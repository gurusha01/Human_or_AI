Paper Summary:  
The authors formalize and prove the long-standing assumption that partition trees with superior quantization rates also exhibit improved nearest neighbor search performance. Building on this insight, they introduce the 'max margin' partition tree and establish a connection between its search performance and the margin. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that partition trees with low quantization errors, including the proposed 'max margin' tree, yield effective nearest neighbor search results.  
Review:  
I appreciate the authors' effort in formalizing the long-standing assumption that partition trees with better quantization rates generally lead to improved nearest neighbor search performance. The formalism and conditions outlined in Theorem 3.1 are intuitive, and the connection to the 'expansion constant' (a formal representation of the intrinsic dimension of the input sample) is well-motivated. However, I believe the bound presented in Eq. 4 could be tightened (see comments below).  
I have a few suggestions for the authors to consider incorporating into the manuscript:  
- While the use of the expansion dimension is intuitive, it necessitates a strong assumption, such as condition C1, to hold over every convex set in the underlying space. I suspect (though I have not verified it) that if the authors instead use the doubling dimension, they might avoid explicitly requiring condition C1, thereby improving the overall readability of the text. It may also be worth noting that bounded doubling dimension implies the result.  
- The authors could consider adding a brief discussion on the implications if the input set \( S \) is drawn from an underlying distribution.  
- The notation '\(\tilde{c}\)' for the expansion constant in Theorem 3.1 seems unnecessary. Consider simplifying it to '\(c\)'.  
- Regarding Eq. 4, I believe the bound could be made tighter. Shouldn't the ratio in lines 531â€“532 always be less than 1? Tightening this ratio could significantly improve Eq. 14.  
Quality:  
The paper systematically investigates the relationship between vector quantization and nearest neighbor search, offering both a robust theoretical foundation and compelling experimental results. However, the bound appears to be looser than expected.  
Clarity:  
The paper is clearly written.  
Originality:  
The work is original.  
Significance:  
This work is highly significant, as it formalizes the long-standing belief that partition trees with superior quantization rates lead to better nearest neighbor search performance. It has the potential to inspire further formal analysis of other fast nearest neighbor search techniques.  
Update after the author response:  
Thank you for the clarifications. Over the past week, I came across a highly relevant paper from COLT 2013 titled "Randomized Partition Trees for Exact Nearest Neighbor Search." The authors should update their discussion to include a comparison with this work. Overall, the authors have done an excellent job formalizing the intuition that partition trees with better quantization rates tend to have superior nearest neighbor search performance. A tighter analysis could further improve the bound. The experimental results on real-world data validate that the theoretical insights hold in practice.
