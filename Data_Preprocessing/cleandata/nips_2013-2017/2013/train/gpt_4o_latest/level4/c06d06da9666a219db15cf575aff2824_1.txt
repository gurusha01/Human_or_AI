The authors reformulate the task of learning chordal Markov networks as a constraint satisfaction problem.
The paper is well-written overall, and the authors demonstrate that their approach can identify the optimal structure for certain problems where this was previously unknown.
However, the proposed method is unlikely to scale to significantly larger examples due to the exponential increase in the number of propositional variables required.
Additionally, it would be beneficial to include a comparison with the literature on learning directed acyclic graphs (e.g., works by Koivisto and Sood), given that chordal Markov networks are clearly a subclass of DAGs.
In summary, this is a well-crafted paper that advances the state of the art in exact structure learning. Some additional discussion comparing the method to prior work on learning Bayesian Networks would further strengthen the contribution.
