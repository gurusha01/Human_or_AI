This study seeks to illuminate the novel neural network algorithm known as dropout by anchoring it in theoretical principles and, through this, offering guidance on selecting relevant parameters to achieve optimal performance.
Quality: The quality of the research is high, though the manuscript itself could benefit from improvements. Specifically, there are several typographical errors and missing symbol definitions. Adding a summary of the findings at the end would also enhance the manuscript's overall readability.
Clarity: While the paper is generally well-written, its clarity is hindered by the aforementioned typos, missing definitions, and the absence of a summary (as noted above). Below is a non-exhaustive list of suggested corrections:
- Introduction, line 7: Possible typo or ambiguity.  
- Equation (1): The symbol \( l \) needs to be defined.  
- Section 3.1: The symbol \( n \) needs to be defined. Is the stochasticity in \( S \) due to dropout? Please clarify. Additionally, explain \( m = 2^n \), which seems to represent the number of different inputs in the network. There is also a typo in Equation (7).  
- Section 5.1: Typo in Equation (25) and an extra full stop immediately following Equation (28).  
- Section 5.2, first line: The definition of the sigmoidal function is missing a \( + \) sign.  
- Figures: The caption formatting is inconsistent across figures.  
- References: Citations in the text begin with reference [6].  
- Summary/Conclusions: A dedicated summary or conclusions section is missing.  
Originality: To the best of my knowledge, the paper is original and provides valuable insights into key questions regarding the configuration of networks that utilize dropout.
Significance: In my opinion, the article is significant. I wonder if parallels could be drawn between the dropout algorithm—applied to connecting weights rather than nodes—and the release probability of biological synapses, which are often unreliable and may effectively implement a "dropout" mechanism. Overall, this is an intriguing study that grounds the dropout algorithm in solid mathematical foundations. However, the manuscript contains several typographical errors, and its readability could be further improved.
