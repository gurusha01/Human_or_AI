A fundamental question in neuroscience pertains to the relationship between network structure and function. A significant challenge in establishing this relationship arises from the multi-layered complexity of neural systems, characterized by nonlinearity, variability, and stochasticity. The current work focuses on networks of spiking neurons that aim to optimally represent time-varying input signals. The performance cost function includes a quadratic error term and a penalty for excessive activity. The authors demonstrate that the natural dynamics of a spiking neuron network can be interpreted as minimizing this cost function, which leads to a so-called balanced state—a state widely considered to be a natural regime for biological neuron dynamics. 
A notable strength of this formulation is its avoidance of linear approximations, which have frequently been employed in prior studies. This approach allows for a more accurate representation of the true dynamics. Within this framework, the authors derive firing rates as solutions to a quadratic optimization problem subject to non-negativity constraints on the rates. This enables them to express the solution in closed form as a piecewise linear function. Furthermore, they link the nature of the input to the resulting tuning curves (monotonic or bell-shaped) and demonstrate that optimal performance can be achieved with heterogeneous tuning curves, a feature that has indeed been observed in biological systems.
Overall, I found this paper to be both engaging and insightful. Together with reference [13], which addresses synaptic plasticity, this work represents an original contribution to understanding the relationship between structure and function in neural systems.
Specific comments:  
1) The form of \( E \) in equation (6) implies that \( W \) must be symmetric, as the anti-symmetric component of \( W \) does not contribute to the quadratic term. However, equation (7) itself does not appear to impose symmetry. Please clarify this point.  
2) Equation (6) suggests that it should have a minimum where \( \frac{dE}{d\nu} = 0 \), resulting in \( \dot{V} = 0 \). However, why does this necessarily imply \( Vi = 0 \) (balanced state) rather than \( Vi = \text{constant} \)?  
3) Typo: Line 330, where \( \beta I \)—something appears to be missing.  
This is a compelling paper that motivates the balanced state in spiking neural networks as a solution to an optimal representation problem. It is an original and thought-provoking contribution.
