The paper begins by noting the similarity between rooted directed acyclic graphs (RDAGs) and binary decision trees. By fixing the number of child nodes in an RDAG, the authors demonstrate through a series of experiments that these RDAGs (and their ensembles) perform favorably compared to several baseline methods. Since this represents a distinct form of regularization compared to what is typically employed in randomized trees, it constitutes a valuable empirical observation. In my opinion, the primary contribution of the paper lies in the experimental evidence, which suggests that RDAGs could have practical utility. While there is always room to expand experimentation, the authors have done a commendable job of addressing various aspects in their study.
In Section 2, the authors argue that binary decision trees and rooted binary decision DAGs exhibit significant similarity, which forms the basis for the remainder of the paper. However, the abstract, title, and introduction imply a broader generalization of this similarity, which I find misleading and, to some extent, frustrating. The authors should temper their claims in the early sections of the paper, as these are not substantiated by the rest of the work.
A minor point: while the abbreviation DAG is widely recognized, its meaning should still be defined upon its first appearance in the text, which in this case is the abstract. The paper explores RDAGs (rooted directed acyclic graphs) and their ensembles, demonstrating through experiments that fixing the number of child nodes yields competitive results compared to other randomized tree classifiers.
