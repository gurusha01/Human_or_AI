The paper applies PMCMC sampling within an SSM framework with a GP process prior, extending its use to actual parameters rather than being limited to standard filtering and smoothing tasks. This represents a straightforward application of the PMCMC methodology. However, it is unfortunate that the challenges involved in implementing the PMCMC scheme are not thoroughly described or critically evaluated, as addressing these challenges would have constituted a significant contribution. A more comprehensive and critical assessment of the approach's strengths and weaknesses would have added substantial value to the paper, given its focus on applying PMCMC methodology. While it may be unreasonable to expect a complete revision of the experimental section, providing more in-depth evaluation rather than a mere demonstration would have been beneficial. The application of PMCMC to SSMs would have been more impactful if it had included an analysis of the practical difficulties in making such a scheme operational and a clearer assessment of its actual performance.
