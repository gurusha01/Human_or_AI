The authors address the problem of estimating the ratio of two probability density functions. Their proposed approach leverages a kernel and a Fredholm integral equation, framing the task as an inverse problem. From a machine learning perspective, the assumption of densities poses significant challenges, as it is well-known that within any epsilon neighborhood of a probability measure \( P \) with a \(\nu\)-density, there exist probability measures lacking \(\nu\)-densities. Consequently, estimating the ratio of two densities is inherently problematic in the context of machine learning. As far as I can determine, the authors do not specify the dominating measure \(\nu\) being used (e.g., Lebesgue measure, counting measure, or another alternative), and it remains unclear whether their results are rigorous, particularly concerning sets of \(\nu\)-measure zero. Additionally, I find the lack of a clear statement regarding the underlying assumptions to be a limitation. For instance, does \( x \) belong to \( \mathbb{R}^d \) or to a more general topological space? Is the density \( p \) strictly positive for all \( x \)?
