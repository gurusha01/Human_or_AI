This paper introduces the application of determinantal point processes (DPP) for modeling neural population activity. The authors demonstrate that their proposed model can be applied to both simulated and real neural datasets.
However, the paper lacks a clear demonstration of its advantages over existing methods, such as generalized linear models (GLMs). In Section 4, the authors should directly compare the performance of the DPP and GLM on the same datasets and provide evidence that the DPP outperforms the GLM.
The authors claim that a key advantage of DPP over GLM is its ability to capture inhibitory interactions between neurons. However, can't GLMs also model inhibitory interactions through coupling filters? If so, what makes the DPP's approach to capturing inhibitory interactions superior? Providing 1-2 sentences of intuition about how equation (1) achieves this would be valuable. Additionally, while the authors focus on the DPP's ability to model inhibitory interactions, isn't it also capable of capturing excitatory interactions? Clarifying this point would strengthen the paper.
I found Figures 2b, 3, and 4 difficult to interpret. It would be helpful if the authors explicitly described what the reader should observe in these figures. Furthermore, could Figures 3 and 4 be connected to known classifications of neurons as excitatory or inhibitory?
On page 8, the authors state, "The model is able to accurately capture...dichotomy of neurons," but I could not locate where in Section 4 this claim is substantiated.
In Section 3.2, it would be beneficial to explain how the dimensionality of y is determined and how the kernel parameters (if applicable) are learned. While this work shows promise, it currently feels underdeveloped. The advantages of DPP over existing methods for modeling neural population activity need to be more clearly articulated.
