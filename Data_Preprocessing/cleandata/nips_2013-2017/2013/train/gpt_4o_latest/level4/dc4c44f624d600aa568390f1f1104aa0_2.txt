This paper introduces a class of algorithms for rank aggregation, termed GMM algorithms. The central concept of these algorithms is to utilize GMM for rank aggregation and decompose the full rankings in rank aggregation into pairwise comparisons. The authors provide conditions under which the GMM algorithms are unique and consistent. Additionally, both theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms outperform the baseline MM algorithm in terms of runtime while maintaining competitive statistical efficiency.
The paper is exceptionally well written, making its main contributions easy to comprehend. The proposed methods are methodologically sound, and the theoretical and empirical evaluations of the algorithms are compelling. The work is original and constitutes a significant advancement in the field of learning to rank.
Minor concerns:
* Page 4, line 173: The position-k breaking \( GP^k \) is defined only for \( k \geq 2 \). However, on line 200, \( GP^1 \) is presented without clarification.  
* Page 3, line 152: It is unclear whether Definition 1 pertains to the breaking process or the GMM method \( \text{GMM}_G(D) \).  
Overall, this paper is well written, and the proposed work is robust, innovative, and impactful. I recommend accepting this paper.
