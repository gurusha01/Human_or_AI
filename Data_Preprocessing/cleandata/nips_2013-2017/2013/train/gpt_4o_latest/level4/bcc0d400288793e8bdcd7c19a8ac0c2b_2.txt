The paper investigates theoretical aspects of active sensing, specifically scenarios where individuals must actively seek information to accomplish a goal. It introduces an extension to the existing C-DAC model, which gathers information myopically to maximize a task-specific cost function. This approach is contrasted with an alternative model (Infomax), which prioritizes information acquisition without considering task-specific costs. The paper's overarching aim is both compelling and significant. However, the novelty is somewhat diminished, as the work primarily extends Ahmad & Yu (2013) to incorporate myopic action selection. While this extension is reasonable, its importance or novelty is unclear, as it does not appear to play a central role in the interpretation of the experimental results.
There is relevant prior work on this topic. For instance, the authors should consider Markant & Gureckis (2012), "Does the utility of information influence sampling behavior?" which examines a related question: whether individuals optimize for information or a task-specific cost function. Their findings suggest that information optimization better accounts for human behavior.
The paper suffers from significant issues in writing and presentation. The abstract is overly long, the manuscript exceeds the 8-page limit for NIPS, and Ahmad & Yu (2013) is cited excessively, including twice in the abstract. The experimental design is difficult to follow, with terms like "patch" left undefined (e.g., does it refer to a set of trials with specific target probability distributions or possible target locations?). Additionally, while the theoretical motivation is clear, the focus on the "confirmatory search" phenomenon seems ad hoc and inadequately justified. It is unclear why this phenomenon was selected or why it is critical for distinguishing between the models.
The modeling results in Section 3 are not particularly compelling. Both the full C-DAC and the myopic variant capture the qualitative patterns, but the authors do not discuss the implications of this overlap. Does this suggest that the chosen measures fail to differentiate the models effectively? Furthermore, no fit statistics or quantitative evidence is provided to demonstrate the advantage of the myopic model, beyond describing it as "more psychologically plausible." Section 4 is similarly opaque, particularly the policy-space graphs in Figure 3, which are difficult to interpret. Terms like "Greedy MAP" are introduced without explanation, and this model is not mentioned elsewhere in the paper.
The analysis in Figure 4 is also puzzling. If the model is intended to represent human behavior, there is no discussion of human performance for comparison. While it is acceptable to highlight the myopic C-DAC model's performance on various metrics, as a model of human behavior, it should align with human data. If the work is instead intended as an engineering analysis of a computer vision-based visual search algorithm, this distinction should be made explicit.
Note: My initial assessment was more critical, but after discussions with other reviewers, I have assigned a score of 7. While many of the above concerns remain valid, the paper has notable strengths, including its emphasis on multiple model comparisons, the empirical data, and the derivation of theorems related to the optimal stopping rule. The authors' response was constructive, and it would be beneficial if the paper were revised to address reviewer feedback and improve clarity before acceptance.
In summary, the paper adds a myopic modification to the C-DAC model for cost-sensitive active sensing. The model is applied to data from a visual search task, and the myopic variant appears to fit the experimental data reasonably well. However, the full (non-myopic) model performs similarly, raising questions about the added value of the myopic approach. Other aspects of the paper, such as the policy-space graphs, remain difficult to interpret. While the paper presents intriguing ideas, it is not yet fully developed. The contribution beyond the original C-DAC model remains unclear, apart from a vague claim of greater psychological plausibility due to its lack of multi-step optimization.
