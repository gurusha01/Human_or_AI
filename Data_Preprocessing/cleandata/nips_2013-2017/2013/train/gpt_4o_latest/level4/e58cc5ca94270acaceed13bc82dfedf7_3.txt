The paper introduces novel theoretical frameworks leveraging side information to reduce sample complexity and demonstrates their utility in the context of transductive multi-label learning.
In the proof, the authors assume that both A and B are orthonormal matrices (top paragraph on page 4). It would be helpful to clarify how the results would be affected if A and B were not orthogonal. Additionally, since U and V are expressed as linear combinations of the column vectors of A and B, the proof might be simplified accordingly.
The unconstrained optimization problem (3) closely resembles the problem addressed in [1]. Specifically, if we index the set of observations \(\Omega\) from 1 to \(k\) such that \(\Omegak = (ik, jk)\), and define \(Ck = A{ik, .} B{jk, .}^T\), problem (3) transforms into \(\minZ \sumk \|Mk - \text{tr}(Z Ck)\|^2 + \lambda \|Z\|_{\text{tr}}\), which is identical to the problem solved in [1]. Furthermore, [1] provides consistency results and an efficient algorithm. It would be beneficial to compare the proposed algorithm to the one in [1] within the multi-label learning experiment.
In the second paragraph, it is mentioned that recent approaches attempt to address the issue but at the cost of losing performance guarantees. However, this is unclear, as paper [5], cited in the manuscript, provides convergence guarantees. In fact, there are several papers, such as [2], that propose efficient algorithms with convergence guarantees and do not require updating the full matrix.
In the proof of Lemma 1 in the supplementary material, there is a typographical error in line 063: it should read \((1 - \|P_{T^{\perp}}\|)\), where the \(\perp\) symbol is missing.

The authors present new theoretical and empirical findings on the sample complexity of matrix completion. These results should be compared to those of Bach (2008), which analyzed a closely related problem.
