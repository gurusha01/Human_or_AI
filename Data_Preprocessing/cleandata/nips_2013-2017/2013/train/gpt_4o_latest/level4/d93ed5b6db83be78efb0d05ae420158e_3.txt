Review - Summary:  
The authors utilize Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs) to model the spiking activity of simultaneously recorded neurons. Their approach accounts for both stimulus dependence and pairwise competitive interactions among neurons. The proposed model is evaluated using both synthetic data and hippocampal recordings.
Comments:  
1) To the best of my knowledge, the application of DPPs to neural recordings is novel. Addressing the challenge of incorporating instantaneous interactions into GLMs for neurons (even coupled ones) while maintaining model tractability is a significant and unresolved issue. Therefore, I find this work timely and relevant for the NIPS neuroscience community.
2) The manuscript is well-written, and the introduction to DPPs is accessible, making the paper easy to follow (with some exceptions noted below).
3) My primary concern is that the authors have not sufficiently demonstrated that their model is well-suited for multi-cell recordings. Experimentally observed noise correlations are predominantly positive (at least in cortical regions), which would not be captured by the DPP framework. If this understanding is incorrect, the authors should clarify and provide supporting references. Additionally, the authors need to better justify and cite evidence for the importance of scenarios where competitive interactions dominate in multi-cell recordings.
4) Section 4.3, application to hippocampal data: This section does not convincingly establish the suitability of the DPP-based model for the data. Are the noise correlations (calculated from the data) between excitatory pairs, inhibitory pairs, and excitatory-inhibitory pairs predominantly negative? This distinction is critical, as GLMs can already capture stimulus-induced correlations. The authors should elaborate on the main result figures (FIG4 and FIG3(a)) to explain why the latent embedding is meaningful and what insights the kernel matrix provides about the data. To make room for this discussion, the experiments on synthetic data could be scaled back. Furthermore, the observation that the method detects theta oscillations is unsurprising (as this is a feature of the GLM component) and could be summarized more briefly. Regarding Table 1, the authors could strengthen their argument by including more comparisons between models of the form "GLMcomponent1+...+GLMcomponentn" and "GLMcomponent1+...+GLMcomponentn+Latent." This would allow for a clearer assessment of whether the DPP component adds value.
5) Section 3.3: The stimulus dependence of each neuron is already captured by the weight vector $wn$. Does the introduction of $w\nu$ create redundancy in the model?
6) The manuscript lacks a more detailed comparison between coupled GLMs and the DPP approach. For example, while coupled GLMs do not include instantaneous coupling, this limitation could potentially be addressed by using finer time binning. A discussion of such trade-offs would be valuable.
Minor Comments:  
1) The notation around equations (4) and (5) is either unclear or imprecise. For instance, $\Pi^{(t)}$ should likely be defined as $diag(\sqrt{\lambda1^{(t)}}, \ldots)$ rather than as stated in line 157. Additionally, in equation (5), $K^{(t)}{St}$ seems to include only the term $k\theta$ and not the GLM component $\lambdan^{(t)}$, unlike equation (4). If this interpretation is correct, $K^{(t)}{St}$ should be written as $K{St}$ since the time dependence would arise solely from ${St}$. Furthermore, the normalizer in equation (5) should be independent of $St$ and instead involve $K{\mathcal S}$ rather than $K{St}$ (a similar adjustment applies to $\Pi{St}$).
2) In the definition of $K_S$ in line 131, it would be helpful to reiterate that $n, n' \in S$.  
Overall, this is an interesting and timely paper that would benefit from stronger biological motivation for the proposed model and more detailed experimental analyses.
