The authors propose a scalable approximate inference algorithm tailored for the "triangle model" of networks. They introduce an innovative subclass of the model that cleverly shares parameters, and they employ stochastic variational inference to estimate the posterior distribution in the context of very large networks. The paper is well-written and well-executed. I find it to be acceptable.
p1: What exactly does "parsimonious" modeling mean? This term does not seem to be a standard expression in the context of probabilistic models (though I could be mistaken). Since it plays a key role in the paper, I recommend elaborating on it in a sentence for clarity.
p1: Based on my understanding of Gopalan et al., down-sampling the zeros does not compromise accuracy. The corresponding sentence in the introduction appears misleading.
p4: While I appreciate the triangle model as a pragmatic approach, I do not think the comparison to LDA is appropriate. In the generative process of LDA, the output "is" a document, albeit a nonsensical one, even if it is not the original. In contrast, running your model can yield outputs that are not networks. This distinction does not detract from the model's utility or practicality, but the defense via LDA is not convincing.
p5: Hoffman et al. should be cited alongside Amari and Sato. In your setting, which involves "local variables" (as per Hoffman's terminology), Sato's algorithm is not applicable. The necessary theoretical foundation is provided in Hoffman.
p6: The method for generating power-law networks in the latent space is unclear. The paper lacks sufficient detail on this point.
p6: You previously cite Gopalan et al. as a method for accelerating MMSB. It would be appropriate to compare your approach to their algorithm, either in addition to or instead of MMSB batch.
Small comments:
p2: Replace "mixture-membership" with "mixed-membership."
p8: Consider removing the final sentence. The second-to-last sentence provides a stronger conclusion to the paper.
