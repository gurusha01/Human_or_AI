This paper introduces an approximate message passing algorithm for matrix factorization. The authors first demonstrate that the matrix factorization problem can be viewed as a generalization of the clustering problem. Subsequently, the message passing algorithm developed for matrix factorization is tailored specifically to clustering. Finally, experimental comparisons are performed between the proposed algorithm and the k-means++ algorithm.
Quality: The mathematical derivations presented in this paper are incomplete and omit several non-trivial steps, even in the appendix.
1) In line 139 of the appendix, why is the second term of equation (11) stated to be \(O(1/\sqrt{m})\)? The parameter \(\beta\) appears to be missing in Section 2.  
2) Some parts of the analysis, such as the derivation of equation (19), seem to rely on the assumption that \(m\) and \(n\) grow at the same rate. Overall, the asymptotic analysis provided in this section is rather terse, raising concerns about its mathematical rigor.  
3) In line 167, why is \(m \tauw^2\) claimed to be the expectation of \(A{il}^2\)? Since \(A\) represents observed data and \(m \tau_w^2\) corresponds only to the variance of the likelihood, the justification for this approximation needs to be explicitly verified.  
4) How does the message passing algorithm derived for finite \(\beta\) converge to the MAP problem? The message passing algorithm minimizes the KL divergence, but the equality \(\lim{\beta \to \infty} \min \text{KL} = \min \lim{\beta \to \infty} \text{KL}\) does not necessarily hold.  
5) The proof of Proposition 1 is overly concise. How is equation (17) derived?  
Clarity: The paper is well-organized, and the main contributions are clearly presented, making the key ideas relatively easy to follow.
Originality: Since the authors primarily focus on estimating the first and second moments of the marginal posterior, the proposed algorithm appears to be an application of Expectation-Propagation (EP) to the matrix factorization problem. EP has already been applied to matrix factorization in the following work: [Stern et al., 2009](http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/79460/www09.pdf). Section 1 of the appendix seems to describe standard EP update procedures. Please clarify if this interpretation is incorrect.  
Additionally, there seems to be a potential connection between the clustering algorithm proposed in this paper and the clutter problem discussed in the original EP paper: [Minka, 2001](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/minka/papers/ep/minka-ep-uai.pdf). Specifically, if the likelihood in the clutter problem is replaced with a uniform mixture of Gaussian distributions, the two problems may share similarities. To clarify, this observation is intended as a suggestion for further exploration rather than a critique of the paper's originality.
Significance: While the authors emphasize the algorithm's application to clustering, the comparison to only the k-means++ algorithm may be insufficient given the extensive literature on clustering. To establish the practical utility of the proposed method, broader comparisons with other state-of-the-art clustering algorithms would be beneficial. Furthermore, the proofs provided in the paper, including those in the appendix, are incomplete, making it difficult to assess their technical correctness. Lastly, as noted earlier, the algorithm appears to be a straightforward application of Expectation-Propagation to the matrix factorization problem, which has already been explored in prior work by Stern et al. [2009](http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/79460/www09.pdf).
