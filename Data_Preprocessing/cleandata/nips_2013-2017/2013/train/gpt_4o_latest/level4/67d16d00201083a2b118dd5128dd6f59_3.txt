The manuscript addresses the challenge of fitting conditional copula models. It extends beyond the conventional use of constant copula functions by aiming to capture scenarios where the copula parameters vary as functions of other (potentially time-dependent) aspects of the problem.
The primary approach involves representing the parameter space using Gaussian Processes. Beginning with a Gaussian Process prior, the method incorporates information from observed data through Expectation Propagation to perform approximate inference of the posterior distribution.
The paper is exceptionally well-written and straightforward to comprehend. The problem is clearly motivated, and the illustrations, particularly those involving HMM-based and multivariate time series copulas, are articulated with great clarity. The experiments are also adequate and well-executed. In summary, this is a strong paper that introduces a novel problem, proposes a sound solution, and supports it with excellent experimental demonstrations.
