The paper explores a method for efficiently merging multiple rankings into a Plackett-Luce model. The central concept involves the use of "breakings," which represent subsets of the complete ranking data. The authors demonstrate that consistency is a crucial property, which, for instance, is satisfied by top-k rankings (1,2 > 3,4,5), but not by adjacency rankings (1 > 2, 2 > 3, 3 > 4, 4 > 5).
The paper is adequate. While the presentation of the method occasionally feels excessively formal, the examples provided help clarify the main ideas effectively.
I did not fully grasp why the approach is referred to as the "Generalized Method of Moments." What exactly is the method of moments, and in what way has it been generalized here? Initially, I assumed that the MM in the experimental comparisons referred to the non-generalized method of moments, but it actually stands for "Minorize Maximization."
The authors also presume that the reader is already familiar with the MM method, which I am not. This makes it challenging to fully appreciate the contribution. While the authors assert that MM is a standard approach for rank aggregation, I believe they should have also evaluated other methods for comparison.
Additionally, why are the top-k and bottom-k breakings not symmetric in their structure? What is the motivation for using the bottom-k breaking?
Overall, the paper seems reasonable, but I do not believe this contribution will have a significant impact. Furthermore, the experimental results (improvements over MM on synthetic datasets and the Sushi dataset) are not sufficiently compelling to support the claims.
