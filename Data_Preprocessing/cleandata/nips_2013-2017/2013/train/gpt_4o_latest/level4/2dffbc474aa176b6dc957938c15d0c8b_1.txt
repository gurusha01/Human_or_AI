This paper introduces a Bayesian framework for state and parameter estimation in nonlinear state-space models, incorporating a Gaussian process (GP) prior to learn the transition dynamics. The inference methodology leverages particle Markov chain Monte Carlo (PMCMC) with the recent innovation of ancestor sampling. Additionally, the paper addresses computational optimizations, particularly in relation to sparsity and low-rank Cholesky updates.
The work is technically robust and well-presented, with a clear and accessible exposition. The novel aspect lies in the online marginalization of the transition dynamics achieved through the use of ancestor sampling. The inclusion of computational considerations, such as sparsity and low-rank updates/downdates of Cholesky factors for covariance matrices, further enhances the paper. While the empirical results are concise, they are adequate for the scope of the study (additional suggestions provided below).
Beyond its primary contributions, this paper is likely to spark discussions on inference techniques for non-Markovian state-space models and the trade-offs involved in learning transition dynamics as opposed to specifying a parametric model a priori.
Given the limited space, the authors might consider expanding the discussion on the distinctions between employing a parametric transition model specified a priori and using a similar model as the GP mean function. For instance, this could include implications for out-of-sample predictions, such as forecasting.
The results presented in Table 1 and the accompanying description in the preceding paragraph are somewhat unclear. Specifically, it is not evident whether the RMSE is computed against a withheld dataset or the same dataset used for conditioning (as indicated by the *|data in the column headers). My primary interest lies in the RMSE for out-of-sample predictions, particularly forward forecasts against withheld data. This scenario is where I would anticipate the most significant differences between the learned dynamics and the ground truth model. If Table 1 does not already reflect this, adding an extra column to show such results would be a valuable enhancement.
A minor issue: the abbreviation CPF-AS is introduced in Algorithm 1 before being defined in the first paragraph of Section 3.3.1. Overall, this is a strong and innovative paper that is likely to inspire engaging discussions.
