Review - Reviewer's response to the rebuttal:
"Theorem 1 needs to be corrected/clarified."  
We appreciate the clarification provided in the rebuttal. It appears that part of the theorem was inadvertently omitted in the original submission. The authors now state that the sufficient condition is to have a sufficiently large population of distinct neurons: \( N \geq \summ [(2L1+1)(2L2+1)\dots(2L{nm-1}+1)] \). The necessary condition is that the total number of spikes exceeds \( (2L{nm}+1) \cdot \summ [(2L1+1)(2L2+1)\dots(2L{nm-1}+1)] + N \).  
This explanation is more acceptable, although the condition remains somewhat unclear to me. Specifically, it is not evident what prevents the spikes from being fully synchronized across neurons, which would render them uninformative.  
"…what would happen if all filter kernels were the same? Then no matter how many neurons you added, you would not gain any further information."  
The authors argue that this is not entirely accurate. For instance, if all filters are Dirac-delta functions, the inputs are encoded directly without additional processing. However, they claim that it is still possible to recover all inputs if the neurons differ in parameters such as bias, capacitance, or the threshold of the integrate-and-fire (IAF) neurons. They also suggest that imposing linear independence between kernels could ensure signal recovery.  
While this is true, I must point out that the definition of the IAF-TEM in Equation (3) and subsequent sections does not explicitly indicate that the neurons have distinct parameters. This omission is the basis of my original remark. I recommend that the authors explicitly state this assumption in the manuscript.

Review for "Multisensory Encoding, Decoding, and Identification"
The paper presents an extension of Time Encoding Machines (TEMs) to the multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) framework, leveraging the formalism of Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS). The work is motivated by a neuroscientific perspective, with the introduction correctly noting that multisensory integration and processing offer significant advantages to organisms but remain poorly understood. The paper proposes a specific extension of TEMs to the MIMO setting, using trigonometric polynomials as basis functions. Necessary conditions for perfect decoding and system identification are provided. The feasibility of the proposed algorithms is demonstrated through an audio/video decoding task and an audio/video encoder identification task. The paper concludes with the claim that this work constitutes the first tractable computational model for multisensory integration (which is incorrect) and suggests that extending the approach to the noisy case would be straightforward.  
Clarity:  
The paper is generally well-written, though the notation in Section 3 is somewhat cumbersome. However, this complexity seems unavoidable.  
Originality:  
The most novel contribution of the paper is the extension of TEMs to the MIMO setting. However, the connection to neuroscience is tenuous.  
Quality:  
Certain aspects of the paper require further clarification and improvement before publication.  
Significance:  
From a technical standpoint, the paper demonstrates the feasibility of TEMs for multimodal encoding, which could have practical applications. However, the contribution to neural coding is limited to the motivational context provided in the introduction.

Detailed Comments:  
- Line 100: "bandlmited" → "bandlimited"  
- Line 137: Specify that \( j \) is the complex unit.  
- Line 144: Clarify whether the \( un \) in Equation (1) are distinct from the \( un^i \) in Figure 1. If so, consider using a different notation.  
- Line 166: Define "BIBO-stable" (bounded-input-bounded-output).  
- Line 166: For the video filters in Example 2, does "finite temporal support of length \( Si \leq Ti \)" refer to spatio-temporal support?  
- Line 177: Indicate that the \( h{l1 \ldots l_n} \) are the filter coefficients to connect this formula to Theorem 1.  
- Line 182: Specify that "IAF" stands for "integrate-and-fire."  
- Line 185: In Equation (3), clarify the meaning of the index \( k \). If it refers to the spike index, explicitly state that \( t_k \) represents spike times, which are strictly monotonically increasing with \( k \). A brief introduction to IAF-TEMs would be helpful, as the paper transitions from continuous signals to spikes without sufficient explanation.  
- Lines 195–196: The statement "Then there exists a number \( N \) ... can be perfectly recovered" appears to describe a sufficient condition. However, the proof of Theorem 1 (starting at Line 224) discusses a necessary condition. This discrepancy suggests that Theorem 1 remains unproven. Additionally, if all filter kernels were identical, adding more neurons would not improve signal recovery. To address this, the kernels likely need to satisfy a linear independence condition, as in [15].  
- Figures 1, 2, 4: The \( v_i \) variables do not appear elsewhere in the paper. Clarify their purpose.  
- Section 5 (Examples): The examples are informative, but using real audio-video datasets would strengthen the connection to neuroscience and demonstrate the practical relevance of the approach.  
- Line 417: The claim that this is "the first tractable computational model for multisensory integration" is incorrect. See, for example, the works by Wei & Körding or Ernst & Banks. Please remove this statement.

The extension of TEMs to the MIMO setting is potentially interesting for technical applications and decoding in neuroscience. However, Theorem 1 requires further clarification, and I remain uncertain about its validity in its current form.
