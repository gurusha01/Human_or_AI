The objective of developing multivariate distributions suitable for count data is a significant one, and the authors appropriately highlight the shortcomings of existing methods (though one reservation regarding this is noted below).
From a theoretical and conceptual perspective, the paper has several strengths. The authors begin by proving that a previously proposed truncation does not yield a valid model and proceed to propose several alternatives. While the TPGM truncation is straightforward, it is justified due to its intuitive interpretation. The QPGM and SPGM approaches, though technically simple, are innovative in that they leverage the base measure and sufficient statistics of the exponential family representation to modify the Poisson distribution. Moreover, the proposed modifications are well-motivated and conceptually appealing. However, the underlying theory largely builds on the work of Yang et al., leaving us with a set of potential model suggestions whose practical utility remains to be demonstrated.
Given this context, the experimental evaluation is underwhelming, especially since the stated aim of the paper is to address the practical limitations of Poisson graphical models. While the synthetic experiments show some promise, the data appears tailored to favor the proposed models. In the real-world experiments, the absence of comparisons with copula-based alternatives is particularly conspicuous. Additionally, the reported results are largely qualitative and anecdotal. Since all methods involve constructing joint distributions, a more rigorous evaluation using metrics such as log-probability on test data is necessary.
A more critical issue, which strikes at the core question of whether the proposed models are needed, is the overly black-box treatment of copula-based competitors. For instance, even when employing a Gaussian copula, it would be more appropriate to use a reasonable marginal model rather than the one used in the non-paranormal approach (which lacks a density and was primarily chosen for its asymptotic properties rather than practical advantages). The nearly identical performance to Glasso is questionable, and I strongly suspect that even basic Gaussian kernel density estimates would perform better. Similarly, in the real-data experiments, the sensible choice of using \( R = 11 \) could also inform the selection of the copula's marginal distribution. While I do not expect an exhaustive exploration, the inclusion of a reasonable baseline is necessary.
Lastly, the paper is generally well-written. While I am confident in the correctness of the results—particularly since the authors begin by identifying an error in prior work—I recommend including all proofs in the supplementary material. Additionally, I found the end of Section 3.1 to be overly detailed, with the bound adding little to the Gaussian-like argument. Conversely, Section 3.2, which forms the core of the proposed method, could benefit from a slower and more detailed exposition. Specifically, the figure currently relegated to the supplementary material should be included in the main text and its intuition better explained.
In summary, the authors propose alternatives to the Poisson graphical model based on a conditional exponential construction, aiming to enable flexible joint modeling with both positive and negative dependencies. On the positive side, the proposed approach is conceptually appealing and offers some theoretical novelty. On the negative side, the experimental evaluation is limited and somewhat biased, leaving the overall value of yet another multivariate Poisson-like model unclear.
