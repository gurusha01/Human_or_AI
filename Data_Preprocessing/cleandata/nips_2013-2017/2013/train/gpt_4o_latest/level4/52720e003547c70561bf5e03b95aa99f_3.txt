Summary of the Paper
This study addresses the challenge of solving covariance selection problems in extremely large-scale settings, involving up to millions of features and trillions of parameters. The authors focus on the CLIME estimator, which is recognized for its ability to estimate the precision matrix of a Gaussian vector by solving the problem column by column, making it more suitable for distributed computations. Additionally, the theoretical analysis of CLIME is noted to be simpler compared to the Graphical-Lasso. The paper introduces a novel algorithm that fits the CLIME estimator by solving the problem block-wise instead of column-wise, combined with an inexact direction method of multipliers. The authors provide theoretical guarantees for the convergence rate of this algorithm, addressing both the objective function and the distance to optimality. To reduce computational complexity, special attention is given to specific matrix structures, such as sparsity and low rank, during the computation process. The algorithm is implemented within a scalable parallel computation framework, supporting both shared and distributed memory systems. Numerical experiments compare the runtime of the proposed method against its direct competitors using synthetic and real datasets. Additionally, a detailed analysis is conducted to evaluate the speedup achieved with varying block sizes and the number of cores in both shared and distributed memory environments.
Comments
The paper is well-written and highly comprehensible. The novelty and contributions of the proposed method are clearly articulated in the introduction, with strong connections to existing work supported by well-chosen bibliographical references. The algorithm is presented effectively, striking a good balance between technical aspects of numerical analysis/algebra and theoretical convergence guarantees. The numerical experiments are thorough, and the implementation demonstrates impressive performance results.
However, my primary concern lies in the accessibility of the method. If the source code (which largely relies on open-source libraries) is not made available to the community, the practical impact of this work would be significantly diminished. Overall, this is a robust algorithmic contribution that addresses the critical practical problem of covariance selection in high-dimensional settings (millions of variables). Such a powerful tool deserves publication, provided it is made accessible to the broader community.
