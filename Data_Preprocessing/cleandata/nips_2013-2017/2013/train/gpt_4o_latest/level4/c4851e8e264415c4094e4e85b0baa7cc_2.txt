This paper addresses the automatic classification of unstructured social group activity videos. To bridge the semantic gap between low-level features and class labels, the authors employ a latent topic model based on replicated softmax to extract topics as mid-level representations for video classification. The core contribution of the paper lies in integrating sparse Bayesian learning with replicated softmax, resulting in the proposed model termed the "relevance topic model (RTM)." In RTM, the discriminative topics and sparse classifier weights are jointly learned, with the authors proposing a variational EM algorithm for parameter estimation and inference. The algorithm is evaluated on a benchmark dataset, where it demonstrates improved performance compared to other supervised topic models and several baseline methods.
The paper is well-structured, with a clear motivation and ideas that are relevant to the field (e.g., video scene analysis, classification, and recognition). It also adequately references prior research in the area.
However, the significance of incorporating sparsity into the BOW representation, classifier, and hierarchical prior on the weights is not entirely clear. Additionally, the differences between the attributes used in prior research [4] and the topics identified by the proposed RTM are not well articulated. While the use of the replicated softmax model for extracting latent topics as mid-level representations is not novel [5], the paper's key contribution—the joint learning of latent topics and classifier weights—is both interesting and innovative.
Section 3.3 includes several complex mathematical equations that are challenging to follow.
The experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm performs well. However, the experimental validation has certain limitations: 1) The generalization performance is suboptimal. For instance, when many instances are used (e.g., 100 in Table 2), the algorithm does not achieve satisfactory results. 2) In Section 4.3, the authors compare their algorithm only with the baselines in [4]. Given that the novelty of the proposed algorithm lies in the joint learning of discriminative topics and sparse classifier weights, it would be more convincing to compare it against other baselines where topics are extracted using the replicated softmax model but classifier weights are learned separately (e.g., latent topic extraction using replicated softmax [5] combined with an SVM classifier).
The joint learning of latent topics and classifier weights, as proposed in this paper, is an interesting idea with potential applications in related fields such as video context classification and recognition. To better highlight the strengths of this key contribution, it is recommended to include additional baseline comparisons in the experimental section.
