This paper explores the automatic determination of step size in policy gradient methods, with a particular emphasis on the Gaussian policy setting. The authors derive a lower bound on the performance difference resulting from a gradient step and optimize this bound with respect to the step size.
Overall, I appreciate the effort to rigorously analyze the relationship between step size and policy performance. While the paper could benefit from presenting clearer and more direct results, it represents a solid, though incremental, contribution to NIPS.
Quality. The paper includes substantial theoretical work, but at times it lacks focus. For instance, Theorem 3.3 appears tangential to the main contribution. A more cohesive narrative and less digression would enhance the paper's impact.
The experimental results are underwhelming. While the comparisons are meaningful, they do not convincingly demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach.
Clarity. The paper is occasionally difficult to follow, as some steps are deferred to the supplemental material or omitted entirely. For example, the repeated reliance on stationary points is not accompanied by sufficient formal details.
Originality. The work is original.
Significance. I value the effort to refine policy gradient methods by addressing step size, particularly through a theoretical lens. However, the significance of the results appears to be modest.
Suggestion. The algorithmic component of the paper (Section 5) is introduced late and feels secondary. Emphasizing the algorithm earlier and deriving the necessary quantities for the bound in a structured manner could significantly improve the paper. Overall, I appreciate the effort to rigorously analyze the relationship between step size and policy performance. While the paper could benefit from presenting clearer and more direct results, it represents a solid, though incremental, contribution to NIPS.
