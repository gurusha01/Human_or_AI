This paper investigates Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) in zero-sum extensive-form games with perfect information and simultaneous moves. It establishes that the MCTS algorithm converges to an approximate Nash equilibrium under specific conditions. The empirical analysis supports the theoretical findings.
The detailed comments are as follows:  
1. Overall, this is a solid paper that provides a sufficient condition for the convergence of MCTS algorithms. The results are valuable, and the presentation is clear. However, since the primary contribution of the paper lies in its theoretical analysis, I have concerns regarding the novelty of the proof techniques employed.  
2. While UCB algorithms are widely utilized in the literature, they are not addressed in this paper. Considering that there has been prior analysis of UCB for Trees, it would strengthen the paper if the authors included a discussion of UCB algorithms and compared them with the other algorithms analyzed.  
3. The paper only proves that the propagation of the mean demonstrates good convergence. However, the experimental results suggest that the propagation of the current sample value also performs well under various criteria. Could the authors provide an explanation for this observation?  
In summary, this paper examines Monte Carlo tree search in zero-sum extensive-form games with perfect information and simultaneous moves. While the findings are interesting, the paper is not particularly exceptional from a technical standpoint.
