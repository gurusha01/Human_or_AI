The paper introduces several novel models for representing joint distributions over integer-count variables. The authors critique the "default" model proposed by Yang et al., arguing that it is inadequate because it can only capture negative correlations to ensure the distribution remains normalized. To address this limitation, they propose a series of improvements, including a new truncation method, the use of a quadratic base measure statistic (which they prove to be necessary under fixed conditions), and finally, a sub-linear sufficient statistic. The paper also includes experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets.
This is a well-written paper that offers elegant solutions for modeling count data. The work appears to be original, and the results are meaningful and significant.
However, I found the arguments against the truncation and quadratic models to be somewhat unpersuasive. Regarding the truncation method, I can envision many practical scenarios where counts do not typically grow too large, making the model effective in such cases. As for the quadratic model, could there not be situations where "Gaussian-like thin tails" are actually suitable?
I am unfamiliar with the term "sparsistent," though I note that it has been used in prior literature.
Minor comments:  
- Page 3, above Section 2.1.1: Replace "graphical mode distributions" with "model."  
- Page 5, above Section 3.1: In the phrase "Note that the log...," do you mean "Note that although the log..."?  
Overall, this is a high-quality paper on modeling joint distributions over count variables.
