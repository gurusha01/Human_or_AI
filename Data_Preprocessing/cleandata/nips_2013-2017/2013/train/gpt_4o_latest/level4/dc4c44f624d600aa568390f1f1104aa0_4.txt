This paper introduces a generalized method of moments framework for rank aggregation by estimating the parameters of a Plackett-Luce (PL) model from a given set of rankings. The proposed approach involves decomposing rankings into pairwise comparisons, which are subsequently used to construct a transition matrix. The stationary distribution of this matrix is then employed to parameterize the PL model. The authors provide consistency results for various strategies of "breaking" rankings into pairwise comparisons and validate the method's efficiency experimentally using two datasets.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the proposed method appears to be theoretically sound. The "breaking" strategy is both intuitive and conceptually appealing.
However, I have two primary concerns regarding the paper: the practical applicability of the method and the comprehensiveness of the experimental evaluation.
The analysis and experiments predominantly focus on the small-m/large-n scenario, where a large number of rankings are provided for a small set of items. While consistency is an important theoretical property, I am not convinced it is the most critical aspect for rank aggregation in practice. Many of the practical applications highlighted in the introduction (e.g., meta-search) involve large-m/small-n settings, where relatively few rankings are available for a large number of items. Although the authors address the computational complexity of inference, they do not provide any discussion or empirical evaluation of accuracy in this regime, leaving the performance of the proposed method in such settings unclear.
The experiments on synthetic and real-world data do demonstrate qualitative differences between breaking strategies in terms of both speed and accuracy (measured via RMSE and Kendall correlation). However, these metrics may not be ideal for evaluating top-k breaking strategies (Figure 4), as errors lower in the ranking could disproportionately affect the scores without practical significance. Incorporating at least one position-sensitive metric would provide a more meaningful evaluation in this context.
Minor Comments:
- Line 83: The parameter \(\gamma^*\) does not appear in the definition of \(Pr_{PL}\). Should this instead be \(\gamma\)?  
- Line 95: Should the norm \(\|a\|_W\) be squared here? Is \(W\) assumed to be positive definite (making this a proper norm), or is it introduced purely for convenience? Additionally, is the \(W\) notation necessary, given that the remainder of the paper sets \(W = I\)?  
- Line 102: The function \(GMM_g(D, W)\) is set-valued and should converge to the set \(\{\gamma^\}\), not the point \(\gamma^\).  
- Line 124: The title of Section 3 misspells "Plackett."  
- Line 245, Eq. 2: Should both the numerator and denominator involve \(Pos(c, d)\), or should the denominator refer to \(Pos(c)\)?  
- Line 377: There is a broken reference in footnote 4.
In summary, this paper presents a generalized method of moments approach for estimating the parameter vector of a Plackett-Luce ranking model. While the paper is well-written and the analysis is compelling, the practical applicability of the method remains uncertain, and the experimental evaluation could benefit from greater depth.
