This paper demonstrates that it is possible to infer the network properties of a large system by sequentially recording from smaller subnetworks and subsequently combining the resulting sub-models. When extended to point-process data, this approach could be broadly applicable to datasets where typically only a few channels are shifted or adjusted each day. To my knowledge, there is no directly comparable work in the literature (the closest being J. W. Pillow and P. Latham's "Neural characterization in partially observed populations of spiking neurons"), and this appears to be a compelling and innovative concept.
However, in practice, it is unclear how much this method is constrained by the assumption of data being approximately linear-Gaussian. The paper does not provide sufficient intuition regarding how deviations from this assumption might affect the fitting process or lead to potential breakdowns. In the extreme scenario where the full model can be inferred from a single subset (up to a linear transformation of the latent dimensions, as noted by the authors), it is unclear how much additional information about the coupling matrix is gained by incorporating other subsets, as opposed to simply collecting more data from one subset.
Another aspect that warrants clarification is why the model applied to real data only works when there is some overlap between the two populations. This observation suggests that the linear-Gaussian simulations do not fully capture the complexities of the real data. It would be helpful to provide some intuition about how the overlap constrains the model and contributes to its performance.
In the experiments involving real data, where the linearity assumption likely does not hold, one must question how much of the explained noise correlations (which are well-fit, whereas the couplings themselves show little correlation with the true couplings in Figure 3b) are attributable to shared input rather than direct pairwise couplings. It seems plausible that the noise correlations could be better captured by latent variables rather than pairwise couplings.
The paper dedicates significant space to the introduction and discussion but provides limited detail on the estimation process. For example, the equation for the M-step at the bottom of page 3 is presented as a key contribution but is neither adequately explained nor derived. While this result may be straightforward for experts in linear dynamical systems (LDS), such an assumption would diminish the novelty of the work. The authors have proposed a strong idea, but it requires clearer exposition to fully convey the importance and implications of the results.
In summary, this is an intriguing idea tested on real data, but certain details remain insufficiently explained.
