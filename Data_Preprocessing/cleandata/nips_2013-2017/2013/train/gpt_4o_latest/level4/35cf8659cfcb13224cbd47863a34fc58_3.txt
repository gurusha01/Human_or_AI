The paper is well-written, with proper spelling, grammar, and accurate citations, demonstrating a level of quality well above average. However, in adherence to the NIPS style, it is recommended to avoid starting sentences with citations. The theoretical exposition is concise in certain sections, such as the consistent use of \(f()\) and \(g()\) throughout the paper.
This work investigates stochastic block models (SBM) and enhances the basic single-table instance of an infinite relational model (IRM) by incorporating the theory of Bayesian Rose trees. This modification allows the Chinese Restaurant Process (CRP) formulation of the IRM to be replaced with the more straightforward Equation (7). The approach to factoring over subtrees is inspired by prior work on learning Bayesian network structures, such as Koivisto and Sood (JMLR 2004, Section 3), where the posterior distribution factorizes elegantly based on the class of constrained structures chosen. This enables efficient implementation of greedy search, computation of marginal likelihoods, handling of sufficient statistics, link prediction, and related tasks.
Evaluation of SBMs is typically performed using "gold standard" datasets where the true partition structure is known. Metrics such as NMI and other clustering-based measures are commonly employed for this purpose, as they allow for direct comparison with the ground truth. In this paper, you report using AUC, which initially required some thought to interpret, as I am more accustomed to NMI evaluations for SBMs. I assume your approach involves removing a subset of links and predicting whether they should be restored. If this is correct, it requires further clarification in the text. Additionally, recent evaluations of SBMs have been conducted on significantly larger datasets than the one used here. While the small-scale evaluation presented in Figure 4 is informative, it would be more compelling if applied to a larger dataset. Moreover, comparisons should not be limited to Bayesian non-parametric methods, as numerous semi-parametric methods, some of which are mentioned in the paper, have been published and warrant consideration.
The primary contribution of this work lies in the proposed agglomerative method, which is effectively summarized in Table 1. The paper extends the basic single-table IRM framework by integrating the theory of Bayesian Rose trees, resulting in clear and well-articulated theoretical insights and algorithms. However, while the concepts and algorithms are straightforward, the experimental evaluation is illustrative rather than comparative, which limits its adequacy.
