This paper introduces an active learning framework for structured prediction tasks, employing an entropy-based criterion to determine which nodes in a partially labeled example should be queried. The approach builds upon the recent work of Schwing et al., which focuses on efficient inference techniques for structured learning models with missing labels.
The authors propose and investigate two variants of their method. The first variant identifies the output node with the highest entropy in unlabeled or partially labeled examples after training on labeled and partially labeled data. The second variant incorporates unlabeled examples into the learning process, eliminating the need for additional inference computations since entropy values for all nodes are calculated during training.
The experimental results are clear and demonstrate promising performance. However, one limitation is that the method is only compared against a baseline that randomly selects nodes for labeling, which is a relatively weak benchmark. It would have been more compelling to include comparisons with alternative strategies, such as expected error reduction. Additionally, it would have been valuable to analyze how the active learning method performs under varying proportions of weakly labeled, unlabeled, and fully labeled data. That said, the paper does a commendable job of addressing computational considerations and analyzing the impact of the epsilon parameter.
One concern that the authors should address is the potential influence of approximation errors in entropy estimation, which relies on convex belief propagation, on the reported results.
In summary, while the paper is well-executed, its novelty is somewhat limited. Uncertainty-based query selection is a standard approach in active learning, and the inference and learning techniques closely follow the work of Schwing et al. Nonetheless, the strong experimental results are encouraging and indicate that this is a promising direction for structured prediction research. This paper offers a relatively straightforward extension of a recent learning and inference method, but its strong results highlight its potential impact.
