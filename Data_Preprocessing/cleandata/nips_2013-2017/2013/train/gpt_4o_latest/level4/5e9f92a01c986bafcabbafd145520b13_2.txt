2-photon calcium imaging has enabled the recording of large neuronal populations, but since only one voxel can be imaged at a time, there remain unavoidable trade-offs between temporal resolution and the size of the population being recorded. This paper introduces the use of compressive sensing techniques (which, as the authors note, have already been applied in various imaging contexts, such as confocal fluorescence imaging) for neural population imaging. This approach aims to make voxel measurements more efficient, potentially allowing for recordings from significantly larger populations of neurons.
The authors develop a straightforward linear model of the measurement process, incorporating a fixed baseline, AR(1) temporal dynamics, and binary spikes. They present both a 'standard' reconstruction algorithm for this model and another algorithm that simultaneously estimates neuron locations. The paper provides theoretical analysis (limited to the 'standard' approach) as well as simulation results for both algorithms.
Detailed comments:  
a) The paper feels somewhat fragmented, alternating between the 'known locations' and 'unknown locations' scenarios. Focusing on the 'known locations' case and using the additional space to elaborate on the details would likely have resulted in a more cohesive and readable paper.  
b) The imaging matrix \( B \) uses weights of ±1—can 'negative imaging' actually be implemented, and if not, what implications does this have for the practical applicability of the proposed method?  
c) Neural activity is sparse but may exhibit temporal synchronization—how would this characteristic influence the effectiveness of the proposed approach?  
Quality: While there are unresolved questions about the method's performance on real-world data, the proposed analysis and methods appear sound (though I am not equipped to fully assess the theoretical rigor). However, the connection between the theoretical analysis and the simulation results feels somewhat tenuous.  
Clarity: The paper is dense, and the theoretical components lack sufficient detail for full comprehension. Focusing on fewer aspects and providing more thorough explanations would have strengthened the paper.  
Originality: While compressive sensing has been applied in other imaging domains, this appears to be the first application to 2-photon calcium imaging.  
Significance: This is a conceptual and somewhat speculative contribution. However, if the proposed method can be successfully applied to real data, it could have a transformative impact on the field.  
This paper introduces a novel algorithmic framework for calcium imaging based on randomized measurements, demonstrating its potential to scale neural population recordings to sizes previously unattainable. While the paper leans toward being 'conceptual' and raises questions about the method's applicability to real data, the idea is highly innovative and holds significant promise, making it a strong candidate for NIPS.
