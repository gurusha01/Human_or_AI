This paper tackles the challenge of identifying the types of agents from their partial preference data, with the goal of leveraging this information to better estimate the underlying preferences for each type. The authors introduce a Generalized RUM (GRUM) to model the behavior of such clustered agents. To estimate the latent variables, including agent types, a reversible jump MCMC technique is employed. The paper also provides a theoretical analysis of the model's identifiability and the unimodality of the likelihood posterior.
Quality
The paper makes three main contributions: the introduction of the GRUM model, a theoretical analysis, and an inference algorithm. The GRUM model extends the RUM framework to account for multiple agents with distinct types, which is novel. While the theoretical guarantees are intriguing, they have limitations that are discussed in the significance section. The inference algorithm, however, is fairly standard, and the numerical results are underwhelming, both on simulated and real-world datasets. The evaluation focuses solely on estimating the number of clusters, whereas the primary challenge lies in clustering agents. A more relevant numerical analysis would involve studying how the number of misclustered agents depends on problem parameters, such as the number of clusters, the degree of variation in the matrix \( W \) across clusters, and the extent of missing data.
Clarity
Certain claims in the paper could benefit from clearer explanations.
- On page 2, the first paragraph of Section 1.1 is ambiguous. It is unclear which aspects of the model eliminate unrealistic substitution patterns and how it avoids scenarios where removing top choices results in the same alternative being selected.
- On page 2, the numerical results do not convincingly support the claim that "the clustering of types provides a better fit to real-world data."
- On page 5, the definition of "nice" PDFs is unclear due to the lack of a proper definition for \( \phi^{(n)}(x) \), making the conditions difficult to interpret. For example, if \( \phi \) is a PDF, \( gn \) should be non-negative, yet \( gn(x1)/gn(x_2) \) converges to -1.
- The definition of "nice" CDFs is unintuitive, and the paper does not explain why the model might fail to be identifiable if the noise CDF is not "nice."
- On page 7, the claim that "GRUM with 3 types has significantly better performance than..." is not well-supported by the table. The observed improvement of 2–3% in the log posterior appears marginal. How significant is this improvement?
Originality
This work extends the RUM model to a setting with multiple alternatives and agents, modeling correlations between agents through their types. While the GRUM model is novel, the use of the RJ-MCMC approach is fairly standard.
Significance
The theoretical guarantees provided are interesting but have limited applicability. For instance, Theorem 1 establishes unimodality only when the types are known, as the paper explicitly states. This restriction impacts the convergence of the MCMC approach, and the paper does not clarify how long the MCMC should be run in practice. Additionally, the paper does not adequately explain why this problem is challenging or why it has not been addressed previously, as the authors claim. The lack of comparisons—either in theoretical results or numerical experiments—makes it difficult to assess the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. A comparison to fundamental limits or alternative approaches, either theoretically or through simulations, is notably absent.
