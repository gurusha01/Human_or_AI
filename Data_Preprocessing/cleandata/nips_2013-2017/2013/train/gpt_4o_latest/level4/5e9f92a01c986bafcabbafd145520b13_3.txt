I reviewed the rebuttal and removed point 3 from my critique as it has been adequately addressed. While I remain somewhat dissatisfied with the responses to points 1 and 2, I have increased the score to 8.
The authors present a framework for two-photon imaging leveraging compressed sensing. In the first section of the paper, they use simulations to demonstrate the feasibility of reconstructing calcium traces, non-negative firing rates (which closely approximate spike times in high-SNR conditions), and spatial intensity profiles of neurons based on random projections of the data. In the latter part, they show that in a noiseless scenario, the reconstruction quality undergoes a phase transition. They derive an approximation for the phase transition curve, which proves to be reasonably accurate under specific conditions.
I am generally positive about the proposed approach, as it has significant potential to enhance the efficiency of two-photon imaging experiments, which are typically constrained by the trade-off between data quality and the number of neurons that can be imaged. Although I cannot independently verify the mathematical derivations, particularly in section 3, the successful validation through simulations lends credibility to the results.
However, aside from the stylistic critique that the paper is written in a highly technical manner with extensive jargon, my primary concern is that the authors have not convincingly demonstrated the practical feasibility or utility of the approach. My concerns are centered around the following two issues:
1. The method's sensitivity to noise (Fig. 1) necessitates testing under realistic noise conditions. In practice, calcium imaging is subject to high noise levels, particularly due to shot noise, which becomes more pronounced when imaging at the faster rates proposed by the authors. While I cannot definitively state the typical SNR (as defined in line 189) for real experiments, I suspect it is closer to 0 dB than the 20 dB used in Fig. 1, and it may even fall below 0 dB. This is a critical issue, and the authors need to provide compelling evidence that the SNRs they assume are representative of real-world scenarios.
2. Regarding the estimation of neuron locations, the simulations appear to lack background (neuropil) activity between neurons, and the neurons occupy a significant portion of the imaged space. In practice, the situation is vastly different. In a 3D volume, cell bodies constitute at most 10% (likely less) of the voxels, with the remainder being neuropil (axons and dendrites) that also exhibit calcium activity, albeit typically with faster dynamics and higher correlation. While I suspect that a few large singular values could be excluded based on their spatial profiles, I cannot assess whether the P-NN algorithm is significantly impacted by this. Furthermore, the use of SVD to identify neurons assumes uncorrelated firing, which is unlikely in most experimental settings. Since one of the primary goals of imaging many neurons simultaneously is to study their joint activity, this assumption could be a major limitation and warrants discussion.
The above concerns would be less critical if the paper's primary aim were to establish the theoretical framework. However, the authors should then be more explicit about the practical challenges that may arise. As it stands, the manuscript gives the impression that the method is ready for implementation in an actual imaging setup, whereas significant hurdles remain. Overall, this is a potentially impactful approach to calcium imaging based on compressed sensing, but its practical feasibility remains uncertain and could be more thoroughly addressed.
