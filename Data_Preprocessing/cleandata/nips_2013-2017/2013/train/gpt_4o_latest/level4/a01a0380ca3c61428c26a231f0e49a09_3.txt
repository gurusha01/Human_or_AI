The authors investigate space-partitioning trees in the context of nearest-neighbor (NN) search. Specifically, they analyze the error introduced by depth-first search (DFS) without backtracking and establish a connection between this search error and the quantization error of the tree.
While the authors' work is intriguing, it has certain limitations. The connection between search error and quantization error is demonstrated by bounding the search error with a relatively complex bound that incorporates parameters derived from the quantization error. However, this connection holds only if the bound is tight, which does not appear to be the case:
For instance, consider the expansion coefficient \( c \) in Theorem 3.1. This coefficient depends on \( q \). If \( q \) is chosen to be sufficiently far from \( S \)—such that \( \min_{x \in S} |x - p| \) exceeds the distance between any two points in \( S \)—the expansion coefficient becomes \( n \). This, in turn, forces \( L \) in condition C2 to be zero, rendering Theorem 3.1 inapplicable in such scenarios. The issue here is that Theorem 3.1 only analyzes the "upstairs" term of the distance error. A more robust result could potentially be achieved by simultaneously considering the "downstairs" term as well.
Additionally, the dependence of \( c \) on \( q \) implies that Theorem 3.1 cannot be practically employed to compute actual error bounds during real-world searches, as determining the expansion coefficient appears computationally prohibitive. Thus, Theorem 3.1 serves primarily as theoretical evidence for the relationship between search error and quantization error.
Now, let us assume \( q \) lies "within" \( S \), such that the expansion coefficient does not vary significantly when \( q \) is added to \( S \). Consider the following scenario: duplicate \( S \) and translate the duplicate such that the two copies are entirely disjoint. The expansion coefficient and \( \omega \) should remain approximately unchanged, as any reasonable tree would first separate the two copies, resulting in \( \omega = 0 \) at the first level. While the quantization improvement rate would be excellent at the first level, it would deteriorate at subsequent levels, similar to the original \( S \). Consequently, \( \beta \beta \) would remain unchanged. As the two copies are moved farther apart, \( \psi \) would increase, causing the bound to loosen. A more effective approach might involve analyzing \( \psi \) and \( \beta \) at a "local level" rather than globally.
Although such cases may not frequently occur in practice, I would encourage the authors to empirically demonstrate the tightness of their bound, akin to the analysis presented in Figure 2.
The technical writing could also be improved. The authors occasionally use accents and indices unnecessarily. For example:
- Replace \( \tilde{c} \) with \( c \).
- Replace \( B{l2} \) with \( B \).
- Use less ornate notation for intrinsic dimension \( d \) and full dimension \( D \).
- Replace "027: - " with "027: ---".
Additionally, Definition 2.1 is somewhat unclear. It would be more concise to state that the quantization error improvement rate is defined as  
\[ \beta = \frac{VS(A)}{VS(A) - VS(Al, A_r)}. \]
Further clarifications are also needed:
- In condition C2, what is meant by "complete"?
- In condition C4 of Theorem 3.1, does the tree \( T \) include all nodes or only the leaves?
In summary, the authors bound the search error of non-backtracking DFS in space-partitioning trees (for NN search) using quantization error. While the connection is conceptually sound, I remain unconvinced of the tightness of the provided bound, which diminishes the overall impact of the paper.
