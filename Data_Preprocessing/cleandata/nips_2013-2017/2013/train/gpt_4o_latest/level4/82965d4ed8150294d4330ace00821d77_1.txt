This paper investigates a method to accelerate template evaluations in object detection by leveraging vector quantization. The core concept involves substituting each HOG cell with an index pointing to a dictionary. Consequently, template evaluation is reduced to a sequence of table lookups followed by a straightforward addition. Combined with prior work on speeding up detection [5], this approach achieves a speedup of two orders of magnitude.
Quality: The paper is well-written and rigorously evaluated. The computational cost model presented in Section 4 is particularly commendable, as it clarifies ambiguities present in earlier speedup papers. The timing comparisons provided are both thorough and persuasive.
Clarity: The paper is clearly articulated and well-structured.  
Suggestion (not essential for the review): Section 4 could benefit from a graph illustrating how the time required for end-to-end evaluation on a single image scales with the number of categories. This might serve as an alternative visualization to Table 1.
Originality: This is the primary drawback of the paper. Many of the ideas employed here have been previously explored. Specifically, the concept of quantizing HOG cells was introduced in [10] (see Section 5.2). While [10] achieved a speedup factor of 2 using quantization alone (without the additional optimizations presented here), this paper demonstrates a significantly larger speedup of approximately 100. This is a substantial improvement. Nonetheless, in terms of novelty, the contribution lies more in the somewhat innovative combination of existing techniques to achieve a remarkable gain, rather than in proposing a fundamentally new idea.
Significance: This paper is highly significant for the computer vision community due to the substantial speedup achieved, which could have a profound impact on downstream applications. The authors have committed to releasing the code, and if they follow through, the code is likely to be widely adopted across the vision community. While the paper does not introduce any groundbreaking machine learning techniques, it effectively demonstrates significant performance improvements for a critical computer vision task.
