Review - General:
The paper introduces a supervised hybrid topic model for unstructured activity recognition, referred to as the relevance topic model (RTM). The supervised component corresponds to the class labels of the training videos.
RTM combines sparse Bayesian learning with the Replicated Softmax model. The core idea is to simultaneously learn discriminative topics as mid-level video representations and a discriminant function to serve as a video classifier. RTM consists of an undirected component that models the marginal distribution of video words and a directed component that models the conditional distribution of video classes given the latent topics. Additionally, the authors present methods for parameter estimation and inference. 
The proposed algorithm is evaluated on the Unstructured Social Activity Attribute (USAA) dataset, with quantitative results demonstrating that RTM outperforms existing methods in activity classification accuracy. Furthermore, the authors provide an intriguing comparison of topic correlations between two distinct classes.
The concept is compelling. The use of SIFT, STIP, and MFCC, which are low-level features primarily based on pixel representations, is noteworthy. However, it would be interesting to include a brief discussion on how more descriptive features, such as those derived from object detection, could be incorporated into the model.

Quality:  
The overall quality of the paper is good.
Clarity:  
The paper is well-written, and the problem is clearly defined.
Originality:  
The originality is moderate. While the approach of constructing intermediate features for activity recognition is not novel, and the use of supervised or semi-supervised methods has been explored before, the integration of these elements in the proposed model is noteworthy. 
Unsupervised methods, such as [2], which are designed for structured scenarios, often rely on strong assumptions about the temporal structure of observation vectors (video words). However, in unstructured activities, as addressed in this work, temporal constraints can be relaxed. 
Minimal supervision is reasonable for a challenging task like activity recognition in unconstrained videos. A thought-provoking question would be to explore the minimal amount of human-labeled data required to achieve acceptable classification performance on such "wild" videos.
Significance:  
The research topic is highly relevant and significant.  
The paper tackles an important problem: recognizing social activities in unconstrained videos. The authors propose an interesting model that leverages minimal labeling to learn and discover topics for activity recognition. The paper is well-written and provides sufficient evaluation to support its claims.
