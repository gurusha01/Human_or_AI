The authors introduce a generalized method of moments (GMM) framework for estimating the parameters of the Plackett-Luce (PL) model. Their approach involves decomposing complete rankings into pairwise comparisons, which are subsequently utilized to compute the required quantities during each iteration of the algorithm.
I find the proposed method intriguing, particularly the analysis of how the type of decomposition influences the consistency and quality of the solutions. This analysis highlights an important trade-off between computational efficiency and solution quality, which I found to be a strong point of the paper.
However, the primary limitation of the GMM approach lies in its scope of applicability. The theoretical results presented in the paper are restricted to full rankings, whereas many real-world preference aggregation problems involve partial rankings or preferences. While the authors mention extending their method to handle partial rankings as future work, including at least preliminary results in this direction would substantially enhance the paper's impact and relevance.
I also have a few concerns regarding the experimental evaluation, which I outline below:
- The real-world data experiment is not particularly compelling. Comparing models on a dataset where neither provides a good fit seems questionable, especially since the ground truth is derived from one of the models being evaluated. Could the authors clarify why this dataset was selected?
- A comparison with a gradient descent approach for maximizing the PL log-likelihood would be valuable. In my experience, gradient descent performs well for PL models, particularly in scenarios where the relative ordering of the parameters (e.g., Kendall correlation) is more critical than their absolute values. Additionally, a well-optimized gradient descent implementation should be more computationally efficient per iteration and require less memory than the GMM approach. Do the authors have any results or insights on this comparison?
Overall, I find the proposed method to be promising and innovative. However, in its current form, the paper's contribution may have limited impact on the broader research community. Addressing the concerns raised above, particularly regarding partial rankings and experimental validation, would significantly strengthen the work.
