This paper proposes a novel approach to active learning for structured output spaces. The key idea is to leverage local marginals for query selection instead of performing inference over all random variables before selecting queries for active learning. The computation of local marginals builds upon the methodology introduced in [28].
I appreciate the direction and focus of this work. Active learning in structured spaces is a significant and underexplored problem in computer vision, making the research presented in this paper highly relevant. The paper makes a meaningful contribution to the field, albeit by extending prior work.
That said, there are several issues that need to be addressed:
1. The experiments are limited to the indoor geometry task. To broaden the impact of the work, the authors should consider including experiments on other tasks, such as scene labeling or human pose estimation. Both of these involve structured output spaces and would significantly enhance the paper's impact.  
2. The experimental baselines are primarily ablative. It would be beneficial to compare the proposed approach to existing methods, such as those in [7] and [33]. Additionally, there seems to be some overlap between [7] and Algorithm 1, as well as [33] and Algorithm 2. A more explicit comparison highlighting the differences between this work and [7,33] would strengthen the paper.  
3. Section 2.2 is challenging to follow. I recommend reducing the emphasis on the related work section and providing a clearer and more detailed explanation of Section 2.2.  
4. The paper lacks qualitative results. Including qualitative examples that illustrate why certain images are preferred over others during the active learning process would help clarify and intuitively explain the approach. The paper would benefit from a discussion of why the proposed method works and what insights can be drawn from the results.  
5. The paper should cite Siddiquie et al., "Beyond Active Noun Tagging: Modeling Contextual Interactions for Multi-Class Active Learning," CVPR 2010. This work addresses active learning in structured output spaces and uses structure/contextual interactions for query selection, making it relevant to the current study.
Overall, I find the direction of this paper promising. While the approach is not entirely novel, it takes important steps forward in addressing an underexplored problem. I believe the paper merits acceptance.
