This paper introduces a method to accelerate the nearest neighbor retrieval process for VP-trees by estimating the decision function. Specifically, the authors achieve this through a combination of sampling and regression using a piecewise linear function. The proposed approach is applicable to both metric spaces (e.g., Euclidean space) and non-metric spaces (e.g., certain Bregman divergences). Empirical results demonstrate that the method is faster than recently proposed state-of-the-art techniques in most cases. Additionally, the paper explores the broader applicability of VP-trees.
The proposed approach appears to be a reasonable application of fundamental machine learning techniques to search problems where brute-force evaluation is computationally expensive. The paper is well-structured, clearly written, and supported by convincing experimental results.
Overall, this work is clearly presented, appears to be novel to a reasonable extent, and is technically sound. It introduces a method to estimate the decision function for improving VP-tree performance, specifically through sampling and regression with a piecewise linear function.
