Please incorporate a simulation where the loss function is not strongly convex but the proximal gradient (PG) algorithm still converges linearly (for varying levels of stability). Additionally, provide a discussion on the scenarios where the theoretical guarantees break down. Furthermore, elaborate on how the analysis can be extended to the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM).

This paper establishes the linear convergence of the proximal gradient method for trace-norm regularized learning problems, where the loss function is expressed as \( f(X) = h(A(X)) \), with \( A \) being a linear operator and \( h \) being strongly convex on any compact set with a Lipschitz continuous gradient.  
The work extends prior results by Tseng [20], Tseng and Yun ("A coordinate gradient descent method for nonsmooth separable minimization"), and Zhang et al. [22], which demonstrated linear convergence using the "error-bound condition" for lasso and group lasso problems, to the trace-norm setting. While this extension is non-trivial, the contribution appears to be primarily technical in nature.  
The presentation of the proofs is generally clear.  
Strengths:  
- Establishes the linear convergence of the proximal gradient algorithm, building on and extending the results of Tseng et al.  
Weaknesses:  
- The contribution is largely technical.  
- A numerical example demonstrating linear convergence is missing.  
Detailed Comments:  
1. The proofs of Theorem 3.1 and Lemma 3.2 closely resemble those in Tseng's work. The authors should more explicitly reference the original contributions to clarify the novelty of their work.  
2. A numerical example illustrating linear convergence (e.g., a semilog plot of function value versus the number of iterations) would significantly strengthen the paper.  
3. The dependence of the constants \( \kappa1, \ldots, \kappa4 \) on the parameters \( \underline{\alpha} \) and \( \overline{\alpha} \) is unclear and should be elaborated.  
Minor Issue:  
4. The sequence of inequalities preceding inequality (13) is unclear. The final inequality holds due to the convexity of the trace norm and the fact that \( -\bar{G} \in \tau\partial\|X\|_{\ast} \), rather than the intermediate inequality (see p. 289 in [20]).  
Summary:  
This paper extends prior linear convergence results based on the "error-bound condition" from lasso and group lasso problems to the trace-norm setting.
