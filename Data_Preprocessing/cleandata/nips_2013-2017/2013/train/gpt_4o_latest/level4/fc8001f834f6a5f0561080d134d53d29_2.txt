Review - Paraphrased Version:
Summary:  
This paper introduces a method for learning a pruning algorithm tailored to VP-trees in non-metric spaces. The core idea involves estimating the decision function for approximate nearest neighbor search within the VP-tree by sampling and then approximating it using a piecewise linear function. The proposed learning-to-prune approach is evaluated for search efficiency against relevant pruning baselines and demonstrates significant improvements, particularly when the intrinsic dimensionality of the data is low.
Clarity:  
The paper is generally well-written, but it occasionally lacks detailed explanations regarding implementation specifics and parameter choices. For instance, the rationale behind selecting values such as K=100, m=7, ρ=8, and a bucket size of 10⁵ (as mentioned in Lines 185, 227, and 315) is not adequately discussed.
Originality:  
To the best of my knowledge, this is the first work that explores the idea of "learning to prune" by approximating the approximate nearest neighbor classification on a VP-tree, making it a novel contribution.
Significance:  
Nearest neighbor methods are a foundational topic in search and classification. As such, this learning-to-prune approach, which approximates nearest neighbor search using a non-linear function, is likely to attract interest from a broad audience.  
That said, the datasets used for experimental validation appear overly simplistic and low-dimensional, which may not reflect realistic scenarios. For instance, results on datasets like RCV-256 or SIFT for L2 distance are not provided. Additionally, the ability of the proposed method to achieve the claimed speed-up in metric spaces is not convincingly demonstrated, which limits its applicability. For fast search in metric spaces, there are established methods that leverage techniques like LSH and embeddings. A relevant reference is: [31] P. Jain, B. Kulis, K. Grauman, "Fast Image Search for Learned Metrics," CVPR 2008.  
In summary, the paper presents a novel learning-to-prune approach that approximates the decision function for approximate nearest neighbor search in a VP-tree using a non-linear piecewise function learned via sampling. This method achieves substantial speed-up over existing approaches on the chosen datasets. However, the motivation for focusing specifically on non-metric spaces requires stronger justification, as it excludes relevant baselines applicable to metric spaces.
