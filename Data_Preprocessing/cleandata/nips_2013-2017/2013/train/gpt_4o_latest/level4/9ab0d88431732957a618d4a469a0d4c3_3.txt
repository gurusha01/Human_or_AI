Multiple model learning extends the concept of clustering by allowing cluster centers to be represented as learning models.  
In this framework, each learning model is associated with weighted data, where the weights, averaged across models, are constrained to uniform values through l2 regularization.  
This regularization enables the derivation of a straightforward alternating optimization algorithm.  
Additionally, theoretical performance bounds are established, demonstrating robustness to outliers.  
The paper presents a clear motivation for the work.  
The theoretical analysis appears mathematically rigorous.  
(Some notations, such as P_delta, are defined in the appendix but not in the main body of the paper. The authors are advised to ensure that the manuscript is self-contained.)  
Since each set of weighted data can be linked to an (empirical) distribution, it would be beneficial to discuss the regularization properties from the perspective of probabilistic mixture models, in addition to the optimization viewpoint.  
Leveraging l2 regularization on the average data weights, the authors propose a novel approach to multiple model learning.  
The numerical experiments validate the method's efficiency and strong performance.
