This paper introduces a modification to random forests aimed at improving memory efficiency by replacing trees with directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). The authors propose two methods for automatically learning these DAGs.
The overall quality of this paper falls below the acceptance threshold for NIPS. Firstly, the novelty in relation to random forests is minimal. The sole modification involves substituting trees with DAGs. While the paper asserts that DAGs offer improved memory efficiency, this claim is insufficiently substantiated (as elaborated below).
Secondly, the proposed approach appears highly ad hoc. Although Section 3 begins with an optimization problem outlined in Equations 2–4, the optimization in Section 3.1 ultimately reduces to ad hoc local search methods. The description of the algorithms in Section 3.1 is vague and lacks clarity, making it doubtful that anyone could implement the algorithm based on the provided details. Furthermore, it is unclear whether the algorithm converges at all, even to a local minimum.
The experimental results fail to convincingly demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method. The central claim of the paper is improved memory efficiency, yet the experiments only show that the proposed approach produces models with fewer nodes. However, the number of nodes is just one aspect of model size, as other components—such as the splitting functions and class distributions at leaf nodes—also contribute to memory usage. It remains unclear how a reduction in the number of nodes translates to overall memory efficiency. For example, if the nodes account for only a small fraction of the total model size, then models with 3,000 nodes versus 22,000 nodes might require roughly the same amount of memory. Additionally, with memory becoming increasingly affordable, a minor reduction in memory usage (e.g., a few kilobytes) would have limited practical relevance.
In summary, this paper represents a trivial modification of existing techniques, lacks sufficient novelty, and is unlikely to have a meaningful impact. It does not meet the standards expected at NIPS.
