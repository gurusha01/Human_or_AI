This paper introduces a generative model for natural image patches that incorporates occlusions and the translation invariance of features. The proposed model is composed of a set of masks and features that can be spatially translated across the patch. By specifying translations for the masks and features, the patch is generated by sampling conditionally independent Gaussian noise. The authors present an inference framework for estimating the model parameters, which is validated on synthetic data with compelling results. Furthermore, the model is applied to natural image patches, where it successfully learns a set of masks and features. The resulting receptive fields, when combined, predominantly resemble Gabor-like structures, though some exhibit globular patterns.
Quality:  
The model is innovative and addresses key aspects of natural image structure. I appreciate the explicit incorporation of translation invariance and the connection drawn to convolutional networks in the discussion. The results are intriguing and demonstrate the potential of the approach.
However, I have several concerns that I hope the authors can address.  
My primary concern lies with the assumption of conditional independence given the masks and features (and their locations). Why was pixel-wise independent noise chosen? This assumption seems to constrain the model's expressive power, as it restricts the generated patches to a "sprite"-like structure, where features are merely masked and translated. I would like to see samples generated by the model and a comparison with natural image patches.  
Additionally, I am curious about the model's behavior when trained on unwhitened patches. It would be interesting to observe the impact of whitening on the resulting receptive fields, as I suspect it plays a significant role in shaping them.  
Lastly, the background model appears overly simplistic and somewhat artificial. The concept of "background" in natural images is ambiguous, as it often consists of other scene elements that are scaled down or blurred. Why not enforce a constraint that all pixels must be covered by at least one mask? It would be more compelling if the model could automatically learn a "background" component from the data, such as a flat mask with simple features.
Clarity:  
Overall, the paper is well-written. However, given the complexity of the model and the numerous parameters involved, some definitions are buried within inline equations, which can make the paper harder to follow. I recommend revising Figure 1 to make it more accessible by using synthetic masks and features that better illustrate the concept. The current examples are not very intuitive; for instance, swapping the mask and feature might go unnoticed. A simple mask paired with a straightforward texture would likely improve clarity.
Originality:  
The work appears to be original, presenting a novel model with thoughtful analysis.
Significance:  
This paper will likely appeal to the natural image statistics community, as well as researchers in neuroscience and sparse coding. It offers an interesting and detailed model that captures fundamental properties of natural images. While there are some concerns, this is solid work overall.
