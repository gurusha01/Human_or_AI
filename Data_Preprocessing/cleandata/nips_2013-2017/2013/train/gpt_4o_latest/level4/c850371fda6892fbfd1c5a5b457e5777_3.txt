The paper introduces a general framework for designing differentially private online algorithms in both the full information and bandit settings.
The manuscript is well-written, clear, and effectively motivated. It provides a thorough discussion of its connections to the relevant literature. While I did not verify every detail in the appendix, the presented results seem correct upon review.
Although the paper may not represent a groundbreaking contribution, the ideas are compelling and, in my opinion, merit publication.
Minor suggestions:  
- Please consider moving the discussion section into the main text, as the open problems, particularly the comparison with the results in [1], are quite intriguing. The paper provides a general framework for designing differentially private online algorithms, supported by rigorous and comprehensive theoretical results.
