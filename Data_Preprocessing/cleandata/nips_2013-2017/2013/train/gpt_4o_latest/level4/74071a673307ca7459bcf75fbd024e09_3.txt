This paper investigates regret guarantees in the context of prediction with expert advice, focusing on guarantees that can be simultaneously achieved against each individual expert. The problem is essentially resolved for the case of two constant binary experts under the absolute loss (or dot loss). Specifically, the authors compute the finite-time and asymptotic regions of achievable pairs. The paper also explores connections to random playout and provides bounds in terms of logarithmic prior weights.
This is a well-written and rigorous paper that delves into a novel aspect of the theory of prediction with expert advice. The results are mathematically precise and elegant, though somewhat limited in scope. While I do not anticipate a significant impact on the NIPS community, the work shows latent potential that could be more fully realized through future research.
The techniques heavily depend on the linearity of the loss function. It would be valuable to extend the discussion to include, for example, convex and Lipschitz loss functions.
The minimax algorithm for absolute loss with a fixed horizon was first introduced in: N. Cesa-Bianchi et al., "How to use expert advice," Journal of the ACM, 44(3):427-485, 1997. Please correct the reference.
===============================
I have reviewed the authors' rebuttal. This is a solid and elegant paper with results that are somewhat narrow in scope. I would recommend acceptance, although I expect it to appeal to only a small subset of the NIPS community.
