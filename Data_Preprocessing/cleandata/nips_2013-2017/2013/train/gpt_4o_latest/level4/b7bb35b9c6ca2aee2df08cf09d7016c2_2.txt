The paper introduces a novel approach to constructing a parameter server for distributed machine learning systems, providing each client with a view of parameters that maintains a bounded level of staleness. By leveraging a combination of caching mechanisms, the client interface ensures that all updates to the parameter array occurring after a fixed deadline (defined as the current clock/iteration/tick minus a fixed delay) are visible, while also incorporating more recent updates when feasible. This design offers a parameter view that integrates the majority of updates while making a best-effort attempt to include the most recent ones. The authors demonstrate that this straightforward semantic preserves the theoretical guarantees of cyclic delay methods while achieving significantly better performance in practice. Empirical results across various problems and cluster configurations highlight that the observed advantages stem from a combination of improved efficiency (compared to BSP) and enhanced optimization progress per update (compared to asynchronous methods).
This work proposes a simple yet effective semantic framework that enhances existing "parameter server" schemes commonly employed in large-scale machine learning applications. In addition to straightforwardly preserving theoretical guarantees, the proposed method exhibits notable speed improvements in reasonably sized experiments compared to baseline approaches. On these merits alone, the paper makes a compelling case for its contribution.
The approach appears well-suited to addressing common challenges in loaded clusters, such as stragglers. The caching mechanism, in particular, seems to significantly reduce overhead for slower nodes, potentially providing a degree of "load balancing" that is otherwise challenging to achieve. However, it would be helpful to explicitly demonstrate whether this mechanism indeed enables the "catch-up" phenomenon described in the paper to a meaningful extent.
The paper provides some discussion of the read semantics, including details about the cache policy, which defaults to a fallback when the local cache is stale. However, regarding the read-my-writes policy, is it correct to assume that all local writes are propagated to all caches and the server? A brief clarification on the writing semantics would enhance reproducibility and understanding of the proposed method.
Overall, as a systems-oriented paper, the authors present a strong case for their approach.
Pros:
- Straightforward semantics.
- Retains fundamental theoretical guarantees for common methods (e.g., SGD).
- Experimental results demonstrate tangible speedups across multiple distributed problems, with the improvements aligning with the expected sources.
Cons:
- A direct comparison to cyclic delay methods would strengthen the evaluation.
- The approach may be more complex to implement compared to asynchronous or BSP methods; is the moderate speedup worth the added complexity?
Update:
I appreciate the authors' clarifications and additions, which address my minor concerns. The paper presents a framework for parameter servers in machine learning applications, offering moderate speedups alongside appealing theoretical and practical properties.
