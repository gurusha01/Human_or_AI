The paper introduces a method for completing an n-by-m matrix M with rank r smaller than min(n, m). Rather than directly completing M, the authors assume access to an n-by-r1 matrix A and an m-by-r2 matrix B, enabling the representation M = AZB'. The matrices A and B are treated as pre-supplied side information, and the proposed approach focuses on estimating Z to complete M.
The authors demonstrate that when r1 is significantly smaller than n and r2 is significantly smaller than m, the number of entries required to complete M is greatly reduced by leveraging the side information matrices. Additionally, since Z has much smaller dimensions than M, the estimation process becomes highly efficient.
Previous works, such as those by Goldberg et al. (2010), Adams, Dahl, and Murray (2010), and Porteous, Asuncion, and Welling (2010), have also explored matrix completion with side information. However, the method proposed in this paper appears distinct from prior approaches, and the authors provide evidence of its advantage over the method in Goldberg et al. (2010).
The sample complexity analysis is well-executed, and the experimental results are encouraging. 
One concern with the paper is that the assumption of access to side information is somewhat strong, making the observed reductions in sample complexity and performance improvements less surprising. Nonetheless, the authors present an example where such an assumption is reasonable and applicable.
Overall, the paper establishes a theoretical result demonstrating that incorporating side information matrices can substantially lower sample complexity in matrix completion. This leads to an efficient method that achieves computational speed-ups by estimating a low-dimensional matrix.
