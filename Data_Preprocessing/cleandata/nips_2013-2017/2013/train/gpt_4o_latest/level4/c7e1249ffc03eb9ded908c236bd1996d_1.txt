This paper addresses the problem of demand estimation in multi-heterogeneous agents, focusing on classifying agents and estimating the preferences of each agent type using ranking data of various alternatives. This is a significant problem due to its practical relevance in understanding the underlying preference distributions of diverse agents. To address this, the authors propose generalized random utility models (GRUM), develop RJMCMC algorithms for parameter estimation in GRUM, and establish theoretical conditions for the model's identifiability. Experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the model's effectiveness.
Overall, this paper is thorough and well-executed. It not only presents a detailed algorithm for parameter estimation and experimental validation but also provides non-trivial theoretical insights into the conditions for model identifiability. I reviewed the majority of the lengthy proofs and, to the best of my knowledge, found no errors. While the GRUM model itself has been introduced in prior work at UAI, which reduces the novelty of this contribution to some extent, I believe this paper merits acceptance.
Minor suggestions for improvement:
1) The authors should explicitly clarify the relationship between their work and the original GRUM models, including a discussion of prior contributions and the aspects that require deeper analysis (e.g., identifiability conditions). These points should be elaborated in the Related Literature section.
2) To better validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, the scale of the experiments could be expanded. Using K=4 and L=3 (representing the number of features for agents and alternatives) provides limited information and could be extended for more robust evaluation.
In conclusion, this paper tackles an important problem and presents a solid contribution.
