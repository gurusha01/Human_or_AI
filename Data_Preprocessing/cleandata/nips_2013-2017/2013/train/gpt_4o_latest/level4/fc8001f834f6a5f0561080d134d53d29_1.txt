This paper investigates methods to enhance the computational efficiency of approximate nearest neighbor retrieval techniques. The abstract provides a concise and accurate summary of the work. The paper is well-written, engaging, and presents a notable contribution through Property 1, where the authors demonstrate the applicability of their proposed method to specific types of spaces.
That said, the contribution appears to have limited alignment with learning and neural computing. The proposed method does not seem to heavily rely on learning, as the learning components are limited to simple sampling and approximating piecewise linear functions in very low-dimensional spaces. Consequently, this paper may not align strongly with the core research focus of NIPS, in my opinion.
 Comment after authors' feedback 
The authors have addressed my concerns effectively. I now understand why learning is an integral part of this method and why the learning process is intentionally kept simple (as simplicity is appropriate for the underlying problem). This paper explores ways to improve the computational efficiency of approximate nearest neighbor retrieval methods. It remains well-written and engaging.
