The authors provide a precise characterization of the tradeoffs achievable between regret-vs-expert-0 and regret-vs-expert-1 in the two-expert setting with a known horizon \( T \). They present an algorithm capable of achieving any tradeoff along the Pareto frontier, with the specific case of equal regret bounds for both experts recovering the standard definition. Additionally, they analyze the asymptotic behavior of this tradeoff curve.
The key contributions of the paper are encapsulated in Theorems 6 and 8. These results are particularly noteworthy, with Theorem 6 offering a tight minimax characterization. However, it would be beneficial if the authors provided more motivation for the central function \( f_T(i) \), which currently appears somewhat ad hoc. It seems plausible that this function is connected to Rademacher random variables and binomial probabilities, with Theorem 8 potentially arising from a normal approximation to the binomial distribution. That said, the scope of these results is quite restricted, as they are limited to the \( K = 2 \) expert case. While Section 4.1 notes that the \( \sqrt{\min \log \text{prior}} \) frontier is weaker for \( K = 2 \), this is unsurprising given that the bound originates from an algorithm that is not minimax optimal.
Theorem 10 is another significant contribution, as it generalizes Theorems 6 and 8 to the broader experts problem in two dimensions, rather than being confined to the specific case of absolute loss. The proof of Theorem 10 suggests that the entire paper could potentially be reframed in terms of this more general problem, which might lead to a clearer presentation. At the very least, Theorem 10 should be introduced earlier in the paper to enhance the flow and structure.
Section 5.2 is somewhat unclear in its purpose. It appears to suggest that the standard \( \sqrt{T \log K} \) bounds can be recovered using the \( K = 2 \) algorithm presented in the paper. However, the authors need to clarify this point and explain why such a result is meaningful or interesting, especially considering that simpler algorithms already achieve this bound.
The primary limitation of the paper lies in its focus on the \( K = 2 \) case, which is far less practical than the general \( K > 2 \) setting. This omission significantly restricts the broader applicability of the results.
In summary, while the authors provide a complete characterization of the Pareto frontier for prediction with expert advice, their analysis is confined to the relatively narrow case of two experts.
