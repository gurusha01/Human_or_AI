This paper is theoretically robust and presents an intriguing novel EP-type inference method for continuous-time stochastic dynamical systems. The manuscript is well-organized, and the theoretical aspects are articulated clearly. However, the authors could have provided stronger motivation for their approach by including a more comprehensive experimental section. The only comparison with alternative methods is found in the first example in Section 3.1, where the authors benchmark their method against an MCMC approach. While I do not entirely agree with using MCMC approaches as a benchmark, given that the proposed method performs comparably to MCMC, what specific advantages does it offer? This point requires a more detailed discussion. In the third example, the authors appear to imply that their results are similar to those of Zammit Mangion et al., justifying their method primarily from a computational perspective. However, the authors should provide a quantitative assessment of this computational advantage. Introducing a new approach without offering a clear understanding of its performance characteristics relative to existing methods is of limited value to the community. I strongly encourage the authors to provide quantitative insights on this matter during the rebuttal phase. Overall, this is a very interesting paper, but the experimental section falls short of being fully satisfactory.
