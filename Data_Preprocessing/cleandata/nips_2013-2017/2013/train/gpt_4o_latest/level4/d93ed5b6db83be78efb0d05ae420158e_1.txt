This paper introduces determinantal point processes (DPPs) as a framework for modeling inhibitory interactions in spike train data. The authors employ a maximum likelihood estimation approach utilizing stochastic gradient descent. The concept is intriguing and holds promise as a potentially powerful non-factorial spike train modeling technique.
That said, the presentation feels somewhat unfocused, and it is unclear to what extent DPPs offer tangible improvements in model accuracy. Given that gain and periodic terms can be incorporated into generalized linear models (GLMs) relatively easily, it is not immediately evident that reframing the problem using DPPs justifies the additional complexity. Instead of exploring latent space structures, it might be more insightful to directly compare the practical utility of the DPP approach against alternative methods.
GLMs with neuronal coupling, while not capturing instantaneous correlations, generally handle correlations effectively, and state-space models are even better suited for instantaneous correlations (see Macke et al., NIPS 2011). Additionally, recent work has developed models for instantaneous interactions using pseudo-likelihood methods (e.g., Stevenson et al., 2012; Hanslinger et al., Neural Computation 2013). How does the DPP approach compare to these potentially more tractable models?
Minor issues:
1. What specific kernel \( k_\theta \) was used in the experiments? How critical is it to use a kernel based on marginal preferences, as described in Equation 2?
2. Equation 6 raises questions about how gain control is implemented. In the normalization framework of Carandini and Heeger, gain control is typically a nonlinear operation applied to the firing rate of individual neurons. Here, \( \nu_t \) appears to be a positive, stimulus-dependent scalar that influences the entire population. Is this interpretation correct?
3. The historical context in Section 2.1 requires clarification. GLMs were initially proposed for spike train modeling much earlier (Brillinger, 1988; Chornoboy et al., 1988), and Harris et al., 2003 (rather than Truccolo et al.) was among the first to apply them to real data.
In response to the rebuttal:  
The additional model comparison results provided in the rebuttal are helpful, and it is surprising that the DPP approach performs significantly better. Nonetheless, it might still be worthwhile to explore GLM-like models that can describe instantaneous coupling, as noted earlier.
In summary, this paper proposes DPPs as a method for modeling inhibitory interactions in spike train data. While the idea is compelling and has potential as a non-factorial spike train model, the presentation lacks focus.
