This paper introduces a compelling method for modeling dependencies between variables using Gaussian process conditional copulas. The approach leverages Gaussian process priors on latent functions to capture their interactions. An alternating EP algorithm is then proposed to perform approximate Bayesian inference. Experimental results, conducted on both synthetic datasets and two real-world datasets, demonstrate the superior performance of conditional copula models, particularly the one based on the Student-t copula.
Overall, the paper is well-written and has potential applications in dependence modeling for time series data. The EP inference method is also practical for deriving the posterior distribution as described. However, a significant issue with the paper is the lack of clarity in certain aspects:  
(1) How are the parameters in the copula model (e.g., \(\alpha\), \(\beta\), \(\omega\) for the Symmetrized Joe Clayton Copula) determined? It appears that these parameters are set as constants. How should they be selected for a specific time series dataset?  
(2) The paper does not provide sufficient details about the parameters of the exponential covariance function used in the Gaussian process.  
(3) There is no explanation of how to determine the number of latent functions \(k\).  
In summary, this paper addresses an interesting problem and proposes a feasible inference method. However, it lacks important details regarding parameter selection and settings.
