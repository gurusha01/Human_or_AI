This paper addresses the problem of regret against individual actions in the full-information online prediction setting. Rather than aiming to uniformly bound regret across all experts (actions), the work provides a characterization of the "regret profiles" that can be achieved in the fundamental case of binary prediction with absolute loss. The author(s) define a profile <r0, r1> as T-realizable if there exists an algorithm that ensures regret r0 and r1 against constant predictions 0 and 1, respectively, under any (non-oblivious) adversary. A simple example of a T-realizable profile is <0, T>. 
The paper precisely characterizes (including constants) the Pareto-front of all T-realizable profiles for any T in the basic case of two actions with absolute loss. Using this result, the authors derive an asymptotic bound. Additionally, the paper provides algorithms that achieve these realizable profiles. 
The paper is well-written, the problem is clearly motivated, and the proofs appear to be sound. The exploration of non-uniform regret bounds represents an intriguing and novel research direction. This work marks an important first step in this emerging area. 
Comments:
1. In Definition 1, the paper clarifies that the adversary model under consideration is the non-oblivious (adaptive) one. However, I would prefer this to be stated more explicitly and earlier in the paper, especially since Lemma 3 does not hold for oblivious adversaries. 
2. The second part of Theorem 6 was somewhat unclear. Initially, I assumed it provided a complete description of the algorithm that achieves the vertices of the Pareto-front. It became apparent later that it merely describes certain behaviors of the algorithm at three specific time steps. This should be clarified explicitly or omitted altogether for better readability. 
3. How do the new bounds compare to the classical uniform regret bound of \(\sqrt{T/2 \ln K}\)? I would have appreciated a discussion on this point, particularly given that the above bound is asymptotically optimal. 
4. The algorithms used to establish the upper bounds appear to be computationally inefficient. It would be valuable to explore more efficient algorithms that achieve regret bounds close to the optimal ones. 
Overall, this work provides optimal bounds for regret profiles against constant actions in online learning. The paper is technically rigorous and opens up a promising new line of research in regret analysis.
