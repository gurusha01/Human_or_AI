The paper "Adaptive Anonymity via b-Matching" tackles the challenge of releasing a private dataset in a way that ensures individuals within the dataset become indistinguishable by censoring specific measurements. The authors introduce the concepts of k-anonymity and the b-matching problem, framing it as the construction of a bipartite graph that captures the compatibility between the original and released datasets. They propose two algorithms tailored for the asymmetric and symmetric cases, which are grounded as variational approximations of the star (suppression) minimization problem. The paper includes an approximation result for these algorithms and offers a range of privacy guarantees for both single attacks and sustained attacks on the k-clique construction, as well as symmetric and asymmetric b-matchings. A concise experimental section is presented, showcasing some compelling results.
This work is of high caliber, as it thoroughly addresses the b-matching problem and introduces computationally efficient algorithms that are well-supported by theoretical justifications. The paper is exceptionally well-written, with a clear and accessible introduction and exposition. The algorithmic contributions are robust, and the privacy guarantees are substantial. The study is likely to have a significant impact, as b-matching represents a meaningful extension of k-anonymity while serving as a practical alternative to other privacy frameworks. Additionally, the approach is highly versatile, accommodating user-defined privacy levels and addressing both symmetric and asymmetric scenarios. However, one critique is that Theorem 1 is relatively weak, as its approximation factor depends on the degree, rendering it of limited utility. Including an explanation (even in the appendix) of how the algorithms serve as a variational upper bound of the ideal program would enhance the paper's persuasiveness.
Minor comments:  
- Line 191: Replace "a more general" with "a general."  
- Line 263: Use `` instead of ''.  
- Definition 4.1: This is unclearâ€”how does the matching relate to the symmetry notion here?  
Overall, this paper provides a comprehensive exploration of the b-matching problem for k-anonymous privacy, offering innovative algorithms and strong privacy guarantees. I strongly recommend its acceptance, as it is poised to become a significant contribution to the study of k-anonymity through b-matching.
