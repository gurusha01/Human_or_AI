The paper introduces a novel approach to estimate the density ratio \( p/q \). While there are existing methods addressing this problem, the key contribution of this work lies in reformulating density ratio estimation as a Fredholm integral equation.
Strengths of the paper:
The manuscript is well-written and engaging. The problem of density ratio estimation is both significant and intriguing.
Weaknesses, comments, and questions:
(i) The paper lacks certain details. For instance, why does  
\[
\int k_t(x,y)f(x)dx = f(y) + O(t)?
\]
A proof (either in the main text or supplementary material) or a proper reference is required for such statements, even if they are straightforward to verify.
(ii) This method can also be applied to density estimation as a special case (\( q=1 \)). It is noteworthy that this approach does not require the bandwidth to converge to zero, unlike standard kernel density estimation (kde), which becomes inconsistent in such cases. A more detailed discussion on this would be helpful to clarify how the bandwidth parameters in this method differ from those in kde.
(iii) A brief explanation of Tikhonov regularization should be included, as many in the NIPS community may not be familiar with it.
(iv) All proofs are relegated to the supplementary material. I have not verified their correctness.
(v) It would be beneficial to include a discussion on why a naive plug-in approach—estimating \( p \) and \( q \) separately—is inferior to the proposed method.
(vi) The paper does not clearly compare the performance of the proposed method with existing approaches. For example, if I recall correctly, [12] also derives minimax bounds. While Corollaries 2 and 4 in this paper provide upper bounds on the convergence rate, it is unclear how these compare to the optimal minimax rate.
(vii) References for the datasets used in the experiments (CPUsmall, Kin8nm, USPS) should be provided.
(viii) A demonstration of the proposed method on toy problems with fixed and known \( p \) and \( q \) is missing. For example, in the case of one-dimensional \( p \) and \( q \), a plot comparing the true \( p/q \) with the estimated \( p/q \) would help readers evaluate the quality of the estimation.
In conclusion, this is a commendable paper on density ratio estimation. However, it remains unclear how the proposed method compares to existing algorithms (e.g., [12]), and the lack of demonstrations on toy problems (e.g., using simple one-dimensional \( p \) and \( q \)) is a notable omission.
