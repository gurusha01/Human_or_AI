This manuscript introduces a systematic approach to enable structure learning for SEMs with data sets that are only locally i.i.d., meaning the data may originate from distinct underlying models over time. The paper is well-written, easy to follow, and addresses an important challenge—learning from time-dependent data—which has been overlooked by many widely used structure learning algorithms. The proposed techniques for extending learning to time-dependent data are straightforward yet effective, as demonstrated by experiments using the PC method.
There are two recommendations that could enhance the clarity of the paper's contributions. First, the experiments include the statement that "any other standard graphical model structure learning algorithms would perform similarly, ..." which seems overly strong. Differences between structure learning methods can be significant. It would be better to rephrase this, explicitly stating that the experiments focus on the PC method for both time-independent data and its adaptation for time-dependent data, which is highly relevant. The authors could then speculate that similar results might hold for other methods or retain the assertion but provide detailed reasoning to justify why this would be the case.
Second, the conclusion notes that extending the proposed ideas to Bayesian networks might not be straightforward due to challenges in maintaining sufficient statistics. While this issue is not central to the paper's primary contribution, it highlights that applying the same learning procedure to Bayesian networks and other models may require more than minor adjustments. The paper would benefit from disclosing this limitation earlier, perhaps framing the work more directly around its focus on SEM models while still acknowledging the potential (but non-trivial) extensions to other models. This would help sharpen the paper's scope.
In summary, this is a well-written paper on learning the graph structure for SEMs under the assumption that data are only locally i.i.d. The proposed formulation is simple to understand and implement, and the experimental results are promising, even though they focus solely on comparisons using the PC method. I have reviewed the authors' feedback and acknowledge their responses.
