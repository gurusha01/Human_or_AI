The concept of k-anonymity is widely recognized. In this work, the authors propose an innovative extension called b-matching. They compare the two approaches and develop novel algorithms to generate efficient solutions for b-matching.

Line 020: Remove the comma after "and."  
Line 057: Replace with "...entry y_i of Y..."  
Line 061: Use "at least k-1."  
Suggestion: Consider using different weights for various features (e.g., individuals might be more comfortable disclosing their age than revealing their HIV status). The paper introduces a new privacy measure and demonstrates how to efficiently anonymize datasets based on this measure.
