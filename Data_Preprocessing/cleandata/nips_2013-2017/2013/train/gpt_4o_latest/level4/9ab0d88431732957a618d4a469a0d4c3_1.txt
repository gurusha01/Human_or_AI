The authors present a regularized weighting technique for multi-model learning in this paper. Multi-model learning involves fitting a "mixture" of simple models to a dataset in a general framework, where each model is associated with a convex loss, and the mixture is optimized with respect to both the model parameters and their weights. These weights describe the extent to which each model explains individual data points. The proposed framework generalizes several classical approaches, such as k-means and probabilistic mixture modeling. To enhance robustness against outliers, the authors introduce a penalty on the model weights, encouraging uniform weight distributions. The paper includes several theoretical results and limited experimental validation.
The paper is engaging and well-written, with the generality of the proposed approach being particularly well-articulated. The authors have managed to present a substantial collection of results concisely, relegating all proofs to the supplementary material while maintaining a self-contained narrative. The limitations of the proposed technique are also clearly acknowledged (e.g., Figure 2.2). 
Overall, my impression of the paper is very positive. However, there are some shortcomings. A minor issue concerns the notations:  
- The notation \(\Delta^n\) is introduced too late (in footnote 1 on page 3, despite being used on page 2).  
- The orthogonal projection operator \(P_C\) is defined only in the supplementary material, though it is used in Lemma 2. Even in the supplementary material, its definition is delayed.  
- The parameter \(\gamma\), discussed below Definition 2, is indirectly defined. The discussion would benefit from greater clarity, such as explicitly stating that the proportion of zero weights (ignored data points) should fall within a specific range.  
While the paper is generally clear, Section 3.1 is overly cryptic and lacks sufficient detail. For instance, how was the noise generated? What is the value of \(\alpha\), and how does this value affect performance? Does "MAD" in the legend correspond to "MD" in the text? If PCA is the base learner, was dimensionality reduction performed, and if so, how? This single experimental evaluation raises more questions than it answers, offering limited insight into the proposed method.
Regarding the choice of \(\alpha\), as discussed in Sections 2 and 3.2, it is evident that this parameter impacts the model's performance. Practitioners would naturally want to optimize \(\alpha\). However, the experimental section neither specifies the value of \(\alpha\) nor explores its effects. The authors provide little guidance on how to tune this parameter, which I see as a significant shortcoming. Since \(\alpha\) appears explicitly in Theorem 3, it is clear that its influence on the results is theoretically non-trivial.
Another concern is the upper bound assumption (\(B\) throughout the paper). While I am familiar with clipping techniques from older works (e.g., Zeger and Lugosi, 1995: http://www.code.ucsd.edu/~zeger/publications/journals/LuZe95-IT-Nonparametric/LuZe95-IT-Nonparametric.pdf), I find it difficult to interpret this assumption in the current context. Specifically, the goal of addressing arbitrary outliers seems to conflict with the validity of this assumption in practice. Extending Theorem 3 to a more general case where the bound assumption does not hold (as done in the referenced paper) is not straightforward. If the authors have a justification for this assumption, it should be emphasized more clearly.
Finally, while Section 1.1 briefly discusses related work, the discussion feels limited. Mixture models, for example, can handle outliers explicitly by incorporating components such as Student-t distributions instead of Gaussians or by introducing explicit noise components. Bayesian priors can also mitigate the effects of extreme outliers. While these approaches may not achieve a non-zero breakdown point, they perform well in practice. A more comprehensive discussion of these alternatives would strengthen the paper.
In conclusion, this is a strong paper introducing a novel approach to mixing simple models in a regularized manner, with theoretical guarantees for robustness against outliers. However, the experimental evaluation is insufficient to fully validate the method. Expanding the experimental section would be challenging without sacrificing the theoretical results, but doing so would significantly enhance the paper.
