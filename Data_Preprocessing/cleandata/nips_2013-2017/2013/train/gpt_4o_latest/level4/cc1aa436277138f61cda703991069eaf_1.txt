The authors address the fundamental problem of determining the number of control questions required to assess workers' performance in a crowdsourcing task. They propose two methods for utilizing control questions. The first is a two-stage estimator that generates two estimates: one for the workers' biases and another for the bias-corrected estimate of the true label. For this approach, the authors demonstrate that minimizing the MSE of the estimator requires O(sqrt(L)) control questions per worker, where L denotes the number of labels provided by each worker.
The second method involves a joint estimator that simultaneously estimates both the workers' biases and the true labels. This model is more challenging to analyze, and the authors address this by linking the MSE to the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of the bipartite graph that connects items to workers. For this method, the bound on the number of control items is shown to be O(L/sqrt(n)), where n represents the total number of labeled items. Since the number of items assigned to each worker is ≤ n, this bound simplifies to O(sqrt(L)), making it significantly more efficient than the two-stage estimator in terms of control question usage as n → ∞. The joint estimator's performance heavily depends on the structure of the assignment graph connecting items to workers. Specifically, the derived bound holds when the assignment graph is an expander. Fortunately, random graphs are almost surely expanders, and a random L-regular assignment scheme suffices.
The paper concludes with realistic experiments that validate the theoretical results. Notably, the authors also explore scenarios where some of the assumptions underlying their derivations are violated. They find that while the joint estimator is more efficient in its use of control questions, it is less robust than the two-stage method when the model is mis-specified. The paper is well-written, though the proofs are somewhat concise for my preference, which is understandable given the page constraints.
Minor typo: In the conclusion section, line 371, O(L) should be corrected to O(sqrt(L)). Overall, I believe this paper presents significant and intriguing findings, and I recommend it for acceptance.
