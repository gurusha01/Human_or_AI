The paper introduces Stale Synchronous Parallel (SSP) computation for machine learning, presenting an implementation and, most notably, offering the first detailed analysis of its relationship to machine learning metrics. This analysis is specifically conducted in the context of SGD. Extensive experiments are provided to empirically validate the proposed approach.
The manuscript is exceptionally well-written and straightforward to follow. Reviewing it has been an enjoyable experienceâ€”thank you for that!
While my overall recommendation is to accept the paper, I would like to highlight a few points that could enhance the clarity of the exposition and its integration into related work. In my view, the primary contribution of the paper is not in proposing the use of SSP for machine learning. That connection, while perhaps somewhat intuitive, has been recognized previously, albeit more informally among practitioners rather than in academic literature.
The main contribution, in my opinion, lies in (a) conducting the work with rigor and (b), more critically, providing an analysis that links system-level parameters, such as staleness, to machine learning concepts like the convergence behavior of the learner. If possible, more emphasis should be placed on this analysis. The paper mentions that space constraints led to the exclusion of examples beyond SGD. If feasible, these examples should be included, either in the main text or as part of the appendix.
Finally, a minor critique: The claim on page 7, Line 376, that SSPtable is more general than Hadoop, comes across as somewhat simplistic. SSPtable is optimized for small incremental updates, whereas Hadoop is designed to handle large-scale object aggregation. Additionally, Hadoop includes a robust shuffle phase, which SSPtable does not require. I recommend softening this statement to better align with the otherwise precise and polished nature of the paper. 
Overall, this is an excellent paper that effectively bridges the gap between SSP and machine learning. The presentation and content are outstanding, making it an easy accept.
