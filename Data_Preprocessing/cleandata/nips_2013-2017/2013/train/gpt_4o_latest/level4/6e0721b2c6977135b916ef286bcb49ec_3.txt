Paraphrased Review: Near-optimal Distribution for Data Matrix Sampling
This paper introduces a novel sampling method for constructing (random) sparse matrices that closely approximate a given matrix in terms of the spectral norm. The authors make several well-justified assumptions, such as the properties of the "data matrix" and the constraints imposed by the computational model (e.g., streaming data). The paper is written in a clear and accessible manner, though certain topics, such as compressibility and fast indexing, are mentioned but not explicitly tied back to the proposed method. The authors begin by discussing the well-known L1 and L2 sampling schemes, which serve as benchmarks throughout the paper, before delving into the matrix Bernstein inequality and its relevance to sparse matrix sampling. The explanations are thorough and supported by intuitive arguments, making the work approachable even for non-specialists. However, the text occasionally becomes overly verbose, particularly in comparison to the concise experimental section. I suggest condensing these sections while retaining the core arguments and explanations.
The paper's primary contributions are Algorithm 1 and Theorem 2.2, which provides its theoretical foundation. However, Equation 6 and its derivation are somewhat challenging to follow. While certain properties (e.g., specific regimes for s: small, large) are discussed in the surrounding text, it would be helpful to more explicitly connect these to the Bernstein inequality, which ostensibly underpins the approach. Although Section 5 touches on this connection, the algebraic complexity and dense notation make it difficult to fully grasp. Strengthening the link between the simplified row-L1 distribution and the Bernstein inequality would enhance the clarity of the presentation. Despite these structural and clarity concerns, the results are significant, and the key idea, along with the execution of the proof and algorithmic details, is highly non-trivial.
In contrast, the experimental section and empirical analysis are underwhelming. First, the graphs in the printed version are illegible, which is frustrating. Second, the experimental analysis lacks depth and fails to explore any aspect in detail. Third, the paper does not establish connections to relevant applications. Fourth, the spectral norm objective is abruptly abandoned ("it turns out to be more fruitful to considerâ€¦") in favor of a new criterion based on projections onto the top singular vectors. The spectral norm objective is neither plotted nor mentioned again. Given the meticulous attention to detail in the theoretical section, this shift feels abrupt and unexpected. It raises the question of whether the objective should be revisited to address the "scaling" issue, for instance.
Overall, the paper provides a solid literature review and a creative approach that leverages the Bernstein inequality to derive improved sampling distributions. However, given the shortcomings in the experimental section and the lack of a deeper analysis beyond the proofs, I remain unconvinced of the definitive superiority of this method.
