A novel heuristic criterion is introduced for active label acquisition within the Gaussian Random Field (GRF) model for semi-supervised classification. The authors demonstrate that the so-called E-optimal criterion effectively minimizes the survey risk, as previously described by Garnett et al. I greatly appreciated the elegant theoretical properties (such as submodularity, which ensures near-optimality guarantees for greedy algorithms, and suppressor-free conditions) as well as the insights derived from the analysis (e.g., arguments based on the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality suggest that the criterion is inclined to select graph cluster centers rather than outliers). Empirically, the proposed approach outperforms most of the standard alternatives.
In summary, this is an excellent paper, offering sufficient novelty, strong theoretical foundations, clear explanations, and well-executed experiments, making it a solid contribution to NIPS.
