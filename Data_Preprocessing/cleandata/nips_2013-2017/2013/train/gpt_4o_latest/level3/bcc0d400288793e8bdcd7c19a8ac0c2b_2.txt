This paper extends the C-DAC model (Ahmad & Yu, 2013) by introducing a myopic approximation for cost-sensitive active sensing, aiming to reduce computational complexity while retaining context sensitivity. The authors compare the new model to Infomax (Butko & Movellan, 2010), which optimizes information gain but lacks task-specific cost considerations. The paper also presents experimental data from a human visual search task and evaluates the performance of C-DAC, myopic C-DAC, and Infomax against human behavior. While the study provides some insights into the trade-offs between computational efficiency and behavioral relevance, it has several critical shortcomings that limit its impact.
Strengths:  
The paper's main strength lies in its empirical comparison of multiple models, including the novel myopic C-DAC, and its use of human behavioral data to evaluate model performance. The authors also derive a theoretical stopping rule for Infomax, which is a valuable contribution. Furthermore, the exploration of confirmatory search phenomena and the context-sensitive nature of active sensing align with broader interests in computational neuroscience and machine learning. The inclusion of cost-sensitive decision-making is a meaningful step toward bridging theoretical models and real-world constraints.
Weaknesses:  
The paper suffers from limited novelty, as the myopic extension builds directly on Ahmad & Yu (2013) without a clear demonstration of its added value. The results show that myopic C-DAC performs similarly to the full C-DAC, raising questions about the necessity of this extension. Moreover, the paper fails to cite relevant prior work, such as Markant & Gureckis (2012), which also explores cost vs. information optimization. The writing is another significant weakness: the abstract is overly long, terminology is unclear, and the paper exceeds page limits, making it difficult to follow. Section 4 and the policy-space graphs are particularly opaque, hindering comprehension. Additionally, the rationale for focusing on confirmatory search phenomena is not well explained, and the experiment design lacks sufficient detail. Importantly, the model's performance is not compared to human behavior in a rigorous psychological context, limiting its relevance as a cognitive model.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:  
Pro:  
- Empirical comparison of multiple models.  
- Derivation of stopping rules for Infomax.  
- Exploration of context-sensitive active sensing.  
Con:  
- Limited novelty and unclear added value of the myopic extension.  
- Poor writing and organization.  
- Lack of citation of relevant prior work.  
- Weak experimental design and unclear connection to human behavior.  
Recommendation:  
The paper has potential but requires significant revisions. The authors should clarify the importance of the myopic extension, improve the writing and organization, cite relevant prior work, and provide a more rigorous comparison to human behavior. Without these changes, the paper does not meet the quality standards for acceptance.
