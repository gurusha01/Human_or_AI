This paper presents a novel statistical method for "stitching" together sequentially imaged sets of neurons, enabling the characterization of population dynamics across non-simultaneously recorded neurons. By framing the problem as fitting a latent dynamical system with missing observations, the authors propose a simple linear Gaussian dynamical system with four parameters estimated using a variant of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. The method is validated on both simulated and experimental calcium imaging data from mouse somatosensory cortex, demonstrating its ability to infer noise correlations between non-simultaneously recorded neuron pairs. This approach addresses a critical limitation in current imaging techniques and has the potential to significantly expand the scale of neural population dynamics that can be studied.
Strengths
The paper makes a strong and original contribution to the field by addressing a fundamental limitation in neural imagingâ€”namely, the inability to simultaneously record from large populations of neurons. The proposed method is novel in its ability to infer functional connections between non-simultaneously imaged neurons, a capability not addressed by prior work. The authors provide a thorough validation of their method on both simulated and real datasets, demonstrating its robustness and practical utility. The results are particularly compelling, as the method achieves high accuracy in predicting noise correlations and neural activity across non-simultaneously recorded populations, outperforming a naive baseline approach. The paper is well-written and organized, making the methodology and results accessible to the reader. Additionally, the significance of the work is clear, as it offers a pathway to study neural circuits at scales previously unattainable with current imaging technologies.
Weaknesses
While the paper is technically sound, there are a few areas for improvement. First, the method relies on population overlap for accurate stitching, and the authors do not fully explore the trade-offs between overlap and total coverage in experimental design. This is an important consideration for practical applications. Second, the figures, while informative, lack sufficient description in the legends and are not adequately elaborated upon in the text, which may hinder comprehension for some readers. Additionally, the authors acknowledge that their linear Gaussian model is a simplification and does not capture the full complexity of neural dynamics, such as nonlinearities and spiking activity. While this is a reasonable trade-off for computational tractability, it would be valuable to discuss how more sophisticated models could be integrated into their framework.
Arguments for Acceptance
1. Novelty: The method is highly original and addresses a critical gap in the field.
2. Significance: The work has the potential to significantly advance the study of neural circuits by enabling the analysis of larger populations of neurons.
3. Technical Soundness: The method is rigorously developed and validated on both simulated and real data.
4. Potential for Impact: The approach could be widely adopted by neuroscientists, given its practical utility and relevance to current experimental limitations.
Arguments Against Acceptance
1. Dependence on Overlap: The method's reliance on population overlap raises questions about its scalability to larger datasets with minimal overlap.
2. Simplistic Model: The use of a linear Gaussian model may limit the method's applicability to more complex neural dynamics.
3. Clarity of Presentation: The insufficiently detailed figures and legends detract from the overall clarity of the paper.
Overall Assessment
This is a strong paper that makes a meaningful contribution to the field of computational neuroscience. While there are some limitations, they do not detract significantly from the overall quality and impact of the work. I recommend acceptance, with minor revisions to improve the clarity of the figures and to further discuss the implications of population overlap and model simplifications.
