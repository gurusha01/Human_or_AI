The paper presents a novel algorithm for normalized cuts on hypergraphs, leveraging a ratio of convex functions solved via RatioDCA and a primal-dual method. It extends this framework to semi-supervised learning (SSL) on hypergraphs, formulating it as a related optimization problem. The proposed method demonstrates superior performance compared to existing techniques on multiple datasets for SSL, clustering, and cut objectives. The paper is technically sound, well-written, and makes a significant contribution to hypergraph-based learning, particularly by addressing limitations of prior approaches that rely on graph approximations or tensor methods.
Strengths:
1. Technical Innovation: The paper introduces a family of regularization functionals based on the total variation on hypergraphs, which interpolates between total variation and Laplacian-type regularization. This is a novel and theoretically grounded approach that fully utilizes hypergraph structure.
2. Algorithmic Contributions: The use of RatioDCA for optimizing balanced hypergraph cuts and the primal-dual algorithm for solving convex optimization problems are well-executed and scalable.
3. Experimental Validation: The proposed method outperforms existing techniques in SSL and clustering tasks, particularly on datasets where hypergraph structure is meaningful. The experiments demonstrate the advantages of directly working with hypergraph cuts over approximations like clique expansion.
4. Clarity and Organization: The paper is clearly written, with detailed explanations of the mathematical foundations, algorithms, and experimental results. The supplementary material provides additional proofs and algorithmic details.
Weaknesses:
1. Relevance of Hypergraphs: While the paper highlights the benefits of hypergraphs, it provides limited discussion on when hypergraphs are a better choice than vectors or regular graphs for data representation. This could help readers better understand the practical applicability of the method.
2. Semi-Supervised Learning Context: The relevance of SSL to the datasets is not fully addressed, particularly the performance of the method without unlabeled samples. This raises questions about the robustness of the approach in real-world scenarios.
3. Title Misalignment: The title emphasizes "total variation," but this is not the central focus of the paper. A more precise title could better reflect the contributions.
4. Clarity in Problem Formulation: The semi-supervised problem (Equation 3) and its relationship to the proposed algorithm could be clarified to avoid confusion for readers unfamiliar with the context.
Pro vs. Con for Acceptance:
- Pro: The paper makes a significant contribution to hypergraph-based learning, introduces novel algorithms, and demonstrates strong empirical results.
- Con: Limited discussion on the practical relevance of hypergraphs and SSL in the datasets, along with minor clarity issues.
Recommendation: Accept with minor revisions. The paper advances the state of the art in hypergraph cuts and SSL, and its contributions are likely to inspire further research in this area. Addressing the weaknesses, particularly the practical relevance of hypergraphs and SSL, would strengthen the paper further.
