The paper presents a novel theoretical framework for matrix completion that leverages side information to significantly reduce the sample complexity required for perfect recovery of low-rank matrices. By incorporating side information matrices \( A \) and \( B \), the authors demonstrate that the number of observed entries can be reduced from \( O(r(n+m)\ln^2(n+m)) \) to \( O(r(ra + rb)\ln(ra + rb)\ln(n+m)) \), where \( ra \) and \( rb \) are the dimensions of the side information matrices. This reduction is validated both theoretically and empirically, with applications to transductive incomplete multi-label learning. The proposed Maxide algorithm is shown to be computationally efficient and effective in both synthetic and real-world datasets.
Strengths:
1. Theoretical Contribution: The paper provides a rigorous theoretical analysis of matrix completion with side information, introducing a significant improvement in sample complexity. The results are well-supported by a clear derivation of theorems and coherence measures.
2. Practical Relevance: The application to transductive incomplete multi-label learning is compelling, as it addresses a real-world problem where side information (e.g., feature vectors and label correlations) is often available.
3. Empirical Validation: Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The results highlight both the accuracy and computational efficiency of the Maxide algorithm compared to state-of-the-art methods.
4. Efficiency: The reduction in computational cost by solving a smaller optimization problem involving \( ra \times rb \) matrices instead of \( n \times m \) matrices is a notable advantage, particularly for large-scale problems.
Weaknesses:
1. Assumptions on Orthonormality: The proof assumes \( A \) and \( B \) are orthonormal matrices, but the paper does not adequately address the implications when these matrices are not orthogonal. A discussion on how to handle non-orthogonal side information or a generalization of the proof would strengthen the contribution.
2. Comparison with Prior Work: Problem (3) closely resembles the optimization problem in Bach (2008). A direct comparison with Bach's algorithm and consistency results would provide a clearer picture of the advancements made by this work.
3. Conflicting Claims: The claim about performance guarantees in the second paragraph conflicts with prior work, such as Jaggi and Sulovsky (2010), which provides efficient algorithms with convergence guarantees. This discrepancy should be clarified.
4. Typographical Error: There is a typo in the proof of Lemma 1 in the supplementary material (missing \( \perp \) in line 063), which should be corrected for clarity.
5. Limited Discussion on Related Work: While the paper cites relevant studies, it does not sufficiently differentiate its approach from prior work on matrix factorization techniques that also utilize side information.
Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Clarify the implications of non-orthonormal side information matrices and provide a simplified explanation using linear combinations of \( A \) and \( B \)'s column vectors.
2. Include a detailed comparison with Bach (2008) and other related works to highlight the novelty and advantages of the proposed method.
3. Resolve the conflicting claims about performance guarantees and provide a more nuanced discussion of the trade-offs between computational efficiency and recovery guarantees.
4. Correct the typographical error in the supplementary material and ensure all proofs are clear and complete.
Recommendation:
The paper makes a significant theoretical and practical contribution to the field of matrix completion and multi-label learning. However, the issues outlined above, particularly the lack of clarity regarding non-orthonormal side information and insufficient comparisons with prior work, need to be addressed. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address these concerns.
