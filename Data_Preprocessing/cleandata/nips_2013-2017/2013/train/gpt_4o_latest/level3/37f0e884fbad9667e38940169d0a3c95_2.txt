The paper introduces a novel hybrid optimization algorithm, Epoch Mixed Gradient Descent (EMGD), aimed at addressing the computational inefficiency of gradient-based methods for smooth and strongly convex optimization problems with high condition numbers. By combining full and stochastic gradients, EMGD achieves a high-probability convergence rate of \(O(\log(1/\epsilon))\) for full gradients, independent of the condition number \(\kappa\). This is a significant theoretical improvement over traditional methods, which scale as \(O(\sqrt{\kappa} \log(1/\epsilon))\). The algorithm is particularly relevant for large-scale optimization problems where computing full gradients is computationally expensive.
Strengths:  
1. Theoretical Contribution: The paper provides a rigorous theoretical analysis demonstrating that EMGD reduces the dependency on \(\kappa\) for full gradients, a notable advancement in optimization theory.  
2. Novelty: The mixed gradient approach, which interleaves deterministic and stochastic gradients, is an interesting and potentially impactful idea.  
3. High-Probability Guarantees: Unlike some prior methods that only guarantee convergence in expectation, EMGD provides high-probability convergence bounds, which is a stronger result.  
4. Flexibility: The algorithm is applicable to both constrained and unconstrained optimization problems, which broadens its potential use cases.  
Weaknesses:  
1. Dependence on Known Condition Number: A major limitation is the assumption that the condition number \(\kappa\) is perfectly known. The paper does not address how to estimate \(\kappa\) in practice, which limits the algorithm's applicability.  
2. Lack of Experimental Validation: The paper does not include empirical results to validate the theoretical claims or compare EMGD with existing methods such as SGD, averaged SGD, or SAG. This omission weakens the practical significance of the work.  
3. Misspecified Hyper-Parameters: The theoretical analysis does not account for cases where \(\kappa\) or other hyper-parameters are misspecified, which is a common scenario in real-world applications.  
4. Limited Scope: The analysis is restricted to strongly convex problems, leaving out non-strongly convex settings, which are also critical in optimization.  
5. Insufficient Related Work Discussion: The paper overlooks prior work on hybrid deterministic-stochastic methods, such as Friedlander and Schmidt (2012), and does not compare convergence rates with these methods.  
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:  
- Pro: Theoretical novelty, strong convergence guarantees, and potential applicability to large-scale optimization problems.  
- Con: Lack of empirical validation, reliance on impractical assumptions (e.g., known \(\kappa\)), and incomplete exploration of related work and alternative methods.  
Recommendation:  
While the theoretical contributions are significant, the lack of experimental validation and practical considerations (e.g., estimating \(\kappa\)) are major shortcomings. The paper would benefit from empirical studies comparing EMGD with standard methods and addressing the challenges of estimating \(\kappa\). Additionally, a more comprehensive discussion of related work is necessary. I recommend rejecting the paper in its current form but encourage the authors to address these issues for future submissions.
