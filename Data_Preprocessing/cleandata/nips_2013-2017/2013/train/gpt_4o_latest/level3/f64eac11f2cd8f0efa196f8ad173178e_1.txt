The paper presents a novel approach to adaptively determining the step size in policy gradient methods by maximizing a lower bound on expected policy improvement. This is a significant theoretical contribution, as step size selection is critical to the performance of policy gradient methods, yet it has received limited attention in prior research. The proposed method is particularly compelling because it computes the step size with the same computational complexity as ordinary policy gradient methods, relying only on the estimated gradient. This makes it a practical alternative to more computationally expensive methods like Newton's method.
The paper assumes a fixed standard deviation for Gaussian policies to derive the lower bound, which is a reasonable simplification for theoretical analysis. However, this assumption may limit the method's applicability to more complex policy models. The experimental results demonstrate that the method performs well when the fixed standard deviation is sufficiently large, but the paper does not explore the impact of this assumption in scenarios with small or varying standard deviations. This is a potential limitation that warrants further investigation.
The paper is well-written, clearly organized, and provides a thorough theoretical analysis. The derivation of the lower bound and its closed-form solution for Gaussian policies is rigorous and original. However, the paper would benefit from the addition of a conclusion section to summarize the key findings and discuss future directions. Furthermore, while the experimental results are promising, they are limited in scope. The paper compares the proposed method primarily against baseline policy gradient methods but lacks comparisons with state-of-the-art approaches like expectation-maximization (EM) policy search. Including such comparisons would strengthen the empirical validation of the method.
Another area requiring clarification is the convergence behavior with a single update for \(\sigma=5\), as shown in Table 1. It is unclear whether this result generalizes to other scenarios or is specific to the experimental setup.
In summary, the paper makes a valuable contribution to the field by addressing a critical yet underexplored problem in policy gradient methods. Its strengths lie in its theoretical rigor, practical computational complexity, and clear presentation. However, the paper would benefit from broader experimental comparisons, a conclusion section, and clarification of certain results. Overall, the method shows promise as a practical and theoretically sound alternative for adaptive step size selection in policy gradient methods.
