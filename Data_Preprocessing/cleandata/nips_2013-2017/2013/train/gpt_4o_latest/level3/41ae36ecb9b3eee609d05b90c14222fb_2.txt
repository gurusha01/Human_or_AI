This paper addresses a significant problem in machine learning and signal processing by establishing the linear convergence of the proximal gradient method (PGM) for trace norm-regularized problems under weaker assumptions than strong convexity. The authors leverage a novel Lipschitzian error bound, resolving a previously open question regarding its applicability to the nuclear norm case. This contribution is both technically rigorous and practically relevant, as it broadens the applicability of PGM to a wider class of loss functions commonly used in machine learning, such as square and logistic losses.
The paper builds on Tseng's Lipschitzian error bound framework and extends it to the trace norm case, overcoming challenges posed by the non-polyhedral epigraph of the trace norm. The authors provide a detailed proof of the error bound and demonstrate its implications for the linear convergence of PGM. The technical depth of the paper is commendable, particularly the use of matrix perturbation theory to analyze the spectral structure of points near the optimal solution set. The numerical experiments further validate the theoretical findings, showcasing linear convergence in both matrix completion and classification tasks.
However, the paper has some weaknesses. First, it lacks a direct comparison to the vector case of ℓ1-norm regularization. Such a comparison would clarify the relationship between the two cases and highlight why techniques for ℓ1 regularization cannot be directly applied to the trace norm case. Second, the title could be revised to better reflect the contribution, as the flexibility introduced by the linear operator affects the loss function rather than the regularizer. Third, minor issues include clarifying terms like "sampling operator," fixing a broken reference, and providing a more intuitive explanation of "Q-" and "R-" linear convergence. Additionally, the technical proof of Lemma 3.2, while thorough, could benefit from a more concise discussion and clearer conclusions to balance its complexity.
In summary, the paper makes a strong theoretical contribution by resolving an open question and advancing the understanding of PGM's convergence properties for trace norm-regularized problems. Its strengths lie in its technical rigor and practical relevance, but its clarity and scope could be improved with additional comparisons and refinements.
