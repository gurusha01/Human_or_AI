The paper presents a novel application of compressed sensing (CS) techniques to calcium imaging, aiming to improve the scalability of neural population imaging. By leveraging randomized projections of spatial calcium concentrations and exploiting the sparsity of neural spiking, the proposed framework demonstrates the potential to significantly reduce the number of measurements required per timestep, thereby enabling faster imaging of larger populations. The authors introduce a simple linear model with autoregressive temporal dependence and binary spikes, accompanied by two reconstruction algorithms—one of which estimates neuron locations using rank-penalized matrix factorization. This work builds on prior applications of CS in imaging domains such as MRI and fluorescence microscopy, extending it to 2-photon calcium imaging for the first time.
Strengths:  
The paper is highly original, introducing a transformative idea that could dramatically scale neural population imaging. The theoretical analysis, particularly the use of statistical dimensions to characterize phase transitions in reconstruction performance, is rigorous and insightful. The authors provide a clear demonstration of the potential for significant undersampling, achieving up to a 10× reduction in measurements while maintaining robust reconstruction. The scalability of the proposed methods, with computational complexity scaling linearly with experiment length, is another notable strength. Additionally, the inclusion of both known and unknown neuron location cases broadens the applicability of the framework.
Weaknesses:  
Despite its promise, the paper feels disjointed in its presentation. The frequent switching between the 'known' and 'unknown' neuron location cases detracts from the clarity and focus. A more in-depth exploration of the 'known locations' case, which is more experimentally feasible, would strengthen the paper. The use of ±1 weights in the imaging matrix raises practical concerns about the feasibility of "negative imaging" in real-world setups, which the authors do not fully address. Furthermore, while the theoretical analysis is sound, there is a disconnect between the theory and simulation results, leaving the applicability to real-world data uncertain. Sparse but synchronized neural activity, a common biological scenario, is not adequately explored, and the paper does not address potential challenges such as motion artifacts in vivo.
Clarity:  
The paper is dense and could benefit from better organization and clearer exposition of key ideas. Simplifying the presentation and focusing on fewer, well-explained points would make the work more accessible. Additionally, some technical details, such as the practical implementation of the imaging matrix, are underexplained.
Significance:  
If successfully implemented, the proposed framework could revolutionize calcium imaging by enabling the monitoring of larger neural populations at higher temporal resolutions. However, the speculative nature of the results, combined with the lack of validation on real-world data, tempers its immediate impact.
Arguments for Acceptance:  
- Novel and potentially transformative application of CS to calcium imaging.  
- Rigorous theoretical analysis with clear potential for significant undersampling.  
- Scalable algorithms with linear computational complexity.  
Arguments Against Acceptance:  
- Practical feasibility of the imaging matrix and real-world applicability remain unaddressed.  
- Disjointed focus and lack of clarity in presentation.  
- Sparse synchrony and motion correction challenges are insufficiently explored.  
Recommendation:  
The paper is a strong candidate for acceptance due to its originality and potential impact, but revisions to improve clarity, focus, and practical considerations are essential.
