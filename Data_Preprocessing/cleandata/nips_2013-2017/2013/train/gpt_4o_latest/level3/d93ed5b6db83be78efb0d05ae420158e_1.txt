The paper introduces a novel application of determinantal point processes (DPPs) to model inhibitory interactions in neural spike train data, extending the generalized linear model (GLM) framework. The authors propose a maximum likelihood approach using stochastic gradient descent and demonstrate the model's utility in capturing inhibitory relationships, gain control, and periodic modulation in both simulated and real-world neural data. While the idea is intriguing and potentially impactful, several concerns limit its clarity and significance.
Strengths:
The paper addresses an important problem in computational neuroscience: modeling complex inhibitory interactions in neural populations. The use of DPPs is innovative, offering a tractable way to model anti-correlations that are challenging for traditional methods like GLMs. The empirical results on simulated data and rat hippocampal recordings are promising, showing that the model captures known biological phenomena such as the dichotomy between pyramidal cells and interneurons and their modulation by the theta rhythm. Additionally, the incorporation of gain control and periodic modulation is a thoughtful extension that aligns with observed neural dynamics.
The authors provide a detailed mathematical formulation and empirical validation, showcasing the model's ability to outperform coupled GLMs in spike prediction tasks. The visualization of latent embeddings and periodic components adds interpretability, a valuable feature for neuroscientific applications.
Weaknesses:
Despite its novelty, the paper lacks clarity in several key areas. The description of the kernel function and gain control mechanism is insufficiently detailed, making it difficult for readers to reproduce the results. Additionally, the historical context of GLMs is inaccurately presented, and the paper does not adequately compare its approach to alternative models, such as state-space models or pseudo-likelihood methods, which are known to handle correlations effectively.
The significance of using DPPs over simpler approaches, such as GLMs with coupling or periodic terms, is not convincingly demonstrated. While the rebuttal provides additional model comparison results, these are limited in scope. The paper does not explore whether GLM-like models could achieve similar performance with less computational complexity, especially given the cubic scaling of DPPs with the number of neurons.
Recommendations:
To strengthen the paper, the authors should:
1. Provide a more comprehensive comparison with alternative models, including GLMs with coupling and state-space models, to justify the added complexity of DPPs.
2. Clarify the details of the kernel function, gain control mechanism, and periodic modulation to improve reproducibility.
3. Address inaccuracies in the historical context of GLMs and better position the work within the existing literature.
4. Explore extensions, such as incorporating spiking history or modeling excitatory interactions, to enhance the model's applicability.
Decision:
While the paper presents an interesting and novel approach, the lack of clarity and insufficient comparison with existing methods limit its impact. I recommend a weak reject but encourage the authors to address these issues for future submission.
