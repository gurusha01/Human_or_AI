The paper presents a significant advancement in privacy-preserving data release by generalizing k-anonymity to the b-matching framework, addressing the adaptive anonymity problem where individuals specify their desired privacy levels. This work is particularly noteworthy for its ability to accommodate heterogeneous anonymity levels, a limitation of traditional k-anonymity, and for providing strong theoretical privacy guarantees under both single and sustained attacks.
The authors effectively formalize the adaptive anonymity problem and introduce two novel algorithms for symmetric and asymmetric b-matching. These algorithms are computationally efficient and demonstrate superior utility compared to existing methods, such as agglomerative clustering, as evidenced by the experimental results on benchmark and social datasets. The proposed algorithms minimize data suppression while ensuring compatibility between original and obfuscated datasets, achieving better utility without compromising privacy. The theoretical analysis, including resilience to attacks and privacy guarantees, is rigorous and well-supported. The use of bipartite graph structures and variational approximations is innovative and extends the applicability of k-anonymity to more flexible and practical scenarios.
The paper is well-written, with a clear exposition of the problem, methodology, and results. The introduction provides a strong motivation for the work, and the experimental section convincingly demonstrates the practical benefits of the proposed approach. The ability to handle both uniform and adaptive anonymity settings further underscores the generality of the method. Additionally, the theoretical guarantees for privacy, including resilience to k-clique constructions and sustained attacks, are a valuable contribution to the field.
However, there are some areas for improvement. The approximation factor in Theorem 1 is relatively weak, and a more detailed explanation of the variational upper bounds would strengthen the theoretical contributions. Additionally, minor issues such as the wording in certain sections and the clarity of Definition 4.1 should be addressed to improve readability.
In terms of originality, the paper introduces a novel relaxation of k-anonymity using b-matching, which is a meaningful contribution to privacy-preserving data release. The work is highly significant as it advances the state of the art by providing a practical and flexible alternative to existing privacy notions. The experimental results demonstrate the potential for real-world applications, particularly in scenarios requiring personalized privacy levels.
