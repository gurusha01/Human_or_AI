The paper introduces two novel methods for density ratio estimation, formulated as Type I and Type II Fredholm equations, leveraging regularization techniques. The first method employs importance sampling with LÂ² norm regularization and RKHS terms, while the second utilizes a kernel with a locality parameter to ensure consistency. The authors provide theoretical convergence results and experimental validations, demonstrating the effectiveness of their proposed methods. A significant contribution is the introduction of Cross-Density Cross-Validation (CD-CV), enabling parameter selection for density ratio estimation, which addresses a key challenge in unsupervised learning.
Strengths:  
The paper makes a substantial contribution by framing density ratio estimation as a classical inverse problem using Fredholm equations. This novel formulation connects the problem to established tools in spectral and Fourier analysis, offering a principled framework for algorithm development. The use of RKHS-based regularization provides flexibility and stability, and the proposed methods outperform existing alternatives like Kernel Mean Matching (KMM) and LSIF in computational efficiency and accuracy. The introduction of CD-CV is particularly noteworthy, as it addresses the lack of unsupervised model selection techniques in density ratio estimation. The experimental results are robust, covering diverse datasets and resampling scenarios, and the theoretical analysis, including convergence rates and error bounds, adds rigor to the work.
Weaknesses:  
While the paper is technically sound, the convergence rate derived in Theorem 1 is slow, and stronger assumptions on the density ratio (q/p) or the operator spectrum could potentially yield polynomial rates. The assumption that q/p belongs to a "nice" function class, such as Sobolev spaces, is restrictive and warrants further discussion on its practical implications and limitations. Additionally, the supplementary materials contain numerous typos and errors, making it challenging to verify the theoretical results. This detracts from the clarity and reproducibility of the work. The paper could also benefit from a more detailed comparison with related methods, particularly in terms of computational complexity and scalability to high-dimensional data.
Pro Acceptance:  
- Novel formulation of density ratio estimation as an inverse problem.  
- Rigorous theoretical analysis with convergence guarantees.  
- Introduction of CD-CV for unsupervised parameter selection.  
- Strong experimental performance compared to existing methods.
Con Acceptance:  
- Slow convergence rates and restrictive assumptions.  
- Errors in supplementary materials hinder reproducibility.  
- Limited discussion on scalability and computational complexity.
Recommendation:  
The paper addresses a significant problem in unsupervised learning with a novel and principled approach, supported by theoretical and experimental evidence. While there are some limitations, the contributions outweigh the weaknesses. I recommend acceptance, provided the authors address the issues in the supplementary materials and discuss the practical implications of their assumptions.
