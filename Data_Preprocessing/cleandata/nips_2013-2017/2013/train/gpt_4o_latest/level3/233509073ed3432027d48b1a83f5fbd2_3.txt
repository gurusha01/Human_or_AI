The paper addresses the critical and often overlooked problem of structure learning for Structural Equation Models (SEMs) in time-dependent, locally i.i.d. data environments. This is a significant contribution, as most existing algorithms assume globally stationary generative processes, which are not representative of many real-world scenarios. The proposed Locally Stationary Structure Tracker (LoSST) algorithm is a novel heuristic approach that enables online structure learning by dynamically updating sufficient statistics and adapting to changes in the underlying data-generating structure. This work fills an important gap in the field and has the potential to inspire further research on dynamic graphical models.
The manuscript is well-written and organized, making the technical content accessible to readers. The authors provide a clear explanation of the LoSST algorithm, its theoretical underpinnings, and its practical implementation using the PC algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness in both synthetic and real-world scenarios, particularly in detecting and adapting to structural changes. The comparison with batch-mode learning highlights the advantages of LoSST in dynamic environments, while its comparable performance in stable settings ensures its general applicability.
However, there are several areas where the paper could be improved. First, the assertion that other standard graphical model structure learning algorithms would perform similarly to LoSST is too strong and lacks sufficient justification. This claim should either be supported with additional experimental evidence or rephrased to reflect its speculative nature. Second, the difficulty of extending the proposed approach to Bayesian networks due to challenges with sufficient statistics is only mentioned in the discussion. This limitation should be disclosed earlier in the manuscript to clarify the scope of the work. Third, while the focus on SEMs is appropriate, the framing could be sharpened by explicitly acknowledging the challenges and potential extensions to other types of graphical models, such as Bayesian networks or Markov random fields.
The experimental results are promising but limited in scope, as they rely solely on the PC method for structure learning. Exploring alternative structure learning algorithms could strengthen the paper's claims about the generality of LoSST. Additionally, while the real-world application to U.S. price index data is compelling, further validation on diverse datasets would enhance the paper's significance.
Pros:
1. Addresses an important and underexplored problem in dynamic structure learning.
2. Proposes a novel, efficient algorithm with theoretical and practical contributions.
3. Demonstrates strong performance in both synthetic and real-world scenarios.
4. Well-written and accessible to readers.
Cons:
1. Overgeneralized claim about the performance of other algorithms.
2. Scope limitations (e.g., challenges with Bayesian networks) disclosed too late.
3. Experimental validation is limited to the PC method and a single real-world dataset.
In summary, the paper is a strong contribution to the field of dynamic graphical models, but it would benefit from a more nuanced discussion of its limitations and broader experimental validation. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions.
