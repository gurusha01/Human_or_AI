The paper addresses the problem of estimating the density ratio \( q/p \), a critical task in applications such as importance sampling and covariate shift in transfer learning. The authors propose a novel framework based on reformulating the problem as a Fredholm integral equation of the first kind, solved using regularization techniques within the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) framework. The resulting Fredholm Inverse Regularized Estimator (FIRE) algorithms are theoretically analyzed and experimentally validated. The paper also introduces an unsupervised parameter selection method, Cross-Density Cross-Validation (CD-CV), and demonstrates its utility in various settings.
Strengths:
1. Theoretical Contributions: The paper provides a principled formulation of density ratio estimation as an inverse problem, leveraging classical operator theory and regularization techniques. The detailed theoretical analysis, including convergence rates and error bounds for Gaussian kernels, is a significant strength.
2. Algorithmic Simplicity and Flexibility: The FIRE algorithms are simple, computationally efficient, and easy to implement, with explicit solutions derived via the representer theorem.
3. Novel Parameter Selection: The CD-CV method is a valuable contribution, addressing a challenging issue in unsupervised and semi-supervised learning. Its practical utility is demonstrated through experiments.
4. Experimental Validation: The authors provide extensive experimental results, comparing FIRE to existing methods like LSIF and TIKDE. The results show strong performance and computational efficiency, particularly in regression and classification tasks under covariate shift.
5. Relevance: The problem is timely and important, with applications in transfer learning and statistical inference. The connections to classical analysis and kernel methods enrich the machine learning literature.
Weaknesses:
1. Cost Function Motivation: The choice of the combined \( L{2,p} \) and \( L{2,q} \) cost function requires clearer justification and linkage to practical applications. While the flexibility is appreciated, the rationale for this particular combination is underexplored.
2. Dimensionality Dependence: The convergence rates depend on the dimensionality of the underlying space, but the practical implications for high-dimensional settings are not thoroughly discussed. This could limit the applicability of the method in real-world scenarios.
3. Smoothness Regularization: The relationship between the smoothness of \( q/p \) and the smoothness of \( q \) and \( p \) is mentioned but not deeply explored. This could provide additional insights into the method's theoretical underpinnings.
4. Convergence Intuition: While the paper provides intuitive reasoning for convergence in the Type II setting, a similar argument for Type I would strengthen the theoretical contributions.
5. Test Function Family: The choice of test functions \( \{k(x, \cdot)\} \) is not well-motivated. A stronger rationale or exploration of alternative families could enhance the paper.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper addresses a significant problem with a novel and theoretically grounded approach.
- The theoretical contributions, including convergence guarantees and error bounds, are rigorous and well-presented.
- The FIRE algorithms and CD-CV method are practical and demonstrate strong empirical performance.
- The work is timely and relevant to the NIPS community, with connections to kernel methods, transfer learning, and statistical inference.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The motivation for key design choices, such as the cost function and test function family, is insufficiently clear.
- The discussion on dimensionality dependence and high-dimensional applicability is limited.
- The smoothness assumptions and their implications are not fully explored.
Recommendation:
Overall, this is a strong and well-executed paper that makes a meaningful contribution to the field. While there are areas for improvement, the strengths outweigh the weaknesses. I recommend acceptance, with minor revisions to address the clarity and motivation of key design choices.
