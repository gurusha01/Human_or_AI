This paper investigates convex norm-regularized optimization methods for low-rank tensor factorization, focusing on the "latent" Schatten norm and its comparison to the "overlap" Schatten norm. The authors provide theoretical bounds for the mean-squared-error (MSE) behavior of the latent norm, demonstrating its superiority over the overlap norm under various noise assumptions. The paper also introduces a generalization of these norms and proves a duality theorem, connecting the latent and overlap norms. Numerical simulations validate the theoretical findings, confirming that the latent approach performs better in scenarios where the underlying tensor is low-rank in a specific mode.
Strengths:
1. Theoretical Rigor: The paper is technically sound, with well-supported theoretical contributions. The derivation of MSE bounds and the duality theorem are significant additions to the literature on structured sparsity and tensor decomposition.
2. Empirical Validation: Numerical experiments align with the theoretical predictions, strengthening the paper's claims about the latent norm's performance.
3. Novel Insights: The paper provides a clear explanation of why the latent norm outperforms the overlap norm in certain cases, particularly when the tensor is low-rank in a specific mode.
4. Connection to Broader Literature: The work effectively links tensor decomposition methods to structured sparsity research, broadening its relevance.
Weaknesses:
1. Incremental Contribution: While the theoretical results are solid, the paper's focus is narrow and incremental. It primarily refines existing methods rather than introducing fundamentally new algorithms or practical applications.
2. Lack of Lower Bounds: The absence of lower bounds for the derived upper bounds raises concerns about the completeness of the theoretical analysis, particularly for algorithm comparisons.
3. Abstract Misleading: The abstract suggests a broader contribution, including new algorithms and experimental analyses for generalized norms, which are not present in the paper.
4. Clarity Issues: Figure 1 is introduced prematurely, making it difficult to interpret without the necessary context provided later in the paper. Additionally, minor grammatical and phrasing issues detract from the paper's readability.
5. Limited Practical Relevance: The paper's contributions are primarily theoretical, with limited discussion of real-world machine learning applications or practical implications.
Recommendation:
While the paper is technically sound and provides valuable theoretical insights, its narrow focus and limited practical relevance reduce its impact. The lack of lower bounds and the misleading abstract further weaken its contribution. However, the rigorous analysis and empirical validation are strengths. I recommend acceptance with major revisions, focusing on improving clarity, addressing the lack of lower bounds, and aligning the abstract with the actual contributions.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Solid theoretical contributions with empirical validation.
- Advances understanding of tensor decomposition methods.
- Connects tensor norms to structured sparsity literature.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Incremental and narrow focus with limited novelty.
- Lack of lower bounds undermines algorithmic comparisons.
- Misleading abstract and clarity issues in presentation.
In summary, the paper is a valuable theoretical contribution but would benefit from revisions to enhance clarity, scope, and alignment with practical applications.
