The paper provides a rigorous and insightful study of minimax bounds for probability estimation under local privacy constraints, focusing on multinomial and density estimation problems. It establishes sharp minimax rates of convergence for both settings, revealing significant trade-offs between privacy and statistical efficiency. Specifically, the results demonstrate that local privacy causes a quadratic reduction in effective sample size for multinomial estimation, while for density estimation, the optimal non-private rates are unattainable under privacy constraints. The novel minimax bounds for density estimation under privacy constraints are particularly noteworthy, and the proofs appear to be correct and well-constructed.
Strengths:  
The paper makes a significant theoretical contribution by bridging minimax decision theory and differential privacy, providing a formal framework to quantify the trade-offs between privacy and statistical efficiency. The results are sharp and supported by both lower and upper bounds, with efficient algorithms achieving the stated rates. The analysis of multinomial estimation highlights the optimality of Warner's randomized response mechanism, a classical method, under local privacy constraints. For density estimation, the paper introduces innovative techniques, such as orthogonal series estimators, to achieve optimal rates. These contributions advance the understanding of privacy-preserving statistical inference and provide a foundation for future work in this area. The paper is well-written, with clear mathematical exposition and detailed proofs.
Weaknesses:  
The paper lacks sufficient contextualization of its contributions relative to prior work. While it references foundational studies on differential privacy, it misses key related works on noise complexity lower bounds, such as Hardt & Talwar (2010) and De (2012). The multinomial estimation problem is a special case of linear counting queries, yet the paper does not clarify whether its bounds improve over existing results for differential privacy. Additionally, the density estimation results rely on the trigonometric basis, but the validity of comparing non-private lower bounds to this basis is unclear. The paper would benefit from including references such as Nikolov, Talwar, and Zhang (2013), which discuss Mean Square Error in differential privacy, to better situate its findings within the broader literature.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:  
Pros:  
- Novel and rigorous theoretical contributions to privacy-preserving estimation.  
- Sharp minimax rates with correct proofs and efficient algorithms.  
- Advances understanding of trade-offs between privacy and statistical efficiency.  
- Well-written and organized.  
Cons:  
- Insufficient discussion of related work and prior results.  
- Lack of clarity in some comparisons, particularly for density estimation.  
- Missed opportunity to connect findings to broader differential privacy literature.  
Conclusion:  
This paper is a strong contribution to the field of privacy-preserving statistical inference, with novel results and rigorous analysis. However, its lack of contextualization relative to prior work is a notable weakness. I recommend acceptance, contingent on the authors addressing these gaps by discussing related work and clarifying the scope of their contributions.
