This paper investigates the convergence properties of the proximal gradient method (PGM) for trace norm-regularized optimization problems, demonstrating that the algorithm achieves an asymptotic linear convergence rate under relaxed strong convexity assumptions. The authors utilize a novel Lipschitzian error bound framework, extending the applicability of PGM to a broader class of loss functions commonly encountered in machine learning. The key technical contribution lies in the use of a simultaneous diagonalization technique for matrices, which simplifies the proof by reducing it to the vector case.
Strengths:
1. Technical Contribution: The paper provides a rigorous theoretical analysis and proves that PGM converges linearly without requiring strong convexity of the loss function. This is a meaningful extension of existing results, as strong convexity is often absent in practical machine learning problems. The use of a Lipschitzian error bound framework is a significant technical achievement.
2. Novel Observation: The simultaneous diagonalization of matrices is an elegant and novel contribution. This technique not only simplifies the proof but also resolves an open question about error bounds for trace norm regularization.
3. Clarity of Results: The main results, particularly Theorems 3.1 and 3.2, are well-stated and supported by detailed proofs. The numerical experiments further validate the theoretical findings, showing linear convergence in practice.
Weaknesses:
1. Technical Soundness: While the paper is technically sound, there is a lack of clarity in the appendix regarding the choice of the constant \( \kappa_3 \) and its role in the claimed inequality. This could hinder reproducibility and should be clarified.
2. Clarity: The paper would benefit from better organization. Presenting the main claims and results earlier, followed by technical proofs, would improve readability. Currently, the focus on technical details in the early sections may overwhelm readers unfamiliar with the topic.
3. Originality: While the simultaneous diagonalization technique is novel, the overall approach largely builds on existing frameworks, such as the Luo and Tseng error bound methodology. This limits the originality of the work.
4. Significance: The theoretical extension to relaxed strong convexity is valuable but has limited practical significance. The results are asymptotic, and their impact on algorithm design or real-world applications is not immediately evident.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper makes a solid theoretical contribution by extending the understanding of PGM's convergence properties.
- The novel matrix diagonalization technique is a creative and valuable addition to the literature.
- The results are well-supported by rigorous proofs and numerical experiments.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The contribution is incremental, with limited practical implications for algorithm design.
- The paper's organization and clarity could be improved, particularly for readers less familiar with the topic.
- The originality is moderate, as much of the work builds on existing frameworks.
Recommendation:
This paper is a strong theoretical contribution to the field of optimization and machine learning. However, its incremental nature and limited practical impact may make it more suitable for a specialized audience. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions, specifically addressing the clarity issues in the appendix and reorganizing the presentation of results for better readability.
