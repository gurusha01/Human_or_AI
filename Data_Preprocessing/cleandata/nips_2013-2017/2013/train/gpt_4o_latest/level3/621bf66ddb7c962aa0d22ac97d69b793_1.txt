The paper introduces SHRT (Subsampled Randomized Hadamard Transform), a novel method to accelerate ridge regression in the high-dimensional setting where the number of features (p) far exceeds the number of observations (n). SHRT achieves this by preconditioning the design matrix using a Randomized Walsh-Hadamard Transform, followed by feature subsampling, reducing the computational complexity of the key matrix operation from \(O(n^2p)\) to \(O(np \log(n))\). The authors provide theoretical guarantees, including risk bounds for the fixed design setting, and demonstrate the method's efficacy through experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets.
The paper is technically sound, with well-supported claims through theoretical analysis (e.g., Lemma 2 and Theorem 1) and empirical validation. The clarity of the writing is commendable, with detailed explanations of the algorithm, its computational cost, and its theoretical underpinnings. The experimental results are thorough and convincingly demonstrate the computational efficiency and accuracy of SHRT compared to true ridge regression and alternative approaches like PCA and randomized PCA.
However, the paper's originality is somewhat diminished by its overlap with prior work, particularly the ICML 2013 paper "Fastfood." Both SHRT and Fastfood leverage similar building blocks, such as Walsh-Hadamard and Rademacher matrices, but differ in their assumptions and use cases. SHRT focuses on the linear kernel setting with \(p \gg n\), while Fastfood is more general and includes additional components like the "G" matrix. While the authors highlight these distinctions, the paper would benefit from a stronger contextualization of its contributions relative to Fastfood and other randomized methods, such as those by Rahimi & Recht (2007, 2008), which are notably absent from the references.
The paper's significance lies in its ability to address a computational bottleneck in ridge regression, a widely used method in high-dimensional data analysis. The proposed SHRT method is particularly relevant in the era of big data, where efficient algorithms for \(p \gg n\) problems are in high demand. The application of SHRT to PCA further broadens its utility, though comparisons to other randomized PCA methods could be expanded.
Strengths:
1. Significant computational speed-up for ridge regression with minimal loss in accuracy.
2. Rigorous theoretical analysis and risk bounds.
3. Well-written and clearly organized, with detailed experimental validation.
Weaknesses:
1. Overlap with prior work, particularly Fastfood, reduces the perceived novelty.
2. Missing citations to foundational works (e.g., Rahimi & Recht) and limited discussion of related randomized methods.
3. Comparisons to alternative methods could be more comprehensive, particularly in randomized PCA.
Recommendation:
While the paper demonstrates technical quality and practical significance, the overlap with prior work and insufficient contextualization of contributions warrant revisions. The authors should explicitly cite and discuss related works, clarify the novelty of their approach, and expand comparisons to other randomized methods. With these improvements, the paper would make a strong contribution to the field.
