This paper introduces Opportunistic Policy Iteration (OPI), a novel improvement to symbolic policy iteration for Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with factored states and actions. The authors address the scalability challenges of symbolic planning in domains with exponentially large action spaces by proposing a hybrid approach that interleaves value iteration (VI) and modified policy iteration (MPI). The key innovation lies in the use of generalized backups that opportunistically enforce policy constraints only when they do not increase the size of the value function representation, thereby reducing the size of Algebraic Decision Diagrams (ADDs). This approach is proven to converge and is further extended with a memory-bounded variant, allowing for a tradeoff between space and time complexity. The experimental results demonstrate significant scalability improvements over state-of-the-art symbolic planners across multiple benchmark domains.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Significance: The paper tackles an under-explored area—symbolic planning with factored actions—and provides a meaningful contribution by improving scalability. The introduction of OPI and its memory-bounded variant represents a novel approach to managing the complexity of symbolic backups.
2. Theoretical Soundness: The authors rigorously prove the convergence of OPI and provide bounds on its performance relative to traditional Bellman backups and policy backups.
3. Empirical Validation: The experimental results convincingly demonstrate the advantages of OPI over existing methods, particularly in terms of scalability and memory efficiency. The inclusion of diverse domains (e.g., Inventory Control, SysAdmin, Elevator Control) strengthens the generalizability of the findings.
4. Compression Insights: The analysis of ADD compression ratios provides valuable insights into the limitations of current representations and suggests avenues for future research.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity and Accessibility: The paper is unnecessarily difficult to follow due to limited explanations and the assumption of prior familiarity with symbolic approaches. For instance, the representation of the policy (\(\pi\)) as an ADD and its role in pruning operations is insufficiently explained, leaving readers to infer its purpose from mathematical equations and diagrams.
2. Late Introduction of Key Concepts: The high-level explanation of pruning is introduced too late, making it challenging for readers to grasp its importance early on. Figure 4, intended to clarify pruning, instead adds confusion due to unclear notation (e.g., "D" and "C" presumably referring to "D" and \(\pi\)).
3. Experimental Exhaustiveness: While the experiments are thorough, it is unclear whether the results are exhaustive across all relevant benchmarks or parameter settings. For example, the impact of varying discount factors or alternative ADD variable orderings is not explored.
4. Presentation Issues: The paper suffers from several grammatical and formatting issues. Terminology such as "flat actions" should be replaced with "atomic actions" for clarity. Graphs are too small and could benefit from reduced whitespace. References are inconsistently formatted and lack proper capitalization.
Recommendation:
While the paper presents a technically sound and significant contribution to symbolic planning, its clarity and accessibility issues hinder its impact. I recommend acceptance with major revisions to address the following:
- Provide clearer and earlier explanations of key concepts, particularly the role of pruning and the representation of \(\pi\).
- Improve the quality of figures and graphs, ensuring that they are legible and well-annotated.
- Address grammatical and formatting issues, including consistent terminology and properly formatted references.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper advances the state of the art in symbolic planning for factored-action MDPs.
- The proposed methods are theoretically sound and empirically validated.
- The focus on scalability and memory efficiency is highly relevant to the field.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The paper's clarity issues may limit its accessibility to a broader audience.
- Experimental results, while promising, could be more exhaustive.
Overall, this paper provides a valuable contribution to the field and merits inclusion in the conference, provided the authors address the identified weaknesses.
