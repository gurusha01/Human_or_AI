The paper presents a novel statistical method to infer network properties of large neural circuits by sequentially recording from subnetworks and "stitching" these observations into a unified model. This approach is particularly relevant for analyzing point-process data, such as calcium imaging in neuroscience, where experimental limitations prevent simultaneous recordings of entire neural populations. The authors model the problem as a latent linear dynamical system (LDS) with missing observations, demonstrating its utility in predicting noise correlations across non-simultaneously recorded neurons. The method is tested on both simulated data and real calcium imaging datasets from the mouse somatosensory cortex, showing promising results in reconstructing network dynamics.
Strengths:
1. Originality and Novelty: The proposed method addresses a significant gap in the field by enabling the inference of interactions between non-simultaneously observed neural populations. This is a novel contribution, as prior work has largely focused on simultaneously recorded data or made strong assumptions about the relationship between stimulus and noise correlations.
2. Significance: The ability to infer joint dynamics from partial observations has broad implications for neuroscience and other fields where data collection is constrained. The method could potentially enable the study of larger neural circuits than previously feasible, advancing our understanding of neural computation.
3. Empirical Validation: The authors validate their approach on both simulated and real data, providing a clear comparison with baseline methods. The results demonstrate that the stitching method significantly outperforms naive approaches and approaches the performance of a fully observed model.
4. Theoretical Insight: The paper builds on foundational results in dynamical systems theory, adapting them to a practical and impactful application.
Weaknesses:
1. Practical Limitations: The reliance on a linear-Gaussian assumption raises concerns about the method's applicability to more complex, non-linear, and non-Gaussian neural dynamics. While the authors acknowledge this limitation, they do not explore alternative models or discuss the potential impact on results.
2. Overlapping Populations: The method's dependence on overlapping subsets of neurons is a critical limitation. The authors note that stitching fails without overlap, but the trade-off between overlap and total coverage is not systematically explored.
3. Clarity of Presentation: The paper lacks detailed explanations of key steps, particularly the M-step equation in the EM algorithm. This undermines the reproducibility and clarity of the method. Additionally, the description of experimental datasets and results could be more concise and better organized.
4. Coupling Correlations: While the method predicts noise correlations well, it struggles with true coupling correlations, potentially due to common input effects. This issue is not sufficiently analyzed or addressed in the paper.
Recommendation:
The paper is a strong candidate for acceptance due to its originality, significance, and empirical validation. However, revisions are needed to improve clarity, address practical limitations, and provide a more thorough analysis of the method's assumptions and performance. Specifically:
- Include a discussion of the method's applicability to non-linear-Gaussian data and potential extensions.
- Provide more detail on the estimation process, particularly the M-step.
- Explore the trade-off between overlap and coverage in experimental design.
- Analyze the method's limitations in capturing true coupling correlations.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Novel and impactful contribution to a challenging problem.
- Strong empirical results on both synthetic and real datasets.
- Potential to advance the state of the art in neural circuit analysis.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Limited applicability to non-linear-Gaussian data.
- Dependence on overlapping populations restricts generalizability.
- Insufficient clarity in methodological details.
Overall, the paper makes a valuable contribution to the field and merits consideration for acceptance, provided the authors address the identified weaknesses.
