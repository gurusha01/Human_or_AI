This paper addresses a significant limitation in existing approaches for modeling multivariate count data, particularly the inability of Poisson graphical models (PGMs) to capture positive conditional dependencies due to normalizability constraints. The authors propose three novel models—Truncated Poisson Graphical Model (TPGM), Quadratic Poisson Graphical Model (QPGM), and Sublinear Poisson Graphical Model (SPGM)—to overcome these limitations. Their theoretical contributions include proving the infeasibility of prior truncation methods (e.g., Winsorized Poisson) and introducing alternative formulations that modify the Poisson distribution using exponential family representations. These models allow for richer dependence structures, including both positive and negative conditional dependencies, which is a notable advancement in the field.
The paper is well-written and provides a clear exposition of the theoretical underpinnings of the proposed models. The authors rigorously derive the conditions for normalizability and demonstrate how their models extend the applicability of PGMs to a broader range of count data scenarios. However, the clarity of Sections 3.1 and 3.2 could be improved, as the derivations for QPGM and SPGM are dense and may be challenging for readers unfamiliar with the underlying mathematical framework. Including detailed proofs in the supplementary material would enhance the paper's accessibility and reproducibility.
While the theoretical contributions are compelling, the experimental evaluation is a notable weakness. The synthetic experiments appear biased toward the proposed models, and the real-data comparisons lack rigor. For example, the absence of objective metrics like log-probability evaluations undermines the credibility of the results. Additionally, the paper does not adequately compare its models to copula-based alternatives, which are a relevant class of competitors for multivariate count data. The use of copula models in a black-box manner, coupled with questionable marginal model choices, further detracts from the experimental rigor. The suspiciously similar performance of the proposed models to Glasso in some cases raises concerns about the novelty of the empirical findings.
In terms of significance, the paper tackles an important problem and provides theoretically sound solutions. However, the lack of robust experimental validation leaves the practical utility of the proposed models unclear. Future work should focus on more comprehensive evaluations, including comparisons to state-of-the-art methods and applications to diverse real-world datasets.
Pros:
1. Novel theoretical contributions addressing a critical limitation in PGMs.
2. Introduction of three new models with the potential to advance the field.
3. Clear writing and organization, with room for minor improvements in clarity.
Cons:
1. Weak experimental evaluation, with biased synthetic experiments and limited real-data analysis.
2. Missing comparisons to copula-based alternatives and objective metrics like log-probability.
3. Questionable empirical findings, including suspiciously similar performance to Glasso.
Recommendation:
While the paper makes strong theoretical contributions, the experimental shortcomings limit its impact. I recommend acceptance conditional on a major revision to address the experimental gaps and provide more robust comparisons to alternative methods.
