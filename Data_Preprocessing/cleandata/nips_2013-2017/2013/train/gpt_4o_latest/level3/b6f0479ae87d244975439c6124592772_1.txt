Review of the Paper
Summary
This paper presents active learning algorithms tailored for structured prediction problems, extending the work of [Schwing et al., ICML 2012] by incorporating active learning protocols based on entropy of local variable marginals. Two active learning approaches are proposed: (1) Separate active learning with independent inference steps and (2) Joint active learning that combines learning across labeled, partially labeled, and unlabeled data. The methods are evaluated on a 3D room layout prediction task, demonstrating impressive annotation savings (~90%) while achieving state-of-the-art performance with only ~10% of the labeled data. The joint active learning approach outperforms the separate approach, especially in leveraging unlabeled data. Additional contributions include batch-mode active learning, computational reuse via warm-starting, and insights into querying partial labels versus full labels.
Strengths
1. Quality: The paper is technically sound and builds on state-of-the-art structured learning with latent variables. The empirical results are compelling, demonstrating significant annotation savings and efficiency improvements over random sampling. The reuse of computations and warm-starting between rounds is a practical and effective optimization.
2. Originality: While the approach is an extension of existing methods, the application of active learning to structured prediction with latent variables is novel in this specific setting. The use of entropy-based uncertainty estimation for querying partial labels is a meaningful contribution.
3. Significance: The proposed methods address a critical challenge in structured predictionâ€”reducing annotation costs. The demonstrated ~90% savings in labeling effort is highly impactful, especially for real-world applications in computer vision and beyond. The joint active learning approach, in particular, shows promise for broader adoption.
4. Clarity: The paper is mostly well-written and organized. The experimental results are clearly presented, and the algorithms are described in sufficient detail for reproducibility. The authors' commitment to releasing the source code is commendable.
Weaknesses
1. Active Learning Concerns: The evaluation of annotation costs is somewhat outdated, relying on "$1 for 1 label" simulations. Real-world annotation costs are often more nuanced, involving variable costs for different types of labels or tasks. Addressing these scenarios would enhance the paper's practical relevance.
2. Clarity: While the paper is generally clear, some sections could benefit from improved explanations. For instance, the task-loss function and its role in the learning process are not adequately explained for readers unfamiliar with the topic. Additionally, the notation is occasionally inconsistent, and the graphical model concepts might be challenging for a broader audience.
3. Originality: The paper, while novel in its specific setting, is a relatively straightforward extension of [Schwing et al., ICML 2012]. It lacks groundbreaking theoretical contributions and is more of a companion piece to the prior work.
4. Significance: The paper's contributions, while useful, are incremental. It advances the state of the art in structured prediction but does not introduce fundamentally new paradigms or methodologies.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Provide a more detailed discussion of realistic annotation cost scenarios, incorporating variable costs or task-specific considerations.
2. Improve the clarity of the task-loss function explanation and ensure consistent notation throughout the paper.
3. Consider adding a broader discussion of the limitations of the proposed methods, particularly in terms of scalability to larger graphical models or datasets.
4. Address minor issues in the abstract and phrasing for better polish.
