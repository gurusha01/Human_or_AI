This paper introduces Bayesian Hierarchical Community Discovery (BHCD), a novel Bayesian nonparametric model for uncovering hierarchical community structures in social networks. By extending stochastic block models (SBM) with Bayesian Rose trees, the authors simplify the Chinese Restaurant Process (CRP) formulation of the Infinite Relational Model (IRM). The proposed approach leverages subtree factoring from Bayesian network structure learning, enabling efficient computations such as greedy search and link prediction. The authors demonstrate that BHCD achieves comparable or superior accuracy to IRM while being two orders of magnitude faster. The paper also provides a detailed description of the algorithm, its variations, and experimental results on datasets like Sampson's monastery network and NIPS co-authorship data.
Strengths:
1. Clarity and Presentation: The paper is well-written, with clear explanations of the theoretical model and algorithms. Notation is consistent throughout, using \( f() \) and \( g() \) effectively to describe the likelihood functions. Citations are comprehensive, although the authors should avoid starting sentences with citations to align with NIPS style.
2. Theoretical Contribution: The extension of SBM with Bayesian Rose trees and the simplification of the CRP formulation are novel and well-motivated. The dynamic programming approach for computing marginal likelihoods is elegant and computationally efficient.
3. Efficiency: The greedy agglomerative algorithm scales as \( O(n^2 \log n) \), making it suitable for large networks. The sparse variant further improves performance for sparse datasets.
4. Experimental Results: The experiments illustrate the method's efficiency and qualitative performance. The use of Sampson's monastery network and NIPS datasets provides a good balance of interpretability and scalability. The hierarchical structures discovered are meaningful and align with prior findings.
Weaknesses:
1. Evaluation Metrics: While the paper uses AUC for evaluation, this deviates from the standard NMI metric typically used for SBM. The authors should provide a clearer justification for this choice and discuss its implications.
2. Dataset Size: The evaluation datasets are relatively small, limiting the generalizability of the results. Including larger datasets and comparisons with semi-parametric methods would strengthen the empirical validation.
3. Experimental Depth: The experimental work is illustrative rather than comparative. While the results are promising, the paper lacks a rigorous comparison with state-of-the-art methods beyond IRM.
4. Algorithm Simplicity: While the theoretical and algorithmic contributions are clear, they are relatively simple compared to more sophisticated models in the field. This simplicity may limit the model's applicability to more complex network structures.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper presents a novel and efficient approach to hierarchical community discovery, advancing the state of the art in Bayesian nonparametric models.
- The clarity of the theoretical exposition and the practical efficiency of the algorithm make it a valuable contribution to the field.
- The experimental results, while limited, demonstrate the method's potential for real-world applications.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The evaluation lacks depth, with small datasets and limited comparisons to other methods.
- The choice of AUC as the evaluation metric needs stronger justification.
- The simplicity of the model may limit its impact compared to more sophisticated approaches.
Recommendation:
This paper is a solid contribution to the field of hierarchical community discovery, particularly for its computational efficiency and novel theoretical approach. However, the evaluation could be significantly improved. I recommend acceptance, provided the authors address the justification for AUC, expand the experimental evaluation, and include larger datasets for benchmarking.
