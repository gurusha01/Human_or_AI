This paper presents a theoretical and empirical analysis of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithms in zero-sum extensive-form games with perfect information and simultaneous moves. The authors propose a general MCTS framework that utilizes no-regret selection methods, such as regret matching and Exp3, and prove that these algorithms converge asymptotically to an approximate Nash equilibrium (\(\epsilon\)-NE). This work addresses a gap in the literature by extending convergence guarantees to simultaneous-move games, a domain where such results were previously unavailable.
Strengths:
The paper is technically sound and well-written. The theoretical contribution is significant in that it establishes convergence guarantees for MCTS in simultaneous-move games, a challenging and underexplored area. The use of \(\epsilon\)-Hannan consistent selection methods is well-motivated and aligns with existing work in online learning and game theory. The experimental results are thorough, comparing mean reward propagation (used in the analysis) with standard sample value propagation. The empirical confirmation of convergence to \(\epsilon\)-NE supports the theoretical claims, and the exploration of worst-case games adds depth to the evaluation.
The paper's clarity is commendable, with a logical structure and detailed explanations of the algorithms and proofs. The inclusion of both theoretical analysis and empirical validation strengthens its contribution to the field.
Weaknesses:
The primary limitation is the asymptotic nature of the convergence results, which do not provide rates of convergence. This is a significant drawback, as backward induction methods already provide exact equilibria, albeit with higher computational costs. The authors could have explored finite-time convergence rates under specific regret assumptions (e.g., \(\sqrt{T}\)), which would make the results more practically relevant. Additionally, while the experiments attempt to derive insights into convergence rates, the findings remain inconclusive, leaving an important question unanswered.
Another weakness is the incremental nature of the contribution. While the extension to simultaneous-move games is novel, the results build on well-established concepts in MCTS and regret minimization, limiting the originality. Minor issues, such as inconsistent notation and typographical errors (e.g., "leafs" instead of "leaves"), should also be addressed.
Recommendation:
Arguments for acceptance:
- Theoretical rigor and correctness.
- Extension of MCTS convergence guarantees to simultaneous-move games.
- Comprehensive experimental evaluation.
Arguments against acceptance:
- Lack of finite-time convergence rates.
- Incremental contribution relative to existing results.
- Minor presentation issues.
Overall, this paper is a solid contribution to the field of algorithmic game theory and MCTS research. While the lack of convergence rate analysis limits its practical impact, the theoretical insights and empirical validation justify its acceptance. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the typographical errors and improve the discussion on convergence rates.
