The paper introduces A Lasso, a novel single-stage algorithm for learning sparse Bayesian network structures for continuous variables in high-dimensional spaces. The method addresses the computational challenges posed by the directed acyclic graph (DAG) constraint, which makes Bayesian network structure learning NP-hard. Unlike traditional two-stage approaches, A Lasso integrates the scoring and DAG constraint enforcement into a single optimization framework, leveraging LASSO for sparsity and the A* search algorithm for efficient exploration of the exponentially large search space.
Strengths:
1. Technical Soundness and Innovation: The paper is technically robust, presenting a well-motivated and theoretically grounded method. The use of the LASSO objective function within the A* search framework is innovative, and the admissible heuristic ensures optimality while significantly pruning the search space. The heuristic schemes proposed for further pruning are practical and effective, particularly for large graphs.
2. Performance: Experimental results demonstrate that A* Lasso outperforms existing methods such as L1MB and SBN in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency. The precision/recall curves and prediction error metrics convincingly show the method's superiority, especially for larger networks.
3. Clarity and Reproducibility: The paper is well-written and provides sufficient implementation details, making it accessible for replication by third parties. The inclusion of algorithmic pseudocode and detailed experimental setups enhances its clarity.
4. Significance: The method addresses a critical problem in Bayesian network learning, advancing the state of the art by offering a scalable and accurate solution. Its application to synthetic and real-world data (e.g., stock prices) highlights its practical relevance.
Weaknesses:
1. Assumption of Gaussian Distributions: The method assumes linear Gaussian models for conditional distributions, which, while reasonable for many applications, limits its applicability to non-Gaussian or nonlinear settings. This limitation is acknowledged but not explored in depth.
2. Application to Stock Price Data: The application to stock price data lacks clarity. The paper does not adequately explain how the data is represented as a Bayesian network, leaving the reader uncertain about the practical implications. Adding references or more detailed explanations from the rebuttal would strengthen this section.
3. Scalability for Very Large Graphs: While A* Lasso with heuristic pruning performs well on graphs with up to ~300 nodes, its scalability to even larger networks remains unclear. The trade-off between pruning and accuracy could be explored further.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper presents a novel and effective approach to a challenging problem, with clear theoretical and empirical contributions.
- It is well-written, reproducible, and demonstrates significant improvements over existing methods.
- The method is likely to inspire further research and practical applications in Bayesian network learning.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The strong Gaussian assumption limits the method's generalizability.
- The unclear application to stock price data weakens the practical demonstration of the method.
Recommendation:
I recommend acceptance of this paper, with a minor revision to clarify the stock price application. The paper is a strong scientific contribution, advancing the field of Bayesian network learning with a method that is both innovative and practical.
