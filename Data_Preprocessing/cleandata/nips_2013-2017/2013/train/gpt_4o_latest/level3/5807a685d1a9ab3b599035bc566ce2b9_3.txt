This paper provides a rigorous and insightful exploration of local privacy within the context of probability and density estimation, leveraging a minimax expected error framework. The authors establish fundamental lower bounds for the minimax rate in \(l2\) distance estimations for users drawn from a discrete distribution over \(d\) types. Notably, the paper demonstrates that the classical randomized response mechanism achieves these lower bounds, proving its optimality for \(l2\) norm estimations. For density estimation, the authors extend their analysis to show that a scheme where users perturb only their own type also meets the lower bound, highlighting the simplicity and effectiveness of such mechanisms. These results underscore the relevance of classical techniques, such as randomized response, in modern privacy-preserving statistical inference.
Strengths:
1. Technical Rigor and Novel Contributions: The paper makes significant contributions by deriving sharp minimax convergence rates under local privacy constraints, bridging statistical decision theory and differential privacy. The results are well-supported by theoretical analysis, with clear lower and upper bounds that demonstrate the trade-offs between privacy and statistical efficiency.
2. Optimality of Classical Methods: The authors' proof that randomized response is optimal for \(l_2\) norm estimations is a notable contribution, as it reaffirms the utility of a decades-old method in contemporary privacy-preserving settings. Similarly, the optimality of simple user-specific perturbation schemes for density estimation is both elegant and practical.
3. Impact and Significance: The paper addresses fundamental questions about the cost of privacy in statistical inference, providing tools and insights that are likely to influence future research in privacy-preserving machine learning and statistics.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity and Accessibility: While the theoretical results are robust, the explanations of the minimax bounds and their derivations are dense and rely on cumbersome notations. Simplifying these sections or providing more intuitive explanations would improve accessibility for a broader audience.
2. Limited Scope: The focus on \(l2\) norm bounds is thorough, but the paper does not discuss \(l1\) norm bounds or their relationship to \(l_2\) bounds. Exploring these connections could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the problem.
3. Broader Applicability: The minimax bounds are tailored to the local privacy setting. While this focus is valuable, extending the analysis to broader privacy settings (e.g., central differential privacy) would enhance the paper's generality.
4. Overlap with Prior Work: Section 3 overlaps with a FOCS 2013 paper, which slightly diminishes the novelty of the multinomial estimation results. However, the paper's broader contributions still justify its acceptance.
Recommendation:
This paper is a high-quality contribution to the field of privacy-preserving statistical inference. Its rigorous analysis, demonstration of fundamental trade-offs, and validation of classical methods as optimal make it a valuable addition to the literature. While the clarity of presentation and scope could be improved, these issues do not detract significantly from the paper's overall merit. I recommend acceptance, with minor revisions to improve clarity and address the noted limitations. 
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Rigorous theoretical contributions with sharp lower and upper bounds.
- Demonstration of the optimality of classical methods like randomized response.
- Significant implications for privacy-preserving statistical inference.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Dense and complex presentation, which may hinder accessibility.
- Limited exploration of broader privacy settings and alternative norms.
- Partial overlap with prior work, reducing novelty in some sections.
Overall, the paper advances the state of the art in local privacy and statistical estimation, making it a strong candidate for acceptance.
