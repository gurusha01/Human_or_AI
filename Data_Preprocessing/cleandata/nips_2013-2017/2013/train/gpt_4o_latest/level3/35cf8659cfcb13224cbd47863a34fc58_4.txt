This paper presents a novel approach for hierarchical community detection in networks by introducing a Bayesian nonparametric model that integrates Bayesian rose trees with stochastic blockmodels. The proposed method, Bayesian Hierarchical Community Discovery (BHCD), employs a greedy agglomerative clustering algorithm to infer hierarchical structures efficiently. The authors claim significant computational advantages, with a worst-case complexity of \(O(n^2 \log n)\) and practical runtimes two orders of magnitude faster than the Infinite Relational Model (IRM), while achieving comparable or better accuracy.
Strengths
The proposed approach is technically sound and demonstrates innovation in its recursive likelihood updates, which allow efficient computation in \(O(\text{Nodes} + \text{Edges})\) time. The integration of Bayesian rose trees with stochastic blockmodels is a compelling contribution, as it enables hierarchical community detection with scalability to larger networks. The paper is well-organized, with clear motivation and a thorough description of the methodology. The experiments on real-world datasets, such as Sampson's monastery network and the NIPS co-authorship network, effectively showcase the model's qualitative and quantitative performance. The results highlight the method's ability to discover meaningful hierarchies and make accurate predictions significantly faster than existing Bayesian nonparametric models.
Weaknesses
Despite its strengths, the paper has several limitations. First, the notation and explanation in Section 3 are dense, making it difficult for readers to follow the dynamic programming and recursive updates. Simplifying this section or providing additional examples would improve clarity. Second, while the experiments demonstrate the benefits of modeling hierarchy, the study lacks comparisons to other hierarchical network models, such as the nested Chinese Restaurant Process (CRP) and the Mondrian Process. This omission limits the ability to contextualize the proposed method's performance relative to state-of-the-art hierarchical models. Third, the use of the term "nonparametric" is debatable, as it diverges from prior interpretations of Bayesian rose trees, and the authors do not adequately address this inconsistency. Finally, the scalability of the method on very large networks remains untested, and the experiments focus primarily on small to medium-sized datasets.
Arguments for Acceptance
1. The paper introduces a novel and efficient approach for hierarchical community detection, advancing the state of the art.
2. The computational efficiency and scalability of the method make it a valuable contribution for analyzing large networks.
3. The experiments demonstrate strong qualitative and quantitative results, with significant runtime improvements over existing methods.
Arguments Against Acceptance
1. The lack of comparisons to other hierarchical models limits the evaluation's comprehensiveness.
2. The dense notation and unclear explanations in Section 3 hinder reproducibility and accessibility for readers.
3. The scalability of the method on very large networks remains unverified.
Recommendation
Overall, this paper makes a meaningful contribution to hierarchical community detection in networks and demonstrates significant computational advantages. However, addressing the clarity issues in Section 3 and including broader experimental comparisons would strengthen the work. I recommend conditional acceptance, provided these concerns are addressed in the revision.
