The paper presents a general framework for Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithms in zero-sum extensive-form games (EFGs) with perfect information and simultaneous moves, proving convergence to an approximate Nash equilibrium (NE) under certain conditions. The authors provide a theoretical guarantee for algorithms using -Hannan consistent selection methods like regret matching and Exp3. Empirical evaluations confirm the theoretical results and suggest that other MCTS variants may also converge to approximate NE. This work addresses a gap in the theoretical understanding of MCTS in simultaneous-move games, complementing its practical success.
Strengths:
1. Theoretical Contribution: The paper provides a rigorous theoretical foundation for the convergence of MCTS algorithms in a challenging game-theoretic setting. The use of -Hannan consistency as a sufficient condition is novel in this context and aligns well with the broader literature on online learning and regret minimization.
2. Empirical Validation: The experimental results validate the theoretical claims and explore the practical performance of mean propagation versus current sample value propagation. The inclusion of worst-case game analysis adds robustness to the empirical findings.
3. Clarity and Structure: The paper is well-organized, with clear definitions, algorithms, and proofs. The authors provide sufficient background for readers unfamiliar with simultaneous-move games or regret minimization techniques.
Weaknesses:
1. Limited Novelty in Proof Techniques: While the theoretical results are sound, the proof techniques rely heavily on established concepts like Hannan consistency and bounded error propagation. The novelty of the approach may be questioned, as it primarily adapts existing methods to a new setting rather than introducing fundamentally new techniques.
2. Exclusion of UCB Algorithms: The paper explicitly excludes Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithms, which are widely studied and used in MCTS. Including a discussion or comparison of UCB-based methods would strengthen the work, even if their convergence cannot be guaranteed.
3. Unexplained Experimental Results: The empirical observation that other MCTS variants converge to approximate NE is intriguing but not theoretically justified. This discrepancy between theory and practice warrants further explanation or analysis.
4. Marginal Technical Significance: While the findings are interesting, the paper does not advance the state of the art in a technically exceptional way. The results are incremental and primarily formalize what practitioners may already suspect.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper addresses an important theoretical gap in the analysis of MCTS for simultaneous-move games.
- The combination of theoretical guarantees and empirical validation makes the contribution robust and well-rounded.
- The work is relevant to both the game theory and reinforcement learning communities, with potential applications in AI and decision-making systems.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The novelty of the proof techniques is limited, and the exclusion of UCB algorithms weakens the generality of the results.
- The paper does not provide finite-time convergence bounds, which would significantly enhance its practical utility.
- The unexplained empirical convergence of other MCTS variants highlights an incomplete theoretical understanding.
Recommendation: Weak Accept. While the paper is not groundbreaking, it provides a solid theoretical contribution to an underexplored area and is supported by empirical evidence. Addressing the noted weaknesses in a future revision would make it a stronger contribution to the field.
