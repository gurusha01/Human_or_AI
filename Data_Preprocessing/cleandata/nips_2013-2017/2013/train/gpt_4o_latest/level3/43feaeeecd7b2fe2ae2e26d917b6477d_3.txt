The paper introduces a novel approach to constructing multivariate distributions over unbounded counts that adhere to Markov structures in undirected networks. This is a significant contribution to the field, as modeling count data in high-dimensional settings has been a longstanding challenge in statistical literature. The authors propose three new models—Truncated Poisson Graphical Model (TPGM), Quadratic Poisson Graphical Model (QPGM), and Sublinear Poisson Graphical Model (SPGM)—to address the limitations of existing Poisson graphical models (PGMs), particularly their inability to model positive dependencies. The paper also demonstrates the utility of these models through simulation studies and a case study on breast cancer microRNA networks.
Strengths:  
The paper makes a valuable theoretical contribution by addressing the restrictive assumptions of traditional PGMs. The introduction of TPGM, QPGM, and SPGM expands the range of dependencies that can be modeled, allowing for both positive and negative correlations. The authors provide a rigorous mathematical foundation for their models, including proofs of normalizability and tractability. The simulation studies and case study demonstrate the models' practical advantages over Gaussian graphical models and traditional PGMs, particularly in recovering network structures from count data. The identification of biologically relevant hubs in the microRNA network underscores the potential real-world impact of these methods.
Weaknesses:  
Despite its theoretical rigor, the paper has several limitations. First, the SPGM lacks closed-form conditional distributions, which raises questions about its classification as a Poisson-like model. Additionally, the QPGM's Gaussian-like thin tails may limit its applicability to data with heavy-tailed distributions. The motivation for modeling counts using Poisson distributions is not sufficiently justified, given that empirical count data often deviate from Poisson assumptions. The paper would benefit from visualizations, such as plots of SPGM's probability mass function, to provide readers with a clearer understanding of the models' behavior. Furthermore, the literature review is incomplete, neglecting relevant work in spatial statistics and copula-based methods. The practical utility of these models is also questionable compared to simpler alternatives like structured Gaussian random fields with Poisson measurements. Finally, some references, such as those related to sequencing reads replacing microarrays, need to be updated.
Pro/Con Arguments for Acceptance:  
- Pro: The paper addresses a challenging and important problem, providing novel theoretical insights and practical methods for modeling multivariate count data. The results are promising and demonstrate clear advantages over existing methods.  
- Con: The paper lacks a comprehensive engagement with existing literature, and its practical utility compared to simpler methods is not convincingly established. Additionally, some limitations of the proposed models, such as SPGM's lack of closed-form conditionals, are not adequately addressed.
Recommendation:  
While the paper is of significant theoretical interest, its practical justification and engagement with prior work are lacking. I recommend acceptance contingent on revisions to address the incomplete literature review, provide clearer guidance for practitioners, and include visualizations and updated references.
