The paper introduces a Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) approach for estimating parameters of the Plackett-Luce (PL) model, leveraging pairwise comparisons derived from full rankings. The authors propose a novel framework for rank aggregation by constructing a transition matrix from these comparisons and parameterizing the PL model via its stationary distribution. The paper establishes consistency results for various "breaking" strategies and validates the proposed methods on synthetic and real-world datasets. Notably, the approach is computationally more efficient than the classical Minorize-Maximization (MM) algorithm, while maintaining competitive statistical efficiency.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Theoretical Contributions: The paper provides a fresh perspective on rank aggregation by framing it within the GMM paradigm. The characterization of consistent and inconsistent breaking strategies is a significant theoretical contribution, offering insights into the trade-offs between computational efficiency and statistical accuracy.
2. Clarity: The paper is well-written and organized, with clear explanations of the proposed methods and their theoretical underpinnings. The "breaking" technique is intuitive and effectively bridges the gap between full rankings and pairwise comparisons.
3. Computational Efficiency: The proposed GMM algorithms demonstrate superior computational efficiency compared to the MM algorithm, making them appealing for large-scale applications.
4. Experimental Validation: The experiments on synthetic data and the sushi dataset provide a reasonable evaluation of the proposed methods, highlighting their strengths and limitations.
Weaknesses:
1. Limited Applicability: The analysis and experiments focus on small-m/large-n settings, whereas many real-world applications involve large-m/small-n scenarios. The paper does not address how the method performs in these settings, which limits its practical relevance.
2. Experimental Metrics: The use of RMSE and Kendall correlation as evaluation metrics may not fully capture the quality of top-k rankings. Position-dependent metrics would provide a more nuanced understanding of the method's performance.
3. Scope of Experiments: The experimental validation is somewhat limited, with only two datasets considered. Broader empirical evaluation on diverse real-world datasets would strengthen the paper's claims.
4. Minor Issues: There are minor issues with unclear notation, a misspelled section title, and a broken reference in footnote 4, which detract from the paper's overall polish.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper introduces a novel and computationally efficient approach to rank aggregation, which is a key problem in machine learning and social choice.
- The theoretical contributions, particularly the analysis of breaking strategies, are significant and advance the state of the art.
- The clarity and organization of the paper make it accessible to a broad audience.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The limited focus on small-m/large-n settings and the lack of discussion on large-m/small-n scenarios reduce the paper's practical impact.
- The experimental evaluation is narrow in scope and does not fully explore the method's applicability across diverse datasets and ranking tasks.
Recommendation:
While the paper has notable strengths in terms of novelty, theoretical contributions, and computational efficiency, the concerns regarding practical applicability and limited experimental scope are significant. If accepted, the authors should address these limitations in a revised version. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions, as the paper provides valuable insights and has the potential to stimulate further research in rank aggregation.
