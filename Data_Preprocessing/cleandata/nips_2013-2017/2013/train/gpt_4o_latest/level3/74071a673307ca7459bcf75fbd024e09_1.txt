This paper presents a novel exploration of regret profiles in the context of full-information online prediction with binary actions and absolute loss. It introduces the concept of T-realisable profiles and provides a comprehensive characterization of the Pareto-front of such profiles for any finite time horizon T. The authors also propose algorithms to achieve these profiles and analyze their asymptotic behavior as T approaches infinity. The work is positioned as a significant contribution to the study of non-uniform regret bounds, which has been relatively underexplored in the literature.
Strengths:
1. Technical Soundness and Novelty: The paper is technically rigorous and provides exact characterizations of regret trade-offs, which are further extended to asymptotic settings. This level of detail and precision is commendable and sets the foundation for future work in non-uniform regret bounds.
2. New Research Directions: By focusing on asymmetric regret guarantees and Pareto-optimal trade-offs, the paper opens a new line of inquiry in online learning, particularly in the context of absolute loss. This has the potential to inspire further research in related areas, such as horizon-free strategies and modern regret budgets.
3. Clarity and Organization: The paper is well-written and logically structured, making it accessible to readers familiar with online learning and regret analysis. The use of visualizations, such as Pareto frontiers, aids in understanding the results.
4. Theoretical Contribution: The analysis of the asymptotic Pareto frontier and the critique of classical uniform regret bounds (\(\sqrt{T/2 \ln K}\)) provide valuable insights into the limitations of existing approaches.
Weaknesses:
1. Adversary Model Placement: The non-oblivious adversary model, which significantly impacts the validity of the results, is introduced late in the paper. This should be clarified earlier to avoid potential confusion for readers.
2. Theorem 6 Clarity: The second part of Theorem 6 is not clearly explained and could benefit from additional elaboration or simplification. This would improve the accessibility of the paper's core results.
3. Relation to Classical Bounds: While the paper critiques classical uniform regret bounds, it does not explicitly discuss how the new bounds compare quantitatively or qualitatively to these classical results. This omission limits the practical interpretability of the findings.
4. Computational Efficiency: The proposed algorithms, while theoretically optimal, are computationally inefficient. This limits their applicability in real-world scenarios, and the paper would benefit from a discussion of potential efficient alternatives.
Recommendation:
The paper is a strong theoretical contribution to the field of online learning and regret analysis. However, its practical impact is somewhat limited by the computational inefficiency of the proposed algorithms and the lack of discussion on their relation to classical bounds. I recommend acceptance, provided the authors address the clarity issues in Theorem 6 and discuss the implications of their results in comparison to classical uniform regret bounds. Additionally, an acknowledgment of the computational challenges and potential future directions for efficient algorithms would strengthen the paper further. 
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Novel and technically sound contributions to non-uniform regret bounds.
- Opens new research directions in asymmetric regret guarantees.
- Well-written and organized.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Computational inefficiency of proposed algorithms.
- Lack of clarity in certain results (e.g., Theorem 6).
- Missing discussion on practical implications and comparison to classical bounds. 
Overall, this paper is a valuable theoretical addition to the field and merits inclusion in the conference proceedings.
