The paper addresses the underexplored problem of tracking changes in dependency structures in data streams, proposing the Locally Stationary Structure Tracker (LoSST) algorithm for Structural Equation Models (SEMs). This is a novel contribution to the field of graphical model structure learning, as most existing methods assume globally stationary environments. LoSST combines batch learning (via the PC algorithm) with statistical tracking mechanisms, leveraging Mahalanobis distance and Liptak's weighted p-values to detect structural or parametric changes and decide when to relearn the model. The algorithm is evaluated on synthetic datasets with known ground truth and real-world US price index data, demonstrating its ability to detect meaningful trends while ignoring transient noise.
Strengths
The paper tackles a novel and practically relevant problem, offering a heuristic-first approach that opens new research directions. The proposed algorithm is efficient, operating in an online fashion with single-pass processing of data, which is crucial for real-time applications. The experiments are well-designed, demonstrating LoSST's advantages over traditional batch-mode learning in dynamic environments. The use of pooled p-values to mitigate sensitivity to outliers is particularly innovative, as it ensures robustness against short-lived changes. Additionally, the paper provides a thorough review of related work, situating LoSST within the broader context of graphical model learning and changepoint detection. The writing is generally clear, and the algorithm's trade-offs between convergence and diligence are thoughtfully discussed.
Weaknesses
The paper lacks theoretical guarantees or convergence proofs for LoSST, which would strengthen its scientific rigor. The reliance on heuristics, such as the weighting scheme and probabilistic relearning, is not fully justified or systematically analyzed. Methods like Hotelling's TÂ² distribution and Liptak's weighted p-values are used outside their original guarantees, and this limitation is not adequately acknowledged. Experimental descriptions are cryptic in places, and the figures are too small and poorly labeled, which detracts from the clarity of the results. The explanation for LoSST's poorer performance on edge addition with parametric changes is unsatisfactory, and the suggestion to decouple parameter and structure updates warrants further exploration. Finally, while the creative use of footnotes for proofs is noted, these should be moved to supplementary materials for better readability.
Recommendation
The paper is a strong contribution to the field, addressing a novel and challenging problem with a practical algorithm. However, the lack of theoretical guarantees and some clarity issues in the experimental section prevent it from being a top-tier submission. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions, focusing on improving the clarity of figures, providing more detailed experimental descriptions, and explicitly acknowledging the limitations of the heuristic methods used. The paper's heuristic-first approach is a valuable starting point, but future work should aim to provide theoretical underpinnings and explore more principled alternatives to the current heuristics.
Arguments for Acceptance
- Tackles a novel and underexplored problem.
- Proposes a practical, efficient algorithm with demonstrated utility in real-world and synthetic datasets.
- Opens new research directions in online structure learning.
Arguments Against Acceptance
- Lacks theoretical guarantees or convergence proofs.
- Relies heavily on heuristics without systematic justification.
- Figures and experimental descriptions need improvement for clarity.
Overall, the paper is a meaningful contribution to the field and merits acceptance with revisions to address the noted weaknesses.
