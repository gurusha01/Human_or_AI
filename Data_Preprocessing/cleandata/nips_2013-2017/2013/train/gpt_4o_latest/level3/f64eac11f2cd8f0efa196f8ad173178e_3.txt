This paper proposes a novel approach to adaptively determine step sizes for policy gradient methods by maximizing a lower bound on expected performance gain. The authors derive a theoretically grounded lower bound, simplify it for Gaussian policies, and extend it to approximate settings where gradients are estimated from trajectory samples. The approach is validated through theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation on a linear-quadratic Gaussian (LQG) regulation problem. The work addresses a critical issue in reinforcement learning (RL)—the manual tuning of step sizes—which significantly impacts convergence speed and stability.
Strengths:  
1. Contribution: The paper makes a significant contribution by introducing a theoretically sound and practical method for adaptive step-size selection in policy gradient methods. The derivation of a closed-form solution for the optimal step size under Gaussian policies is particularly noteworthy.  
2. Theoretical Quality: The theoretical framework is robust, with detailed derivations and proofs. The authors effectively link their approach to prior work on policy gradient methods and performance bounds, demonstrating a deep understanding of the field.  
3. Empirical Validation: The experiments on the LQG problem illustrate the practical utility of the proposed method. The results show that the adaptive step size avoids divergence while improving convergence speed, validating the theoretical claims.  
4. Originality: The focus on adaptive step-size selection from a theoretical perspective is novel. The paper advances the state of the art by addressing a relatively underexplored aspect of policy gradient methods.  
Weaknesses:  
1. Clarity: While the paper is generally well-structured, the final section on numerical simulations feels rushed and lacks sufficient discussion of the results. A clearer presentation of the empirical findings, including better-labeled tables and axes, would enhance readability.  
2. Significance: Although the proposed method is impactful, the derived bounds could be tighter. This limitation is acknowledged by the authors and presents an opportunity for future work.  
3. Scope of Evaluation: The empirical evaluation is limited to the LQG problem, which, while instructive, does not fully demonstrate the method's applicability to more complex RL tasks, such as motor control or robotics.  
Suggestions for Improvement:  
- Improve the clarity of tables and figures, particularly axis labeling, to make the results more accessible.  
- Include comparisons with heuristic step-size tuning methods to highlight the advantages of the proposed approach.  
- Extend the empirical evaluation to more diverse RL tasks to better demonstrate the method's generalizability.  
Arguments for Acceptance:  
- The paper addresses an important and underexplored problem in RL.  
- The theoretical contributions are solid and well-supported by empirical evidence.  
- The approach is novel and has the potential to impact both research and practical applications in RL.  
Arguments Against Acceptance:  
- The empirical evaluation is limited in scope, which may hinder the assessment of the method's generalizability.  
- The clarity of the final section and presentation of results could be improved.  
Conclusion:  
Overall, this paper is a strong contribution to the field of reinforcement learning. Its theoretical rigor, novelty, and potential practical impact outweigh its minor shortcomings. I recommend acceptance, with the expectation that the authors address the clarity and scope issues in the final version.
