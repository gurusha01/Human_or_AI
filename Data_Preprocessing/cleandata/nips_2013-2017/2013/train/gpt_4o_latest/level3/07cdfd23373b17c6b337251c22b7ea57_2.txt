Review of the Paper
This paper introduces a scalable approach for latent space inference in large networks by leveraging a bag-of-triangles representation and a parsimonious statistical model called the Parsimonious Triangular Model (PTM). The authors propose a stochastic variational inference algorithm that achieves an impressive runtime complexity of \(O(NK)\), enabling the analysis of networks with millions of nodes and hundreds of latent roles on a single machine. The work is positioned as a significant improvement over existing methods like MMSB and MMTM, which suffer from scalability issues due to their higher parameter dimensionality and computational complexity.
Strengths:
1. Scalability and Efficiency: The proposed PTM reduces the parameter space from \(O(K^3)\) (in MMTM) to \(O(K)\) by grouping triangle configurations, which is a novel and effective contribution. The stochastic variational inference algorithm further ensures that the method is computationally practical for large networks.
2. Empirical Validation: The experiments demonstrate that the method achieves competitive or improved accuracy for latent space recovery and link prediction compared to state-of-the-art methods. The scalability is particularly impressive, with convergence on a 1M-node network in just a few hours.
3. Novel Approximation: The authors propose an intuitive \(O(K)\) approximation for the local update rule, which balances computational efficiency and accuracy. This is a thoughtful design choice that addresses the limitations of naive mean-field approximations.
4. Clear Contributions: The combination of a-MMSB and MMTM ideas into a unified framework is a novel contribution. The paper also highlights the advantages of triangle-based modeling over edge-based approaches for certain network tasks.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity of Presentation: While the technical content is strong, the paper could benefit from improved clarity in its presentation. For example, the distinction between \(\Delta^1\) and \(\Delta^2\) is not well-explained, and the justification for subsampling triangles using \(\delta\) is insufficiently detailed.
2. Interpretability of Latent Space: The paper does not adequately address what can be learned about graph similarities and differences from the inferred latent space. This raises concerns about the interpretability of the model outputs.
3. Directed Networks: The method is limited to undirected networks, and there is no discussion on how it could be extended to directed networks, which are common in real-world applications.
4. Robustness Concerns: The choice of the 0.125 threshold for latent space recovery is somewhat arbitrary, and its impact on robustness is not thoroughly explored. Similarly, the performance of the method with fewer observed edges (e.g., less than 10% held out) is not investigated.
5. Counterintuitive Results: The method outperforms MMSB on synthetic networks generated by MMSB, which is surprising and warrants further explanation. This raises questions about the fairness of the experimental setup or the generality of the method.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper addresses a critical challenge in network analysis—scalability—by proposing a novel and efficient approach.
- The empirical results are compelling, showing orders-of-magnitude improvements in runtime while maintaining competitive accuracy.
- The combination of ideas from a-MMSB and MMTM is innovative and advances the state of the art.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The presentation of the method and results could be clearer, particularly regarding the subsampling strategy and latent space interpretability.
- The lack of discussion on directed networks and robustness to parameter choices limits the generalizability of the approach.
- Some experimental results, such as outperforming MMSB on MMSB-generated data, are counterintuitive and require further justification.
Recommendation:
Overall, this paper makes a strong contribution to scalable network modeling and is likely to be of interest to the community. However, the authors should address the clarity issues, provide more justification for key design choices, and discuss extensions to directed networks in a revision. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions.
