This paper presents a novel Bayesian nonparametric model, Bayesian Hierarchical Community Discovery (BHCD), for inferring hierarchical community structures in social networks. By generalizing the stochastic block model to hierarchical clustering, the authors address a gap in existing methods, which predominantly focus on flat community structures. The proposed model employs a tree-structured mixture of stochastic block models, leveraging a greedy agglomerative clustering algorithm to efficiently infer hierarchical partitions. The paper demonstrates that BHCD achieves comparable or superior accuracy to the Infinite Relational Model (IRM) while being significantly faster, scaling as \(O(n^2 \log n)\) in the number of vertices.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Insight: The paper introduces a Bayesian version of agglomerative clustering, combining ideas from stochastic block models and hierarchical clustering. The key insight—restricting partitions to tree structures for efficient computation of marginal likelihood—is both elegant and impactful.
2. Efficiency: The proposed method is computationally efficient, outperforming IRM by two orders of magnitude in runtime, making it suitable for large-scale networks.
3. Empirical Results: The experiments on real-world datasets, including the NIPS co-authorship network, demonstrate the method's scalability and competitive predictive performance. The sparse variant of BHCD is particularly noteworthy for its efficiency on sparse networks.
4. Significance: The hierarchical approach provides richer insights into community structures compared to flat clustering, which could inspire further research and practical applications in social network analysis.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity: The paper suffers from writing issues, including spelling/grammar errors, vague phrasing, and unclear dataset descriptions. For instance, Section 4, which connects the tree-learning procedure to the Bayesian generative model, is particularly difficult to follow and requires significant improvement.
2. Mathematical Presentation: Certain equations (e.g., Eq. 5) and visual elements (e.g., Figure 3) are confusing or unnecessary, detracting from the overall clarity of the paper.
3. Limited Depth in Comparisons: While the paper compares BHCD to IRM, it does not provide sufficient discussion on how it relates to other hierarchical models, such as those based on the Mondrian process or methods limited to shallow hierarchies.
4. Interpretability of Results: The hierarchical structures discovered by BHCD are not always easy to interpret, particularly for binary-only variations, which could limit their practical utility.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:
Pro: The paper makes a strong contribution to the field by addressing the computational inefficiencies of existing Bayesian nonparametric methods for hierarchical clustering. Its novelty, efficiency, and empirical performance make it a valuable addition to the literature.  
Con: The unclear connection between the generative model and the learning algorithm, coupled with writing and presentation issues, detracts from the paper's accessibility and reproducibility.
Recommendation:
I recommend acceptance with minor revisions. The paper's novelty, strong empirical results, and computational efficiency outweigh its weaknesses. However, the authors should address the clarity and presentation issues, particularly in Section 4, and improve the overall writing quality to make the paper more accessible to readers.
