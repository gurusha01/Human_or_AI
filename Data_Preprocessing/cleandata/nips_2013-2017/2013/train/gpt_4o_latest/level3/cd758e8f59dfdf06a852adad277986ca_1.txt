This paper addresses the problem of cluster tree estimation for probability density functions supported on or near a d-dimensional manifold embedded in a D-dimensional space. The authors build on the robust single linkage (RSL) algorithm proposed by Chaudhuri and Dasgupta (2010), adapting it to the manifold setting. They demonstrate that the algorithm achieves consistency with convergence rates dependent on the intrinsic manifold dimension \(d\), rather than the ambient dimension \(D\), which is a significant theoretical advancement for high-dimensional data analysis under the manifold hypothesis. Additionally, the paper introduces a framework for analyzing clustering consistency when data are concentrated near a manifold, extending the results to noisy settings.
The paper's key contributions include bounds on s-net sizes and volume deformation under the assumption of a small condition number (\(\tau\)), as well as non-trivial lower and upper bounds for convergence rates. The authors also sketch a sample complexity lower bound instance for RSL algorithms, showing that their results are tight up to a factor of \(1/(\epsilon \tau)^d\). However, the lower bounds do not improve upon prior work but instead differ in applicability, particularly for cases where \(1/\tau = 0\).
While the paper makes important theoretical contributions, several weaknesses hinder its clarity and impact. The writing is often unclear, with confusing definitions and errors in key statements. For instance, Definition 3 lacks clarity, as terms like "n" and "Cn" are undefined, forcing readers to consult prior work for context. Theorem 4 is incorrect and weaker than Theorem 6 in prior literature, necessitating correction. Lemma 16's inequalities are insufficiently explained, and Lemma 18 contains a missing \(1/2\) term in the definition of \(v{\text{cap}}\), along with unclear notation for \(\Gamma(1/2)\). These issues detract from the paper's readability and accessibility.
The choice of the salience parameter (\(2\sigma > \tau\)) could also be simplified for better interpretability, as suggested by assuming \((3\sigma/16) < (\tau/16)\). Despite these issues, the generalization of the RSL algorithm to the manifold case is a significant contribution, offering bounds on s-net sizes and demonstrating adaptivity to the intrinsic dimensionality of the data.
Strengths:
1. Theoretical advancement in adapting RSL algorithms to manifolds, with convergence rates independent of ambient dimension \(D\).
2. Introduction of a framework for clustering consistency under manifold + noise models.
3. Tight bounds on sample complexity and s-net sizes under manifold assumptions.
Weaknesses:
1. Poor clarity in writing, with undefined terms and errors in key theorems and lemmas.
2. Theorem 4 is weaker than prior work and requires correction.
3. Lower bounds are not improvements over prior work but differ in scope.
4. Over-reliance on prior work for definitions and context, making the paper less self-contained.
Recommendation:
While the paper makes valuable theoretical contributions, the issues with clarity, errors, and reliance on prior work significantly detract from its quality. I recommend acceptance only if the authors address the clarity issues, correct Theorem 4, and provide more detailed explanations for Lemma 16 and Lemma 18.
