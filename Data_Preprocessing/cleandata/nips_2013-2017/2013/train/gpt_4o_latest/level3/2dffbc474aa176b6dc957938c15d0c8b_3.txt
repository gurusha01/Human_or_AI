This paper presents a fully Bayesian approach for inference and learning in nonlinear nonparametric state-space models (SSMs) by leveraging Gaussian process (GP) priors over state transition dynamics. The authors propose a tailored Particle Markov Chain Monte Carlo (PMCMC) algorithm to sample from the smoothing distribution while marginalizing over the state transition function. This approach preserves the nonparametric flexibility of the model and enables efficient inference. The paper also introduces a sparse GP formulation to reduce computational complexity, making the method scalable to larger datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on both synthetic and real-world systems, such as a cart-and-pole system.
The paper builds on prior work in GP-based SSMs, such as Deisenroth et al. (2012), which focused on filtering and smoothing for learned GP dynamics, and Turner et al. (2010), which used EM for parametric GP models. The authors' contribution lies in addressing the challenge of learning GP-SSMs by marginalizing the state transition function, thus avoiding parametric assumptions. This is a significant step forward in the field of Bayesian nonparametrics for dynamical systems.
Strengths:
1. Technical Contribution: The use of PMCMC with tailored samplers is a notable advancement, allowing efficient sampling from the smoothing distribution while retaining the nonparametric expressivity of the GP-SSM.
2. Scalability: The introduction of sparse GP priors significantly reduces computational complexity, making the method more practical for larger datasets.
3. Experimental Demonstrations: The experiments effectively showcase the method's ability to handle multimodal smoothing distributions and learn complex dynamics, even with limited training data.
4. Clarity of Presentation: The paper is well-organized, with detailed explanations of the methodology and clear mathematical derivations.
Weaknesses:
1. Limited Discussion of Challenges: While the application of PMCMC is straightforward, the paper lacks a detailed discussion of the practical challenges in implementing the scheme, such as tuning hyperparameters or addressing potential computational bottlenecks.
2. Missing Critical Assessment: The paper does not provide a thorough evaluation of the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed approach compared to alternative methods. For instance, a deeper discussion of when the method might fail (e.g., under extreme data sparsity) would have been valuable.
3. Experimental Evaluation: The experiments focus more on demonstrating the method's capabilities rather than rigorously evaluating its performance. Metrics such as runtime comparisons, sensitivity to hyperparameters, or robustness to noise could have added more depth.
4. Significance of Results: While the results are promising, the paper does not explicitly quantify how much the proposed method advances the state of the art compared to existing approaches.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper introduces a novel and technically sound approach to learning in GP-SSMs, which is a challenging and important problem in the field.
- The methodology is well-motivated, and the experiments demonstrate its potential to handle complex dynamical systems effectively.
- The scalability improvements via sparse GPs make the approach more practical for real-world applications.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The lack of a critical assessment of the method's limitations and challenges reduces the overall impact of the work.
- The experimental evaluation could be more comprehensive, particularly in terms of benchmarking against alternative methods and exploring practical difficulties.
Recommendation:
Overall, this paper makes a meaningful contribution to the field of Bayesian nonparametrics for dynamical systems. While there are areas for improvement, particularly in terms of critical evaluation and experimental rigor, the technical novelty and potential impact justify its acceptance. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the identified weaknesses.
