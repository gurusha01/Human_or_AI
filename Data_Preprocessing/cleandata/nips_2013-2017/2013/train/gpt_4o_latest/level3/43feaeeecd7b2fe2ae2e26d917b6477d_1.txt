The paper introduces novel models for representing joint distributions over integer-count variables, addressing a critical limitation of existing Poisson graphical models (PGMs) that only allow negative conditional dependencies due to normalization constraints. The authors critique the default model from Yang et al., highlighting its inability to capture positive correlations, and propose three innovative solutions: a new truncation method (Truncated Poisson Graphical Model, TPGM), a quadratic base measure (Quadratic Poisson Graphical Model, QPGM), and a sub-linear sufficient statistic (Sublinear Poisson Graphical Model, SPGM). These approaches significantly expand the applicability of PGMs by enabling the modeling of both positive and negative dependencies in count data.
The paper is well-written, original, and makes a substantial contribution to the field of count data modeling. The authors provide a thorough theoretical foundation for their models, demonstrating normalizability and flexibility in parameterization. The experimental results, conducted on both synthetic and real-world datasets, convincingly show that the proposed methods outperform traditional Gaussian graphical models and the original PGM in recovering network structures from count data. Particularly noteworthy is the application to breast cancer microRNA networks, where the proposed models identify biologically relevant hubs and cliques missed by other methods.
However, there are some weaknesses. While the authors critique truncation and quadratic models, the reviewer finds these criticisms somewhat unconvincing. For instance, the TPGM's bounded domain may be a limitation in some scenarios, but it could still be effective for datasets with naturally bounded counts. Similarly, the QPGM's Gaussian-like behavior, while noted as a drawback, might be advantageous in certain applications requiring smooth distributions. The authors could strengthen their arguments by providing more nuanced discussions of when these models might be preferable. Additionally, the term "sparsistent" is unclear and should be explicitly defined, even if it has prior usage. Minor textual corrections are needed for clarity on pages 3 and 5.
Strengths:
1. Originality: The paper introduces three novel approaches to overcome a significant limitation of existing PGMs, advancing the state of the art in count data modeling.
2. Significance: The proposed models have broad applicability, demonstrated through synthetic experiments and a compelling real-world case study in genomics.
3. Clarity: The paper is well-organized and provides sufficient detail for reproducibility.
4. Quality: The theoretical contributions are sound, and the experimental results are robust and well-presented.
Weaknesses:
1. The criticisms of truncation and quadratic models could be more balanced, as these approaches may work well in specific contexts.
2. The term "sparsistent" is not clearly defined, which may confuse readers unfamiliar with its prior usage.
3. Minor textual issues on pages 3 and 5 require correction for improved clarity.
Recommendation:
I recommend acceptance of this paper, as its strengths in originality, significance, and technical quality outweigh its minor weaknesses. The proposed models represent a meaningful advancement in the field and are likely to inspire further research and applications in count data modeling.
