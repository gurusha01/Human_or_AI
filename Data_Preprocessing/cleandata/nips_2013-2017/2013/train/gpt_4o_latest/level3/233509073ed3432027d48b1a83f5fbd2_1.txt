The paper introduces the Locally Stationary Structure Tracker (LoSST), a heuristic algorithm for online structure learning of graphical models in environments with dynamically changing generating structures. The authors argue that most existing structure learning methods assume globally stationary data, which limits their applicability to real-world scenarios where generating structures are only locally stationary. LoSST addresses this gap by tracking sufficient statistics in an online manner and dynamically adapting to changes in the underlying graphical model structure. The authors demonstrate the algorithm's performance through simulations and a real-world application to U.S. price index volatility data.
While the paper tackles an important problem, several issues limit its impact. First, the claim that LoSST is the first method to address this problem is inaccurate. Prior work by Siracusa III and Fisher (AISTATS 2009) also handles non-iid data and varying generating structures, albeit using Bayesian methods. This oversight in the related work section misrepresents the novelty of the contribution. Additionally, the paper conflates assumptions about models (e.g., exchangeability) with assumptions about algorithms (e.g., factorized scoring functions), which could mislead readers about the scope of the proposed approach.
The paper lacks clarity in defining its exact learning task. It is unclear whether the primary focus is on change point detection, structure inference, or both. Furthermore, the distinction between the proposed model and algorithm is ambiguous. The presentation could also be improved: the end of page 3 is difficult to follow, figures require larger font sizes and better color descriptions, and the discussion on computational cost versus tracking accuracy is domain-specific and lacks generalizability.
In terms of originality, the work appears incremental rather than groundbreaking. While the use of pooled p-values for weighting is a potentially novel aspect, it is not fully explained, leaving its contribution unclear. The algorithm's heuristic nature and reliance on existing structure learning methods (e.g., the PC algorithm) further limit its innovation.
The significance of the work is moderate. While LoSST may inspire future research on online structure learning, its heuristic approach and limited theoretical grounding reduce its potential to advance the state of the art. The results are promising but developmental, and the algorithm's applicability to rapidly changing structures or mixed datasets remains untested.
Pros:
- Addresses a relevant and challenging problem in online structure learning.
- Demonstrates promising results in simulations and a real-world application.
- Provides a practical algorithm that can operate in real-time.
Cons:
- Misleading claims about novelty and prior work.
- Lack of clarity in defining the learning task and contributions.
- Limited theoretical innovation and heuristic nature of the approach.
- Presentation issues and domain-specific discussions reduce accessibility.
In conclusion, while the paper makes a useful contribution to online structure learning, its incremental nature, lack of clarity, and presentation issues suggest it is not yet ready for acceptance in its current form. Revisions addressing these concerns could significantly strengthen the work.
