The paper presents a myopic approximation of the C-DAC (Context-Dependent Active Controller) algorithm for active visual search, aiming to balance computational efficiency with psychological plausibility. Building on prior work, the authors address the limitations of C-DAC's computational complexity by proposing a one-step look-ahead approximation that retains the context-sensitivity of the original model. The study compares the performance of C-DAC, its myopic variant, and Infomax, a cost-free statistical optimization algorithm, against human behavioral data from a visual search experiment. The results demonstrate that both C-DAC and myopic C-DAC outperform Infomax in capturing human-like behaviors, such as confirmation bias, while the myopic variant offers a more computationally feasible alternative.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Originality: The paper introduces a myopic approximation to C-DAC, which is a novel contribution to the field of active sensing. By reducing computational complexity while retaining context-sensitivity, the proposed model bridges the gap between theoretical rigor and psychological plausibility.
2. Empirical Validation: The authors provide experimental evidence comparing human behavior with the predictions of the models. The inclusion of behavioral metrics such as fixation choice and duration strengthens the paper's claims.
3. Theoretical Insights: The paper offers a stopping threshold bound for Infomax and myopic C-DAC, contributing to the theoretical understanding of decision boundaries in active sensing.
4. Clarity of Results: Figure 2 effectively illustrates the performance of the models across multiple dimensions of fit, highlighting the strengths of C-DAC and its myopic variant in capturing human-like confirmation bias.
Weaknesses:
1. Psychological Plausibility: While the myopic C-DAC is more plausible than the original C-DAC, the reviewer questions whether even this approximation fully aligns with human cognitive processes. Further discussion on this aspect would strengthen the paper.
2. Diagnostic Sets in Figure 2: The authors do not sufficiently explain why sets 9 and 1&3 are particularly diagnostic. Clarifying this would enhance the interpretability of the results.
3. Comparative Analysis: While the paper demonstrates the superiority of C-DAC and its myopic variant over Infomax, it would benefit from a deeper exploration of scenarios where Infomax might perform comparably or better, to provide a more balanced evaluation.
4. Scalability: Although the myopic approximation reduces complexity, its scalability to real-world, high-dimensional problems remains uncertain. This limitation warrants further discussion.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:
- Pro: The paper makes a significant contribution by proposing a computationally efficient, context-sensitive algorithm that aligns well with human behavior, advancing both theoretical and practical understanding of active sensing.
- Con: The psychological plausibility of the models and the lack of clarity regarding certain experimental results (e.g., diagnostic sets) leave room for improvement.
Recommendation: Overall, the paper is a strong scientific contribution that addresses a critical challenge in active sensing. While some aspects could be clarified or expanded, the strengths outweigh the weaknesses. I recommend acceptance, contingent on addressing the reviewer's concerns about psychological plausibility and the diagnostic sets in Figure 2.
