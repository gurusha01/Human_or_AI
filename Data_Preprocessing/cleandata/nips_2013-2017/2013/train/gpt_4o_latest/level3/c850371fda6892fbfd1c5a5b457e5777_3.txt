This paper introduces a general framework for designing differentially private online learning algorithms in both full information and bandit settings. By modifying the popular Follow The Approximate Leader (FTAL) algorithm, the authors propose private variants that achieve competitive regret bounds while ensuring rigorous privacy guarantees. The key innovation lies in maintaining differentially private running sums of gradients using a tree-based aggregation protocol, which enables efficient computation with logarithmic space and update time. The results improve upon prior work in the full information setting and represent the first private algorithms for the bandit setting, a significant contribution to the field.
Strengths:
1. Clarity and Motivation: The paper is well-written, clearly motivated, and provides a thorough discussion of its relation to prior work. The authors effectively situate their contributions within the broader literature, referencing seminal works and highlighting gaps their methods address.
2. Technical Soundness: The proposed algorithms appear technically sound, with regret bounds that match or approach the best-known nonprivate bounds up to logarithmic factors. The privacy guarantees are rigorously analyzed, and the use of the tree-based aggregation protocol is well-justified.
3. Novelty: While the paper does not represent a breakthrough, it introduces novel techniques for private online learning, particularly in the bandit setting, where no prior private algorithms existed. The adaptation of FTAL to the private setting is a meaningful contribution.
4. Practicality: The algorithms are computationally efficient, requiring only logarithmic space and update time, making them practical for large-scale applications.
Weaknesses:
1. Appendix Reliance: While the main text is clear, many technical details and proofs are relegated to the appendix. This makes it harder for readers to fully verify the results without extensive cross-referencing.
2. Regret Bounds: For general convex functions, the regret bounds in the bandit setting (Õ(T³/⁴)) lag behind the nonprivate counterparts (O(√T)), particularly for multi-arm and linear bandits. This gap limits the practical impact of the results in these scenarios.
3. Open Problems Placement: The discussion of open problems is insightful and engaging but is currently confined to the end of the paper. Moving this section to the main text would better highlight the broader implications and future directions of the work.
Recommendation:
I recommend accepting this paper for publication. While it is not a groundbreaking contribution, the ideas are novel, technically sound, and address an important problem in the field. The authors should consider moving the discussion of open problems to the main text to enhance the paper's impact.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Novel contributions to private online learning, especially in the bandit setting.
- Clear writing and strong contextualization within the literature.
- Rigorous privacy guarantees and competitive regret bounds.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Regret bounds for bandit settings are suboptimal compared to nonprivate algorithms.
- Heavy reliance on the appendix for technical details.
Overall, the paper makes a valuable contribution to the field and merits inclusion in the conference.
