The paper proposes a novel approach to reduce variance in stochastic gradient optimization by leveraging control variates, aiming to accelerate convergence. The authors demonstrate the method on two distinct problems: logistic regression (convex) and stochastic variational inference for latent Dirichlet allocation (non-convex). The results indicate faster convergence and improved performance compared to classical stochastic gradient methods.
Strengths:
The proposed method addresses a critical limitation of stochastic gradient optimization—high variance in noisy gradients—which often leads to slower convergence. By introducing control variates derived from low-order moments of the data, the authors present a generalizable and theoretically grounded approach. The method is particularly compelling given the widespread use of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in large-scale machine learning. The theoretical analysis is rigorous, and the empirical results on logistic regression and LDA demonstrate the potential of the approach. Additionally, the paper is well-structured and relatively easy to follow, with clear motivation and detailed derivations.
Weaknesses:
The empirical validation is limited in scope. For logistic regression, experiments are conducted on only one dataset (covtype), which raises concerns about the generalizability of the results. Similarly, the evaluation of LDA is restricted to predictive log-likelihood on three corpora without comparisons to other state-of-the-art variance reduction techniques. The absence of standard baselines, such as methods using varying mini-batch sizes or other variance reduction techniques (e.g., SVRG, SAGA), weakens the empirical claims. Furthermore, the related work section is incomplete, omitting key references such as Paisley et al. (2012) and Greensmith et al. (2004), which also explore variance reduction techniques. While the paper is generally clear, some explanations, such as the covariance estimation process and Figure 2, could benefit from further clarification.
Originality and Significance:
The approach is novel in its generality, extending the use of control variates to stochastic gradient optimization in both convex and non-convex settings. However, there is some overlap with prior work on control variates in Bayesian inference, and the paper does not sufficiently clarify its contributions over these methods. Despite these limitations, the method has significant potential for broad applicability and impact, particularly in large-scale machine learning.
Recommendation:
While the paper introduces a promising method with strong theoretical underpinnings, the limited empirical validation and missing comparisons to related work detract from its overall quality. To strengthen the contribution, the authors should:
1. Expand the experimental evaluation to include more datasets and standardized benchmarks.
2. Compare their method against other variance reduction techniques.
3. Address missing references and clarify the contributions over prior work.
4. Improve the clarity of certain explanations and figures.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The method is theoretically sound and addresses an important problem in stochastic optimization.
- The approach is generalizable and has potential for significant impact.
Arguments for Rejection:
- Limited empirical validation and missing baselines weaken the experimental claims.
- Incomplete coverage of related work and insufficient differentiation from prior methods.
Overall, the paper is a valuable contribution but requires substantial revisions to meet the standards of a top-tier conference. I recommend a weak reject with encouragement to resubmit after addressing the identified weaknesses.
