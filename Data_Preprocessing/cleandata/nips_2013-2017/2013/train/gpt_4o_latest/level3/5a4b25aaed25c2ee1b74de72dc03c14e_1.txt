This paper addresses the challenge of slow mixing in Gibbs sampling for pairwise Ising models with strong interactions by proposing a novel approach that projects the model parameters onto a fast-mixing parameter set. The authors aim to improve inference accuracy under limited sampling time by leveraging spectral norm constraints to ensure rapid mixing. The paper introduces multiple projection methods, including Euclidean distance, piecewise KL-divergence, and reverse KL-divergence, and evaluates their performance on small Ising models. While the idea of projecting onto fast-mixing models is innovative and unexplored in prior work, several concerns limit the broader applicability of the proposed approach.
Strengths:
1. Novelty: The concept of projecting onto the nearest rapidly mixing model is original and represents a fresh perspective on approximate inference. This approach departs from traditional variational methods by focusing on mixing time guarantees rather than structural tractability.
2. Theoretical Contributions: The paper provides a rigorous derivation of projection methods under different divergences and demonstrates how spectral norm constraints can ensure rapid mixing. The dual formulation for Euclidean projection is particularly elegant.
3. Empirical Comparisons: The experiments show that the proposed methods outperform standard variational techniques (e.g., mean-field, loopy belief propagation) in terms of marginal accuracy under finite sampling time, highlighting the practical utility of the approach in certain scenarios.
Weaknesses:
1. Scalability: The method's scalability to larger models is unclear. The computational cost of the projection step, particularly for stochastic gradient descent with repeated Gibbs sampling, is significant and not accounted for in the reported results. This omission undermines the claimed improvements in efficiency.
2. Experimental Limitations: The experiments are restricted to small toy models (e.g., 8Ã—8 grids and random graphs with 10 nodes). The absence of evaluations on larger or more complex models limits the generalizability of the findings.
3. Generalization: Extending the approach to general Markov random fields or non-binary state spaces remains an open question. The paper does not provide sufficient discussion on how the spectral norm bounds or projection algorithms would adapt to these cases.
4. Clarity Issues: While the paper is generally well-organized, it suffers from unproven claims (e.g., the looseness of the spectral norm bound), missing references, and inconsistent notation for KL divergence. These issues detract from the overall clarity and rigor.
5. Reverse KL Discussion: The significant difference in performance between mean-field error and reverse KL projection error is noted but not adequately explored, leaving a gap in the theoretical understanding of the method.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper introduces a novel and elegant approach to approximate inference, which could inspire future research in mixing time-aware methods.
- It provides a strong theoretical foundation and demonstrates promising results on small-scale models.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The lack of scalability and omission of projection time in the experiments raise concerns about the method's practicality.
- The limited experimental scope and unclear generalization to larger or more complex models reduce the paper's significance.
Recommendation:
While the paper presents an innovative idea with solid theoretical grounding, its practical impact is constrained by scalability concerns and limited experimental validation. I recommend rejection in its current form but encourage the authors to address these issues and resubmit. Specifically, future work should include experiments on larger models, account for projection costs, and explore extensions to general MRFs.
