This paper proposes a novel framework for achieving differential privacy in online learning algorithms, addressing both the full information and bandit settings. The authors introduce a new stability measure, (\(\beta1, \beta2, \delta\))-stability, to quantify performance stability under changes in training and validation datasets. The approach leverages the exponential mechanism and provides a utility bound, while a tree-based structure is used to compute differentially private partial sums of gradients with noise variance \(O(\log T)\). Two algorithms are presented: one for the full information model and another for the bandit setting. Both algorithms achieve significant improvements in regret bounds compared to prior work, with the full information model achieving \(O(\text{poly log } T)\) regret under strongly convex and L-Lipschitz cost functions, and the bandit setting achieving optimal regret bounds using a "one-shot gradient" technique.
Strengths:
1. Technical Contribution: The paper makes a substantial contribution by improving regret bounds for differentially private online learning. In the full information setting, the regret bounds approach those of non-private algorithms, which is a significant step forward.
2. Novelty: The introduction of (\(\beta1, \beta2, \delta\))-stability and the use of tree-based aggregation for private gradient computation are innovative and well-motivated.
3. Bandit Setting: The extension of differential privacy to the bandit setting, including the novel "one-shot gradient" technique, is a notable contribution, as this area has been underexplored.
4. Utility Guarantees: The theoretical analysis is rigorous, with clear utility guarantees for both algorithms, supported by well-defined privacy proofs.
5. Scalability: The algorithms are computationally efficient, with logarithmic space and update time, making them practical for large-scale applications.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity: The paper suffers from clarity issues in several sections. Key concepts, such as private instances, problem settings, and adversary types, are not defined with sufficient precision. Specific lines (e.g., 107, 229-232, 305) are unclear or inconsistent, which hampers readability.
2. Experimental Validation: The paper lacks empirical results to validate the theoretical claims. While the focus is on theoretical contributions, experimental evaluation would strengthen the paper's impact.
3. Comparison to Prior Work: Although the paper references prior work, the comparison could be more thorough. For instance, the improvements over Jain et al. (2012) and Dwork et al. (2010) are discussed, but the differences in practical scenarios are not fully elaborated.
4. Bandit Regret Bounds: While the regret bounds in the bandit setting are optimal under the given assumptions, they are still worse than non-private bounds for specific cases like multi-arm or linear bandits. This limitation is acknowledged but not addressed.
Recommendation:
Accept with Minor Revisions. The paper makes significant theoretical advancements in differentially private online learning, particularly in the full information and bandit settings. However, the clarity of exposition needs improvement, and the addition of experimental results would enhance the paper's overall quality. Addressing these issues would make the paper a strong contribution to the field.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Significant improvement in regret bounds for private online learning.
- Novel techniques, such as tree-based aggregation and "one-shot gradient," with rigorous theoretical guarantees.
- Addresses an important and challenging problem in differential privacy.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Lack of clarity in key sections, which may confuse readers.
- Absence of experimental validation to support theoretical claims.
- Limited discussion on practical implications of the proposed methods.
In conclusion, the paper is a valuable contribution to the field of differentially private online learning and aligns well with the conference's focus on advancing the state of the art in machine learning and privacy.
