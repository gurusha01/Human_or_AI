The paper introduces a novel supervised hybrid topic model, the Relevance Topic Model (RTM), designed for unstructured social activity recognition in web videos. It addresses two key challenges in this domain: the semantic gap between low-level features and class labels, and the scarcity of labeled training data. By integrating sparse Bayesian learning with the Replicated Softmax model, RTM jointly learns discriminative mid-level topic representations and a sparse classifier. The model's architecture combines an undirected component for video word distributions and a directed component for conditional class distributions, with an efficient variational EM algorithm proposed for parameter estimation and inference. The approach is evaluated on the Unstructured Social Activity Attribute (USAA) dataset, achieving state-of-the-art classification performance and demonstrating robustness, particularly in low-data scenarios.
Strengths:
1. Technical Soundness: The paper is technically robust, with well-defined mathematical formulations and a clear explanation of the RTM's architecture. The integration of sparse Bayesian learning and rectified linear units enhances the model's ability to handle complex video data.
2. Significance: The work addresses an important and challenging problemâ€”recognizing unstructured social activities in unconstrained videos. The results, particularly on the USAA dataset, show significant improvements over existing methods, highlighting the model's practical utility.
3. Clarity: The paper is well-organized and clearly written, with sufficient detail provided to reproduce the results. The inclusion of parameter estimation and inference methods is commendable.
4. Evaluation: The experimental results are thorough, comparing RTM against strong baselines and alternative supervised topic models (e.g., MedLDA, gClassRBM). The analysis of topic sparsity and multimodal extensions further strengthens the evaluation.
Weaknesses:
1. Originality: While the combination of sparse Bayesian learning and Replicated Softmax is novel, the overall approach of using supervised topic models for activity recognition is not entirely new. The originality is moderate, as similar ideas have been explored in prior work (e.g., MedLDA, gClassRBM).
2. Feature Representation: The reliance on low-level features (SIFT, STIP, MFCC) may limit the model's performance on more complex datasets. Exploring richer features, such as object detection or scene context, could enhance the model's applicability.
3. Minimal Supervision: While the paper justifies the use of minimal labeled data, it does not explicitly quantify the minimum amount of labeled data required for effective performance. This could be a valuable addition for practitioners.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:
- Pro: The paper presents a technically sound, well-evaluated, and significant contribution to the field of activity recognition, with clear improvements over existing methods.
- Con: The originality is moderate, and the reliance on low-level features may limit generalizability to more complex datasets.
Recommendation: Accept with minor revisions. The paper is a strong contribution to the field, but addressing the feature representation limitations and providing more insights into the minimal supervision requirements would further enhance its impact.
