This paper introduces a novel memory-efficient procedure for sampling from sparse data matrices in a streaming setting, using the spectral norm as a quality measure. The authors propose a sampling distribution that adapts to the sampling budget and provides provably near-optimal sparsification under mild assumptions. The method is designed to handle matrices too large to fit in memory, making it particularly relevant for big data applications, such as recommendation systems and large-scale text or image processing. The work builds on prior research in matrix sketching and random matrix theory, positioning itself as a significant improvement over existing L1- and L2-based sampling methods.
The paper is well-written and clearly organized, with strong theoretical foundations and practical relevance. The authors provide a thorough background, effectively situating their contributions within the broader literature. The experiments are well-executed, demonstrating that the proposed method outperforms or matches existing techniques across various datasets, including synthetic and real-world matrices like Wikipedia and Enron. The paper's primary strengths include its memory efficiency, competitive performance, and the practical adaptability of its sampling distribution to the available budget.
However, there are some weaknesses that should be addressed. The Proof Outline in Section 5 is unclear, with ambiguous connections between lemmas and the main theorem. This lack of clarity could hinder reproducibility and understanding for readers less familiar with the theoretical underpinnings. Additionally, Equation 7 is overly complex and would benefit from being split into two parts for better readability. Minor issues with notation, such as a potential typo in "matrices B_i" on page 4 and an unclear quadratic equation on page 6, should be corrected. The numerical inconsistency on page 7 also requires attention. Furthermore, the blue "Bernstein" line in the plots is difficult to distinguish, and adding arrows or more distinct markers would improve visualization.
Arguments for Acceptance:
1. Significance: The method addresses a critical problem in matrix sketching for streaming data, advancing the state of the art.
2. Originality: The adaptive sampling distribution and its theoretical guarantees are novel contributions.
3. Quality: The experimental results are robust and demonstrate clear improvements over existing methods.
4. Clarity: Despite minor issues, the paper is generally well-written and accessible.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
1. Clarity of Proofs: The theoretical section, particularly the Proof Outline, lacks clarity and could confuse readers.
2. Minor Errors: Notational inconsistencies and unclear equations detract from the paper's polish.
3. Visualization: Poor plot design could hinder the interpretation of experimental results.
Overall, this paper presents a strong contribution to the field of matrix sketching and is well-suited for publication after addressing the noted issues.
