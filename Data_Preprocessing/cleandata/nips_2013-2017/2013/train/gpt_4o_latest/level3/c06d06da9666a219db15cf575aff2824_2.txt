This paper presents a novel approach to learning the structure of Markov networks by formulating the problem as a large constraint satisfaction problem (CSP). The authors leverage a weighted CSP approach to identify the junction tree with the largest marginal likelihood, utilizing off-the-shelf CSP solvers such as MAXSAT, SMT, and ASP. A key contribution is the characterization of junction trees as cliques and separators over a balanced maximum weight spanning tree, introducing the concept of "balancing" to simplify the encoding of spanning trees. The paper also demonstrates the applicability of this approach on two datasets, achieving optimal solutions for one and providing new insights for the other.
Strengths:  
The paper is well-written, clearly organized, and provides a thorough theoretical foundation for the proposed method. The characterization of junction trees using a balancing condition is a novel contribution that simplifies the encoding of the problem and may have broader implications for junction tree algorithms. The use of Boolean constraint-solving techniques, which have not been widely applied to Markov network learning, is innovative and opens up new avenues for research. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the approach on small datasets, and the ability to compute globally optimal solutions is a significant achievement. The authors also provide a detailed comparison of different solver technologies, which adds value for practitioners considering similar approaches.
Weaknesses:  
The primary limitation of the proposed method is its scalability. The CSP formulation involves an exponential number of constraints, making it impractical for larger datasets or networks with many variables. While the authors acknowledge this limitation, the paper does not explore approximate or bounded CSP formulations that could improve tractability. Additionally, the use of uniform priors in the experiments may not reflect real-world scenarios where sparse or low-treewidth models are often preferred. Incorporating non-uniform priors remains an open question. The experimental evaluation, while thorough for small datasets, does not provide insights into how the method might perform on larger or more complex datasets.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:  
Pro:  
1. Novel and theoretically sound formulation of Markov network learning as a CSP.  
2. Introduction of the balancing condition for spanning trees is a significant contribution.  
3. Demonstrates the potential of Boolean constraint-solving techniques for this domain.  
4. Well-written and clearly presented, with detailed experiments and analysis.  
Con:  
1. Limited practical value due to scalability issues with the exponential number of constraints.  
2. Lack of exploration of approximate or heuristic methods to address tractability.  
3. Experiments are restricted to small datasets, limiting generalizability.  
Recommendation:  
While the paper's scalability issues limit its immediate practical impact, its theoretical contributions and novel use of CSP techniques make it a valuable addition to the field. I recommend acceptance, with the suggestion that the authors explore approximate formulations and non-uniform priors in future work.
