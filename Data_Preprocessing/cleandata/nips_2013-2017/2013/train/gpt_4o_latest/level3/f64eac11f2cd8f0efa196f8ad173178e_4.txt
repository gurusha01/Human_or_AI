This paper presents an adaptive step size policy-gradient reinforcement learning method by deriving and maximizing a lower bound on the expected performance gain. The authors focus on Gaussian policies and provide a theoretical framework for automatic step size selection, which is a significant contribution to the reinforcement learning literature. The paper builds on prior work in policy gradient methods, such as REINFORCE and PGT, and addresses a critical yet underexplored issue: the impact of step size on convergence speed and stability. The theoretical derivations are rigorous, and the authors demonstrate how their approach guarantees performance improvement at each step under certain conditions.
Strengths:  
The paper makes a strong theoretical contribution by deriving principled frameworks for step size selection. The authors provide general results that are applicable to various policy representations and gradient estimators, which could have broad implications for reinforcement learning research. The clarity of the mathematical derivations is commendable, and the paper is well-organized and well-written, making it accessible to readers familiar with policy gradient methods. The use of Gaussian policies as a case study is appropriate, as it allows for closed-form solutions and practical insights into the proposed method. Additionally, the authors highlight the relationship between policy variance and step size, which is an important observation for practitioners.
Weaknesses:  
The empirical evaluation is limited to a toy problem (linear-quadratic Gaussian regulation), which restricts the practical applicability of the results. While the adaptive method outperforms fixed step sizes for high policy variance, it underperforms for low variance, raising questions about its robustness. Furthermore, the empirical results lack comparison to relevant baseline methods, such as expectation-maximization-based policy gradient approaches. This omission makes it difficult to assess the broader applicability and competitiveness of the proposed method. Another limitation is the persistent large errors in gradient estimation, even with increased trajectories, which result in loose bounds and limited practical implications. The authors acknowledge these issues but do not provide concrete solutions or directions for improvement.
Arguments for Acceptance:  
- Strong theoretical contributions with potential to influence future research.  
- Clear and rigorous mathematical derivations.  
- Addresses an important and underexplored problem in reinforcement learning.
Arguments Against Acceptance:  
- Limited empirical validation with mixed results.  
- Lack of comparison to relevant baseline methods.  
- Practical implications are constrained by loose bounds and gradient estimation errors.
Overall Assessment:  
This is a high-quality paper with significant theoretical contributions, but its empirical validation is preliminary and limited. While the paper advances the state of the art in step size selection for policy gradient methods, its practical impact remains unclear. I recommend acceptance if the conference prioritizes theoretical contributions, but stronger empirical results and baseline comparisons would be necessary for broader impact.
