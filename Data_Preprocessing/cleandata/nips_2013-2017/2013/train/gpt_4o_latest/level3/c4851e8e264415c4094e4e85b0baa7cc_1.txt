The paper proposes a novel supervised topic model, the Relevance Topic Model (RTM), for video classification, particularly targeting the challenging task of recognizing unstructured social group activities in web videos. The authors extend the Replicated Softmax model by incorporating sparse Bayesian learning and rectified linear units (ReLUs) to enhance the expressiveness of latent topics and improve classification performance. A variational inference framework is developed to make the learning process tractable. The model is evaluated on the Unstructured Social Activity Attribute (USAA) dataset, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance, especially in scenarios with limited labeled training data.
Strengths
The paper addresses an important and challenging problem in video classification, particularly the recognition of complex social group activities with limited training examples. The proposed RTM is technically sound, with a well-motivated integration of sparse Bayesian learning and ReLUs into the Replicated Softmax framework. The derivation of a variational bound for inference is rigorous and leverages the semi-conjugacy between ReLUs and Gaussian likelihoods effectively. The experimental results are compelling, showing that RTM outperforms existing supervised topic models (e.g., MedLDA and gClassRBM) and baseline methods, particularly in low-data regimes. The sparsity of the learned relevance topics is a notable strength, as it enhances generalization and robustness. The extension to multimodal data is another valuable contribution, demonstrating the model's flexibility.
Weaknesses
While the technical contributions are strong, the paper lacks broader evaluation on datasets beyond the USAA dataset. This limits the generalizability of the findings and the claim that RTM is a generic approach. Additionally, the model is not specifically tailored to social group activity recognition, which weakens its motivation for this particular application. The authors could have explored more baselines, especially recent deep learning-based approaches, to provide a more comprehensive comparison. The clarity of the paper could also be improved, particularly in the mathematical derivations, which may be difficult for non-expert readers to follow. Finally, while the sparsity of relevance topics is discussed, the interpretability of these topics in the context of social group activities is not explored in depth.
Arguments for Acceptance
1. The paper addresses a significant and underexplored problem in video classification.
2. The proposed RTM is technically novel and well-founded, with rigorous derivations and a tractable inference framework.
3. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, particularly in low-data scenarios.
4. The approach is flexible and can handle multimodal data effectively.
Arguments Against Acceptance
1. The evaluation is limited to a single dataset, raising concerns about generalizability.
2. The approach is not specifically tailored to the problem of social group activity recognition, which weakens its motivation.
3. The paper lacks comparisons with more recent deep learning-based methods.
4. Some parts of the paper, particularly the mathematical derivations, could be clearer.
Recommendation
Overall, this paper makes a meaningful contribution to video classification and supervised topic modeling. However, its impact would be significantly strengthened by broader evaluations and additional baselines. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions, focusing on improving clarity and expanding the experimental evaluation.
