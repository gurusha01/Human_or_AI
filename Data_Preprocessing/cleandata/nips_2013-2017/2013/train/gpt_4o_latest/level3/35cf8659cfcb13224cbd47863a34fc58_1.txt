This paper introduces a novel Bayesian nonparametric model, Bayesian Hierarchical Community Discovery (BHCD), for uncovering hierarchical community structures in social networks. The proposed method extends the Infinite Relational Model (IRM) by leveraging ideas from Bayesian rose trees to define a tree-structured mixture of stochastic blockmodels. The authors employ a greedy agglomerative procedure to efficiently learn the hierarchy, achieving a computational complexity of \(O(n^2 \log n)\), which is independent of the number of nested communities. This approach addresses the scalability challenges of existing Bayesian nonparametric models, particularly for dense networks.
Strengths
The paper is well-written and provides a clear exposition of the proposed method. By adapting ideas from Bayesian rose trees to relational data, the authors present a novel approach that achieves comparable predictive performance to IRM while being two orders of magnitude faster. The experiments on Sampson's monastery network and the NIPS co-authorship datasets demonstrate the method's ability to uncover meaningful hierarchical structures and make accurate predictions. The inclusion of both qualitative and quantitative results strengthens the paper's claims. Additionally, the authors provide a detailed comparison of BHCD's computational efficiency with other Bayesian nonparametric methods, highlighting its scalability advantages.
The proposed method is significant as it addresses a critical challenge in scaling Bayesian nonparametric models for network data. The hierarchical structure discovered by BHCD has potential applications in various domains, such as social network analysis and biological networks. The paper also thoughtfully discusses limitations and potential future directions, such as improving scalability for sparse networks and exploring non-conjugate likelihoods.
Weaknesses
While the paper demonstrates scalability improvements over IRM, it does not provide timing results or scalability analysis for real-world networks with tens of thousands of nodes. This omission makes it challenging to assess the method's practical applicability to very large networks, such as social or gene networks. Additionally, the greedy agglomerative procedure lacks a theoretical analysis of how close it gets to the optimal tree. Exploring properties like submodularity could strengthen the theoretical foundation of the method.
Minor issues include grammatical errors (e.g., "pair of trees" and "a fruitful next step") that should be corrected for clarity. Furthermore, while the authors acknowledge that BHCD's performance depends on hyperparameter settings, they do not provide a systematic analysis or guidelines for choosing these parameters.
Recommendation
Overall, this paper makes a valuable contribution to the field of network modeling by proposing an efficient and interpretable method for hierarchical community discovery. Despite some scalability concerns and the lack of theoretical guarantees for the greedy procedure, the method's computational efficiency and demonstrated performance make it a strong candidate for acceptance. Addressing the scalability and theoretical concerns in future work could further enhance the impact of this research. I recommend acceptance, with minor revisions to address the noted issues.
