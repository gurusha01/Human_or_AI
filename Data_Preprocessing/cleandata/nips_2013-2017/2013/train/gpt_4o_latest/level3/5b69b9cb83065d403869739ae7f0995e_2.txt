The paper presents a novel algorithm for low-rank matrix reconstruction using Belief Propagation (BP) message-passing within a Bayesian framework. The authors extend Approximate Message Passing (AMP) algorithms to handle general-rank cases and incorporate Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) estimation, which is a notable contribution. The algorithm is also applied to clustering by framing it as a low-rank matrix reconstruction problem, outperforming Lloyd's K-means algorithm in numerical experiments. This work represents the first application of BP to matrix factorization, filling a niche in the field.
Strengths:
1. Algorithmic Contribution: The paper introduces an innovative extension of AMP algorithms, enabling MAP estimation and addressing a broader class of low-rank matrix reconstruction problems. This is a meaningful step forward in leveraging BP for such tasks.
2. Clustering Application: Reformulating clustering as a low-rank matrix reconstruction problem is compelling, and the experimental results demonstrate the algorithm's superiority over Lloyd's K-means in specific scenarios.
3. Efficiency: The proposed algorithm has a computational cost linear in the matrix size, making it scalable for large datasets. The state evolution framework for performance prediction is also a valuable addition.
4. Experimental Results: The algorithm shows promising results on both artificial and real datasets, particularly in clustering tasks, where it achieves better K-means loss and accuracy compared to baseline methods.
Weaknesses:
1. Evaluation Limitations: The experiments are conducted on non-standard datasets, and the absence of widely recognized benchmarks like the Netflix dataset limits the generalizability of the results. This omission makes it difficult to assess the algorithm's performance on conventional problems.
2. Validity of Assumptions: The algorithm relies on approximations assuming large matrix dimensions, but these assumptions are not rigorously validated. This raises concerns about the robustness of the method in practical, finite-dimensional settings.
3. Clarity and Accessibility: The derivation of the algorithm is relegated to the supplementary material, and the main text is dense with cumbersome notation. This hinders accessibility for readers unfamiliar with the technical details of BP or AMP.
4. Citation Gaps: The paper inadequately cites prior work on matrix factorization for clustering and Expectation Propagation (EP). The relationship between the proposed method and EP is not clearly articulated, which could confuse readers about its novelty.
5. Algorithm Novelty: While the algorithm is new, it is not groundbreaking. It represents a straightforward application of BP with some interesting approximations, but lacks transformative insights.
Recommendation:
The paper makes a meaningful contribution by being the first to apply BP to matrix factorization and proposing an efficient AMP-based algorithm for clustering. However, significant improvements are needed in clarity, evaluation, and scholarship. Specifically, the authors should:
- Test the algorithm on standard datasets to enhance its relevance.
- Validate the large-dimensional approximations more rigorously.
- Improve the exposition by simplifying the notation, providing more diagrams, and integrating key derivations into the main text.
- Address citation gaps and clarify the relationship to EP.
In its current state, the paper is borderline for acceptance. While the algorithm is interesting and fills a niche, the lack of clarity and rigorous evaluation limits its impact. If the authors address these issues, the paper could become a valuable contribution to the field.
