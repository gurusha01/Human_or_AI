This paper investigates the estimation of probability distributions under local differential privacy constraints, providing a rigorous minimax analysis of the trade-offs between privacy and statistical efficiency. The authors derive sharp lower bounds on convergence rates using Fano/LeCam-style arguments and complement these with matching upper bounds, demonstrating that randomized response is an optimal strategy for multinomial estimation under certain conditions. Additionally, the paper extends its analysis to density estimation, revealing that local privacy imposes a more severe penalty on convergence rates compared to the classical setting. The authors also propose practical, privacy-preserving estimation strategies, including randomized response for multinomial estimation and orthogonal series estimators for density estimation, both of which achieve the derived minimax rates.
Strengths:
1. Theoretical Rigor and Contributions: The paper provides a comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding the impact of local privacy on statistical estimation. The derivation of sharp minimax rates and the identification of randomized response as optimal for multinomial estimation are significant contributions.
2. Practical Relevance: The proposed estimation strategies, particularly the randomized response mechanism, are practical and computationally efficient, making the results applicable to real-world privacy-preserving data analysis.
3. Novelty: The work bridges minimax decision theory and local differential privacy, offering new insights into the trade-offs between privacy and utility. The extension to density estimation under local privacy is particularly noteworthy.
4. Clarity in Mathematical Derivations: The mathematical rigor and detailed proofs enhance the paper's credibility and provide a solid foundation for its claims.
Weaknesses:
1. Commentary and Clarity: The discussion of results, particularly the necessity of the restriction on α in Theorem 1, is insufficiently precise. This could confuse readers unfamiliar with the nuances of local privacy.
2. Connections to Related Work: The paper lacks adequate discussion of its relationship to existing work on differential privacy, such as Lei's M-estimation procedure and other histogram-based approaches. This omission weakens the contextualization of its contributions.
3. Overly Broad Statements: Some claims about differential privacy are overly general and risk misinterpretation, particularly given the paper's focus on local privacy, which differs significantly from the global differential privacy model.
4. Utility Measures: The paper would benefit from a more detailed discussion of how different choices of ρ (utility measures) influence the results, providing greater clarity for practitioners.
5. Population vs. Sample Statistics: The distinction between population and sample statistics is not clearly explained upfront, which could confuse readers about the scope of the results.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper makes significant theoretical contributions to the field of privacy-preserving statistical inference.
- It provides practical, optimal strategies for estimation under local privacy, which are likely to influence future research and applications.
- The mathematical rigor and novelty of the results align well with the standards of the conference.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The lack of connections to related work and insufficient contextualization of contributions may hinder the paper's accessibility and impact.
- The commentary on results is imprecise in places, and some claims are overly broad, which could lead to misinterpretation.
Recommendation:
While the paper has notable strengths in terms of theoretical contributions and practical relevance, the weaknesses in clarity and contextualization need to be addressed. I recommend acceptance conditional on revisions to improve the discussion of related work, clarify the commentary on results, and refine overly broad statements about differential privacy.
