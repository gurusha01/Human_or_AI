The paper introduces a novel tensor factorization approach for parameter estimation in Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) with sparse, non-sequential observations. This work extends prior research by Anandkumar et al. by identifying a tensor factorization structure that enables the recovery of transition distributions from expectations over sums of transition distributions. The authors provide formal guarantees for learning both first-order Markov models and HMMs in a non-sequential setting, supported by theoretical analysis and preliminary simulations. The key contribution lies in adapting spectral learning methods to a challenging problem setting, offering a provable alternative to traditional Expectation-Maximization (EM) approaches, which often involve non-convex optimization.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Originality: The paper addresses a significant gap in the literature by providing the first formal guarantees for learning dynamic models from non-sequential data. The approach is innovative and demonstrates a thoughtful extension of tensor decomposition techniques to a novel problem domain.
2. Theoretical Contributions: The authors rigorously derive key results, including the ability to recover transition distributions and sample complexity bounds. Theorems are supported by detailed proofs in the appendices.
3. Preliminary Validation: Toy simulations qualitatively align with theoretical bounds, showcasing the feasibility of the proposed method.
4. Potential Impact: The work has broad applicability to real-world problems, such as modeling biological processes or chronic diseases, where sequential data is often unavailable.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity and Organization: The paper could benefit from defining the problem and model earlier in the introduction to provide better context for readers unfamiliar with the domain. Additionally, the extensive review of tensor decomposition methods in Section 2 could be condensed to allocate more space for the novel contributions.
2. Theoretical Intuition: While the theorems are mathematically sound, they lack sufficient intuition about their implications. For instance, Theorem 3 could be better explained in terms of its practical significance and the conditions under which it holds.
3. Experimental Evaluation: The experimental results are limited to toy simulations and do not include comparisons with baseline methods such as EM or applications to real-world datasets. This omission weakens the empirical validation of the proposed approach.
4. Ambiguity in Section 3.1: The assumption that the model involves $N$ i.i.d. replicates is not clearly stated, which could lead to confusion for readers.
5. Minor Issues: Notational inconsistencies, such as the placement of primes above subscripts in $M2$ and $M3$, detract from the paper's polish.
Recommendation:
While the paper makes a significant theoretical contribution, its clarity and empirical evaluation need improvement. The authors should focus on:
1. Defining the problem and model earlier in the manuscript.
2. Providing more intuitive explanations for the theorems.
3. Including comparisons with EM and experiments on real-world data to strengthen the empirical validation.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper addresses a challenging and underexplored problem with a novel approach.
- Theoretical guarantees and sample complexity results are valuable contributions to the field.
- The method has potential applications in diverse domains.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Limited empirical evaluation weakens the practical impact of the work.
- The paper's clarity and organization could hinder accessibility to a broader audience.
- The lack of comparisons with baseline methods leaves open questions about the approach's relative performance.
Overall Assessment:
The paper is a strong theoretical contribution to the field of spectral learning and tensor decomposition. However, its practical relevance and accessibility could be improved with better organization, more intuitive explanations, and comprehensive empirical evaluation. I recommend acceptance contingent on revisions addressing these issues.
