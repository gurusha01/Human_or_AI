The paper addresses the critical problem of sparse recovery in high-dimensional linear regression, particularly under the challenging scenario of correlated covariates in the measurement matrix. This is an important topic with applications in areas such as gene expression analysis and signal processing. The authors propose SWAP, a novel wrapper algorithm that iteratively refines the support set identified by standard sparse recovery methods like Lasso. By swapping variables to minimize a loss function, SWAP aims to improve recovery accuracy in cases where traditional methods struggle due to high covariate correlations.
Strengths:  
The paper tackles a well-motivated and practically relevant problem. SWAP is simple yet effective, as demonstrated by its superior performance over state-of-the-art algorithms on both synthetic and real datasets. The theoretical guarantees provided for SWAP are a notable contribution, particularly the conditions under which it can recover the true support with high probability. The empirical results, especially on gene expression datasets, highlight SWAP's practical utility in high-dimensional settings. Moreover, the authors emphasize SWAP's compatibility with existing sparse recovery methods, making it a versatile tool.
Weaknesses:  
The paper's novelty is somewhat limited, as SWAP heavily relies on the quality of the initial support set. This dependence necessitates sophisticated initialization methods, which can increase runtime and introduce errors, especially when the true support size is unknown. Additionally, the results presentation is suboptimal. Figures are poorly explained, with missing definitions, confusing descriptions, and errors in captions, making it difficult to interpret the findings. Sparse recovery probabilities for practical applications are also not reported, leaving gaps in understanding SWAP's real-world applicability. Furthermore, the paper lacks a comparison to other wrapper methods, which would better contextualize its performance. Minor issues, such as unclear runtime complexity claims, contradictory remarks, grammatical errors, and poorly written sections (e.g., Section 5.1), detract from the paper's overall clarity and polish.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:  
Pros:  
1. Addresses an important and challenging problem.  
2. Demonstrates strong empirical performance on synthetic and real datasets.  
3. Provides theoretical guarantees for sparse recovery under correlated covariates.  
4. Compatible with existing sparse recovery methods, enhancing its practical utility.  
Cons:  
1. Limited novelty due to reliance on initial support quality.  
2. Poor results presentation and lack of comparison to other wrapper methods.  
3. Sparse recovery probabilities for real-world applications are not reported.  
4. Clarity and organization issues, including poorly written sections and grammatical errors.  
Overall Assessment:  
While the paper addresses an important problem and demonstrates practical effectiveness, its limited novelty, reliance on initialization, and issues with clarity and results presentation make it unsuitable for acceptance at a top-tier conference like NeurIPS in its current form. However, with significant revisions, particularly in results presentation and comparisons, it could be a valuable contribution to the field.
