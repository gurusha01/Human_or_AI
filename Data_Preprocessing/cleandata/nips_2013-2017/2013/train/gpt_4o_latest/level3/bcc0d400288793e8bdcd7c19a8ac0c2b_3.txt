This paper investigates how humans guide information search in visual displays by comparing the C-DAC (Context-Dependent Active Controller) model to the Infomax policy. The authors argue that C-DAC, which incorporates behavioral costs and task-specific considerations, aligns more closely with human behavior than Infomax, which optimizes abstract statistical objectives. The paper introduces a myopic approximation to C-DAC, reducing computational complexity while retaining context sensitivity. While the simulations provide intriguing insights, the lack of accompanying human experimental results for the later simulations weakens the overall evaluation of the models.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Originality: The paper builds on prior work by introducing a computationally efficient myopic variant of C-DAC and comparing it to Infomax in the context of human active sensing. This is a meaningful contribution to the field of active vision and decision-making models.
2. Relevance to Human Behavior: The study highlights the importance of behavioral costs, such as time and switching penalties, in modeling human active sensing. The confirmation bias captured by C-DAC and its myopic variant is an important psychological phenomenon, and the paper's focus on this aspect is commendable.
3. Interesting Predictions: The simulations provide experimentally testable predictions, which could guide future research in both neuroscience and artificial intelligence.
4. Theoretical Contributions: The authors propose a stopping boundary for Infomax, which is a novel addition to the literature and addresses some of its limitations.
Weaknesses:
1. Insufficient Human Data: While the paper includes a case study comparing C-DAC and Infomax to human behavior, the later simulations lack corresponding human experimental results. This omission undermines the claims about the superiority of C-DAC and its myopic variant.
2. Unclear Framing: The claim that C-DAC is "context-sensitive" is not convincingly demonstrated in the case study. The relevance of this framing could be better articulated with stronger empirical evidence.
3. Evaluation Limitations: The evaluation of C-DAC relies on a limited set of dependent variables, and the model includes a high number of parameters, raising concerns about overfitting and generalizability.
4. Premature Submission: The paper feels incomplete without human data to validate the later simulations. Including these results would significantly strengthen the paper's contributions.
5. Clarity and Presentation Issues: The paper suffers from unclear terminology, inconsistent formatting, and labeling errors in the text and figures, which detract from its readability.
Recommendation:
While the paper addresses an important problem and provides interesting theoretical contributions, it is not yet ready for publication. The lack of human experimental results for the later simulations and the insufficient evaluation of C-DAC weaken its scientific rigor. The authors should focus on collecting additional human data, refining the framing of C-DAC's context sensitivity, and addressing clarity issues before resubmitting.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Novel contributions to active sensing models.
- Theoretical insights into stopping boundaries and context sensitivity.
- Potential to inspire future experimental and computational research.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Lack of human data for later simulations.
- Insufficient evaluation of C-DAC's claims.
- Presentation issues and unclear framing.
Final Decision: Reject, but encourage resubmission after addressing the outlined weaknesses.
