The paper introduces "decision jungles," a novel approach that leverages rooted directed acyclic graphs (RDAGs) as an alternative to traditional decision trees in machine learning. The authors argue that decision jungles address the exponential memory growth issue of decision trees by allowing multiple paths to each node, thereby reducing model complexity while improving generalization. Two node-merging algorithms are proposed to optimize both the structure and features of the RDAGs during training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that decision jungles outperform standard decision forests and baseline methods in terms of memory efficiency and generalization across various datasets, including computer vision tasks and UCI benchmarks.
Strengths
1. Novelty and Practical Contribution: The use of RDAGs introduces a fresh perspective on decision tree ensembles, offering a new form of regularization that is both theoretically and practically significant. The memory efficiency of decision jungles is particularly valuable for resource-constrained environments like mobile or embedded systems.
2. Thorough Experimentation: The paper provides comprehensive experimental results across multiple datasets, including semantic segmentation and UCI benchmarks. The results convincingly demonstrate the advantages of decision jungles in terms of memory usage and generalization.
3. Technical Soundness: The proposed algorithms (LSearch and ClusterSearch) are well-motivated and rigorously evaluated. The experiments are detailed, and the comparisons to baseline methods are fair and informative.
4. Significance: The work addresses a critical limitation of decision trees—exponential memory growth—and provides a scalable solution. This contribution is likely to influence future research and applications in machine learning.
Weaknesses
1. Overstatement of Generality: The introduction and abstract overstate the generality of the similarity between RDAGs and binary decision trees. While the connection is valid, the claims should be tempered to avoid misleading readers about the scope of the contribution.
2. Clarity Issues: The abbreviation "DAG," though standard, is not defined upon its first occurrence, which could confuse readers unfamiliar with the term. Additionally, some sections, particularly those describing the optimization algorithms, could benefit from clearer explanations or visual aids.
3. Limited Discussion of Limitations: While the experiments are robust, the paper does not sufficiently discuss potential limitations of decision jungles, such as increased computational complexity during training or scenarios where RDAGs may underperform compared to trees.
Recommendation
I recommend acceptance of this paper, as its contributions are both novel and impactful. However, the authors should address the following points to improve the manuscript:
1. Tone down the claims in the introduction and abstract to align with the demonstrated results.
2. Define "DAG" upon its first use and improve the clarity of the optimization algorithm descriptions.
3. Include a brief discussion of the limitations of decision jungles, particularly in terms of training complexity.
