The paper presents a novel approach to learning Gaussian copulas with transformed marginals, introducing a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) sampler that efficiently handles linear constraints through trajectory "bouncing." This work builds on the extended rank likelihood framework of Hoff (2007) and addresses the computational challenges inherent in sampling from constrained Gaussian fields. The authors claim that their HMC-based method improves mixing and convergence compared to Hoff's Gibbs sampling algorithm, particularly in high-dimensional settings.
Strengths:
1. Originality and Technical Soundness: The paper introduces a significant innovation by adapting HMC to the Gaussian copula extended rank likelihood model. The use of the Hough envelope algorithm to reduce computational complexity from \(O(n^2)\) to \(O(n)\) is particularly noteworthy. The method is technically sound, with clear mathematical derivations and a well-structured algorithm.
2. Empirical Performance: The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of HMC over Hoff's algorithm in terms of convergence speed and posterior exploration, even for small datasets. The authors provide detailed comparisons and highlight the risks of overconfidence in Hoff's parameter expansion (PX) approach.
3. Significance: The work addresses a challenging problem in Bayesian inference and has potential applications in dimensionality reduction, clustering, and other machine learning tasks involving discrete variables. The method also offers broader insights into MCMC sampling in constrained spaces.
Weaknesses:
1. Fairness of Comparisons: While the authors claim superior performance for HMC, the empirical results raise concerns about fairness. Specifically, HMC is run for only 1,000 steps, while Hoff's algorithm is run for 2,000 steps. This discrepancy could bias the results in favor of HMC. Extended runs or additional analysis to confirm unimodality and convergence would strengthen the claims.
2. Computational Expense: The authors acknowledge that HMC is approximately 50 times slower than Hoff's algorithm. While they argue that HMC's improved mixing compensates for this overhead, a more thorough discussion of relative efficiency and practical trade-offs is needed. For instance, how does the computational cost scale with increasing sample size or dimensionality?
3. Presentation Issues: The paper suffers from minor presentation flaws, such as delayed citation of Hoff's foundational work and excessive reliance on footnotes. Moving key footnotes into the main text would improve readability and clarity.
Recommendation:
The paper is technically sound, original, and addresses a significant problem in machine learning. However, the concerns about fairness in empirical comparisons and computational expense warrant further clarification. I recommend acceptance, provided the authors address these issues in a revised version. Specifically, they should:
1. Extend the HMC runs to match Hoff's step count or provide additional convergence diagnostics.
2. Include a more detailed discussion of computational trade-offs and practical implications.
3. Revise the manuscript to improve clarity and presentation.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Novel and technically robust contribution to Gaussian copula modeling.
- Demonstrates clear advantages in mixing and convergence.
- Addresses a challenging and impactful problem in Bayesian inference.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Potential bias in empirical comparisons due to unequal step counts.
- Limited discussion of computational efficiency and scalability.
- Minor presentation issues that detract from clarity.
Overall, this paper represents a valuable contribution to the field, but revisions are necessary to address the identified weaknesses.
