The paper presents a method for calculating firing rates in tightly balanced spiking neural networks by framing network dynamics as a quadratic programming optimization problem. This approach builds on prior work, particularly Bourdoukan et al. (NIPS 2012), by interpreting balanced network activity as an algorithm for optimizing signal representation. The authors claim that their method avoids linearizing assumptions and directly identifies the non-linear relationship between firing rates, input, connectivity, and network function. They explore the computational implications of monotonic and bump-shaped tuning curves and examine the effects of tuning curve inhomogeneity on signal representation.
Strengths:
1. Clarity and Writing: The paper is generally well-written and organized, making it accessible to readers with a background in computational neuroscience. The mathematical derivations and simulations are presented clearly, and the figures effectively illustrate key points.
2. Technical Soundness: The derivation of firing rates using quadratic programming is mathematically rigorous, and the results are validated against network simulations. The authors also provide a detailed discussion of the implications of their findings for neural computation.
3. Potential Applications: The proposed framework has potential utility in analyzing experimental neural data and studying the effects of neural damage on computation, which broadens its relevance.
Weaknesses:
1. Limited Novelty: The conceptual advance over Bourdoukan et al. (2012) is minimal. Section 2 largely replicates prior findings, and the novelty is restricted to the explicit calculation of firing rates, which was partially addressed in earlier work. The authors do not sufficiently clarify how their approach significantly extends the state of the art.
2. Biological Applicability: The assumption of a balanced network with equal numbers of inputs and neurons may limit the model's applicability to real neural circuits, which often exhibit divergence and convergence. This raises concerns about the generalizability of the results.
3. Minor Issues: There are errors and inconsistencies, such as the incorrect integration limit in Eq. 3 and the unclear representation of spikes in Figure 1. Additionally, the claims about nonlinearity in Figure 1c require further justification.
Pro and Con Arguments:
- Pro: The paper provides a rigorous mathematical framework for calculating firing rates in balanced networks, which could be valuable for theoretical and experimental neuroscience. The exploration of tuning curve inhomogeneity is particularly interesting and challenges conventional assumptions.
- Con: The novelty is limited, and the biological relevance of the model is questionable. The paper does not sufficiently differentiate itself from prior work, and some technical issues detract from its overall quality.
Recommendation:
While the paper is technically sound and explores an interesting problem, its limited novelty and concerns about biological applicability reduce its impact. I recommend rejection unless the authors can significantly clarify their contributions beyond prior work and address the issues raised above.
