This paper introduces a Bayesian framework for state and parameter estimation in nonlinear state-space models (SSMs) by leveraging a Gaussian Process (GP) prior for learning transition dynamics. The authors propose a novel inference mechanism using Particle Markov Chain Monte Carlo (PMCMC) with ancestor sampling, enabling efficient marginalization of the transition dynamics. The paper also addresses computational challenges by incorporating sparsity and low-rank Cholesky updates, achieving significant efficiency gains. 
The work is technically robust and well-presented, with a clear exposition of the methodology and its theoretical underpinnings. The use of ancestor sampling for online marginalization of transition dynamics is a particularly novel contribution, addressing the non-Markovian dependencies introduced by marginalizing the GP. Additionally, the consideration of computational aspects, such as sparse GP models and efficient matrix updates, strengthens the practical applicability of the approach.
The empirical results, while brief, are sufficient to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method. The experiments on a nonlinear benchmark system and a cart-and-pole system highlight the model's ability to capture complex dynamics and provide uncertainty-aware predictions. However, the paper would benefit from additional discussion on out-of-sample prediction performance, particularly in comparison to parametric models. Clarifying whether the RMSE values in Table 1 reflect out-of-sample predictions or conditioned data is necessary, as this impacts the interpretation of the results. Including an RMSE column for forward-time forecasts against withheld data would further enhance the empirical evaluation.
The paper's originality lies in its combination of GP priors with PMCMC and ancestor sampling, which advances the state of the art in Bayesian inference for SSMs. The authors could expand on the trade-offs between parametric transition models and GP-based mean functions, especially for forecasting tasks. This would provide valuable insights for practitioners deciding between these approaches.
A minor issue is the premature use of the abbreviation CPF-AS before its definition, which could momentarily confuse readers. Addressing this would improve clarity. 
Strengths:
1. Novel and technically sound approach for Bayesian inference in nonlinear SSMs.
2. Efficient computational techniques, including sparsity and Cholesky updates.
3. Clear presentation of methodology and theoretical contributions.
4. Empirical results demonstrate the model's flexibility and predictive capabilities.
Weaknesses:
1. Limited discussion on out-of-sample prediction performance.
2. Ambiguity in RMSE reporting in Table 1.
3. Minor clarity issue with premature abbreviation usage.
Recommendation:
This paper is a strong contribution to the field and is likely to inspire further research on inference methods for non-Markovian models. I recommend acceptance, contingent on addressing the minor clarity issues and expanding the discussion on out-of-sample predictions.
