This paper introduces a novel expectation propagation (EP)-type inference algorithm for continuous-time stochastic dynamical systems, specifically targeting Gaussian Markov process models with mixed discrete and continuous-time likelihoods. The authors extend the classical Kalman-Bucy smoothing procedure to handle non-Gaussian observations, enabling applications in areas such as spiking neuronal models and box likelihood models. The theoretical contributions are significant, as the paper demonstrates that the continuous-time limit of EP updates reduces to variational updates, resulting in a hybrid fixed-point iteration scheme. Additionally, the authors propose post-inference correction methods to improve marginal approximations. These contributions represent a meaningful advancement in the field of continuous-time inference, addressing a challenging problem that has been largely unexplored in the statistical machine learning community.
The paper is well-structured and clearly written, with a strong theoretical foundation. The derivations are rigorous, and the connections to prior work, such as Kalman-Bucy smoothing and variational inference, are well-articulated. The novelty of the approach is evident, as it bridges discrete and continuous-time inference within a unified framework. The proposed method also offers computational advantages, particularly in scenarios with unevenly spaced observations, as highlighted in the neural spike train application.
However, the experimental section is a notable weakness. While the theoretical contributions are compelling, the empirical evaluation lacks depth and fails to provide a comprehensive comparison with existing methods. The only direct comparison is with an MCMC approach in Section 3.1, but the advantages of the proposed method over MCMC are not thoroughly discussed. For example, while computational efficiency is mentioned, no quantitative benchmarks are provided to substantiate these claims. Similarly, in the third example, results are compared to Zammit Mangion et al., but the computational benefits are not quantified. This lack of detailed experimental validation limits the paper's ability to convincingly demonstrate the practical utility of the proposed method.
Strengths:
1. Theoretical Rigor: The paper is technically sound, with a novel and well-justified approach to continuous-time inference.
2. Clarity: The writing is clear, and the methodology is well-explained, making it accessible to readers familiar with the topic.
3. Originality: The hybrid EP-variational approach is novel and addresses a significant gap in the literature.
4. Potential Impact: The method has broad applicability, particularly in fields requiring continuous-time modeling, such as neuroscience.
Weaknesses:
1. Experimental Evaluation: The empirical results are insufficiently motivated and lack comprehensive comparisons with baseline methods.
2. Quantitative Insights: The computational efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method are not rigorously quantified.
3. Limited Discussion: The advantages of the proposed method over existing approaches, such as MCMC, are not clearly articulated.
Recommendation:
While the paper makes a strong theoretical contribution, the experimental section requires significant improvement to justify its practical relevance. I recommend acceptance conditional on the authors addressing the experimental shortcomings by:
1. Providing detailed comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods.
2. Quantifying computational and accuracy benefits in all examples.
3. Expanding the discussion on the practical implications of the proposed approach.
Overall, this paper is a valuable contribution to the field, but its impact would be greatly enhanced with a stronger empirical evaluation.
