The paper presents a significant theoretical contribution to tensor decomposition by introducing and analyzing structured Schatten norms, specifically focusing on the latent Schatten norm. This work builds upon and improves existing results for the overlapped Schatten norm, addressing a critical problem in tensor decomposition with applications in fields like neuroimaging and collaborative filtering. The key theoretical result is the dual characterization of the overlapped and latent Schatten norms, which is both novel and insightful, connecting tensor decomposition to broader studies on structured sparsity. The authors rigorously demonstrate that the latent approach outperforms the overlapped approach, particularly when the true tensor is low-rank in a specific mode. This is supported by a bound showing that the latent approach's error scales with the minimal mode-k rank, contrasting with the average rank dependency of the overlapped approach.
The paper is well-organized and clearly written, making it accessible to readers familiar with tensor decomposition and convex optimization. The theoretical analysis is thorough, leveraging duality principles and consistency arguments to establish the superiority of the latent approach. Additionally, the authors provide numerical experiments to validate their theoretical predictions, confirming the scaling behavior of the mean squared error.
However, the experimental analysis is a notable weakness. While the results align with the theoretical findings, the experiments are briefly discussed and lack critical details. Key questions remain unanswered, such as the rationale behind Tucker rank selection, the role of group regularization, and comparisons to non-convex methods. These omissions limit the practical applicability and broader impact of the work. Furthermore, the experiments primarily focus on synthetic data, leaving open questions about the performance of the latent approach on real-world datasets.
In terms of originality, the paper makes a strong contribution by addressing gaps in the theoretical understanding of tensor decomposition and proposing a novel duality result. The work is well-situated within the existing literature, with appropriate references to prior studies.
Overall, the paper is a significant theoretical advancement in tensor decomposition, with clear implications for improving convex optimization-based methods. However, the limited experimental analysis and lack of real-world validation temper its practical impact.
