Review
This paper addresses the important problem of demand estimation in multi-agent, differentiated product settings by proposing a model that classifies agents into latent types and estimates their preferences using ranking data. The authors extend the Generalized Random Utility Models (GRUM) framework, introduce a novel application of Reversible Jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) for parameter estimation, and establish theoretical identifiability conditions for the model. The paper is well-supported by experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating the scalability and effectiveness of the proposed approach.
Strengths  
1. Technical Quality: The paper is technically sound, with rigorous theoretical contributions. The authors establish identifiability for GRUMs with ranking data, a significant advancement over prior work. The strict log-concavity and uni-modality results are non-trivial and essential for ensuring the robustness of the proposed estimation algorithm.  
2. Algorithmic Contribution: The use of RJMCMC for clustering agents into types and estimating parameters is innovative and well-implemented. The algorithm is scalable and provides reliable posterior estimates for the number of agent types, as demonstrated in the experiments.  
3. Experimental Validation: The experimental results are thorough, covering both synthetic and real-world datasets. The synthetic data experiments provide strong evidence of the method's reliability, while the application to the sushi dataset highlights its practical utility.  
4. Clarity and Reproducibility: The paper is well-organized, with detailed descriptions of the model, algorithm, and experimental setup. The inclusion of theoretical proofs and algorithmic details in the appendix enhances reproducibility.  
Weaknesses  
1. Originality: While the paper makes meaningful extensions to GRUMs, the novelty is somewhat diminished by the prior introduction of GRUMs in earlier work. The authors should more explicitly clarify how their contributions differ from and build upon prior GRUM models, particularly in the Related Work section.  
2. Experimental Scope: The experiments, while effective, are limited in scale. Expanding the experiments to include datasets with more diverse agent and alternative features would strengthen the validation of the proposed method.  
3. Related Work: The Related Work section could benefit from a deeper analysis of prior literature, particularly in terms of how this work compares to existing clustering and demand estimation methods.  
Arguments for Acceptance  
- The paper tackles a significant and challenging problem in demand estimation with a solid methodological framework.  
- The theoretical contributions, particularly the identifiability and uni-modality results, are rigorous and valuable.  
- The proposed RJMCMC algorithm is innovative and demonstrates strong empirical performance.  
Arguments Against Acceptance  
- The novelty of the contributions is somewhat reduced due to the reliance on prior GRUM work.  
- The experimental validation, while promising, could be more comprehensive in terms of dataset diversity and scale.  
Suggestions for Improvement  
1. Clarify the relationship between this work and prior GRUM models, emphasizing the unique contributions of this paper.  
2. Expand the experimental study to include larger and more diverse datasets, which would provide stronger evidence of the model's generalizability.  
3. Enhance the Related Work section with a more detailed comparison to existing methods in clustering and demand estimation.  
Overall Assessment  
This paper makes a strong contribution to the field of demand estimation and multi-agent modeling. While the novelty is slightly reduced by prior GRUM work, the theoretical advancements, algorithmic innovation, and experimental results make it a valuable addition to the literature. With minor revisions, particularly in clarifying contributions and expanding experiments, this paper would be a strong candidate for acceptance.
