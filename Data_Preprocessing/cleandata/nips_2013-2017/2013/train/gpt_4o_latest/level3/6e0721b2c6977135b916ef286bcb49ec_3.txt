The paper introduces a novel sampling method for generating sparse matrices that approximate a given matrix in terms of the spectral norm. The authors propose a distribution based on the Matrix Bernstein inequality, which adapts to the sampling budget and is computationally efficient in the streaming model. This approach is particularly relevant for large-scale data matrices where memory and computational constraints are critical. The authors also provide theoretical guarantees for their method, demonstrating its competitiveness with the optimal offline distribution.
Strengths:
1. Theoretical Contributions: The paper makes significant theoretical advancements by deriving a sampling distribution that is provably near-optimal under mild assumptions. The use of the Matrix Bernstein inequality is well-motivated and provides a strong foundation for the proposed method.
2. Streaming Model Applicability: The method is designed to work under streaming constraints, making it highly relevant for real-world applications involving large datasets.
3. Clarity and Accessibility: The paper emphasizes intuitive explanations, making it accessible to a broader audience, including non-specialists. The clear exposition of the Matrix Bernstein inequality and its implications is commendable.
4. Novelty: The adaptive nature of the proposed distribution, which depends on the sampling budget, is a unique contribution that sets this work apart from prior methods like L1 and L2 sampling.
Weaknesses:
1. Experimental Section: The experimental results are underwhelming. The graphs are difficult to interpret, and the analysis lacks depth. There is no clear connection to practical applications, which weakens the case for the method's real-world utility.
2. Spectral Norm Objective: The paper abandons the spectral norm objective in favor of a new criterion in the experiments, but this shift is not well-justified or revisited in the theoretical analysis.
3. Clarity of Certain Sections: While the exposition is generally clear, some equations (e.g., Eq. 6) are difficult to follow. Additionally, topics like compressibility and fast indexing are mentioned but not tied back to the proposed method.
4. Connection to Bernstein Inequality: The link between the simplified row-L1 distribution and the Bernstein inequality could be better clarified, as this is a key theoretical insight.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper makes a strong theoretical contribution by introducing a novel, adaptive sampling method with provable guarantees.
- The method is computationally efficient and relevant for streaming data, addressing a critical need in large-scale data analysis.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The experimental section fails to convincingly demonstrate the practical utility of the method.
- The shift from the spectral norm objective in experiments is not adequately justified, creating a disconnect between theory and practice.
Recommendation:
While the theoretical contributions are significant, the lack of robust experimental validation and practical insights limits the paper's overall impact. I recommend acceptance with major revisions, focusing on improving the experimental section, providing clearer connections to practical applications, and addressing the disconnect between theory and experiments.
