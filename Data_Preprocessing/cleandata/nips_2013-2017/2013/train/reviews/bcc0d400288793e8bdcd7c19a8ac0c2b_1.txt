This paper propose a myopic version of C-DAC, a visual search algorithm that includes costs and benefits. Some c-b algorithm of this sort will surely beat a naive cost-benefit free version...so the issue is just what the details look like. 
Fig 2 shows that C-DAC does well on many dimensions of fit. 
Comments: 
C-DAC is not psycho'll plausible? why not? 
Fig 2. why is set 9 and 1&3 so diagnostic.  This paper find evidence for a search algorithm that myopically adjust for the cost of future visual saccades.
