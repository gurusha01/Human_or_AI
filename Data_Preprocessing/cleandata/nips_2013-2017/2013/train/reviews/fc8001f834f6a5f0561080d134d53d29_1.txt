This paper studies how to improve the computational efficiency of approximate nearest neighbor retrieval methods. The paper itself has been well summarized in the abstract. It is well-written and interesting. Moreover, a key contribution is Property 1 where the authors show their proposed method is applicable to what kind of spaces. 
However, the contribution is perhaps not closely related to learning and neural computing. I do not see learning plays an important role in the proposed method. The learning in this paper includes simple sampling and approximating piecewise linear function in very low dimensional spaces. As a consequence, this paper may not match the research interests of NIPS very well to me. 
 Comment after authors' feedback  
The authors have clarified my concerns. Now I see why learning cannot be absent for this method, and why learning in this method should be simple (in fact learning for the underlying problem should be simple).
