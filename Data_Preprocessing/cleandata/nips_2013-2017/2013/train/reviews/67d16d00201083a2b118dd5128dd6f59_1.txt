Paper summary: 
The authors propose a Bayesian inference procedure for conditional bivariate copula models, where the copula models can have multiple parameters. The copula parameters are related to conditioning variables by a composition of parameter mapping functions and arbitrary latent functions with Gaussian process priors. The inference procedure for this model is based on expectation propagation. The method is evaluated on synthetic data and on financial time series data and compared to alternative copula-based models. The paper also includes an overview of related methods. 
Quality: 
The proposed method is sound. The authors include a description of related methods and list strengths and weaknesses of their method. 
Clarity: 
The paper is written clearly and concisely. It makes a very mature impression. I could not find any inconsistencies or typos. The figures and tables complement the text seamlessly, equations are clear and well explained and the text is flawless. 
Originality: 
The model and its inference procedure is an extension of a similar conditional copula model that was restricted to copulas with only one parameter. The present work generalizes this approach to allow more than one copula parameter. To my knowledge, this extension is novel. 
Significance: 
The flexibility of copula families with only one parameter is limited and the applicability of more flexible families is a huge advantage. Performance gains compared to the alternative methods are remarkable. This result is very promising. 
 The paper extends an inference procedure for conditional copula models. The contribution is important and well done.
