the paper starts with the observation that rooted DAG and binary decision trees are quite similar. Fixing the number of child notes in a rooted DAG (RDAG) the authors then show in a series of experiments that these RDAG (and ensembles of those) compare favorably to a number of baselines. As this is a somewhat different type of regularization than is typically used in randomized trees this is a worthwhile empirical observation. In my view the key contribution is the experimentation showing indeed that these RDAG might well have practical importance. While any experimentation can be extended the authors have done a good job in my view covering various aspects. 
the authors argue in section 2 that binary decision trees and rooted binary decision DAGs share quite some similarity - this is also what is used in the remainder of the paper. In the abstract, title and introduction however the writing suggests that a much more general similarity is used which I find at least confusing if not even annoying - in that sense the authors should tone down their statements at the beginning of their paper as this is not justified by the rest of the paper. 
another detail: the abbreviation DAG is quite standard - but nevertheless the meaning of the abbreviation should be given the first of its occurrence in the text (that is the abstract in this case)  RDAG (rooted directed acyclic graphs) are explored in this paper (and ensembles) thereof. Experiments show that fixing the number of child notes obtains good results w.r.t. other randomized tree classifiers.
