The paper presents a general method to design differentially private online algorithms, for the full information and bandit settings. 
The paper is clear and well motivated. The relation with the relevant literature is thoroughly discussed. 
I did not check all the details in the appendix, but the results appear correct to me. 
I think the paper is probably not a breakthrough, but the ideas presented are interesting and I think that it still deserves to be published. 
Minor things: 
- please move the discussion to the main text, I find that the open problems are actually interesting, especially the comparison with the results in [1]. A general method to design differentially private online algorithms, for the full information and bandit settings. Clear and complete theoretical results are shown.
