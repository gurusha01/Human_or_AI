This paper provides theoretical bounds on the performance of a convex tensor decomposition algorithm regularized by the latent Schatten norm. It improves upon the result known for regularization using the overlapped Schatten norm. 
Quality : The paper obtains theoretical results for tensor decomposition using latent Schatten norm. The dual characterization of the overlapped and latent Schatten norm in particular is interesting. The experiments however are rather briefly considered and are not elaborated upon. For instance how were the Tucker ranks (r1,...rk) of the examples chosen? How does group regularization such as l_1,\infty work when the tensor is simultaneously low rank in all modes? How does the method perform as compared to non-convex approaches? 
Clarity : The paper is well organized and clear to understand. 
Originality : The main original result in the paper is the duality between the overlapped and latent Schatten norms. This result seems to be of independent interest. 
Significance : Tensor decomposition is an important problem encountered in many applications. Since this paper improves upon existing results for this problem, I believe it is significant work. This paper improves upon existing results for the tensor decomposition problem. The theoretical results are interesting and the paper is well written. However, experiments are considered rather briefly towards the end of the paper.
