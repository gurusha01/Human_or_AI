This authors proposed an inexact alternating direction method of multiplier (ADMM) for solving the linear program problem in the CLIME estimator. A convergence rate of O(1/T) is established. The algorithm is implemented using both shared-memory and distributed-memory architectures. Numerical comparisons with other methods, such as DC-QUIC, Tiger and CLIME-Flare, are provided. 
Quality: The paper is technically sound. 
minor comments: 
1) The derivation of the inexact ADMM for CLIME is standard. See, for example: 
http://math.nju.edu.cn/~hebma/English%20Version.htm 
2) Due to the structures of CLIME, the solution of each subproblem can be computed componentwise and the most expensive operation is matrix-matrix multiplication. Hence, ADMM can be parallelized ideally for CLIME. It is well known that matrix-matrix multiplications can be parallelized well. 
3) The set up of the numerical experiments can be further specified. For example, what is the accuracy achieved by each solver? 
Clarity: The paper is well-organized. 
Originality: The evaluation of ADMM in shared-memory and distributed-memory architectures is interesting. 
Significance: Solving large scale sparse precision estimation problems is challenging. A simple yet robust distributed algorithm is helpful. The evaluation of ADMM in shared-memory and distributed-memory architectures is interesting. The derivation of inexact ADMM is standard and the good scalability is due to the simple structure of CLIME.
