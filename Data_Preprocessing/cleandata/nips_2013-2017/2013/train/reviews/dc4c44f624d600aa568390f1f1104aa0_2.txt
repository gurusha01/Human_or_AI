This paper proposes a class of algorithms for rank aggregation, referred to as GMM algorithms. The key idea of the algorithms is to employ GMM for rank aggregation and to break the full rankings in rank aggregation into pairwise comparisons. The paper gives conditions for the uniqueness and consistency of GMM algorithms. It also shows by theory and experiments that the proposed algorithms run faster than the baseline algorithm of MM, while achieving competitive statistical efficiency. 
The paper is very well written, and it is easy to understand the major points of the paper. The proposed methods appear to be sound, and theoretical and empirical studies on the algorithms are also convincing. The work is novel and represents significant contribution to the research on learning to rank. 
Minor issues: 
* Page 4, line 173, position-k breaking GP^k is only defined for k \ge 2. However, in line 200, GP^1 is given. 
* Page 3, line 152, it is not clear whether Definition 1 is about breaking, or about the GMM method GMM_G(D). 
 This paper is well written, and the work is sound, novel, and significant. I vote for accept for the paper.
