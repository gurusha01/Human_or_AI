This paper proposes the use of determinantal point processes (DPP) to model neural population activity. The authors show that the model can be fit to both simulated and real neural data. 
A missing component of this paper is to show that it is an advance over existing methods, such as GLMs. In Section 4, the authors should compare the performance of the DPP and GLM on the same data, and show that DPP can outperform the GLM. 
The authors state that one of the key benefits of DPP over GLM is that DPP can capture inhibitory interaction between neurons. Can't the GLM also capture inhibitory interactions via the coupling filters? If so, why is the way in which DPP captures inhibitory interactions superior? It would be helpful to provide 1-2 sentences of intuition about how equation (1) captures inhibitory interactions. Also, the authors emphasize the use of DPP for capturing inhibitory interactions - can't the DPP also capture excitatory interactions? 
I had a hard time understanding Figures 2b, 3, and 4. It would be helpful if the authors would state what the reader is supposed to see. Is it possible to relate Figures 3 and 4 to the known identification of which neurons are excitatory vs. inhibitory? 
On page 8, the authors state, "The model is able to accurately capture...dichotomy of neurons". I'm having trouble finding where in Section 4 this was shown. 
In Section 3.2, it would be helpful to describe how to determine the dimensionality of y, and how to learn the kernel parameters (if present). I think this work has good potential, but it seems underdeveloped at this point. The benefits of DPP over existing methods for modeling neural population activity needs to be clarified.
