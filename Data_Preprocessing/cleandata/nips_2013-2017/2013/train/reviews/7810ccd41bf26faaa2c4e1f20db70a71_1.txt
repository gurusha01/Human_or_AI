A new heauristic criterion is provided for active label acquisition for the Gaussian Random Field (GRF) model for semi-supervised classification. The authors show that so-called E-optimal criterion minimizes the survery risk as described by Garnett et al. I very much enjoyed the nice theoretical properties (sub-moudlarity, leading to near optimality guarantees for greedy applications; suppresor free conditions) and insights from analysis (cauchy scwartz inequality based arguments indicate that the criterion is likely to prefer graph cluster centers as opposed to outliers). Experimentally the proposed method outperforms most of the obvious alternatives. 
Overall a very nice paper, with sufficient novelty, theoretical rigor, clarity of explanation and reasonable experiments for a good NIPS paper A new heauristic criterion is provided for active label acquisition for the Gaussian Random Field (GRF) model for semi-supervised classification.
