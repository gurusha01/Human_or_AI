This paper analyzes the robust single linkage algorithm for finding the cluster tree when the support of the density lies on a manifold. Previous work [1] proposed and analyzed the algorithm for the same, when the density is supported on the entire space. This paper shows that the same algorithm could be used in the manifold case with rates depending just on the manifold dimension rather than the ambient dimension. The proof flow is very similar to that of [1] with several modifications to handle the fact that the density is actually supported on a manifold. 
The main point conveyed by the paper seems to be not emphasized sufficiently - despite the fact that the density lies on a manifold, the same RSL algorithm that is based on euclidean distance achieves rates that depend only the manifold dimension - giving some intuition for this fact (say even with a simple synthetic example) might help the reader a lot. Since the proofs are more or less based on similar arguments as that of [1], it is not clear what is the fundamental idea that is behind this phenomenon- at least in the way the proofs are presented. 
I went over the proofs and it seems ok to me. More discussion about the parameter $\rho$ might be helpful to the reader - I guess the previous point is related to this fact. Also I do not really agree with what authors call the 'class of RSL' algorithm (which has some consequences in terms of understanding the implications of the lower bound). Specifically what does ' of the form described in the algorithm in Figure 1' mean - isn't just this one algorithm in that case ?
