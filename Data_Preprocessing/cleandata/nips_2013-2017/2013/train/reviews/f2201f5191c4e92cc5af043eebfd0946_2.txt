This paper presents a method to compute the firing rates in recurrent networks of integrate and fire neurons for given inputs by imposing the condition of optimal balance of excitation and inhibition. While rather technical, the paper is well written, the approach is new, interesting and seems to be sound. The results are convincing, except maybe that the spiking (as shown in Fig. 1) does not appear as stochastic as in cortex. Taken together the approach has a huge potential to foster our understanding of the operation state and the function of cortical networks involved in sensory processing.
