The paper tackles the problem of fitting conditional copula models. The paper goes beyond typical constant copula functions and aim to model cases where parameters of the copula are functions of other (time) varying aspects of the problem. 
The core solution is essentially modeling the parameters space as Gaussian Processes. Starting from a Gaussian Process prior, the information from observed data are incorporated via Expectation Propagation for approximate inference of the posterior distribution. 
The paper is extremely well written and easy to follow. The problem is well motivated and most importantly illustrations with HMM based and multivariate time series copulas are very nicely written. The experiments are sufficient as well. Overall, this is a nice paper that motivates a novel problem and provides a reasonable solution with excellent experimental illustrations.
