Graph cut methods for semi-supervised classification and clustering are dominant in the last decade. Hypergraphs can incorporate higher order information about data than ordinary graphs and thus should be more preferable. Existing methods all have their own sets of limitation, as discusses in Section 1. 
In contrast, this paper studies how to directly deal with the hypergraph cut using the total variation of the Lovasz extension. Two frameworks are proposed in Sections 3 and 4, and an algorithm for solving the involved problems is presented in Section 5. Experimental results in Section 6 are promising. 
The idea of this paper sounds quite interesting. However, the derivation is not easy to follow. I have not checked the technical details since I am not familiar with these optimization problems in Sections 4 and 5. Anyway, the extension in Section 3 for semi-supervised learning from graph Laplacian matrices to the proposed functionals is natural, and the theoretical results seem correct. 
I have two minor questions. Firstly, in Definition 2.1, it is required that f1<=...<=fn. It seems later in the optimizations f as an optimization variable may not always satisfy this constraint. So when is it valid? Secondly, in the experiments, numerical features are converted into categorical by 10 equal size bins. Will this cause certain loss of information?
