This is a theoretically strong and interesting paper that proposes a novel EP-type inference approach for continuous-time stochastic dynamical systems. The paper is well structured and the theory clearly presented. However, the authors should have better motivated the approach with a stronger experimental section. The only comparison with other approaches is in the first example in Section 3.1, where the authors use a MCMC approach as a benchmark. A part from not completely agreeing in using MCMC approaches as a benchmark, as the proposed method performs as well as the MCMC approach, what is the advantage in using it? The authors should discuss 
this point in detail. In the third example, the authors seem to suggest that the results are similar to those in Zammit Mangion et al. They then justify the use of their approach from a computational viewpoint. The authors should give some quantification of the advantage -- it is not useful for the community to introduce a new approach without giving an idea of its characteristics with respect to existing ones. I would really appreciate some quantitative answers on this point in the rebuttal period. Very interesting paper but the experimental section is not completely satisfactory.
