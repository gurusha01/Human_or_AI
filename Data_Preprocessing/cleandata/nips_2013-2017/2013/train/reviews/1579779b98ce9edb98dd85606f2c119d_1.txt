This paper studies Monte Carlo tree search in zero-sum extensive form games with perfect information and simultaneous moves. It is proved that the MCTS algorithm converges to an approximate Nash equilibrium under certain conditions. Empirical study confirms the formal result. 
The detailed comments are as follows. 
1. Overall I think it is a good paper which provides a sufficient condition for the convergence of MCTS algorithms. The result is useful and the presentation is clear. However, as the main contribution of the paper should be the theoretical part, I have concern on the novelty of the proof technique. 
2. UCB algorithms are widely used algorithms in the literature but they are not analyzed in this paper. Given there have been some analysis on the UCB for Trees, it will be better that the authors also consider UCB algorithms and compares them with other algorithms in the paper. 
3. It is only proved that the propagation of the mean has good convergence. However, in the experiments the propagation of current sample value also seems good under different criteria. Can you give some explanation? 
 This paper studies Monte Carlo tree search in zero-sum extensive form games with perfect information and simultaneous moves. The findings in the paper are interesting, however, technically speaking, the paper is not very outstanding.
