The paper describes a number of new models for representing a joint distribution over integer-count variables. The authors argue that the "default" model that arises from Yang et al. is not satisfactory because it can only model negative correlations in order for the distribution to be normalized. They then consider a series of fixes for this including a new truncation method, using a quadratic base measure statistic (which they prove is necessary with everything else fixed), and finally a sub-linear sufficient statistic. The authors present experimental results on both synthetic and real data. 
This is a well written paper describing some nice solutions for representing count data. I believe this is original, and the results are significant. 
I found the "big negatives" of the truncation and quadratic models to be somewhat unconvincing. For the truncation, I could imagine that there would be a lot of interesting domains for which counts typically don't get too high and the model would work well. For the quadratic model, couldn't "Gaussian-esque thin tails" be appropriate sometimes? 
I don't know what "sparsistent" means, but I see that this term has been used for a while.

Page 5, above 3.1: "Note that the log..." Do you mean "Note that although the log"? Well written quality paper on modeling a joint distribution over count variables.
