This paper proposes a general formulation of multiple model learning, which introduces the weight of each data point with a regularization term and is robust to outliers. This paper provides theoretical support of the formulation with some empirical results. 
Quality, clarity, and significance: 
Although this paper contains some interesting results, there are many unclear descriptions in both texts and mathematical notations, which significantly deteriorate the quality and the significance of this paper. 
- Definition 1 is not clear. Why the tuple (actually, it's a triplet) with two sets and one function is called a "problem"? I cannot see any problem from here. I think the problem is minimizing the weighted loss. 
- l.109: What is the bold style m ? I think it's a vector of m_j from j=1 to k, but such a vector is defined as M in l.104. 
- In Example 1, it is better to show that for each example what X, M, and l are. 
- l.147: Why an outlier tends to infinity? 
- Lemma 2. What is the definition of P_{\Delta^n} ? 
- In 3.1 (empirical results), what is the actual alpha and how to set it? 
As the authors say in l.73, this alpha should be set appropriately and I think this is important for this formulation. But how? For example, cross-validation cannot be used in unsupervised learning. So some strategy to set alpha is needed and it is also valuable to analyze the sensitivity with respect to changes in alpha. 
- In Figure 3.1, I do not understand "Dataset" of x-axis. Why RW MAD monotonically increases if datasets change? 
- l.320: It is better to state the mathematical definition of the breakdown point. 
- l.336: In l(mj, xi), mj and xj are opposite (see Definition 1). 
- l.337: It would be better for readability to add some intuitive explanation of the number "22". 
- l.375: What is l(\cdot, m_j)? I think some x is needed for the place \cdot to define this value. 
Originality: 
This paper presents a generalization of multi-model learning with some regularization term and the originality is not so high. But for me it is ok since this approach is important for development of this area. This paper contains interesting theoretical results, but the description is not sophisticated enough and empirical evaluation is not sufficient.
