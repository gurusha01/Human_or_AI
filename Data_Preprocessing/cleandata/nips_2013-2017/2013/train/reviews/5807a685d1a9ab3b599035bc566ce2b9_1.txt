SUMMARY: This paper is a NIPS-formatted version of an ArXiV manuscript, and uses a Fano/LeCam-style argument to derive a lower bound on estimation algorithms that operate on private data when the algorithm is not trusted by the data holder. As a corollary, randomized response turns out to be an optimal strategy in some sense. 
As a caveat to this review, I did not go through the supplementary material. 
pros and cons: 
- the results provide characterize the limitations of learning from data that has been perturbed to guarantee privacy 
- there is some imprecision in the commentary on the results which could lead a casual reader to become confused (see below) 
- connections to existing results on differential privacy seems to be missing 
additional comments: 
- The restriction to local privacy, which is important for the results, makes the privacy model quite different than the differential privacy model, a fact which many readers may not appreciate. This confusion may be exacerbated by statements such as those at the bottom of page 4: "Thus, for suitably large sample sizes n, the effect of providing differential privacy at a level $\alpha$â€¦" The authors should avoid making such overly broad (and perhaps incorrect) statements when describing their results. 
- Is the restriction on alpha in Theorem 1 necessary? In particular, experimental results suggest that $\alpha \approx 1$ may be the most one can expect for certain learning problems (under differential privacy), so it is unclear the the bound tells us about this case. 
- Some commentary on the possible choices of $\rho$ may be nice, so that readers can see how different utility measures can be captured by the analysis. 
- How does this density estimator compare to the M-estimation procedure of Lei? This paper is not cited at all, but I imagine the authors should be aware of it. 
- There are many other approaches to histogram estimation for discrete data. While randomized response achieves the optimal rate of convergence, how do these other algorithms stack up? 
ADDENDUM AFTER REBUTTAL: 
* I think the distinction between the population vs. sample statistics needs to be explained more clearly and more explicitly at the beginning of the paper (c.f. response to Rev.9) 
* A comparison to related work (Lei and those brought up by another reviewer) is important for context. 
* A closer inspection of [10], which has now appeared, makes me construe the additional contribution of this paper more narrowly. While the venues (and hence audiences) for this and [10] are different, the contribution of this paper is twofold: a careful exposition of the local privacy model, and bounds for density estimation. The latter are new but the former is essentially contained in [10].
