This paper proposes to estimate the decision function to speed up the nearest neighbor retrieval process for VP-tree. More specifically the authors propose to do that via a sampling + regression with piecewise linear function. This strategy works for both metric (e.g. Euclidean space) and non-metric (eg., some Bregman divergence) space. The proposed method has been shown to be empirically faster than recently proposed state-of -the-art in most of the cases. Also, the paper discusses the applicability of VP-tree. 
This method seems to be fairly reasonable, and can be viewed as an application of basic machine learning algorithms to search where brute-force evaluation is expensive. The paper is well organized and clearly written, and the experiments are convincing. 
This paper is clearly written, and seems to be reasonably new and technically sound.
