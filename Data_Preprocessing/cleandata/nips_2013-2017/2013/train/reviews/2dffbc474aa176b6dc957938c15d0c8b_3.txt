PMCMC sampling is exploited in an ssm with GP process prior to extend to actual parameters rather than just the usual filtering and smoothing. Nice straightforward application of PMCMC methodology. Pity that a proper evaluation of the challenge tp get the PMCMC scheme to work is not described and evaluated in more detail as this would really have been the important contribution. A more detailed and critical evaluation of the strengths and weaknesses of the approach would have made the paper of value given it is an application of PMCMC methodology. It is probably too much to ask that the experimental section be revised to provide more evaluation than demonstration. Application of PMCMC methodology to ssmwould have been more useful assessing the practicial difficulties in getting such a scheme to work - and how well it actually works
