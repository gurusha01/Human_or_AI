The authors build on the replicated softmax model to devise a classification approach that lends itself to the video classification with only a few examples. The model consists of two parts: The first part is similar to a replicated softmax model that captures topics in the features, with the difference of using a rectified linear units. The second part consists of a discriminant function as a linear combination of topics. The authors apply a trick to make inference tractable: they derive a variational bound which is further lower bounded exploiting the semi-conjugacy between the rectified linear units and the Gaussian likelihood. The model is evaluated on a dataset of videos of social activities, which are to be classified. 
The problem is important, the model derivation is sound, the experimental evaluation is correct. 
However, the approach is independent (and not motivated) from the application of unstructured social group activity recognition. It seems to me that the author developed a general feature learning and classification approach that should be evaluated against other classification datasets and further baselines. 
 An ok approach, but the approach has not much to do with social group activity recognition. As a generic feature learning and classification approach, many comparison to other base lines would strengthen the work.
