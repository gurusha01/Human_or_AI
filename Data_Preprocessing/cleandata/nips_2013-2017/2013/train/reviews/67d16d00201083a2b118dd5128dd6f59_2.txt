This paper presents an interesting approach for modeling dependences between variables based on Gaussian process conditional copulas. It employs Gaussian process priors on the latent functions to model their interactions. Then an alternating EP algorithm is proposed for the approximate Bayesian inference. Experimental results on both synthetic data and two realworld data indicate the better performance of conditional copula models, especially the one based on student t copula. 
In general, this paper is well written and perhaps useful for dependence modeling in time series data. The EP inference is also implementable for the posterior distribution in the paper. A major problem of this paper is that some details are missing: 
(1) How the parameters in the copula model (e.g., \alpha, \beta, \omega for the Symmetrized Joe Clayton Copula) in are calculated? I assume this paper sets them to constants. How to choose them for a given time series data? 
(2) The details of the parameters the exponential covariance function in Gaussian process are missing. 
(3) How to choose the number of latent functions k? 
 This paper discusses an interesting topic and derives an implementable inference method. However, some details on the parameter settings are missing.
