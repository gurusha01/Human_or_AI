This paper analyzes the class of zero-sum perfect-information simultaneous move games. There are some interesting games in this class e.g. goofspiel and Tron. The authors analyze MCTS, implemented with regret-matching for this class of games and prove convergence to an approximate Nash equilibrium. 
The paper is clear and well-written, and the results are well-presented. The main contribution is new results in the formal analysis. Previous work, that the authors cited [20] Lanctot et al, 2013, looks at the setup but has more preliminary analysis. The proof is inductive - with optimal strategies at the leaf nodes. 
I think the biggest weakness in this type of approach is that not very interesting things can be proved about the inner nodes of the game tree. This misses out on some key ideas in game theory: Subgame perfect nash equilibria. I think the paper can be improved by tying the analysis to those concepts. Recommended citation:

This paper presents novel analyses of regret-matching strategy with MTCS in zero-sum perfect information simultaneous move games. While interesting from a computational standpoint, the analyses misses out on tying to powerful tools of sub-game perfect Nash equilibria for these class of games; something that has been well-studied by Game Theorists.
