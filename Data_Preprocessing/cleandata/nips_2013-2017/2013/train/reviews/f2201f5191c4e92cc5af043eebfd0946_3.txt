This is an interesting paper that describes how the firing rates in a balanced network represent solutions to a quadratic cost function reflecting deviations between input signals and decoded output. The paper is well written aside from a few points (described below) that need clarification. 
Unfortunately, however, this paper represents only a relatively small conceptual advance over Ref. 13 (Bourdoukan et al., NIPS 2012) as well as the paper under revision submitted as a supplement. Specifically, the entire section 2 here was already described by Bourdoukan et al NIPS 2012. The fact that an inhomogeneous network can represent signals with a performance similar to those exhibited by homogeneous systems was made by Bourdoukan et al as well as in a number of other recent neuroscience publications. This leaves only the calculation of the firing rates as a new contribution. Nevertheless, this too was essentially done by Bourdoukan et al 2012 NIPS (including the condition for spiking Vi > Ti). 
One aspect that this paper also needs to be address is that the proposed balanced networks have a very specific structure – the number of inputs equals the number of neurons in the recurrent network. Therefore, it is not clear how one may consider divergence and convergence that often are hallmark features of neural circuits. 
Minor comments that need to be clarified: 
-- Eq. 3, I think the lower integration limit has to be 0 ( the upper integration limit may extend to infinity) 
-- Figure 1 legend, "A spike is produced whenever the total input exceeds the spiking threshold (thin black line, bottom panel). However the number of spikes does not match the number of red dots in the upper panels that are also described as marking spike times from this neuron. 
-- Line 187 "We find that these curves are highly nonlinear" –The curves in Figure 1c look quite linear. 
 This paper is nicely written and is quite interesting when read as a stand alone contribution. However, the conceptual advance relatively to Ref. 13 is questionable.
