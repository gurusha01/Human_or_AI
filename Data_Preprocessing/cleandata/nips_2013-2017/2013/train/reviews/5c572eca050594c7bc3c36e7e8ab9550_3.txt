The authors propose a solution to the problem how to estimate the ratio of two probability density functions. The approach is based on using a kernel and a Fredholm integral equation. This yields 
an inverse problem.  From the viewpoint of machine learning, the assumption of densities is a very hard one, because it is well-known that in any epsilon neighbourhood of a probability measure P which has a \nu-density there are probability measures which have no \nu-densities.Therefore, the estimation of a ratio of two densities is problematic from the viewpoint of ML.As far as I can see, the authors do not describe which dominating measure \nu is used (Lebesgue measure, counting measure, something else) and it is unclear to me, if their results are rigorous because of sets of \nu-measure zero. I also miss a clear statement which assumptions are made. E.g., does x belong to $R^d$ or to some general topological space? Is the density p positive for all x ?
