The paper considers HOG-based image detection. The bottleneck of such detection is the scalar product operation between the pairs of HOG cells coming from the image and the template. The central idea of the paper is to replace this scalar product with a single look up, by vector quantizing the HOG-cells on the image side (and precomputing the scalar products with cluster centers on the template side). 
Pros: 
+ The idea is simple, is sound and is clearly explained. 
+ As HOG-based detection (including DPMs) is very popular, and the authors promice to release their code as a software library, this may become a widely used and cited paper. 
+ The experimental evaluation is thorough and the results are very good for the proposed method (several-fold speedup compared to already good codes for evaluating DPMs). This good performance however required considerable micro-level optimization. 
Cons: 
- I can see only one major problem with the paper, but it is a big one: the central idea is already present in [10]. It is true that [10] has a different emphasis, and does retrain its models, but the central idea is there. The main difference between the proposed approach and [10] seems to be that [10] vector-quantizes both the image and the template side (ADC vs SDC in terms of [13]), hence obtaining coarser approximation.

if accepted, please fix the author names in the ref. [13] A well-written paper with a natural and thouroughly-evaluated idea, which is likely to be appealing for many CV researchers. This is undermined by a strong overlap with the previously published (CVPR12) work.
