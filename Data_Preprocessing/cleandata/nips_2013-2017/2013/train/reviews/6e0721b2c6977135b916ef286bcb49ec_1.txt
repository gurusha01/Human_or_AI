The paper describes a novel procedure to sample from a sparse data matrix using the spectral norm as a measurement of quality. The procedure is described for the "streaming" setting in which in which a fixed matrix is read from disk and sampled without requiring the entire matrix to reside in memory at any one time. 
The paper is overall well written and assumptions and implications are explained clearly. For instance, while the definition of the data matrix in 2.1 appearing to be quite arbitrary at first glance, the authors made a good case that these conditions should hold for most typical inputs. The background sections do a good job of positioning this work in relation to other techniques and the experiments are described clearly and well done. The resultant procedure is quite unique, relying upon an unusually weighted data-dependent sampling procedure and the authors demonstrate that the procedure can match or outperform other matrix sampling methods. 
However, the Proof Outline (section 5) is difficult to follow. It is not clear what proof it is trying to outline (for Theorem 4.1?) and it is not clear how Lemma 5.1, 5.2, 5.3 relates, and how the proof outline concludes. 
Other issues: 
- Equation 7 is written in a rather confusing way. Perhaps split it into two sections: Pij = \theta |A{ij}| and \theta = ... 
- Page 4, line 210 "matrices B_i". Should this be B^{(l)} ? 
- Page 6, line 315. It is not clear where that quadratic equation came from. 
- Page 7 line 349. 62 sqrt(2) / 29 ~= 3.02 which is > 3 
- The blue "Bernstein" line is completely invisible in many of the plots. Adding some arrows to indicate the location of the Bernstein line will be helpful. 
 Few complaints, a well-written paper.
