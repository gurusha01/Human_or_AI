The present paper continues a line of successful previous papers dealing with the encoding of signals through the so-called TEM (time encoding machine). The present paper is motivated by the recent realization within the neuroscience community that most sensory processing is in multi-modal, and that this occurs already at early stages of the processing hierarchy. The signal processing advantages of such a scheme are intuitively obvious, and the present paper contributes to demonstrating a practical and mathematically well-founded approach. Such an approach offers the potential advantage of natural hardware implementation using low power elements. 
The mathematical framework for signal representation is based on reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, specifically focusing here on trigonometric functions. The main mathematical contributions appear in the form of two theorems, which establish, respectively, the decoding property and the equivalence of filter identification and neural encoding. Several examples are also presented which demonstrate the effectiveness and power of the method. 
This paper deals with an important and relevant problem in computational neuroscience (and signal processing) and suggests a solid and effective solution. Although the method proposed does not seem to be biologically plausible form an algorithmic perspective, it does suggest limits to what can be achieved with the setting delineated. I was missing some discussion of robustness to noise and power consumption considerations, which was one of the motivations for the paper. 
 An extension of previous work providing a framework for encoding and decoding multi-sensory continuous signals in the spike domain. Precise mathematical characterizations and numerical demonstrations suggest the method is well founded both mathematically and algorithmically.
