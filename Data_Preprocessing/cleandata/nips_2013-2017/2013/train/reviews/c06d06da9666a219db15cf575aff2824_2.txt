The authors formulate the problem of learning an undirected graphical model in terms of a large (intractable) constraint satisfaction problem (CSP)In particular, given observations of the variables, X, they focus on finding the junction tree, T, that with the largest marginal likelihood p(X|T). Rather than blindly searching in the space of all junction trees, they formulate a weighted constraint satisfaction problem and propose to use off-the-shelf CSP solver to find the best junction tree. 
The majority of the paper is on formulating the CSP, including characterizing a junction tree as a collection of cliques and separators over a balanced max weight spanning tree. While this paper is very well written and appears to be novel it may be of little practical value simply because formulating the CSP problem requires an exponential number of constraints - in other words, what do we gain by casting the structure learning problem as a CSP? I would liked to have seen an approximate CSP that relaxes some conditions but remains tractable, or a bounded form of the CSP that learns the most likely junction tree with bounded clique size. Last, I'm not sure how a non-uniform prior on graph structures could be incorporated, but we would prefer a means to learn sparse/low treewidth models. Authors propose a novel formulation of structure leaning as a CSP and introduce a nice tool - the balanced spanning tree - for analyses and algorithms involving junction trees. However, the approach is of little practical value because the CSP requires an exponential number of constraints.
