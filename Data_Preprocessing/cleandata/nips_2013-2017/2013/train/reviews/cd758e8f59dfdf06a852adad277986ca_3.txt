This paper presents an analysis of a k-nearest neighbor based algorithm recently proposed by Chaudhuri and Dasgupta for the case where the data is on or concentrated on a manifold. The key result is that the convergence rate depends on the dimension of the underlying manifold. To obtain the result on the manifold the authors adapt the theory used in Chaudhuri and Dasgupta to the manifold case using the sampling tools developed in Niyogi, Smale, Weinberger. In the case where the data is concentrated on a manifold the use the tools developed by a serious of papers by Rinaldi and others. 
The theory seems correct and these are nice results. The algorithm analyzed may be more appropriate for stratified spaces than manifolds but this is a more minor point. The one negative about this paper is that the algorithm is not novel and many of the theoretical tools used are not novel. However, this complaint can be made of many theoretical papers in NIPs. The authors present a theoretical analysis of cluster trees on manifolds and show the rate is a function of the manifold.
