The authors recast learning of chordal Markov networks as a constraint satisfaction problem. 
The paper is generally well-written and the authors show that their method is able to compute the best structure for some problems for which this was previously unknown. 
Having said that, the method will obviously not scale to examples much larger than those considered (owing to the exponential growth in the number of propositional variables required). 
It would also be useful to make some comparison to the literature on learning DAGs (e.g. papers by Koivisto and Sood) given that obviously chordal Markov networks are a subclass of DAGs. 
 A well-written paper that advances the state of the art in exact structure learning.A bit of additional comparison to work on learning Bayesian Networks would be useful.
