This paper studies regret guarantees in prediction with expert advice that are simultaneously achievable against each individual expert. The problem is essentially solved for the case of two constant binary experts under the absolute loss (or dot loss). In particular, the finite-time and asymptotical region of achievable pairs are computed. Connections to random playout and bounds in terms of log prior weights are discussed. 
This is a solid and well written paper that explores a new direction in the theory of prediction with expert advice. The results are precise and mathematically elegant, although a bit narrow in scope. I do not expect a significant impact on the NIPS community, although there is a latent potential here that futher research might be able to fully express. 
The techniques seem to strongly rely on the linearity of the loss, it would be good to say something about, say, convex and Lipschitz losses. 
The minimax algorithm for absolute loss and fixed horizon has been first proposed in: N. Cesa-Bianchi et al., How to use expert advice. Journal of the ACM, 44(3):427-485, 1997. Please fix the reference. 
=============================== 
I have read the authors' rebuttal. A solid and elegant paper with somewhat narrow results. I would accept it, although I expect it to be interesting only for a small fraction of the NIPS community
