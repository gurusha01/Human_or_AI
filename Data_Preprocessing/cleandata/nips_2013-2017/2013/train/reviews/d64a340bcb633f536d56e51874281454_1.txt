Summary of the paper 
This paper is concerned with the support recovery problem in linear regression in the high dimensional setup, that is to say, recovery of the non null entries in the vector of regression parameters when the number of predictors p exceeds the sample size n. A simple greedy algorithm is proposed, particularly suitable in presence of high correlation between predictors: starting from an initial guess S of the true support, it swaps each of the variables in S to each of the variables in S^c, one at a time, looking for improvement in the square loss. The sparsity level (i.e. number of zero/nonzero entries in the vector of coefficients) remains the same. Such a procedure is called SWAP, and is typically used to enhance the performances of classical sparse recovery algorithms such as the LASSO, by using the latter as the initial guess for S. 
A theoretical analysis describing limitations and guarantees of SWAP are exposed in details: conditions for accurate support recovery and bounds for the number of iterations required are provided. It is shown that the required assumptions are milder than the usual irrepresentability condition. A numerical study show the benefit of using SWAP on synthetic and genomic data sets. 
Comments 
The paper is clearly written and pleasant to read. Good motivations and minimal tools to introduce the SWAP procedure are stated, notably due to the small example in the introductory part. Though quite simple, SWAP sounds like a good idea. A good point to my opinion is the theoretical analysis, which is nicely stated, each parameter and assumption being clearly motivated to the reader; no irrelevant or cumbersome technical points are left to the reader without explanation. This also gives insights on the limitation of the method. 
Still, I a few remarks and questions: 
- remark 3.3: it is not clear what "Line 3" refers to (probably line 4 in Algorithm 1?). The authors provide complexity for this famous Line 3, but the cost of the rank k projection matrix remains unclearâ€¦ quantitative results would have been nice to have an idea of the additional cost over a LASSO fit, for instance. From Proposition 4.1, the number of iterations may become prohibitive as soon as there more than half of false positives in the initial guess of the support. 
- with SWAP, the size of the support remains the same as the initial one: in the synthetic experiments, the authors present their results by arbitrarily fixing the support size to the true one, which may somewhat bias the results. In the genomics example, the sparsity level k varies, but obviously the best k is not always the same between SWAP and the method used for initialization. So how k is chosen practically? 
- in the synthetic examples, the authors provide TPR (true positive rate) and numbers of iterations; still, the false positive rate (FPR) would have been required to judge the performance: by masking the FPR it is no clear if the methods used for the initial guess are in a regime where they fail to maintain a high TPR at a reasonable FPR. 
- I am surprised by the use of classification/binary response in the genomic data considered to illustrate the performances: the square loss used to swap the variables seems inappropriate in this case; also, the methods used for building the initial guess are probably not very good at it, an enhancing the support in this situation may be easier than when considering an continuous outcome. Many genomic data set are provided with an continuous outcome. 
- SWAP is appropriate to deal with correlated predictors, but none of the methods mentioned in the introduction to cope with highly correlated settings (such as the elastic-net, the Trace-Lasso, and so on) are used for comparison, although widely available. This paper presents a simple yet appealing method with sounded theoretical justifications. It is clearly written, easy to read. Still, I have concerns regarding the numerical experiments and comparisons to state-of-the art methods. SWAP enhances some existing sparse recovery algorithms in some settings; yet it is not clear if these settings are adapted to these methods.
