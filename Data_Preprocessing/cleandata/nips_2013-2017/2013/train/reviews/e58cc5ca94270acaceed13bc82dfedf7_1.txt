The paper describes a method of completing an n-by-m matrix M with rank r smaller than min(n,m). Instead of completing M directly, the authors assume access to an n-by-r1 matrix A and an m-by-r2 matrix B such that one can write M=AZB'. The A, B matrices are considered as side information given beforehand and the proposed method completes M by estimating Z. 
The authors prove that, when r1 is much smaller than n and r2 is much smaller than m, one needs far fewer entries to complete M by using the side information matrices. Moreover, in this case, Z is of much smaller dimensions than M, and thus the estimation is very efficient. 
Matrix completion with side information has been considered previously in (Goldberg et. al., 2010; Adams, Dahl, andMurray, 2010; Porteous, Asuncion, and Welling, 2010). The method in this paper appears different from the previous ones, and the advantage over (Goldberg et. al., 2010) is shown in the paper. 
The sample complexity analysis is nice and the experimental results are promising. 
A negative feeling about the paper is, the side information assumption is a bit strong, and the reduced sample complexity and performance gain is therefore not so surprising. Nevertheless, the paper showed an example, where such an assumption is appropriate. 
 The paper presents a theoretical result showing that using side information matrices can significantly reduce sample complexity in matrix completion. The use of side information leads to an efficient matrix-completion method, which achieves speed-ups by estimating a low-dimensional matrix.
