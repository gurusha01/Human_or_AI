This paper proposes a method for compressive sensing calcium imaging, which takes advantage of the sparseness of neuronal activity. The method reduces the number of measurements significantly and uses recently developed mathematical techniques to decode these measurements. Furthermore, the number of measurements necessary for full recovery is studied using cutting-edge mathematical techniques. 
The strength of the paper is in the application of fashionable mathematical techniques to address an important neuroscience problem. The weakness of the paper is that no analysis of actual data is presented. I realize that the required datasets may not yet exist. However, expecting that an experimentalist would be able to read this paper and develop a compressive sensing imaging protocol seems a bit unrealistic to me. I think that the key idea could be communicated on a much simpler level than that of the current presentation.
