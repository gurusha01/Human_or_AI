This paper is related with the problem of demand estimation in multi-heterogeneous agents, specifically, to classify agents and estimate preferences of each agent type using agents' ranking data of different alternatives. The problem is important since it has great practical value in studying underlying preference distributions of multiple agents. To tackle the problem, the authors introduce generalized random utility models (GRUM), provide RJMCMC algorithms for parameter estimation in GRUM and theoretically establish conditions for identifiability for the model. Experimental results on both synthetic and real dataset show the model's effectiveness. 
In general, this paper is a comprehensive and solid work. Not only does it provide a detailed algorithm for parameter estimation in the model, as well as experiments to verify it, but also it gives non-trivial theoretical analysis for the conditions of model's identifiability. I have gone through most of the lengthy proof and to my knowledge found no bugs. Therefore even though the GRUM model has been proposed in an earlier work in UAI, which decreases the innovation of this work by some content, I think this paper deserves to be accepted. 
Some minor suggestions: 
1) The authors should clarify the relation of their work with the original GRUM models, including what the former works have done, and what needs to be analyzed more deeply (such as analysis of identifiability). These should be included in Related Literature. 
2) To verify the effectiveness of the new model, the experiments' scale can be more enlarged, since setting K=4 and L=3 (these two corresponds to feature number) includes too little information of agents and alternatives. 
 The paper studies an important problem, and the proposal is solid.
