Summary: 
-------- 
The authors apply Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs) to the spiking activity 
of simultaneously recorded neurons. In addition to stimulus dependence, the 
resulting model captures pairwise competitive interactions of neurons. The 
authors apply the model to artificial data and hippocampal recordings. 
Comments: 
--------- 
1) The application of DPPs to neural recordings is novel to best of my 
knowledge. The incorporation of instantaneous interactions into GLMs for 
neurons (even coupled ones) such that the resulting model remains tractable is 
an important open problem. Hence, I think the paper is timely and of interest 
to the NIPS neuroscience audience. 
2) The paper is clearly written and DPPs are introduced quite gently, resulting 
in a very readable paper (exceptions below). 
3) My main criticism is that the authors did not fully convince me that their 
model is actually an appropriate one for multi-cell recordings. As far as I 
know, most noise correlations that have been experimentally measured seem to be 
positive (at least in cortex) and could therefore not be captured by this DPP 
approach; please correct me if I'm wrong here. In any case, the authors 
should have argued more thoroughly and given appropriate citations that the 
scenario of exclusively competitive interactions is an important one in 
multi-cell recordings. 
4) Section 4.3, application to Hippocampus data: Unfortunately, this paragraph 
does not fully convince me that the DPP based model is a good model for the 
data. Are the noise correlations (computed from the data) between pairs of 
excitatory / pairs of inhibitory neurons / pairs of exc-inhi really mostly 
negative (emphasize here is on noise correlations as GLMs can capture stimulus 
induced correlations)? The authors should describe the main result figures 
FIG4 and FIG3(a) in greater detail: why is this latent embedding sensible / what 
does this kernel matrix tell us about the data? (The additional space required 
could be obtained by scaling back the experiments on artificial data.) 
The fact that the method uncovers the theta oscillations is not very surprising 
(as this is just the GLM part of the model) and could be described more 
briefly. Table 1: The authors could have made a stronger point for the model if 
the table included more pairs of models of the type 
"GLMcomponent1+...+GLMcomponentn" and 
"GLMcomponent1+...+GLMcomponentn+Latent", as this allows for a direct 
comparison to figure out if adding the DPP part helps. 
5) Section 3.3: In the model, the stimulus dependence of each neuron is already 
captured by the weight vector $wn$. Isn't the introduction of the of $w\nu$ 
redundant? 
6) The manuscript is missing a more in depth comparison between coupled GLMs 
and the DPP approach, eg: coupled GLMs are lacking an instantaneous coupling 
between the neurons, but this could be compensated for by binning the data on 
finer time scales etc. 
Minor Comments: 
--------------- 
1) Either I don't fully understand the notation around eqn. 4 and 5 or it is is 
rather sloppy: I guess $\Pi^{(t)}$ should be defined as 
$diag(\sqrt{\lambda_1^{(t)}},\ldots)$, instead of the definition given in l157. 
Furthermore in eqn 5, $K^{(t)}{St}$ probably only contains the term $k_\theta$ 
and not the GLM part $\lambda_n^{(t)}$, in contrast to eqn 4. If this is 
correct, then $K^{(t)}{St}$ should be $K{St}$ as the only time dependence 
would be via ${S_t}$. Furthermore, shouldn't the normalizer in eqn 5 be 
independent of $St$, i.e. contain eg $K{\mathcal S}$ instead of $K{St}$ 
(similar for $\Pi{St}$)? 
2) In the definition of $K_S$ in l131, it might be worthwhile to again emphasize 
that $n,n' \in S$. An interesting and timely paper that would benefit from extendedbiological motivation for the proposed model and more detailed experiments.
