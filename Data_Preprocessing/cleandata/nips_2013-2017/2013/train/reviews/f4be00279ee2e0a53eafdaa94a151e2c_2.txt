This paper applies approximate inference to nonlinear diffusion equations by taking the continuous-time limit of the expectation-propagation technique. The result is a tracking algorithm which is, naturally, much faster than sampling methods, and on the experiments shown is rather accurate. I'm curious if a linearization of the loss function + the application of Kalman-Bucy (ie, extended KB), possibly applied iteratively, would lead to a more/less effective algorithm. It would also be interesting to see more substantial experiments, for instance with high-frequency financial data where this framework is often use and existing benchmarks are available. 
Quality: the paper is technically solid. 
Clarity: the paper is clearly written and well organized. 
Originality: relatively high. 
Significance: the speedup over MC achieved here is potentially important. 
 This paper applies an approximate inference method, namely, expectation-propagation, to nonlinear diffusion processes and obtains a significant speedup over sampling methods. The paper is clear and straightforward to follow.
