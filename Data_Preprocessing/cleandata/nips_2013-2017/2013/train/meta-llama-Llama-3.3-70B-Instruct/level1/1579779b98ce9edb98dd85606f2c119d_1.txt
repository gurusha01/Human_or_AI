This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of game theory and artificial intelligence, specifically in the context of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithms for zero-sum extensive-form games with perfect information and simultaneous moves. The authors provide a general template for MCTS algorithms that can be instantiated with various selection methods, and they formally prove that if the selection method is -Hannan consistent and satisfies additional requirements on exploration, then the MCTS algorithm converges to an approximate Nash equilibrium (NE) of the extensive-form game.
The paper is well-structured, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, including the necessary background and definitions. The formal analysis is rigorous and well-presented, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the main theorem and its proof. The empirical evaluation is also well-designed, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of the results.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The authors provide a significant contribution to the field of game theory and artificial intelligence, specifically in the context of MCTS algorithms for extensive-form games.
* The paper is well-structured, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, including the necessary background and definitions.
* The formal analysis is rigorous and well-presented, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the main theorem and its proof.
* The empirical evaluation is well-designed, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of the results.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes a high level of background knowledge in game theory and artificial intelligence, which may make it difficult for non-experts to follow.
* The authors do not provide a clear comparison with existing work in the field, which makes it difficult to understand the significance of the contribution.
* The empirical evaluation is limited to a specific class of games, and it is not clear how the results generalize to other classes of games.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the authors provide a significant contribution to the field of game theory and artificial intelligence. However, the paper could be improved by providing a clearer comparison with existing work and a more detailed analysis of the limitations of the results.
