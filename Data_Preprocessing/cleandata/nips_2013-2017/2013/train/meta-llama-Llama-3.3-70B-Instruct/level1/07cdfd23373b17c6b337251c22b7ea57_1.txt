This paper proposes a scalable approach for making inference about latent spaces of large networks. The authors introduce a parsimonious statistical model, called the Parsimonious Triangular Model (PTM), which represents networks as a bag of triangular motifs. They also develop a fast stochastic variational inference algorithm for performing approximate inference under this model. The PTM has a more compact and lower-dimensional parameterization than existing models, allowing for more efficient inference algorithms.
The paper is well-written and clearly explains the technical details of the proposed approach. The authors provide a thorough review of related work and demonstrate the effectiveness of their method through experiments on synthetic and real-world networks. The results show that the proposed approach achieves competitive or improved accuracy for latent space recovery and link prediction, while being orders of magnitude faster than recent work on scalable latent space network modeling.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel and efficient statistical model for latent space network analysis
* The development of a fast stochastic variational inference algorithm for the proposed model
* The demonstration of the effectiveness of the proposed approach through experiments on synthetic and real-world networks
* The comparison with existing methods and the discussion of the advantages and limitations of the proposed approach
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The assumption that the network can be represented as a bag of triangular motifs, which may not be applicable to all types of networks
* The use of a simple subsampling procedure to reduce the computational cost, which may lead to loss of information
* The lack of a thorough analysis of the convergence properties of the proposed algorithm
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of network analysis and provides a promising approach for scalable latent space modeling. The proposed method has the potential to be applied to a wide range of networks and can be used for various tasks, such as community detection, link prediction, and network visualization.
