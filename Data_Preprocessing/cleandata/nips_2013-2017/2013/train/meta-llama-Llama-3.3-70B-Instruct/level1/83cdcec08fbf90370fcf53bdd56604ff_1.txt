This paper introduces the adaptive anonymity problem, where each individual shares their data along with an integer value to indicate their personal level of desired privacy. The authors propose a relaxation of k-anonymity, called b-matching, which achieves better utility and accommodates variable levels of anonymity for each individual. The paper provides novel algorithms and theoretical guarantees for this relaxation, including a polynomial-time algorithm with an approximation guarantee.
The paper is well-written and clearly explains the problem and the proposed solution. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the privacy guarantees of their approach, including one-time and sustained attack scenarios. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in achieving better utility while maintaining the desired level of privacy protection.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The introduction of a new problem, adaptive anonymity, which is relevant to real-world applications where individuals have different privacy preferences.
* The proposal of a relaxation of k-anonymity, b-matching, which achieves better utility and accommodates variable levels of anonymity.
* The provision of novel algorithms and theoretical guarantees for the proposed relaxation.
* The thorough analysis of the privacy guarantees of the approach, including one-time and sustained attack scenarios.
* The experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes that the data is discrete and does not handle continuous attributes.
* The paper does not provide a clear comparison with other existing methods for achieving anonymity, such as differential privacy.
* The paper could benefit from more detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed algorithms.
