This paper proposes a new criterion for active learning on Gaussian Random Fields (GRFs), called Σ-optimality, which queries the node that minimizes the sum of the elements in the predictive covariance. The authors extend submodularity guarantees from V-optimality to Σ-optimality and show that GRFs satisfy the suppressor-free condition. They also demonstrate that Σ-optimality outperforms V-optimality and other related methods on classification tasks.
The paper is well-written and clearly organized, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments. The introduction provides a good background on the problem of active learning on GRFs and motivates the need for a new criterion. The authors also provide a thorough review of related work, including V-optimality and other active learning methods.
The technical contributions of the paper are significant, including the proof of submodularity for Σ-optimality and the demonstration of the suppressor-free condition for GRFs. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the differences between Σ-optimality and V-optimality, including the observation that Σ-optimality tends to select cluster centers whereas V-optimality goes after outliers.
The experimental results are also impressive, demonstrating the superiority of Σ-optimality over V-optimality and other methods on several real-world datasets. The authors provide a thorough comparison of the different methods, including mutual information gain, uncertainty sampling, and expected error reduction.
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of active learning on GRFs and provides a new and effective criterion for selecting nodes to query. The authors' writing is clear and concise, making the paper easy to understand and follow.
