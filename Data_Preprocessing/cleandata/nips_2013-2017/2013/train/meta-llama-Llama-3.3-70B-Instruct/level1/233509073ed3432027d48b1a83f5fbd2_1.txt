This paper presents a novel algorithm, LoSST, for online structure learning of graphical models in dynamic environments where the underlying generative process can change over time. The authors address the limitation of traditional structure learning algorithms, which assume a stationary environment, and propose a heuristic approach that can track changes in graphical model structure or parameters in real-time.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear overview of the related work, highlighting the limitations of existing approaches. The LoSST algorithm is described in detail, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of its properties, including convergence and diligence. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of LoSST in tracking changes in graphical model structure and parameters, and the authors also provide a real-world application to US price index volatility data.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The authors address a significant limitation of traditional structure learning algorithms and propose a novel approach to online structure learning.
* The LoSST algorithm is well-motivated, and the authors provide a clear explanation of its components and properties.
* The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of LoSST in various scenarios, including changes in graphical model structure and parameters.
* The authors provide a real-world application of LoSST to US price index volatility data, which demonstrates its potential in practice.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The LoSST algorithm is heuristic, and the authors acknowledge that it may not be optimal in all scenarios.
* The algorithm's performance may degrade if the generating structure changes very rapidly or if the datapoints are a random-order mixture from multiple structures.
* Some aspects of the algorithm, such as the choice of hyperparameters, may require careful tuning in practice.
