This paper proposes a novel Bayesian nonparametric model for discovering hierarchical community structure in social networks. The model, called Bayesian Hierarchical Community Discovery (BHCD), is a tree-structured mixture of stochastic blockmodels that can efficiently learn a hierarchical community model from data. The authors also introduce a family of greedy agglomerative model selection algorithms that can learn the hierarchy in a single pass through the data, with a worst-case time complexity of O(n^2 log n), where n is the number of vertices.
The paper is well-written and clearly explains the technical details of the model and the algorithms. The authors provide a thorough review of related work and demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through experiments on several datasets, including Sampson's monastery network and the NIPS co-authorship network. The results show that BHCD can discover reasonable hierarchies and make predictions about two orders of magnitude faster than existing Bayesian nonparametric schemes, while achieving comparable performance.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel and efficient Bayesian nonparametric model for hierarchical community discovery
* The introduction of a family of greedy agglomerative model selection algorithms that can learn the hierarchy in a single pass through the data
* The demonstration of the effectiveness of the approach through experiments on several datasets
* The clear and well-organized writing style
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The model assumes a specific form of hierarchical structure, which may not be suitable for all types of networks
* The algorithms may not be scalable to very large networks, although the authors suggest possible ways to improve scalability
* The paper could benefit from more detailed comparisons with other related work, such as non-Bayesian approaches to community discovery
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel and efficient Bayesian nonparametric model for hierarchical community discovery
* The approach is demonstrated to be effective through experiments on several datasets
* The paper is well-written and clearly explains the technical details of the model and the algorithms
Arguments against acceptance:
* The model assumes a specific form of hierarchical structure, which may not be suitable for all types of networks
* The algorithms may not be scalable to very large networks
* The paper could benefit from more detailed comparisons with other related work
Overall, I recommend accepting the paper, as it proposes a novel and efficient approach to hierarchical community discovery and demonstrates its effectiveness through experiments on several datasets. However, the authors should consider addressing the weaknesses mentioned above in future work.
