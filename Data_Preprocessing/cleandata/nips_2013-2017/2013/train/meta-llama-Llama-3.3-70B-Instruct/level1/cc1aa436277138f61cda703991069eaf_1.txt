This paper studies the problem of estimating continuous quantities using a crowdsourcing approach, where workers' reliabilities and biases are unknown and diverse. The authors investigate the value of control items, which are items with known answers used to evaluate workers' performance, and provide a simple rule of thumb for crowdsourcing practitioners. The paper presents theoretical results for different scenarios and provides an analysis of the accuracy of different consensus methods.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem and the related work. The theoretical analysis is thorough, and the authors provide a detailed discussion of the results. The experiments on simulated and real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and provide insights into the importance of model misspecification and bias.
The strengths of the paper include:
* A clear and well-motivated introduction to the problem
* A thorough theoretical analysis of the problem
* A detailed discussion of the results and their implications
* A comprehensive experimental evaluation on simulated and real datasets
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes a Gaussian model for the data, which may not always be realistic
* The authors do not provide a clear discussion of the limitations of the approach and the potential pitfalls
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the related work and how it compares to existing approaches
Overall, the paper is well-written and provides a significant contribution to the field of crowdsourcing. The authors demonstrate a good understanding of the problem and provide a thorough analysis of the results. However, the paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the limitations and potential pitfalls of the approach.
