This paper presents a novel approach to learning the structure of Markov networks from data using constraint satisfaction techniques. The authors introduce a characterization of Markov network structure using a balancing condition on separators between cliques, which enables the use of existing solver technology to compute optimal networks. The paper provides a clear and well-organized presentation of the problem, related work, and the proposed approach.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The introduction of a new characterization of Markov network structure, which is a significant contribution to the field.
* The development of a generic approach to learning Markov networks using constraint satisfaction techniques, which is a novel and promising direction.
* The provision of a clear and detailed presentation of the problem, related work, and the proposed approach.
* The experimental evaluation of the proposed approach using various solvers and datasets, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the method.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes a significant amount of background knowledge in graphical models, constraint satisfaction, and optimization techniques, which may make it difficult for non-experts to follow.
* The experimental evaluation is limited to two datasets, and it would be beneficial to evaluate the approach on a wider range of datasets to demonstrate its robustness.
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the computational complexity of the proposed approach and its scalability to larger datasets.
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The paper presents a significant contribution to the field of graphical models and constraint satisfaction.
