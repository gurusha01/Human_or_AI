This paper extends the factorized asymptotic Bayesian (FAB) inference framework to latent feature models (LFMs), which have been a challenging setting for FAB due to the lack of a specific condition on the Hessian matrix of the complete log-likelihood. The authors provide an asymptotic analysis of the Hessian matrix of LFMs, showing that the factorized information criterion (FIC) for LFMs has the same form as that for mixture models. This allows for the derivation of FAB inference for LFMs, which offers desirable properties such as automatic hidden state selection and parameter identifiability.
The paper is well-written and clearly organized, with a thorough introduction to the background and related work. The authors provide a detailed derivation of the FIC for LFMs and propose a shrinkage acceleration method to reduce computational cost. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of FAB/LFMs in terms of model selection, prediction, and computational efficiency, outperforming state-of-the-art Indian Buffet Process (IBP) methods and variational Bayesian (VB) methods.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The authors provide a rigorous asymptotic analysis of the Hessian matrix of LFMs, which is a significant contribution to the field.
* The proposed FAB/LFM framework offers a fully automated model selection method, which is a desirable property in many applications.
* The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of FAB/LFMs in terms of model selection, prediction, and computational efficiency.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes a specific form of the prior distribution for the latent variables, which may not be suitable for all applications.
* The authors do not provide a thorough comparison with other state-of-the-art methods, such as non-parametric Bayesian methods.
* The paper could benefit from more detailed discussions on the limitations and potential extensions of the proposed framework.
Overall, the paper is well-written and provides a significant contribution to the field of Bayesian inference for LFMs. The proposed FAB/LFM framework offers a promising approach for automated model selection and prediction, and the experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness.
