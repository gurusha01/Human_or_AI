This paper proposes a novel approach to approximate inference in high-treewidth graphical models by projecting the intractable distribution onto a "fast-mixing" set, which is guaranteed to have rapid convergence of Gibbs sampling. The authors derive a dual algorithm to solve the projection under several divergences, including Euclidean distance, piecewise KL-divergence, and reversed KL-divergence.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem of inference in high-treewidth graphical models. The proposed approach is original and has the potential to improve the accuracy of approximate inference methods. The experimental evaluation is thorough, and the results show that the proposed methods outperform standard variational methods and Gibbs sampling with finite time.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel approach to approximate inference in high-treewidth graphical models
* The derivation of a dual algorithm to solve the projection under several divergences
* The thorough experimental evaluation, which shows the effectiveness of the proposed methods
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The looseness of the spectral norm bound, which may be too conservative in some cases
* The lack of a tighter bound on when rapid mixing will occur
* The need for further work to extend the approach to general Markov random fields
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel and original approach to approximate inference in high-treewidth graphical models
* The experimental evaluation is thorough and shows the effectiveness of the proposed methods
* The paper has the potential to improve the accuracy of approximate inference methods
Arguments con acceptance:
* The looseness of the spectral norm bound may be a limitation of the approach
* The need for further work to extend the approach to general Markov random fields may be a drawback
* The paper may benefit from a more detailed analysis of the theoretical properties of the proposed approach
Overall, I recommend accepting the paper, as it proposes a novel and original approach to approximate inference in high-treewidth graphical models, and the experimental evaluation shows the effectiveness of the proposed methods. However, the authors should be encouraged to address the weaknesses of the paper, including the looseness of the spectral norm bound and the need for further work to extend the approach to general Markov random fields.
