This paper presents a comprehensive study of asymmetric regret guarantees for the absolute loss game, a fundamental problem in online learning. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the achievable regret trade-offs, characterizing the set of realizable trade-offs and constructing optimal strategies for each sample size. The paper also explores the relation between priors and regret bounds, showing that the expected trade-off is achievable but sub-optimal.
The paper is well-written, and the authors demonstrate a deep understanding of the problem and its connections to previous work. The technical contributions are significant, and the results have important implications for the field of online learning.
The strengths of the paper include:
* A clear and concise presentation of the problem and its significance
* A thorough analysis of the achievable regret trade-offs, including a characterization of the set of realizable trade-offs and the construction of optimal strategies
* A detailed exploration of the relation between priors and regret bounds, including a proof that the expected trade-off is achievable but sub-optimal
* A discussion of the implications of the results for the field of online learning, including potential applications to other problems and areas of research
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes a significant amount of background knowledge in online learning and game theory, which may make it difficult for non-experts to follow
* Some of the technical proofs and derivations are lengthy and complex, which may make it challenging for readers to verify the results
* The paper could benefit from more discussion of the potential limitations and future directions of the research
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication. The technical contributions are significant, and the results have important implications for the field of online learning. While the paper may be challenging for non-experts to follow, it is well-written and provides a clear and concise presentation of the problem and its significance.
