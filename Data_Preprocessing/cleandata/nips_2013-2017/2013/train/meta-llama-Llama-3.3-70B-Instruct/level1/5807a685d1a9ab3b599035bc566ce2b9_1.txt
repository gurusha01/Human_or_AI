This paper provides a detailed study of the estimation of probability distributions under local differential privacy constraints. The authors establish sharp minimax rates of convergence for estimation in these settings, exhibiting fundamental trade-offs between privacy and convergence rate. The paper is well-written, and the authors demonstrate a clear understanding of the relevant literature and technical concepts.
The paper's main contributions are two-fold. First, the authors provide a theoretical framework for characterizing optimal estimation under local differential privacy constraints. They introduce a notion of "α-private minimax rate" and provide lower bounds on the convergence rates of any estimator under α-local privacy. Second, the authors apply this framework to two specific problems: multinomial estimation and density estimation. For multinomial estimation, they show that Warner's randomized response procedure is optimal, and for density estimation, they establish a new minimax lower bound that exhibits a different polynomial rate of convergence than the classical result.
The paper's strengths include its technical rigor, clarity of exposition, and significance of the results. The authors provide a thorough review of the relevant literature, and their proofs are detailed and well-organized. The paper's contributions are also significant, as they provide a foundation for understanding the trade-offs between privacy and statistical efficiency in a variety of settings.
One potential weakness of the paper is that the results are primarily theoretical, and it is not clear how they will be applied in practice. However, the authors do provide some discussion of the implications of their results for survey sampling and other applications, and they also propose some practical estimation strategies that achieve the optimal convergence rates.
In terms of the review criteria, I would rate the paper as follows:
* Quality: 9/10 (the paper is technically sound, and the authors provide a clear and thorough exposition of their results)
* Clarity: 9/10 (the paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear introduction to the relevant technical concepts)
* Originality: 8/10 (the paper's results are significant and original, but they build on existing work in differential privacy and statistical inference)
* Significance: 9/10 (the paper's results have significant implications for understanding the trade-offs between privacy and statistical efficiency in a variety of settings)
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication. It makes a significant contribution to the field of statistical inference under differential privacy constraints, and it provides a foundation for future research in this area.
