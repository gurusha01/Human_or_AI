This paper addresses the problem of estimating the ratio of two density functions, which is a crucial task in various statistical inference and machine learning applications. The authors propose a novel approach based on reformulating the density ratio estimation problem as an inverse problem in terms of an integral operator, known as the Fredholm equation of the first kind. They apply regularization techniques, specifically Tikhonov regularization with a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) norm penalty, to solve the resulting inverse problem. The proposed algorithm, called FIRE (Fredholm Inverse Regularized Estimator), is shown to be flexible, simple, and easy to implement.
The paper provides a detailed theoretical analysis of the algorithm, including concentration bounds and convergence rates for the Gaussian kernel, which is a popular choice in machine learning. The authors also propose a completely unsupervised technique, CD-CV (Cross-Density Cross-Validation), for model selection, which is a significant contribution to the field.
The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the FIRE algorithm in various settings, including regression and classification tasks. The authors compare their method with other state-of-the-art algorithms, such as Kernel Mean Matching (KMM) and Least Squares Importance Sampling (LSIF), and show that FIRE outperforms them in many cases.
The strengths of the paper include:
* A novel and well-motivated approach to density ratio estimation
* A detailed theoretical analysis of the algorithm, including concentration bounds and convergence rates
* A completely unsupervised technique for model selection, which is a significant contribution to the field
* Experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of the algorithm in various settings
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes that the density functions are smooth and well-behaved, which may not always be the case in practice
* The algorithm requires the choice of several hyperparameters, including the kernel width and regularization parameter, which can be challenging to tune in practice
* The paper could benefit from more extensive experimental evaluations, including comparisons with other algorithms and more detailed analyses of the results
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of density ratio estimation and machine learning. The proposed algorithm, FIRE, is a valuable addition to the toolkit of machine learning practitioners, and the theoretical analysis and experimental results provide a solid foundation for its use in practice.
