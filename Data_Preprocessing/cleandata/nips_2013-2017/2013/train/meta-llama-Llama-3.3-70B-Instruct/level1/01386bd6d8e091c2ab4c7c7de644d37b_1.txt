This paper presents a novel statistical method for "stitching" together sequentially imaged sets of neurons into one model, allowing for the characterization of population dynamics beyond the number of simultaneously imaged neurons. The authors propose a latent dynamical system model that can estimate the joint dynamics of a neural population from partial observations, and demonstrate its effectiveness on both simulated and real calcium imaging data from the mouse somatosensory cortex.
The paper is well-written, clearly organized, and provides a thorough introduction to the problem and related work. The authors provide a detailed description of their method, including the mathematical formulation of the latent dynamical system model and the expectation-maximization algorithm used for parameter estimation. The results are impressive, showing that the stitching method can accurately predict correlations between non-simultaneously recorded neuron pairs, even when the overlap between the two populations is limited.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The novelty of the approach, which addresses a significant limitation of current imaging techniques
* The thorough evaluation of the method on both simulated and real data
* The clear and concise writing style, which makes the paper accessible to a broad audience
* The potential impact of the work, which could enable the characterization of population dynamics in larger neural circuits
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The assumption of a linear Gaussian dynamical system, which may not capture the full complexity of neural dynamics
* The requirement for some overlap between the two populations, which may not always be feasible in experimental designs
* The potential for over-fitting, particularly when dealing with large populations of neurons
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper presents a novel and innovative approach to addressing a significant challenge in neuroscience
* The results are impressive and demonstrate the effectiveness of the method
* The paper is well-written and provides a clear and concise introduction to the problem and related work
* The potential impact of the work is significant, and could enable new insights into neural computation and circuit function
Arguments against acceptance:
* The assumption of a linear Gaussian dynamical system may be overly simplistic, and may not capture the full complexity of neural dynamics
* The requirement for some overlap between the two populations may limit the applicability of the method in certain experimental designs
* The potential for over-fitting may be a concern, particularly when dealing with large populations of neurons.
Overall, I believe that the paper is a strong contribution to the field, and that the strengths outweigh the weaknesses. I recommend acceptance, with minor revisions to address the potential limitations and assumptions of the method.
