This paper proposes a novel greedy algorithm, called SWAP, for sparse recovery in high-dimensional settings with correlated measurement matrices. The algorithm iteratively swaps variables to minimize a loss function until no further improvement is possible. The authors provide theoretical guarantees for the performance of SWAP, including conditions on the measurement matrix that ensure accurate support recovery. They also demonstrate the effectiveness of SWAP through numerical simulations on synthetic and real data, showing that it outperforms several state-of-the-art sparse recovery algorithms.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem of sparse recovery and the challenges posed by correlated measurement matrices. The description of the SWAP algorithm is easy to follow, and the theoretical analysis is thorough and well-motivated. The numerical simulations provide strong evidence for the effectiveness of SWAP, and the authors do a good job of comparing their results to those of other algorithms.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel and effective algorithm for sparse recovery in high-dimensional settings with correlated measurement matrices.
* A thorough theoretical analysis of the performance of SWAP, including conditions on the measurement matrix that ensure accurate support recovery.
* Strong numerical evidence for the effectiveness of SWAP, including comparisons to other state-of-the-art algorithms.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The algorithm and analysis are limited to a specific type of measurement matrix, and it is not clear how well SWAP will perform in other settings.
* The computational complexity of SWAP is not thoroughly analyzed, and it is not clear how scalable the algorithm is to very large problem sizes.
* Some of the notation and terminology used in the paper may be unfamiliar to readers without a strong background in sparse recovery and high-dimensional statistics.
Arguments for acceptance:
