This paper proposes a novel theory of matrix completion that leverages side information to reduce the required number of observed entries for perfect recovery of a low-rank matrix. The authors demonstrate that with the assistance of side information matrices, the sample complexity can be dramatically reduced from O(n ln n) to O(ln n), making it more applicable to large-scale problems. The paper is well-written, and the ideas are clearly presented.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposed approach is novel and addresses a significant limitation of standard matrix completion theory.
* The theoretical analysis is rigorous, and the results are supported by empirical studies on synthetic and real-world data sets.
* The application to transductive incomplete multi-label learning is interesting and demonstrates the potential of the proposed approach in real-world problems.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The assumption that the column and row vectors in the target matrix lie in the subspaces spanned by the column vectors in the side information matrices may not always hold in practice.
* The optimization problem for matrix completion with side information may be computationally expensive to solve, especially for large matrices.
* The empirical studies could be more comprehensive, including more baseline methods and data sets.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel and significant contribution to the field of matrix completion.
* The theoretical analysis is rigorous, and the results are supported by empirical studies.
* The application to transductive incomplete multi-label learning is interesting and demonstrates the potential of the proposed approach.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The assumption about the relationship between the target matrix and the side information matrices may not always hold in practice.
* The optimization problem for matrix completion with side information may be computationally expensive to solve.
* The empirical studies could be more comprehensive.
Overall, I believe that the paper is well-written, and the proposed approach is novel and significant. The theoretical analysis is rigorous, and the results are supported by empirical studies. While there are some limitations and potential weaknesses, I think that the paper is a good fit for the NIPS conference, and I recommend acceptance. 
Quality: 8/10
