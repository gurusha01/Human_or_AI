This paper proposes a novel model for neural spiking data from populations of neurons, based on a determinantal point process (DPP) over latent embeddings of neurons. The model effectively captures complex inhibitory and competitive interactions between neurons, which is a significant improvement over traditional point process models such as the Poisson process and the gamma renewal process. The authors demonstrate the model's ability to learn latent representations that reflect the inhibitory properties of neurons, and show that it can capture known structure and interactions between neurons in rat hippocampal neural spike recordings.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the background and motivation of the work. The technical sections are also well-explained, and the authors provide a detailed description of the model and its components. The empirical evaluation of the model is thorough, and the authors provide a range of experiments to demonstrate the model's performance.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel model that effectively captures inhibitory interactions between neurons
* The demonstration of the model's ability to learn latent representations that reflect the inhibitory properties of neurons
* The thorough empirical evaluation of the model, including a range of experiments to demonstrate its performance
* The clear and concise writing style, which makes the paper easy to follow
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The model's computational complexity, which may limit its scalability to large populations of neurons
* The assumption of independence between time slices, which may not be realistic in all cases
* The lack of comparison to other models that capture inhibitory interactions between neurons
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel and effective model for neural spiking data from populations of neurons
* The model has been thoroughly evaluated, and the results demonstrate its performance and potential
* The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the background and motivation of the work
Arguments against acceptance:
* The model's computational complexity may limit its scalability to large populations of neurons
* The assumption of independence between time slices may not be realistic in all cases
* The lack of comparison to other models that capture inhibitory interactions between neurons may limit the paper's impact and relevance.
Overall, I believe that the paper is a strong contribution to the field, and that the strengths outweigh the weaknesses. I recommend acceptance, with the suggestion that the authors address the limitations and weaknesses in future work.
