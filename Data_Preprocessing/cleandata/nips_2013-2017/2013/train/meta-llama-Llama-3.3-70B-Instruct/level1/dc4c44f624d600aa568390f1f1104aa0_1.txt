This paper proposes a class of efficient Generalized Method-of-Moments (GMM) algorithms for computing parameters of the Plackett-Luce model, which is a popular statistical model for rank aggregation. The authors introduce a new connection between the Rank Centrality (RC) algorithm and the Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model, and then generalize this idea to the Plackett-Luce model. The proposed GMM algorithms break full rankings into pairwise comparisons and compute parameters that satisfy a set of generalized moment conditions.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of their methodology. The technical contributions of the paper are significant, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of the consistency and computational complexity of their algorithms. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, showing that they run significantly faster than the classical Minorize-Maximization (MM) algorithm while achieving competitive statistical efficiency.

* The proposal of a new class of efficient GMM algorithms for the Plackett-Luce model, which is a significant contribution to the field of rank aggregation.

Overall, I believe that the paper is well-written and makes a significant contribution to the field of rank aggregation. The proposed algorithms are efficient and effective, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of their consistency and computational complexity. However, the assumption that the data is generated under the Plackett-Luce model and the limited analysis of the robustness of the proposed algorithms to noise and outliers in the data are concerns that need to be addressed.
