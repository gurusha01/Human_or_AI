This paper presents a novel approach to understanding human active sensing, specifically in the context of visual search. The authors propose a goal-directed, context-sensitive, Bayesian control strategy, C-DAC, which optimizes behavioral costs and adapts to changing task conditions. They also introduce a myopic approximation to C-DAC, which reduces computational complexity while retaining context-sensitivity. The paper compares the performance of C-DAC, myopic C-DAC, and Infomax, a previously proposed algorithm, against human behavioral data from a visual search experiment.
The paper's main strengths are its novel theoretical contributions, including the introduction of C-DAC and its myopic approximation, as well as its experimental validation of these models against human data. The authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of their models and experimental design, making it easy to follow and understand their work. The paper also provides a thorough review of previous work in the field, situating their contributions within the broader context of active sensing research.
One of the paper's weaknesses is its reliance on a specific experimental paradigm, which may limit the generalizability of its findings to other contexts. Additionally, the paper's discussion of the implications of its results for our understanding of brain function and artificial intelligence could be more detailed and nuanced. The authors also acknowledge that C-DAC may not be a realistic model of human brain function due to its computational complexity, which may limit its usefulness as a model of human active sensing.
