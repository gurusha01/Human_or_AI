This paper presents a comprehensive study on flat and hierarchical classification strategies in the context of large-scale taxonomies. The authors propose a multiclass, hierarchical data-dependent bound on the generalization error of classifiers deployed in large-scale taxonomies, which provides an explanation for several empirical results reported in the literature. They also introduce a well-founded way to select nodes that should be pruned in a taxonomy to derive a better-suited classification problem.
The paper is well-organized, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, related work, and their contributions. The technical sections are sound, and the proofs of the theorems are provided in the supplementary material. The experimental results are convincing and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed pruning strategy.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel data-dependent bound on the generalization error of multiclass, hierarchical classifiers, which provides a theoretical explanation for the performance of flat and hierarchical classification strategies.
* The introduction of a well-founded way to simplify a taxonomy by selectively pruning some of its nodes, through a meta-classifier.
* The experimental results, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed pruning strategy and are in line with the theoretical developments.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes that the taxonomy is a rooted tree or a directed acyclic graph, which might not be the case in all real-world applications.
* The proposed pruning strategy is based on a simple meta-classifier, which might not be sufficient for more complex taxonomies.
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with other related work, such as [4] and [19], which propose different approaches to simplify taxonomies.
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The paper presents a novel and theoretically sound approach to understanding the performance of flat and hierarchical classification strategies in large-scale taxonomies.
* The proposed pruning strategy is effective and demonstrates significant improvements over random pruning and the original taxonomy.
* The paper provides a clear and concise introduction to the problem, related work, and contributions, making it accessible to a broad audience.
Arguments con acceptance:
* The paper assumes a specific structure for the taxonomy, which might limit its applicability to other domains.
* The proposed pruning strategy is based on a simple meta-classifier, which might not be sufficient for more complex taxonomies.
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with other related work and a more extensive evaluation of the proposed approach.
Overall, I recommend accepting this paper, as it presents a novel and theoretically sound approach to understanding the performance of flat and hierarchical classification strategies in large-scale taxonomies, and the proposed pruning strategy demonstrates significant improvements over random pruning and the original taxonomy. However, I suggest that the authors address the weaknesses mentioned above and provide a more detailed comparison with other related work.
