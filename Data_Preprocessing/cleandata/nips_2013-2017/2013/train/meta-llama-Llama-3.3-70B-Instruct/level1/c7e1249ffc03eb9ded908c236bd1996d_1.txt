This paper proposes a model for demand estimation in multi-agent, differentiated product settings, extending the popular setup in Berry, Levinsohn, and Pakes (1995) to allow for data-driven classification of agents' types using agent-level data. The authors develop an algorithm involving a novel application of reversible jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) techniques to classify agents' types and estimate the parameters associated with each type.
The paper's main contributions are: (1) establishing the identifiability of the mixture model when observing ranking data, (2) proving the uni-modality of the likelihood function when types are observable, and (3) proposing a scalable algorithm for inference. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through experiments on synthetic and real-world data, showing that models with multiple types provide a significantly better fit.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of their model, algorithm, and theoretical results. The use of RJMCMC techniques is novel and allows for the estimation of the number of types and their associated parameters. The experimental results are convincing, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of the performance of their algorithm.
Strengths:
* The paper proposes a novel extension of GRUMs to allow for heterogeneous agent types.
* The authors establish the identifiability of the mixture model and prove the uni-modality of the likelihood function.
* The proposed algorithm is scalable and can be parallelized for use on large data sets.
* The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.
Weaknesses:
* The paper assumes a specific form for the utility function, which may not be flexible enough to capture complex agent behaviors.
* The authors do not provide a thorough comparison with existing methods for demand estimation.
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the algorithm.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel and significant contribution to the field of demand estimation.
* The authors provide a thorough and well-written explanation of their model, algorithm, and theoretical results.
* The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.
Arguments against acceptance:

Overall, I recommend accepting this paper, as it proposes a novel and significant contribution to the field of demand estimation, and the authors provide a thorough and well-written explanation of their model, algorithm, and theoretical results. However, the authors should address the weaknesses mentioned above to improve the paper.
