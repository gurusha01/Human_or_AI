This paper proposes novel graphical models for count-valued data, addressing the limitations of existing Poisson graphical models which can only capture negative conditional dependencies. The authors introduce three new approaches: the Truncated Poisson Graphical Model (TPGM), the Quadratic Poisson Graphical Model (QPGM), and the Sublinear Poisson Graphical Model (SPGM). These models can capture both positive and negative conditional dependencies between count-valued variables.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and thorough introduction to the background and motivation of the problem. The technical contributions are significant, and the authors provide a detailed analysis of the properties and advantages of each proposed model. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed models in recovering network structures from simulated and real-world data.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The authors address a significant limitation of existing Poisson graphical models and propose novel solutions that can capture both positive and negative conditional dependencies.
* The paper provides a thorough analysis of the properties and advantages of each proposed model, including their normalizability, scalability, and interpretability.
* The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed models in recovering network structures from simulated and real-world data.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes a certain level of familiarity with graphical models and Poisson distributions, which may make it challenging for non-experts to follow.
* Some of the technical proofs and derivations are relegated to the appendix, which may make it difficult for readers to fully appreciate the technical contributions of the paper.
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with existing methods for modeling count-valued data, such as log-linear models and copula-based approaches.
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of graphical models and count-valued data analysis. The proposed models have the potential to be widely applicable in various domains, including genomics, neuroscience, and social network analysis.
