This paper proposes an approximate inference algorithm for continuous-time Gaussian Markov process models with both discrete and continuous-time likelihoods. The authors derive a hybrid fixed-point iteration consisting of expectation propagation updates for discrete-time terms and variational updates for the continuous-time term. They also introduce post-inference corrections methods to improve the marginals of the approximation.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of their methodology. The use of expectation propagation and variational updates is well-motivated, and the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through several experiments on real and simulated data.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel approximate inference algorithm for continuous-time Gaussian Markov process models with both discrete and continuous-time likelihoods.
* The derivation of a hybrid fixed-point iteration that combines expectation propagation and variational updates.
* The introduction of post-inference corrections methods to improve the marginals of the approximation.
* The demonstration of the effectiveness of the approach through several experiments on real and simulated data.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The assumption of a latent linear diffusion process, which may not be applicable to all non-linear diffusion processes.
* The limitation of the approach to continuous-time likelihoods that are regular integrals, rather than Ito integrals.
* The lack of comparison to other approximate inference algorithms, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods.
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of approximate inference for continuous-time stochastic processes. The proposed algorithm is efficient and effective, and the authors demonstrate its potential for application to real-world problems.
