This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of machine learning, addressing the question of whether more data can be used to speed up computation time in supervised learning tasks. The authors provide a positive answer to this question for a natural supervised learning problem, specifically agnostic PAC learning of halfspaces over 3-sparse vectors. They introduce a novel, non-cryptographic methodology for establishing computational-statistical gaps, which allows them to show that under a widely believed assumption, it is impossible to efficiently learn this class using only a limited number of examples.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, as well as a thorough explanation of their methodology and results. The technical contributions of the paper are significant, and the authors demonstrate a deep understanding of the underlying concepts and techniques.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to establish a tradeoff between sample and computational complexity for a natural supervised learning problem. The authors show that while it is possible to learn the class of halfspaces over 3-sparse vectors using a limited number of examples, it is impossible to do so efficiently under certain assumptions. This result has important implications for the design of machine learning algorithms and the understanding of the fundamental limits of learning.
The paper also presents a new algorithm for learning halfspaces over 3-sparse vectors, which is shown to be efficient and effective. The authors demonstrate the efficacy of their algorithm through a series of experiments and provide a detailed analysis of its performance.
In terms of weaknesses, one potential criticism of the paper is that the results are limited to a specific class of learning problems. While the authors demonstrate the significance of their results for this class, it is unclear how broadly applicable they are to other learning problems. Additionally, the paper assumes a certain level of familiarity with machine learning and computational complexity theory, which may make it difficult for non-experts to follow.
Overall, I would argue in favor of accepting this paper. The technical contributions are significant, and the authors demonstrate a deep understanding of the underlying concepts and techniques. The paper is well-written, and the results are clearly presented and well-motivated.
