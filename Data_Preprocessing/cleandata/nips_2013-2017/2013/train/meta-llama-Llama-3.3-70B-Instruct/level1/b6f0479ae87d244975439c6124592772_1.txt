This paper presents active learning algorithms for structured prediction problems, which aim to reduce the amount of labeling required to learn good models. The authors propose two active learning algorithms, separate and joint, that select the most informative random variables to label based on local entropies. The separate algorithm learns from labeled and weakly labeled examples and then performs inference to query the next random variable, while the joint algorithm takes advantage of unlabeled data during learning and computes the entropies in closed form.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear overview of the related work and the contributions of their approach. The experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in the task of 3D room layout prediction from a single image, achieving state-of-the-art performance with only 10% of the labelings.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of two active learning algorithms that can handle general graphical models with arbitrary topology and energy functions.
* The use of local entropies as a criterion for selecting the most informative random variables to label.
* The experimental evaluation, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in a real-world application.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The complexity of the proposed algorithms, which may make them difficult to implement and optimize in practice.
* The reliance on convex approximations, which may not always provide accurate results.
* The lack of comparison with other active learning algorithms that use different criteria for selecting the most informative examples.
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The paper presents a novel approach to active learning for structured prediction problems.
* The experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in a real-world application.
* The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear overview of the related work and the contributions of their approach.
Arguments con acceptance:
* The complexity of the proposed algorithms may make them difficult to implement and optimize in practice.
* The reliance on convex approximations may not always provide accurate results.
* The lack of comparison with other active learning algorithms that use different criteria for selecting the most informative examples may limit the scope of the paper.
Overall, I recommend accepting this paper, as it presents a novel approach to active learning for structured prediction problems and demonstrates its effectiveness in a real-world application. However, the authors should address the weaknesses of the paper, such as the complexity of the proposed algorithms and the reliance on convex approximations, in future work.
