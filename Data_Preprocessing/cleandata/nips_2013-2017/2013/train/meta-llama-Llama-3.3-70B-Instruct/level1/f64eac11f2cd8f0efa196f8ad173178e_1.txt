This paper proposes a novel approach to determine the learning rate in policy gradient methods by maximizing a lower bound to the expected performance gain. The authors derive a lower bound that is a second-order polynomial of the step size and show how a simplified version of this bound can be maximized when the gradient is estimated from trajectory samples. The paper focuses on Gaussian policies and provides a closed-form solution for the optimal step size.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of their approach. The theoretical analysis is sound, and the numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The paper is well-organized, and the authors provide a good introduction to the problem and the related work.
The strengths of the paper are:
* The authors propose a novel approach to determine the learning rate in policy gradient methods, which is a significant contribution to the field.
* The paper provides a clear and detailed explanation of the theoretical analysis, making it easy to follow and understand.
* The numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and provide insights into the behavior of the algorithm.
The weaknesses of the paper are:
* The paper assumes a Gaussian policy model, which may not be applicable to all scenarios. It would be interesting to see how the approach can be extended to other policy models.
* The paper does not provide a comparison with other methods for determining the learning rate, such as line search or trust region methods.
* The numerical simulations are limited to a simple LQG problem, and it would be interesting to see how the approach performs on more complex tasks.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel and significant contribution to the field of policy gradient methods.
* The theoretical analysis is sound, and the numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
* The paper is well-written and easy to follow, making it a pleasure to read.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The paper assumes a Gaussian policy model, which may limit its applicability.
* The paper does not provide a comparison with other methods for determining the learning rate.
* The numerical simulations are limited to a simple LQG problem, and more complex tasks should be considered.
Overall, I think the paper is a good contribution to the field, and I would recommend acceptance. However, I would like to see the authors address the weaknesses mentioned above, such as extending the approach to other policy models and providing a comparison with other methods.
