This paper proposes an approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm for low-rank matrix reconstruction, which is a problem of reconstructing a low-rank matrix from its noisy observations. The algorithm is derived in the Bayesian framework, allowing for the incorporation of prior knowledge about the structural properties of the matrix. The authors also apply the proposed algorithm to a clustering problem, formulating it as a low-rank matrix reconstruction problem with an additional structural constraint.
The paper is well-written, and the proposed algorithm is thoroughly explained. The authors provide a detailed analysis of the algorithm's properties, including its computational cost, convergence, and optimality. The numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in both artificial and real data sets, outperforming existing algorithms such as Lloyd's K-means and the variational Bayes matrix factorization.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel AMP algorithm for low-rank matrix reconstruction, which can incorporate prior knowledge about the structural properties of the matrix.
* The application of the proposed algorithm to a clustering problem, which demonstrates its versatility and effectiveness.
* The thorough analysis of the algorithm's properties, including its computational cost, convergence, and optimality.
* The numerical experiments, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in both artificial and real data sets.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The algorithm's convergence is not guaranteed, and the authors assume convergence in their analysis.
* The choice of the parameter τ, which appears in the algorithm, is not clearly explained, and its estimation is proposed as a temporary solution.
* The comparison with existing algorithms is limited to a few examples, and a more comprehensive comparison would be beneficial.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the proposed algorithm is a significant contribution to the field of low-rank matrix reconstruction and clustering. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm in various experiments, and the paper provides a thorough analysis of the algorithm's properties.
