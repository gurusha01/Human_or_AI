This paper presents a novel algorithm for efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling in the context of Gaussian copula extended rank likelihood models. The authors address the issue of slow mixing in traditional Gibbs sampling approaches by proposing a constrained Hamiltonian Markov chain Monte Carlo (HMC) method. The key contribution of this work is the development of the Hough Envelope algorithm, which efficiently searches for the smallest collision time with the constraints, reducing the computational complexity from O(n^2) to O(n) in practice.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, as well as a thorough review of the relevant literature. The technical sections are detailed and well-explained, making it easy to follow the authors' reasoning. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, showing faster convergence and better exploration of the posterior distribution compared to a state-of-the-art parameter expansion (PX) sampling scheme.
The strengths of this paper include:
* The authors address a significant problem in the field of machine learning, namely the slow mixing of MCMC algorithms in high-dimensional spaces.
* The proposed algorithm is novel and well-motivated, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the technical details.
* The experimental results are convincing, demonstrating the superiority of the proposed algorithm over a competing method.
