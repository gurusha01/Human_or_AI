This paper presents a fully Bayesian approach to inference and learning in nonlinear nonparametric state-space models. The authors propose a Gaussian process prior over the state transition dynamics, resulting in a flexible model that can capture complex dynamical phenomena. To enable efficient inference, they marginalize over the transition dynamics function and infer directly the joint smoothing distribution using a tailored particle Markov Chain Monte Carlo (PMCMC) sampler.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of their approach. The use of a Gaussian process prior over the state transition dynamics is a novel and interesting idea, and the authors demonstrate its effectiveness in several experiments. The paper also provides a thorough review of related work in the field, highlighting the contributions and limitations of existing approaches.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to handle nonparametric models, which can capture complex dynamics that may not be well-represented by parametric models. The authors also demonstrate the flexibility of their approach by using a parametric model as a baseline and showing that the GP-SSM can still learn accurate dynamics even when the parametric model is not representative of the true dynamics.
The experiments presented in the paper are also well-designed and demonstrate the effectiveness of the GP-SSM in learning accurate dynamics and making predictions. The use of a cart and pole system, a classic problem in reinforcement learning, is a good example of the applicability of the GP-SSM to real-world problems.
However, there are some potential weaknesses and limitations of the paper. One potential limitation is the computational cost of the PMCMC sampler, which may be prohibitive for large datasets or complex models. The authors do provide some discussion of the computational cost and propose some methods for reducing it, but this may still be a limitation for some applications.
Another potential limitation is the choice of hyperparameters, which can have a significant impact on the performance of the GP-SSM. The authors do provide some discussion of hyperparameter selection, but this may still be a challenge for practitioners who are not familiar with Gaussian process models.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of state-space models and Gaussian process regression. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach in several experiments and provide a thorough review of related work. While there are some potential limitations and weaknesses, the paper is well-written and provides a clear and detailed explanation of the GP-SSM.
