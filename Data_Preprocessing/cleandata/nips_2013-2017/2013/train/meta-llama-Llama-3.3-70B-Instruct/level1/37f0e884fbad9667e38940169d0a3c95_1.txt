This paper proposes a novel algorithm, Epoch Mixed Gradient Descent (EMGD), for smooth and strongly convex optimization problems. The algorithm leverages both full and stochastic gradients to reduce the number of full gradients required, which can be computationally expensive for large datasets. The authors provide a thorough theoretical analysis, demonstrating that EMGD achieves a linear convergence rate and reduces the number of full gradients needed from O(√κ log 1/ε) to O(log 1/ε), where κ is the condition number.
The paper is well-organized, and the authors provide a clear overview of the related work in convex optimization. The algorithm is carefully described, and the theoretical analysis is rigorous. The authors also provide comparisons with other optimization algorithms, highlighting the advantages of EMGD in terms of computational cost and convergence rate.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel algorithm that addresses the limitation of existing optimization methods
* A thorough theoretical analysis that provides insights into the convergence rate and computational complexity of EMGD
* Comparisons with other optimization algorithms that demonstrate the advantages of EMGD
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The requirement of knowing the condition number κ beforehand, which can be a limitation in practice
* The lack of experimental evaluations to demonstrate the effectiveness of EMGD in real-world scenarios
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel algorithm that addresses a significant limitation in convex optimization
* The theoretical analysis is rigorous and provides valuable insights into the convergence rate and computational complexity of EMGD
* The comparisons with other optimization algorithms demonstrate the advantages of EMGD
Arguments con acceptance:
* The requirement of knowing the condition number κ beforehand can be a limitation in practice
* The lack of experimental evaluations to demonstrate the effectiveness of EMGD in real-world scenarios
Overall, I believe that the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of convex optimization and provides a valuable insight into the design of efficient optimization algorithms. However, the authors should consider addressing the limitations of the paper, such as the requirement of knowing the condition number κ beforehand, and providing experimental evaluations to demonstrate the effectiveness of EMGD in real-world scenarios.
