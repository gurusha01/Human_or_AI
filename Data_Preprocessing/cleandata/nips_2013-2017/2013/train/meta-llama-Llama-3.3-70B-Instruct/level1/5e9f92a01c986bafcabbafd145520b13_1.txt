This paper proposes a novel framework for compressive calcium imaging, which enables the monitoring of large neuronal populations with high temporal resolution. The authors develop a scalable nonnegative deconvolution method to extract neuronal spike time series from randomized projection observations and address the problem of demixing spatial locations of neurons using rank-penalized matrix factorization methods.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, related work, and their proposed approach. The technical sections are detailed and well-organized, making it easy to follow the authors' reasoning and methodology. The use of convex optimization methods and compressed sensing techniques is well-motivated and effectively applied to the problem at hand.
The paper's strengths include:
* The proposal of a novel framework for compressive calcium imaging, which has the potential to enable the imaging of large neural populations at higher rates than currently available.
* The development of efficient methods for extracting neurons' spatial locations and temporal spike locations from limited measurements.
* The use of convex relaxation tools from compressed sensing and low-rank matrix factorization, which provides a robust and efficient approach to the problem.
* The analysis of the noiseless version of the problem from a compressed sensing point of view, which provides valuable insights into the effects of different spike patterns on reconstruction performance.
The paper's weaknesses include:
* The idealistic nature of the analysis, which neglects several issues that can arise in practice, such as motion correction for brain movement and the impact of noise on the measurements.
* The lack of experimental validation, which would be necessary to fully demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
* The potential complexity of the optimization problems, which may require significant computational resources to solve.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel and potentially impactful framework for compressive calcium imaging.
* The technical sections are well-written and provide a clear and concise explanation of the authors' methodology.
* The use of convex optimization methods and compressed sensing techniques is well-motivated and effectively applied to the problem at hand.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The analysis is idealistic and neglects several issues that can arise in practice.
* The lack of experimental validation may limit the paper's impact and relevance to the field.
* The potential complexity of the optimization problems may require significant computational resources to solve.
Overall, I believe that the paper is well-written and provides a valuable contribution to the field of calcium imaging. While there are some weaknesses and limitations to the paper, I believe that the strengths and potential impact of the proposed framework outweigh these limitations, and I recommend acceptance.
