This paper proposes a general approach to variance reduction in stochastic gradient optimization using control variates. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on two practical problems: convex logistic regression and non-convex stochastic variational inference for latent Dirichlet allocation. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear explanation of their methodology and experimental results.
The strengths of this paper include:
* The authors provide a thorough review of the related work and clearly explain the motivation behind their approach.
* The proposed methodology is well-explained, and the authors provide a detailed analysis of the theoretical properties of their approach.
* The experimental results are convincing, and the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on two different problems.
The weaknesses of this paper include:
* The authors could provide more discussion on the computational cost of their approach, particularly in terms of estimating the optimal control variate.
* The authors could also provide more analysis on the choice of the control variate and its impact on the performance of the algorithm.
* Some of the notation and equations in the paper could be better explained, particularly for readers who are not familiar with the topic.
Overall, this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of stochastic gradient optimization, and the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on two practical problems. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear explanation of their methodology and experimental results.
