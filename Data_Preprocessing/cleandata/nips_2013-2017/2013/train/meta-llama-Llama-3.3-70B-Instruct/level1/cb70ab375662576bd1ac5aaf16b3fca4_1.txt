This paper proposes a novel approach to learning dynamic models from non-sequence data using tensor decomposition methods. The authors demonstrate that under reasonable assumptions, their approach can provably recover the parameters of first-order Markov models and hidden Markov models. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of their methodology.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The authors tackle a challenging problem that has not been thoroughly studied before, and their approach is novel and innovative.
* The paper provides a clear and detailed explanation of the methodology, including the assumptions made and the theoretical guarantees provided.
* The authors provide simulation results that demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The assumptions made by the authors may not always hold in practice, and it is unclear how robust the approach is to violations of these assumptions.
* The sample complexity analysis provided by the authors is quite complex and may be difficult to interpret in practice.
* The authors do not provide any real-world examples or applications of their approach, which may make it difficult to evaluate the practical significance of their results.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel and innovative approach to a challenging problem.
* The authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of their methodology.
* The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The assumptions made by the authors may not always hold in practice.
* The sample complexity analysis is complex and may be difficult to interpret.
* The lack of real-world examples or applications may make it difficult to evaluate the practical significance of the results.
Overall, I believe that the paper is well-written and provides a significant contribution to the field. However, the authors could improve the paper by providing more discussion on the robustness of their approach to violations of the assumptions and by including more real-world examples or applications.
