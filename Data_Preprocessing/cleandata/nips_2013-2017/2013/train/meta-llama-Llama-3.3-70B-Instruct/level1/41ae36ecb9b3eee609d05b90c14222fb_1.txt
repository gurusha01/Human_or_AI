This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of machine learning by establishing the linear convergence of the proximal gradient method (PGM) for solving a class of trace norm-regularized problems. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the problem, including a review of previous work and a clear explanation of the methodology used.
The paper is well-organized, and the writing is clear and concise. The authors provide a detailed proof of the main result, which is supported by several lemmas and propositions. The use of mathematical notation is consistent throughout the paper, making it easier to follow.
One of the strengths of the paper is the development of a new Lipschitzian error bound for trace norm-regularized problems, which is a key ingredient in the proof of the linear convergence result. This error bound is likely to be of independent interest and could have implications for other areas of machine learning.
The authors also provide numerical experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the PGM in practice. The experiments are well-designed and provide insight into the performance of the algorithm in different scenarios.
In terms of the review criteria, the paper scores well on quality, clarity, and significance. The paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and numerical experiments. The writing is clear and concise, making it easy to understand the main ideas and methodology. The significance of the paper is high, as it provides a new convergence result for a widely used algorithm in machine learning.
The only potential weakness of the paper is that it assumes a certain level of familiarity with convex optimization and machine learning. While the authors provide some background information, readers without a strong background in these areas may find some of the notation and concepts challenging to follow.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication. The paper makes a significant contribution to the field of machine learning, and the results are likely to be of interest to a wide range of researchers.
