This paper presents a method to speed up object detection by approximating scores using vector quantization (VQ) of feature windows and combining it with various speedup techniques, including cascade detection. The authors demonstrate that their method can achieve a substantial end-to-end speedup over the best current methods without loss of accuracy. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear explanation of their approach, including the use of VQ to approximate dot products and the incorporation of cascade detection to further speed up the process.
The strengths of this paper include its ability to achieve significant speedups while maintaining accuracy, its simplicity and ease of implementation, and its compatibility with existing object detection systems. The authors also provide a thorough evaluation of their method, including comparisons to state-of-the-art algorithms and an analysis of the computational costs involved.
One potential weakness of the paper is that the authors do not provide a detailed analysis of the trade-offs between speed and accuracy, although they do provide some discussion of this issue. Additionally, the authors could have provided more context about the potential applications of their method and its limitations.
In terms of originality, the paper presents a novel combination of techniques, including VQ and cascade detection, to achieve fast and accurate object detection. The authors also provide a thorough review of related work and demonstrate the superiority of their approach over existing methods.
The significance of this paper lies in its ability to achieve significant speedups in object detection, which is a critical component of many computer vision systems. The authors' method has the potential to enable real-time object detection in a variety of applications, including surveillance, robotics, and autonomous vehicles.
