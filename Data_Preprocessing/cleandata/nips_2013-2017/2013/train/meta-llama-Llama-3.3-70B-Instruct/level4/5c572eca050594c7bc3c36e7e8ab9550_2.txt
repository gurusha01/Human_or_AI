This manuscript presents two novel methods for estimating the density ratio of two probabilities, leveraging the principles of importance sampling and regularization techniques. The first approach formulates the problem as a regularization issue, utilizing the L^2 norm of the deviation from equality and a RKHS regularization term, resulting in a Type I Fredholm equation. The second method employs a kernel with a locality parameter that must approach zero for consistency, also expressed as a regularization problem, yielding a Type II Fredholm equation. The authors provide theoretical convergence results and demonstrate the practical efficacy of their methods through experimental evaluations.
A key advantage of the proposed methods over existing approaches, such as KMM, lies in their L^2 formulation, which enables the application of cross-validation (CV) for parameter selection. This is particularly significant in unsupervised learning contexts, where general methods for parameter choice are scarce. The use of L^2 norm allows for a clever adaptation of CV, addressing a critical issue in density ratio estimation. It's worth noting that the objective functions derived from RKHS, as seen in KMM, are not suitable for kernel selection via CV due to their dependence on the kernel, making them non-comparable.
The convergence rate derived in Theorem 1, influenced by the (-t/log λ) factor, is slow for fixed t. In contrast, many kernel method literatures achieve polynomial rates with respect to sample size after fixing the rate of λ. It would be beneficial to explore additional assumptions that could yield a polynomial rate for the proposed estimator. For instance, Caponnetto and De Vito (2007) imposed assumptions on the spectrum of the operator K_{p,t} to achieve an optimal rate for kernel ridge regression. Similarly, making stronger assumptions on q/p could potentially lead to a polynomial rate. A discussion on such polynomial rates under stronger assumptions with fixed t would be a valuable addition.
In density ratio estimation, it's common to assume that q/p belongs to a specific function class, such as Sobolev. However, this assumption is quite strong, requiring prior knowledge about the ratio or tails of p and q. Under such assumptions, the opposite ratio p/q often exhibits poor behavior. It's essential to acknowledge and discuss this limitation of density ratio estimation.
While not mandatory, improving the supplementary materials would be beneficial. The current version contains numerous typos and minor errors, making it challenging to verify the correctness of the theoretical results presented in the main paper. For example, in Lemma 5, corrections are needed, such as replacing W2^2 with Ws^2 and adjusting the bound accordingly. Additionally, expressions at lines 675 and 686 are incorrect, whereas Eq.(31) is correct. The domain of the integral in the proof of Lemma 5 should also be revised. Given the significance of the theoretical results to the paper's contributions, revising the supplementary material is advisable.
The paper's proposal of a new approach to density ratio estimation is noteworthy, particularly in its ability to effectively apply CV for parameter selection, marking a strong point of the methodology.
