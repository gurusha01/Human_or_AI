This study presents novel algorithms for differentially private online learning, effectively covering all scenarios where non-private case results are established. The findings closely mirror the optimal non-private bounds, with minor additional factors and dependencies. Given the recent surge of interest in differentially private learning, this paper offers a more comprehensive and convincing set of results compared to prior work.
At its core, the approach is straightforward, leveraging the "follow the leader" method with a private, noisy history maintained using standard algorithms for differentially private counters. The inherent suitability of follow-the-leader algorithms for privacy has been previously noted, but the current treatment and resulting bounds are particularly noteworthy.
It would be more accurate to describe this work as introducing a class of private learning algorithms or a technique for constructing such algorithms, rather than a general method for rendering online algorithms differentially private, as the latter implies a broader applicability that is not entirely accurate.
The paper's citation practice, which omits author names, made it challenging to read, as frequent references to the bibliography were necessary to fully understand the ideas, particularly when distinguishing between private and non-private cases.
In Table 1, a reminder about the origin of delta from (eps, delta)-DP would be helpful. Additionally, Table 2 lacks citations for non-private results and incorrectly labels the setting as full-information when the results pertain to the bandit setting. Furthermore, the adaptive case results appear to require a T^3/4 term instead of T^2/3.
It is worth investigating whether the explicit dependencies on dimensionality are inherent to preserving privacy and whether a provable gap exists between the achievable dependencies on T for private and non-private algorithms, considering the distinct poly-log factors.
The second-to-last paragraph on page 6 contains redundant information. 
Overall, this paper presents a simple yet appealing approach and set of results on private online learning.
