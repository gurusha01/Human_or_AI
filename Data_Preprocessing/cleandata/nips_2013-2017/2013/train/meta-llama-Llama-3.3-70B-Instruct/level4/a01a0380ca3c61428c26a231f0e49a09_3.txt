The authors investigate the error incurred by depth-first search (DFS) without backtracking in space partitioning trees for nearest-neighbor search, establishing a link between this error and the quantization error of the tree. Although their work is intriguing, several weaknesses are apparent. 
The connection between search error and quantization error is demonstrated through a complex bound with parameters derived from the quantization error. However, this connection relies on the bound being tight, which seems unlikely. For instance, considering the expansion coefficient \(c\) in Theorem 3.1, which depends on \(q\), if \(q\) is chosen such that the minimum distance between \(x \in S\) and \(p\) exceeds the distance between any two points in \(S\), the expansion coefficient becomes \(n\), forcing \(L\) in \(C2\) to be \(0\), rendering Theorem 3.1 inapplicable. This issue arises because Theorem 3.1 only analyzes the upper bound of the distance error, suggesting that a more robust result could be achieved by simultaneously considering the lower bound term.
Furthermore, the dependence of \(c\) on \(q\) implies that Theorem 3.1 is not practically useful for obtaining actual error bounds during the search process, as computing the expansion coefficient is computationally expensive. Thus, Theorem 3.1 serves only as theoretical evidence for the connection between search error and quantization error.
Assuming \(q\) is within \(S\) and the expansion coefficient does not significantly change upon adding \(q\) to \(S\), consider a scenario where \(S\) is copied and transposed such that the two copies are fully separated. The expansion coefficient and \(\omega\) (since any reasonable tree would first separate the copies) would remain approximately the same, but the quantization improvement rate would be excellent on the first level and poor on subsequent levels, resulting in \(\beta\) remaining unchanged. As the copies are moved further apart, \(\psi\) increases, and the bound becomes looser. A better approach might involve working on a local level rather than considering \(\psi\) and \(\beta\) globally.
Although these scenarios may not occur in practice, demonstrating the tightness of the bound empirically, similar to Figure 2, would be beneficial. 
The technical writing could be improved by simplifying notation, such as using \(c\) instead of \(\tilde{c}\), \(B\) instead of \(B{l2}\), and less exotic caligraphy for intrinsic dimension \(d\) and full dimension \(D\). Minor adjustments, like using --- instead of - on page 027, would also enhance readability. Definition 2.1 could be clarified by directly stating that the quantization error improvement rate \(\beta = VS(A) / (VS(A) - VS(Al, A_r))\). Additionally, the meaning of "complete" in \(C2\) and the inclusion of nodes in \(T\) in Theorem 3.1 (whether all nodes or only leaves are included) should be specified.
Overall, while the authors bound the search error of non-backtracking DFS in space-partitioning trees for NN search with a quantization error, the paper's impact is diminished by the lack of convincing evidence that the provided bound is tight.
