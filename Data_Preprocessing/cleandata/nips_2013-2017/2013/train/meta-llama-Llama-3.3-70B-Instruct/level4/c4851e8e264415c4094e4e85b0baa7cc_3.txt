Here is a paraphrased version of the review:
General:
This paper presents a novel supervised topic model, dubbed Relevance Topic Model (RTM), designed for recognizing unstructured activities in videos. The model leverages labeled training data to learn discriminative topics and a classifier. RTM combines sparse Bayesian learning and Replicated Softmax to jointly learn mid-level video representations and a discriminant function. The model consists of an undirected component for modeling video word distributions and a directed component for modeling class-conditional distributions given latent topics. The authors also propose methods for parameter estimation and inference. 
The authors evaluate RTM on the Unstructured Social Activity Attribute (USAA) dataset, reporting quantitative results that outperform existing methods in terms of activity classification accuracy. Additionally, they provide an intriguing analysis of topic correlations between different classes. 
The concept appears promising, and the use of low-level features such as SIFT, STIP, and MFCC is noteworthy. However, it would be interesting to explore the incorporation of more descriptive features, such as object detection, into the model. 
Some relevant works that could be added to the bibliography include [1] and [2], which address similar topics and approaches.

Quality:
The paper is well-written and of good quality. 
Clarity:
The problem statement is clear, and the paper is easy to follow. 
Originality:
The originality of the paper is moderate, as it builds upon existing approaches for intermediate feature learning and semi-supervised activity recognition. However, the relaxation of temporal constraints in unstructured activities and the use of minimal supervision are notable aspects. 
Unsupervised methods, such as [2], often rely on strong assumptions about the temporal structure of observation vectors, which may not be applicable to unstructured activities. The use of minimal supervision is justified for challenging tasks like activity recognition in wild videos. An interesting question for future research is determining the minimum amount of labeled data required for decent classification performance. 
Significance:
The topic of social activity recognition in unconstrained videos is highly significant and exciting. The paper addresses this topic by proposing a novel model that uses minimal labeling for learning and discovering topics. The paper is well-structured, and the evaluation is thorough, making it a valuable contribution to the field.
