The authors present a novel approach, termed SHRT, aimed at accelerating Ridge Regression in scenarios where the number of features (p) significantly exceeds the number of samples (n), i.e., p >> n. The core concept involves reducing the dimensionality of the input matrix X to expedite the computation of XX^T, achieving a reduction in computational complexity from O(n^2) to O(nplogn). This is facilitated through the application of Walsh-Hadamard transforms, which can be computed efficiently in log-time.
The research concept is of high quality and holds considerable potential. The paper is well-structured, technically sound, and clearly written. However, a primary concern arises from the substantial overlap with a recently published paper, "Fastfood â€“ Computing Hilbert Space Expansions in loglinear time" by Quoc Le, Tamas Sarlos, and Alexander Smola, presented at ICML 2013. Given the close timing of the submissions, it is plausible that both works were developed independently. Nonetheless, the Fastfood algorithm appears to be analogous to SHRT but offers a more generalized approach.
A detailed comparison between SHRT and Fastfood reveals several key similarities and differences:
1. The basis matrix R in SHRT corresponds to the matrix P in Fastfood.
2. The Walsh-Hadamard matrix H in SHRT is equivalent to the matrix H in Fastfood.
3. The Rademacher matrix D in SHRT is comparable to the matrix B in Fastfood.
4. A primary distinction lies in the setup, where SHRT is specifically designed for scenarios with p >> n, whereas Fastfood allows for the generation of a number of random features (p_subs) that can exceed p, enabling the construction of multiple "SHRT blocks."
5. SHRT lacks a matrix "G," which in Fastfood represents spectral samples of a Gaussian kernel. This omission is attributed to SHRT's assumption of a vast feature space, leading to the use of a linear kernel. Consequently, the matrices G and S in Fastfood are diagonal in the context of SHRT, and the method is not exponentiated.
The theoretical developments outlined in Lemma 2 and Theorem 1 are mathematically rigorous and introduce novel concepts. Similarly, the application of the method to the PCA algorithm demonstrates innovation. Therefore, despite the overlap with existing work, the submission contains sufficient novel material to warrant consideration.
To further enhance the paper, the authors should cite the works of Rahimi & Recht (2007, 2008) and the Fastfood paper to provide a more comprehensive context. Moreover, establishing a clearer connection with existing research and ideally comparing the proposed method to other randomized approaches would strengthen the manuscript. The author feedback has been noted, and the method's potential to accelerate the computation of XX^T in ridge regression from O(n^2p) to O(nplog(n)) through subsampled randomized Hadamard transforms is acknowledged. While the paper exhibits some overlap with the ICML 2013 work "Fastfood," it also presents novel theoretical developments that contribute to the field.
