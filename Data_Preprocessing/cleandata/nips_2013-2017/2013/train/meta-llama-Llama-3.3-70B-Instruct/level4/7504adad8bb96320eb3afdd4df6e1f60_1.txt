This paper presents an empirical assessment of Classification-Based Policy Iteration (CBPI) using the Tetris benchmark problem, focusing on the analysis of various algorithmic parameters and their impact on performance, rather than introducing novel technical contributions. 
The empirical results indicate that Direct Policy Iteration (DPI), a variant of CBPI that bypasses the use of value functions, achieves performance comparable to both the cross-entropy method and CBPI. This finding is somewhat expected, given the similarities between DPI and the cross-entropy method in terms of policy representation and optimization. 
The analysis and comparative study are convincing, particularly in demonstrating the inadequacy of standard Tetris features for representing value functions optimized through approximate policy iteration. However, the paper falls short in providing insights into the underlying reasons for this inadequacy or proposing alternative feature designs. This limitation reduces the significance and broader applicability of the results. Furthermore, the comparison would benefit from the inclusion of algorithms that compute approximate value functions differently, such as those not based on policy iteration. The current results suggest difficulties in computing good value functions using policy iteration but do not preclude the possibility that other algorithms might succeed in finding effective representations. For instance, incorporating Smoothed Approximate Linear Programming, as explored by Desai, Farias, et al. in 2012, which has shown promising results in this domain, would enhance the comparison. 
The paper offers a comprehensive evaluation of major algorithms on the Tetris problem, a significant benchmark in reinforcement learning. While it shows that classification-based policy iteration outperforms dynamic programming, the lack of deeper insights into the reasons behind the difference in solution quality limits the applicability of these findings to other, more practical domains.
