This manuscript presents a novel approach to accelerate the nearest neighbor retrieval process for VP-trees by estimating the decision function. The authors' strategy involves combining sampling with regression using a piecewise linear function, which is applicable to both metric spaces, such as Euclidean space, and non-metric spaces, including certain Bregman divergences. The empirical results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms recently introduced state-of-the-art approaches in most cases, and the paper also explores the applicability of VP-trees.
The methodology appears to be sound and can be seen as a practical application of fundamental machine learning techniques to optimize search processes where brute-force evaluation is computationally expensive. The paper's organization and clarity are commendable, and the experimental results are persuasive.
Overall, the paper is well-written, technically robust, and contributes a reasonably novel approach. It effectively proposes estimating the decision function to enhance the efficiency of VP-tree's nearest neighbor retrieval, leveraging a sampling and regression strategy with piecewise linear functions. The manuscript's clarity, technical soundness, and novelty make it a valuable contribution.
