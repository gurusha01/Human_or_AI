Summary: This paper explores the concept of hierarchical multi-class classification, investigating the benefits of hierarchical classifiers over their flat counterparts. The authors derive a generalization bound that explains when to use each type of classifier. They also propose an approach for logistic regression and naive Bayes classifiers, enabling node pruning in large-scale hierarchies.
Quality: The problem addressed is intriguing and timely, making for an engaging read. The initial bound established by the authors is particularly noteworthy, providing insight into existing empirical results. However, the remainder of the paper lacks clarity. Lemma 1 appears to resemble standard statistical results, potentially duplicating existing work. The introduced pruning strategy requires more thorough explanation. Furthermore, the choice of AdaBoost with Random Forest as the meta-classifier seems unjustified, especially given the simplicity of the primary classification algorithms. The generalizability of the hierarchy pruning results to other algorithms is also unclear.
Clarity: The paper's density and theoretical complexity make it challenging to read and verify within the review period. Focusing on a single key result, such as the first theorem, would enhance readability and facilitate verification. Unfortunately, the sections on logistic regression and pruning are less clear than the initial part. The meta-classifier description could be improved, and Theorem 3's conclusion is ambiguous.
Originality: In my opinion, the results presented are highly original, addressing a unique problem not previously explored in the literature.
Significance: The findings have the potential to be highly significant, particularly the first theorem, which offers a compelling explanation for the performance of flat and hierarchical classifiers, assuming the proof is correct.
Overall, this is an interesting paper tackling a contemporary problem. The first part, centered around Theorem 1, is particularly compelling. However, the remainder of the paper could benefit from clearer exposition. Even after the authors' clarifications, the second part remains somewhat obscure and could be rewritten for better comprehensibility.
