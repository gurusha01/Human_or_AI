This paper proposes a novel approach to completing an n-by-m matrix M with a rank r less than the minimum of n and m. Rather than directly completing M, the authors leverage side information in the form of an n-by-r1 matrix A and an m-by-r2 matrix B, where M can be expressed as AZB'. By utilizing these pre-specified A and B matrices, the method completes M through the estimation of Z.
The authors demonstrate that when r1 and r2 are substantially smaller than n and m, respectively, the number of entries required to complete M is significantly reduced by exploiting the side information matrices. Furthermore, since Z has much smaller dimensions than M, its estimation is highly efficient.
Previous research, including works by Goldberg et al. (2010), Adams et al. (2010), and Porteous et al. (2010), has explored matrix completion with side information. The approach presented in this paper appears distinct from these earlier methods and demonstrates an advantage over the work by Goldberg et al. (2010).
The paper's sample complexity analysis is thorough, and the experimental results show promise. However, one potential drawback is that the assumption of available side information may be considered strong, which could make the observed reductions in sample complexity and performance gains less surprising. Nonetheless, the paper provides an example where such an assumption is justified.
Overall, the paper contributes a theoretical result indicating that the use of side information matrices can substantially reduce sample complexity in matrix completion, leading to an efficient method that achieves significant speed-ups by estimating a low-dimensional matrix Z.
