The authors utilize PMCMC sampling in a state-space model (SSM) with a Gaussian process prior to estimate actual parameters, moving beyond traditional filtering and smoothing applications. This represents a straightforward, yet notable, application of PMCMC methodology. However, a significant oversight is the lack of a thorough examination of the challenges inherent in implementing the PMCMC scheme, which would have constituted a substantial contribution. A more in-depth and critical assessment of the approach's strengths and limitations would have greatly enhanced the paper's value, given its focus on applying PMCMC methodology. While it may be unrealistic to expect a revision of the experimental section to provide a more comprehensive evaluation rather than a demonstration, a more detailed analysis of the practical difficulties in implementing such a scheme and its actual performance would have been highly beneficial in assessing the applicability of PMCMC methodology to SSMs.
