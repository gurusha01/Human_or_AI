This paper addresses a fascinating and relatively unexplored problem of detecting changes in the underlying dependency structure between variables in a stream of data. The authors focus on developing an efficient solution, termed LoSST, for simpler Structural Equation Models (SEMs). LoSST leverages a standard batch learning algorithm, PC by Spirtes et al. (2000), for structure learning and tracks various statistics from the data stream to determine when to initiate new structure learning. These statistics include the distance from the weighted mean of each variable, the correlation matrix, and the weighted sample size, with a weighting scheme based on the "surprisingness" of new data points. The algorithm computes the Mahalanobis distance and estimated p-values using Hotelling's T2 distribution, which are then combined using Liptak's weighted pooling of p-values to obtain an overall "significance" statistic. This statistic is used in a noisy OR configuration to decide whether to start new structure learning.
The authors evaluate LoSST on synthetic datasets with introduced changes in parameters or structure and perform a brief analysis on real-life US price index data. The results show that LoSST detects known changes and trends in the US economy while ignoring short-lived changes.
The strengths of the paper include tackling an interesting problem, presenting a novel and practical algorithm, conducting adequate experiments, providing a good review of previous work, and being well-written. However, the paper lacks theoretical guarantees and convergence analysis, relying heavily on heuristics. The use of certain methods, such as Hotelling's T2 distribution and Liptak's weighted p-values, is done outside their original context and guarantees, which should be clearly stated.
Additional comments include the suggestion to use supplementary materials for proofs and other missing details, improving figure quality and descriptions, and clarifying the explanation for LoSST's performance on edge addition. Decoupling parameter updates and structure updates may be a desirable direction for future research. Overall, the paper presents a promising, albeit heuristic, implementation that warrants further exploration and theoretical development.
