The paper 'Adaptive Anonymity via b-Matching' tackles the challenge of anonymizing a private dataset by making individuals indistinguishable through data censorship. The authors delve into the concepts of k-anonymity and the b-matching problem, framing them as a bipartite graph that illustrates the compatibility between the original and released datasets. They propose two algorithms, one for asymmetric and one for symmetric cases, which are rationalized as variational approximations of the optimal suppression problem. An approximation result is provided for these algorithms, along with various privacy guarantees for single and sustained attacks on different b-matching constructions. A concise experimental section offers promising results.
This manuscript is of exceptional quality, thoroughly exploring the b-matching problem and presenting computationally efficient algorithms with robust justification. The writing is exemplary, with an introduction and exposition that are easy to follow. Both the algorithmic results and the privacy guarantees are strong. The work is likely to be seminal, as b-matching significantly extends k-anonymity while offering a viable alternative to other privacy notions. Its generality is a notable strength, accommodating user-defined privacy levels and addressing both symmetric and asymmetric scenarios. However, a limitation is that Theorem 1's approximation factor, based on degree, is somewhat weak, rendering it less useful. Providing a clearer explanation, potentially in an appendix, of how the algorithms serve as a variational upper bound to the ideal program would enhance the argument.
Minor suggestions include:
- Line 191: Simplifying 'a more general' to 'a general'.
- Line 263: Using `` instead of '' for quotation marks.
- Definition 4.1: Clarifying how the matching integrates with the symmetry concept, as the current explanation is confusing.
Overall, this paper provides a comprehensive and innovative approach to k-anonymous privacy through b-matching, offering robust privacy guarantees and novel algorithms. I strongly endorse its acceptance, as it has the potential to become a pivotal study in the field of k-anonymity and b-matching.
