The justification for the inequality |Rk| <= kappa |Xk - X_{k+1}| is explicitly provided in the work "Scalable nonconvex inexact proximal splitting" by Suvrit Sra, presented at NIPS'12 (Lemma 4).

Regarding trace norm regularized risk minimization, the proximal gradient algorithm is a widely adopted approach. While the sublinear global convergence rate of this algorithm is well-established, it is also known that the convergence rate becomes linear when the loss function is strongly convex. This paper builds upon the framework established by Luo and Tseng, relaxing the strong convexity assumption. Specifically, the authors derive a local error bound, enabling them to demonstrate that the proximal gradient algorithm converges asymptotically at a linear rate for trace norm regularization. The paper largely adheres to the conventional pattern for proving local error bounds, with a notable observation that facilitates the simultaneous diagonalization of matrices.
Quality: 
The paper appears to be technically sound. However, a clarification is needed regarding the choice of kappa3 (e.g., alpha < 1) in the appendix, line 085. It is unclear why this choice leads to the claimed inequality R(X^k) <= kappa3 |X^k - X^{k+1}|_F.
Clarity: 
The paper is generally easy to follow, despite its technical nature. To enhance readability, it might be beneficial to present the main claims upfront, followed by a detailed exposition. After introducing the local error bound, the authors could postpone the technical proof and instead focus on demonstrating the linear convergence rate, which does not introduce significant new concepts.
Originality: 
The paper's originality is moderate. The observation enabling simultaneous matrix diagonalization is novel and interesting, whereas the remaining approach to establishing the local error bound largely follows existing methods. The subsequent steps do not offer substantial new insights.
Significance: 
The paper's significance is primarily theoretical, with limited implications for algorithm design. Although extending the linear convergence rate of the proximal gradient algorithm to more practical scenarios (i.e., relaxed strong convexity) is a valuable contribution, the asymptotic nature of the proof and claim somewhat diminishes its significance. The approach to matrix diagonalization may be of independent interest. This work demonstrates that the proximal gradient algorithm, applied to trace norm regularized risk minimization, converges asymptotically at a linear rate under a relaxed form of strong convexity. By largely following the Luo and Tseng framework, with a new observation facilitating matrix diagonalization, the paper reduces the problem to a vector case. Overall, this work is incremental and moderately interesting from a theoretical perspective.
