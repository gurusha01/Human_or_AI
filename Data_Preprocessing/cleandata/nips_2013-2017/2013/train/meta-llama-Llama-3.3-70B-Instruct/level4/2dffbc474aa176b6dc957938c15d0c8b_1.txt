This manuscript proposes a Bayesian framework for estimating states and parameters in nonlinear state-space models, leveraging a Gaussian process prior to learn the transition dynamics. The inference process employs particle Markov chain Monte Carlo, incorporating the recently introduced ancestor sampling technique. Additionally, the paper explores computational optimizations related to sparsity and low-rank Cholesky updates.
The paper is technically rigorous and well-presented, making it accessible to readers. The novel application of online marginalization of transition dynamics, combined with ancestor sampling, is a notable contribution. The consideration of computational efficiency, including sparsity and low-rank updates to Cholesky factors of covariance matrices, further enhances the paper's strength. Although the empirical results are concise, they are sufficient, with some suggestions for further improvement provided below.
Beyond its primary objectives, this work is likely to spark discussions on inference methods for non-Markovian state-space models and the potential benefits and drawbacks of learning transition dynamics using this approach versus specifying a parametric model a priori.
To further enrich the paper, the authors may consider expanding on the comparison between using a parametric transition model with a given prior and utilizing a similar model as the mean function of the Gaussian process, particularly in the context of out-of-sample prediction, such as forecasting.
The presentation of results in Table 1 and the preceding paragraph is somewhat unclear, leaving uncertainty as to whether the root mean squared error is calculated against a withheld dataset or the same data used for conditioning. The most interesting scenario would be an evaluation of the root mean squared error against out-of-sample predictions, especially forecasting forward in time against withheld data, where the differences between the learned dynamics and the ground truth model are expected to be most pronounced. If Table 1 does not already include this information, adding an extra column to illustrate this would be a valuable enhancement.
A minor observation is that the abbreviation CPF-AS is introduced in Algorithm 1 before being formally defined in Section 3.3.1. Overall, this is a strong and innovative paper that is expected to stimulate engaging discussions.
