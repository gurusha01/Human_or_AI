Review- Overview 
======== 
This paper presents a novel lower bound on the expected performance gain for policy gradient methods, which can be utilized to optimize the step-size. The bound is initially introduced in a general form, then specialized for Gaussian policies, and finally adapted for REINFORCE and G(PO)MDP/PGT, with an empirical evaluation on a simple LQG problem.
Quality 
======= 
The theoretical contributions are substantial and well-presented, while the experiment effectively demonstrates the approach. Although evaluating the adaptive step-size in motor control and robotic applications would be highly intriguing, it falls outside the paper's scope.
Clarity 
======= 
The paper is well-structured and readable, effectively conveying the origins and proofs of the theorems and lemmas. The progression from theoretical to applied sections is logical, but the latter part (Sect. 6) feels somewhat condensed.
Originality 
=========== 
To the best of my knowledge, this work is the first to theoretically investigate adaptive step-sizes for policy gradient methods.
Significance 
============ 
Although tighter bounds would be desirable (as noted in Sect. 6), the results are theoretically interesting and show promise in experiments.
Minor Comments: 
=============== 
Table 1 could benefit from an additional line showing the optimal step-size (determined by line search, as discussed in Sect. 1). 
On line 75, the statement "do not need to tune a free parameter" might be misleading, as other parameters (e.g., exploration magnitude) still require tuning.
Consider marking the "winners" in Table 1.
The result of 1 step for alpha* with sigma=5 in Table 1 seems unlikely and may be a coincidence.
In Table 2, clarify how iterations are counted (update steps or update steps multiplied by the number of trajectories).
Using e notation instead of >100,000 in Table 2 would improve readability.
A comparison to heuristics in Table 2 would be interesting.
In the supplementary material (Fig. 1&2), consider using a logarithmic iteration axis and adding axis labels for better visualization.
Public Review: 
============== 
The author response addresses most of the above points. The paper tackles an intriguing, unsolved problem from a theoretical perspective and yields results with significant potential for practical applications.
