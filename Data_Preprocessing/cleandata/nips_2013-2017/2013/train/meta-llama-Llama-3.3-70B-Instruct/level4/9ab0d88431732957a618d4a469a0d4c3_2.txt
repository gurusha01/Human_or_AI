This paper presents a novel formulation of multiple model learning, incorporating a regularization term and assigning weights to individual data points, which enhances robustness to outliers. The authors provide theoretical foundations for this formulation, accompanied by empirical results.
Quality, clarity, and significance:
While the paper yields some intriguing findings, its overall quality and significance are compromised by numerous unclear descriptions in both the text and mathematical notation.
- The terminology in Definition 1 is ambiguous, referring to a tuple comprising two sets and a function as a "problem." It would be more accurate to frame the problem as minimizing the weighted loss.
- On line 109, the bold-style notation "m" is unclear; it appears to represent a vector of m_j from j=1 to k, yet a similar vector is defined as M on line 104.
- In Example 1, explicitly stating the values of X, M, and l for each example would enhance clarity.
- The assertion on line 147 that an outlier tends towards infinity requires further explanation.
- Lemma 2 lacks a clear definition of P_{\Delta^n}.
- In Section 3.1, which presents empirical results, the value of alpha and its selection process are not specified. As the authors acknowledge, appropriately setting alpha is crucial for this formulation. However, determining alpha, particularly in unsupervised learning where cross-validation is inapplicable, poses a challenge. A strategy for setting alpha and analyzing its sensitivity to changes would be beneficial.
- The "Dataset" label on the x-axis of Figure 3.1 is perplexing, and the monotonic increase in RW MAD across different datasets is unexplained.
- Line 320 would benefit from a mathematical definition of the breakdown point.
- On line 336, there seems to be a discrepancy between mj and xj, as defined in Definition 1.
- Line 337 could be improved with an intuitive explanation for the choice of the number "22."
- The notation l(\cdot, m_j) on line 375 is incomplete, as it requires a specific value for x to define this value accurately.
Originality:
The paper offers a generalized approach to multi-model learning with a regularization term, although its originality is somewhat limited. Nonetheless, this contribution is valuable for the development of the field. While the paper contains interesting theoretical results, the description and empirical evaluation could be more comprehensive and sophisticated.
