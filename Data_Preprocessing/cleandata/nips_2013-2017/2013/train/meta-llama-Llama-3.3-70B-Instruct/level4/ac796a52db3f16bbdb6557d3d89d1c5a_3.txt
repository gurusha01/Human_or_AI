The authors propose a multiplexing-based framework for modeling multisensory integration.
This manuscript is exceedingly complex, and while its technical implementation appears to be flawless, its opacity makes it challenging to fully comprehend. Nevertheless, one aspect that emerges with clarity is the apparent disconnect between the presented model and actual biological systems, which contradicts the authors' assertion of drawing inspiration from such systems. The application seems rigorous, but its practical significance and potential influence are dubious.
