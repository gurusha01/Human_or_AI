This paper addresses the resolution of covariance selection problems on a massive scale, involving millions of features and trillions of parameters, utilizing the CLIME estimator. The CLIME estimator is notable for providing an estimate of the precision matrix of a Gaussian vector that can be solved column by column, making it more suitable for distributed computations and theoretically easier to analyze than the Graphical-Lasso. The authors propose a novel algorithm that fits the CLIME by solving the problem in a block-wise manner, coupled with an inexact direction method of multipliers. Theoretical convergence rates are provided in terms of both the objective function and distance to optimality. The algorithm is optimized for special matrix structures, such as sparse and low-rank matrices, to reduce computational burden. It is implemented within a scalable parallel computation framework suitable for both shared and distributed memory systems. Numerical studies compare the algorithm's runtime with its competitors on synthetic and real data, and a detailed analysis evaluates the speedup achieved with varying block sizes and the number of cores on different memory systems.
The paper is well-structured and clearly written, effectively communicating the novelty and contributions of the method, along with its connections to existing work and supported by thorough bibliographical references. The introduction of the algorithm strikes a good balance between technical aspects and theoretical convergence guarantees. The numerical analysis is thorough, and the algorithm's implementation demonstrates impressive performance.
However, a significant concern is the method's availability to the community. Given that the source code, largely based on open-source libraries, is not made available, the impact of this work is limited. This is a sound algorithmic paper that tackles the critical practical issue of covariance selection in very high dimensions. Its potential as a powerful tool warrants publication, provided that it is made accessible to the community.
