This work presents a novel, robust approach and a unified framework for generalizing clustering models to accommodate various learning tasks. By incorporating weights on data samples, it enables robust handling of problems such as clustering, subspace clustering, and multiple regression. 
To improve outlier handling, the method assigns probability distributions to each model, deviating from the typical use of Dirac distributions in classical settings. These distributions are obtained by minimizing a trade-off between two terms: a regularization term that aims to produce spread-out weights within each model by measuring the Euclidean distance between the average weight distribution and the uniform distribution, and a data-fitting term that utilizes a weighted loss function to account for the importance of each sample.
However, the paper suffers from loose notation, formulae, and mathematical details, alongside poor English. Most critically, the clarity of the paper is often compromised, making it feel more like a preliminary investigation than a polished, camera-ready submission. Significant revisions are necessary to enhance clarity.
For example, to illustrate their method more clearly, the authors should provide detailed explanations and potentially experiments demonstrating the proposed method's application in the simplest case of their framework, such as clustering (especially in the presence of outliers). This could involve moving Section 2.1 to the Appendix for better organization.
The experimental section is even more lacking than the theoretical part, with insufficient details provided to understand the figures, and Section 3.1 is particularly uninformative regarding practical performance. It would be beneficial for the authors to compare their method with other approaches for the specific tasks proposed, such as clustering.
Furthermore, a more in-depth discussion on the selection of the trade-off parameter Î±, both theoretically and practically, is required.
Additional specific comments include suggestions for referencing other generalizations of the k-means algorithm, introducing notations before their use, and correcting inconsistencies in notation and indexing. Clarifications are also needed on the optimization process, the choice of closeness index, and the definition of terms like "average penalty" and "MAD" in the legend. 
Overall, while the proposed method and motivation are interesting, the paper requires substantial revision to address issues of clarity, notation, and experimental detail to make it suitable for publication.
