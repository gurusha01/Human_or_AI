This manuscript proposes an active learning framework for tackling structured prediction problems, leveraging an entropy-based metric to determine which nodes in partially or completely unlabeled examples to query for additional information. The approach draws upon and extends the work of Schwing et al., which focused on developing efficient inference techniques for structured learning models dealing with missing labels.
The authors introduce two distinct variants of their method. The first variant identifies the node with the highest entropy in unlabeled or partially labeled examples following training on both labeled and partially labeled data. In contrast, the second variant incorporates unlabeled examples into the training process, thereby eliminating the need for additional inference computations since the entropies for all nodes are calculated during the learning phase.
The experimental design is transparent, and the results demonstrate considerable promise. However, a limitation of the study is the comparison solely to a random node selection baseline, which may not provide a robust benchmark. A more comprehensive evaluation could involve comparing the proposed method to alternative strategies, such as expected error reduction, and examining the performance of active learning under varying proportions of weakly labeled, unlabeled, and fully labeled data. Nevertheless, the authors' consideration of computational requirements and the impact of the epsilon factor is thorough.
A critical aspect that warrants the authors' attention is the potential influence of approximation errors in entropy estimation, which relies on convex belief propagation, on the overall results. 
In summary, while the paper is well-executed, its novelty is somewhat limited. The use of uncertainty-based query selection is a standard approach in active learning, and the inference and learning methodologies explored in this work closely follow those established by Schwing et al. Nonetheless, the encouraging results suggest a fruitful direction for future research in structured prediction, indicating that this line of inquiry holds significant potential.
