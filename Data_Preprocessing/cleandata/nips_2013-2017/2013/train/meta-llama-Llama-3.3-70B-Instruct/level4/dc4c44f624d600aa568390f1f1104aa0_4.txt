This manuscript presents a novel approach to rank aggregation by employing a generalized method of moments to estimate the parameters of a Plackett-Luce model from a sample of rankings. The methodology involves decomposing rankings into pairwise comparisons, which are then utilized to construct a transition matrix. The stationary distribution of this matrix is subsequently used to parameterize the Plackett-Luce model. The authors demonstrate consistency results for various techniques of "breaking" the input rankings into pairwise comparisons and validate the efficiency of their approach through experiments on two datasets.
The paper is well-structured and the proposed method appears to be sound. The "breaking" technique is both innovative and intuitive, contributing to the overall clarity of the manuscript.
However, two primary concerns arise regarding the practical applicability of the method and the comprehensiveness of the experimental evaluation. The authors primarily focus on a regime characterized by a large number of rankings over a small set of items, which may not be representative of many practical applications, such as meta-search, that typically involve a large set of items and relatively few rankings. While consistency is a desirable property, its relevance to rank aggregation in such scenarios is questionable. Furthermore, the authors' discussion of computational complexity is not accompanied by an evaluation of accuracy in this regime, leaving uncertainty about the method's performance.
The experiments conducted on synthetic and real data illustrate qualitative differences between various breaking strategies in terms of speed and accuracy, as measured by RMSE and Kendall correlation. Nevertheless, these metrics may not be suitable for evaluating top-k breakings, as errors low in the ranking can have a negligible practical impact. The inclusion of at least one position-dependent score would provide a more comprehensive assessment.
Minor comments include:
 Line 83: The notation \gamma in the definition of Pr_PL appears to be inconsistent and should be revised to \gamma.
* Line 95: The norm ||a||_W should be squared, and clarification is needed regarding whether W is intended to be a proper norm or merely a convenient notation.
 Line 102: The set-valued nature of GMM_g(D,W) should be acknowledged, and its convergence should be described as converging to the set {\gamma} rather than the point \gamma*.
* Line 124: A typo is present in the title of section 3, where "Plackett" is misspelled.
* Line 245, Eq. 2: The equation should be revised to ensure consistency in the use of Pos(c, d) or Pos(c) in both the numerator and denominator.
* Line 377: A broken reference is present in footnote 4.
Overall, while the paper proposes an interesting approach to rank aggregation, its practical applicability and experimental evaluation require further consideration to strengthen the manuscript.
