This manuscript explores the concept of regret in relation to individual actions within the context of full-information online prediction, specifically focusing on the characterization of achievable "regret profiles" for binary prediction with absolute loss. Rather than pursuing uniform regret bounds across all experts, the authors define a regret profile as <r0, r1> being T-realizable if an algorithm exists that can guarantee regrets r0 and r1 against constant predictions 0 and 1, respectively, under any non-oblivious adversary. A straightforward example of a T-realizable profile is <0, T>.
The paper provides an exact characterization (including constants) of the Pareto front for all T-realizable profiles in the fundamental case of binary actions and absolute loss. This characterization is then utilized to establish an asymptotic bound. Furthermore, the authors propose algorithms that achieve these realizable profiles.
The manuscript is well-structured, with a clearly motivated problem and sound proofs. The investigation into non-uniform regret bounds represents a novel and intriguing research direction, with this paper laying foundational groundwork.
Several observations are noteworthy:
- The adversary model, specified as non-oblivious in Definition 1, could be explicitly stated earlier in the paper, as its distinction from oblivious adversaries is crucial, particularly given that Lemma 3 does not apply to oblivious adversaries.
- The presentation of Theorem 6, specifically its second part, may benefit from clarification. Initially, it appears to describe an algorithm achieving the Pareto front's vertices but later reveals itself to be a specific property of the algorithm at certain time steps. Consider either explicit clarification or omission of this detail.
- A comparison between the new bounds and the traditional uniform regret bound of \sqrt{T/2 \ln K} would be enlightening, especially considering the asymptotic optimality of the latter. Discussion on this aspect is lacking.
- The algorithms presented for proving upper bounds seem computationally inefficient. The development of more efficient algorithms with near-optimal regret bounds would be a valuable contribution. This work establishes optimal bounds for regret profiles against constant actions in online learning, demonstrating technical soundness and pioneering a new avenue in regret analysis.
