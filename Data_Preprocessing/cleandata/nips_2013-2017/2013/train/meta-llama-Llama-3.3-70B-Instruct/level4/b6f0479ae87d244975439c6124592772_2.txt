This manuscript proposes a novel approach to active learning for structured output spaces, leveraging local marginals for query selection rather than performing exhaustive inference over all random variables. The method builds upon existing work in [28] to compute these local marginals.
The paper's direction and focus on active learning for structured spaces in vision are commendable, as this is a significant and understudied problem. The research presented is relevant and makes notable contributions, albeit by extending prior work. 
However, several aspects of the paper require improvement:
1. The experimental evaluation is limited to the indoor geometry task. To enhance the paper's broader impact, it would be beneficial to include experiments on additional tasks such as scene labeling or human pose estimation, both of which involve structured spaces and could substantially increase the paper's influence.
2. The experimental baselines are primarily ablative. A comparison to existing methods, such as [7] and [33], would be valuable. Moreover, it appears that [7] bears similarities to Algorithm 1, and [33] to Algorithm 2. A more explicit discussion on how the proposed approach differs from these prior works is necessary.
3. Section 2.2 is challenging to follow. It is suggested that the related work section be condensed, with a greater focus on clarifying the content in Section 2.2.
4. The paper lacks qualitative results, which are essential for illustrating the active learning process and explaining why certain images are preferred over others. Incorporating qualitative results and intuitive discussions on the approach's efficacy would significantly enhance the manuscript.
5. The paper should cite Siddiquie et al.'s work, "Beyond Active Noun Tagging: Modeling Contextual Interactions for Multi-Class Active Learning" (CVPR 2010), which performs active learning on structured output spaces using contextual interactions for query selection.
Overall, while the approach may not be entirely novel, it represents a step in the right direction. With the suggested improvements, the paper has the potential to make a meaningful contribution and is worthy of acceptance.
