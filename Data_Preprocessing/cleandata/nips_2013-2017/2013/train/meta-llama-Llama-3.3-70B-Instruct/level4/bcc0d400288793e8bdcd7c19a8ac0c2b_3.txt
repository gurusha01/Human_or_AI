Review- Paper 1349 â€“ Context-sensitivity in human active sensing 
This manuscript investigates how individuals direct their visual search in a display to gather information. The authors present a recently proposed model, C-DAC, derive an optimal stopping result, and introduce a computation-bounded approximation to the optimal cost. They then describe an experiment involving three patches of stimuli with dots moving either left or right, where participants must quickly identify the patch with left-moving dots. The models utilizing C-DAC-generated policies yielded behavior more similar to human results compared to those using Infomax-generated policies. The authors conclude with simulations that differentiate between three policy generation methods.
The paper tackles a crucial computational problem relevant to both humans and machines: optimal sensor allocation in the environment to accomplish a task. The approach is intriguing, elegant, and a plausible candidate for the computational problem the visual system aims to solve. However, the simulations distinguishing between methods, although interesting, would have been more impactful with accompanying human results. Furthermore, the method's evaluation is insufficient to warrant a NIPS publication, and since C-DAC is a previously published model, it should not be considered a novel contribution of this paper.
Several issues with the paper leave me uncertain about its suitability for NIPS publication. The paper's framing around C-DAC's context-sensitive policies is unclear, and it would be beneficial to explicitly define the context. The case study does not convincingly demonstrate the importance of context-sensitivity. Except for Infomax's incorrect search times for the target value of 9, the experiment does not strongly suggest that humans are guided by computational principles similar to C-DAC. Additionally, C-DAC's complexity and number of parameters are not adequately justified by the predicted dependent variables. The simulations at the end of the paper are more compelling than the case study and could provide stronger evidence for C-DAC, but they lack human experimental validation. The authors may consider delaying publication until they can include human results for these simulations, which would significantly strengthen the paper.
Minor comments: 
Section 2.1: It is preferable to remove bold formatting from vectors indexed to scalars.
Section 3.1, line 232: The phrase "the probability of a target containing a target" should be revised to "the probability of a patch containing a target."
Section 3.2 title: The use of "vs." in "Model vs. behavior" sounds unusual; consider rephrasing, and "model" should possibly be plural.
Section 3.2, lines 261-263: The sentence "... the general tendency for human subjects typically rely more on recent observations..." should be revised to "... the general tendency for human subjects to rely more on recent observations..."
