Near-Optimal Distribution for Data Matrix Sampling: A Review
This paper introduces a novel method for generating sparse matrices that closely approximate a given matrix in terms of spectral norm. The authors make several well-motivated assumptions, including the properties of the "data matrix" and the constraints of the computational model, such as streaming data. The presentation is clear and readable, although some topics, like compressibility and fast indexing, are mentioned but not fully integrated into the proposed method. The paper provides a thorough discussion of existing L1 and L2 sampling schemes, which serve as a foundation for the development of the new approach, and delves into the matrix Bernstein inequality, explaining its significance in sparse matrix sampling. The authors provide intuitive arguments and explanations, making the paper accessible to non-experts. However, the text becomes verbose and lengthy, particularly in comparison to the concise experimental section, and could be condensed while preserving the essential arguments and explanations.
The paper's primary contributions are Algorithm 1 and Theorem 2.2, which provides its justification. Equation 6 and its preceding components are somewhat challenging to follow, and while some properties, such as certain regimes for s (small, large), are explained in the surrounding text, it would be beneficial to explicitly link these back to the Bernstein inequality that motivates them. Some of this connection is established in Section 5, but the algebraic complexity and notation make it difficult to preserve the crucial relationship between the simplified row-L1 distribution and the Bernstein inequality. Despite these caveats regarding the structure and clarity of the presentation, the result is deemed significant, and the key idea, proof, and algorithmic details are considered highly non-trivial.
The experimental section and empirical analysis are somewhat underwhelming in comparison. The graphs in the printed paper are illegible, and there is no in-depth exploration of any aspect. Furthermore, no connection to relevant applications is made, and the spectral norm criterion is abandoned in favor of a new criterion based on projections to the top singular vectors, without plotting or mentioning the original objective. Given the meticulous attention to detail in the theoretical section, this feels like a surprising omission. It would be more consistent to revisit the objective and address the "scaling" issue, for instance. The paper provides a good overview of the literature and a nice idea in using the Bernstein inequality as a starting point to seek better sampling distributions. However, in light of the experimental section and the lack of deeper analysis beyond the proofs, the superiority of this approach is not entirely convincing.
