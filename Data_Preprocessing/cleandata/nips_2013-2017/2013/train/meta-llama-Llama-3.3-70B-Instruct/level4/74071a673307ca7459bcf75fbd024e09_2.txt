The authors present a precise characterization of the tradeoffs between regret-vs-expert-0 and regret-vs-expert-1 in a two-expert problem with a known horizon T, and propose an algorithm to achieve any tradeoff on the Pareto frontier. Notably, the point corresponding to an equal bound on each expert's regret aligns with the standard definition. Additionally, they examine the asymptotic behavior of this tradeoff curve.
The paper's primary contributions are Theorems 6 and 8, which are significant results, particularly Theorem 6, providing a tight minimax characterization. However, the introduction of the key function f_T(i) seems abrupt and could benefit from further motivation, suggesting underlying connections to Rademacher random variables and binomial probabilities. Theorem 8 may be derived from a normal approximation to the binomial, but these results are limited to the two-expert case. As noted in Section 4.1, the sqrt(min log prior) frontier is weaker for K=2, which is not surprising given that this bound originates from a non-minimax optimal algorithm.
Theorem 10 is also crucial, as it extends the applicability of Theorems 6 and 8 to the general experts problem in two dimensions, beyond the special case of absolute loss. The proof implies that the paper could be reframed in terms of this more general problem, and at the very least, Theorem 10 should be presented earlier. 
Section 5.2 is unclear in its objectives, appearing to suggest that standard sqrt(T log K) bounds can be obtained from the presented K=2 algorithm. The authors should clarify the purpose and significance of this section, as simpler algorithms already achieve this bound. 
A major limitation of the paper is its failure to address the case of K > 2, which is of significant practical interest. 
The authors successfully characterize the Pareto frontier for prediction with expert advice but only for the limited scenario of two experts.
