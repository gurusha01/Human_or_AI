The paper focuses on enhancing posterior sampling efficiency in copula models for discrete data, leveraging the Hoff extended rank likelihood, a topic of considerable interest. The authors' algorithm extends the Hamiltonian MC approach of Pakman and Paninski (2012) for multivariate Gaussian sampling with linear inequality constraints, introducing a novel method to reduce computational complexity to O(n) using the Hough Envelope algorithm. The paper is well-written, presenting interesting ideas, and demonstrates high quality, clarity, and originality.
However, initial concerns regarding the significance of the proposed method were raised, which the authors effectively addressed in their rebuttal. To strengthen the paper, it is crucial that the authors incorporate the improved experiments into their revision.
Initially, the experimental results were underwhelming, failing to convincingly demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over existing methods, such as the Hoff algorithm. The complexity of the proposed algorithm, combined with its substantial computational burden, raised questions about its practicality. The trace plots suggested faster convergence but not necessarily improved mixing, and the choice of sample size and model dimension may have been selected to highlight the limitations of the Hoff approach. More compelling would be a comparison of effective sample size per CPU time, including a discussion on the scenarios where the proposed algorithm's advantages are most pronounced.
The algorithm itself is interesting and tackles an important problem, but the initial experimental results were unconvincing. The additional experiments presented in the rebuttal, however, were more compelling. If these new experiments are incorporated into the paper, it would significantly enhance its acceptability.
