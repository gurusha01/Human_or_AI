This manuscript introduces a novel approach for calculating firing rates in recurrent networks comprising integrate-and-fire neurons, given specific inputs, by enforcing the principle of optimal excitation-inhibition balance. Although the technical aspects of the paper are complex, the writing is clear, the methodology is innovative and intriguing, and the underlying concept appears to be robust. The findings are persuasive, with the exception that the spiking patterns illustrated in Figure 1 seem less stochastic than those typically observed in the cortex. Overall, this methodology has significant potential to enhance our understanding of the operational states and functional roles of cortical networks engaged in sensory processing, by providing a new framework for analyzing the dynamics of neural networks under optimal balance conditions.
