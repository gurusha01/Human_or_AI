The authors address the fundamental problem of determining the minimum number of control questions required to assess worker performance in a crowdsourcing task. They propose two approaches to utilizing control questions: a two-stage estimation method, which yields separate estimates for worker biases and bias-neutralized true labels, and a joint estimation method, which simultaneously estimates biases and true labels. For the two-stage method, the authors demonstrate that achieving minimal mean squared error (MSE) requires O(sqrt(L)) control questions per worker, where L represents the number of labels provided by each worker.
In contrast, the joint estimation method is more complex to analyze, and the authors establish a connection between the MSE and the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of the bipartite graph representing item-worker relationships. This approach yields a bound of O(L/sqrt(n)) on the number of control items, where n denotes the total number of labeled items. Given that each worker is assigned at most n items, this bound simplifies to O(sqrt(L)), which is significantly better than the two-stage method as n approaches infinity. The joint estimation method relies critically on the structure of the item-worker assignment graph, specifically requiring the graph to be an expander. Fortunately, random graphs are expanders with high probability, and a random L-regular assignment scheme is effective.
The paper concludes with experiments that validate the theoretical findings. Notably, the authors investigate the robustness of their methods to model misspecification, revealing that while the joint estimation method is more efficient in terms of control question usage, it is less robust than the two-stage method under such conditions. The paper is well-written, although the proofs are somewhat concise, likely due to page limitations. A minor correction is needed in the conclusion section (line 371), where O(L) should be replaced with O(sqrt(L)). Overall, the paper presents important and interesting results, and I recommend it for acceptance.
