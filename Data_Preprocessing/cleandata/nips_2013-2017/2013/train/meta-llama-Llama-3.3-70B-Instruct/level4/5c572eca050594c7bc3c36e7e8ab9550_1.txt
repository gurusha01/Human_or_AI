This paper presents a novel approach to estimating the density ratio p/q by reformulating it as a Fredholm integral equation, distinguishing it from existing methods. The paper's strengths lie in its clear writing and the importance of the density ratio estimation problem.
Notable aspects of the paper include:
The paper's clarity and the significance of the problem it addresses are major strengths.
However, several areas require improvement or clarification:
(i) The paper lacks detailed explanations for certain statements, such as the derivation of \int k_t(x,y)f(x)dx=f(y)+ O(t), which necessitates either a proof within the paper or its supplementary material, or a relevant reference.
(ii) The method's application to density estimation, particularly when q=1, is noteworthy for not requiring the bandwidth to converge to zero, differing from standard kernel density estimation (kde) methods. Further discussion on the distinct roles of bandwidth parameters in this approach versus kde would be beneficial.
(iii) A brief explanation of Tikhonov regularization would be helpful, as it may be unfamiliar to a significant portion of the NIPS community.
(iv) While all proofs are relegated to the supplementary material, their correctness has not been verified.
(v) A comparison with a naive plug-in approach, where densities p and q are estimated separately, would highlight the advantages of the proposed method.
(vi) The performance of this method relative to others, such as the minimax bounds derived in [12], is unclear. The upper bounds on convergence rates provided in Corollary 2 and 4 lack context regarding their optimality.
(vii) References for the datasets used (CPUsmall, Kin8nm, USPS) should be provided.
(viii) Demonstrating the method's effectiveness on toy problems with known p and q, such as plotting true and estimated p/q for simple 1-dimensional densities, would enhance the paper.
Overall, the paper offers an interesting perspective on density ratio estimation. Nevertheless, its comparative performance with other algorithms (e.g., [12]) and its application to simple, well-understood problems are areas that require further exploration to fully appreciate its potential.
