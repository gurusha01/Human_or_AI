This manuscript explores the automatic adjustment of step size in policy gradient methods, with a specific emphasis on Gaussian policies. It establishes a lower bound on the performance difference resulting from a gradient step and optimizes this bound in relation to the step size.
Overall, the approach of meticulously examining the relationship between step size and policy performance is commendable. Although the paper could benefit from more straightforward and lucid outcomes, it presents a satisfactory, albeit modest, contribution to the NIPS conference.
In terms of quality, the paper boasts an extensive theoretical foundation but occasionally lacks direction. For instance, Theorem 3.3 appears to be tangential to the primary result, and the paper would profit from a clearer narrative thread and reduced digressions.
The experimental findings are somewhat underwhelming, as they fail to conclusively demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach, despite providing a meaningful comparison.
The clarity of the paper is sometimes compromised due to the relegation of certain steps to supplementary materials or their omission altogether. For example, the authors repeatedly invoke stationary points without furnishing formal explanations.
The work is undoubtedly original, and its significance lies in the refinement of policy gradient methods through step size optimization, supplemented by a theoretical understanding of the issue. However, the presented results are only marginally significant.
A potential improvement could involve emphasizing the algorithmic aspects, as presented in Section 5, which currently seem like an afterthought. By prioritizing the algorithm and subsequently deriving the necessary quantities for the bound, the paper could be substantially enhanced. Ultimately, the thorough examination of the interplay between step size and policy performance is a commendable approach, and with clearer, more direct results, this paper could make a more substantial contribution to the NIPS conference.
