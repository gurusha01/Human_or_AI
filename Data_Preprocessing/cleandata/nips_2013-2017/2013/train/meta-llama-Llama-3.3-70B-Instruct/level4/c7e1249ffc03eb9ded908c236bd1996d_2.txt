This paper tackles the challenge of identifying agent types from partial preference data to improve estimates of underlying preferences. The authors propose a Generalized RUM model to capture the behavior of clustered agents, utilizing a reversible jump MCMC technique to estimate latent variables, including agent types. The paper also presents a theoretical analysis of model identifiability and likelihood posterior uni-modality.
Quality 
The paper offers three key contributions: the new GRUM model, theoretical analysis, and inference algorithm. The GRUM model generalizes the RUM model to accommodate multiple agents with types, a novel approach. While the theoretical guarantees are intriguing, they have limitations, as discussed in the significance section. The inference algorithm, however, is fairly standard, and the numerical analysis is underwhelming, both on simulated and real-world datasets. The performance evaluation focuses solely on estimating the number of clusters, whereas the primary concern lies in clustering agents. A more relevant numerical simulation would involve assessing how the number of misclustered agents depends on parameters such as the number of clusters, differences in matrix W between clusters, missing data, and others.
Clarity 
Certain claims require further clarification. 
On page 2, the first paragraph of section 1.1 lacks clarity regarding which aspects of the model eliminate unrealistic substitution patterns and prevent the situation where removing top choices results in the same alternative choice. 
The numerical results on page 2 do not convincingly demonstrate that "the clustering of types provides a better fit to real-world data". 
On page 5, the definition of 'nice' pdfs is unclear, as $\phi^{(n)}(x)$ is used without proper definition, making the conditions difficult to understand. For instance, given that $\phi$ is a pdf, $gn$ should be non-negative, but $gn(x1)/gn(x_2)$ converges to -1. 
The definition of 'nice' cdf's is not intuitive, and no explanation is provided for why the model may not be identifiable if the noise cdf is not 'nice'. 
On page 7, the claim that "It can be seen that GRUM with 3 types has significantly better performance than..." is not supported by the table, which suggests only a marginal gain. The significance of a 2-3% gain in the log posterior is unclear.
Originality 
This paper extends the RUM model to a setting with multiple alternatives and agents, modeling correlations between agents via types. The RJ-MCMC approach appears to be fairly standard.
Significance 
The theoretical guarantees are interesting but have limited applications. Theorem 1 establishes unimodality only when types are known, which restricts the convergence of the MCMC approach and raises questions about the required runtime in practice. The paper does not explain why the proposed problem is challenging or why it has not been addressed previously, as claimed. The lack of comparisons, both theoretical and numerical, makes it difficult to assess the proposed algorithm's performance. Theoretical guarantees are interesting but limited, and a comparison to fundamental limits or other approaches is lacking, both in theory and simulations.
