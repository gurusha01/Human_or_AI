This paper explores various approaches to achieving consensus labeling in a crowdsourcing context, with a focus on estimating real-valued quantities through methods such as averaging user estimates. 
When individuals exhibit fixed biases and some true values are available, bias estimation can be performed using either only the true values or all user-provided labels. 
Theoretical results are presented under this data model for both estimation schemes, aiming to determine the required number of true values. 
The theoretical framework appears sound and aligns reasonably well with empirical findings from simulations, notably demonstrating the asymptotic preference for joint estimation as the number of questions increases. 
Overall, the paper offers a compelling blend of theoretical contribution and empirical assessment on a topical issue, although several questions regarding the model remain, and the authors may wish to address these in the paper. 
Some broader inquiries about the model include: 
1. applicability: are there numerous real-valued estimation problems that could benefit from crowdsourcing, and would the proposed bias or bias-variance model be empirically suitable for applications like forecasting, as mentioned by the authors? 
2. model complexity: considering a simplified scenario where all workers share a common bias, resulting in a consistent offset in crowd averages, the proposed estimation schemes may be inappropriate or overly complex. 
In practice, how would such a model perform, and could alternative models, such as a "variance-only" model, yield better results, as suggested by the football dataset? 
3. model selection: given the challenge of determining model appropriateness, what strategies would the authors recommend for identifying the suitable model, such as larger control experiments or alternative approaches? The paper presents a theoretical and empirical analysis of two consensus labeling models, investigating the number of pre-labeled items required for robust consensus labeling, and represents a valuable contribution to the field, combining theoretical and empirical elements to address a current and relevant problem.
