This manuscript presents an enhancement to symbolic policy iteration for domains characterized by factored actions, introducing a novel approach to reduce the size of the resulting Algebraic Decision Diagrams (ADDs). The central concept involves performing a more generalized backup operation for certain actions, rather than adhering to an on-policy backup, when this modification does not increase the complexity of the resulting expression. The authors provide a convergence proof and comprehensive experimental results, which, although impressive, may not be exhaustive due to the reviewer's limited familiarity with symbolic policy iteration.
The combination of symbolic approaches and factored actions is intriguing and underexplored, making the paper appealing. However, a significant challenge in understanding the manuscript arises from the lack of explanation regarding the representation of π as an ADD, particularly when introducing π as a constraint in Section 3. Additional explanatory material, such as an example illustrating the difference between on-policy and off-policy action backups and its connection to the pruning result, would greatly enhance clarity. The current presentation requires the reader to deduce the operation of the pruning operator from mathematical notation and diagrams before encountering its high-level explanation, which appears to be relatively straightforward. This confusion is exacerbated by Figure 4, where the notation "D and C" presumably refers to "D and π".
Due to this complexity and the reviewer's limited familiarity with symbolic approaches, the manuscript is more difficult to comprehend than it should be. 
Minor writing suggestions include:
- Using "atomic actions" instead of "flat actions" to avoid confusion with hierarchical structures.
- Correcting grammatical errors, such as "assume a small flat action space" to "assumes a small flat..."
- Improving formatting in section titles, e.g., "Factored State and Actions Spaces" to "Factored State and Action Spaces".
- Properly citing references, avoiding parenthetical citations as nouns.
- Enhancing clarity in technical descriptions, such as "assignments OF n boolean variables to A real value".
- Refining sentence structure, for example, removing the comma in "interestingly, the first approach to symbolic planning in MDPs, was a version".
- Increasing the size of graphs or optimizing whitespace to improve readability.
- Ensuring full citation information is provided and references are properly formatted, including capitalization.
Overall, the paper offers a technically interesting improvement to symbolic backups, enhancing their performance, although its complexity often hinders understanding.
