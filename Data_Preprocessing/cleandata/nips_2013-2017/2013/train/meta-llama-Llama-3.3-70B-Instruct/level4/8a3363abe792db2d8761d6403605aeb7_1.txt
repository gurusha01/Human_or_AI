This manuscript presents an algorithm for computing normalized cuts of hypergraphs by framing the cut as the minimization of a ratio of two convex functions, which can be addressed using established methods, such as RatioDCA, where the inner problem is solved via a primal-dual approach. The authors also formulate semi-supervised learning on a hypergraph as a related optimization problem, solving it with a similar primal-dual method. The proposed approach is demonstrated to outperform an alternative method that involves transforming the hypergraph into a regular graph for semi-supervised learning, clustering, and cut objectives across several datasets.
The paper is well-structured, clearly written, and technically robust, offering a substantial contribution to the field of hypergraph cuts, with potential implications for semi-supervised learning and clustering, provided that a hypergraph-based approach is pertinent to the problem at hand.
However, the manuscript could benefit from a more detailed discussion on the relevance of adopting a hypergraph approach. Notably, in all the examples presented, the hypergraph is constructed from the covariates by creating a hyperedge for all samples that share the same value of one covariate, rather than being provided as a separate structure. If the data points are initially represented as vectors of features, other semi-supervised and clustering techniques, such as those based on scalar products or a regular graph built from the features, might be more appropriate and should be considered for comparison.
Furthermore, the manuscript does not delve into the relevance of semi-supervised learning to the datasets. It would be insightful to discuss the performance that could be achieved without utilizing the unlabeled samples. Although the primary focus of the paper is on how the new formulation enhances semi-supervised learning, rather than the relevance of semi-supervised learning itself, this aspect warrants consideration.
Several minor points are also worth noting:
- The total variation appears to be somewhat ancillary in the paper, whose primary achievement lies in providing a better algorithm for hypergraph normalized cuts. Consequently, the current title might be slightly misleading from this perspective.
- The semi-supervised problem (3) can be viewed as a prox of λΩ at point Y. While there may not be a simpler method to compute the prox than the proposed algorithm, it would be beneficial to highlight this to avoid confusion between the prox (3) and the prox of its first term and the conjugate of the second term, which are used in its computation.
Overall, the paper excels in its clear presentation and technical soundness, offering a significant contribution to the field. However, it would benefit from a more nuanced discussion on the relevance of using hypergraphs to represent the data, as opposed to other structures like vectors or graphs.
