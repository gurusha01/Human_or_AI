This manuscript presents a novel approach to modeling inhibitory interactions in spike train data using determinantal point processes, with a maximum likelihood estimation method based on stochastic gradient descent. The concept is intriguing and has the potential to serve as a robust non-factorial spike train model. 
However, the current presentation lacks clarity, making it difficult to discern the extent to which determinantal point processes (DPPs) will enhance model accuracy. Given that gain and periodic terms can be readily incorporated into Generalized Linear Models (GLMs), it is unclear whether framing the problem as a DPP offers significant advantages. Instead of examining structure in the latent space, a more valuable approach might be to compare the utility of the DPP method to other existing methods.
GLMs that account for coupling between neurons, although not instantaneous, capture correlations reasonably well. Furthermore, state-space models and pseudo-likelihood approaches, as seen in recent studies (Macke et al, NIPS 2011; Stevenson et al, 2012; Hanslinger et al, Neural Comp 2013), have also been successful in modeling instantaneous interactions. It would be beneficial to compare the DPP approach to these potentially more tractable models.
Several minor issues require clarification: the specific kernel $k\theta$ used in the study is not specified, and the importance of utilizing a kernel based on marginal preferences, as in Equation 2, is unclear. Additionally, the implementation of gain control, as represented by $\nut$ in Equation 6, appears to be a positive, stimulus-dependent scalar affecting the entire population, which seems to differ from the nonlinear operation on the rate of each neuron in Carandini and Heeger's framing.
The historical context provided in Section 2.1 is also inaccurate, as GLMs were initially proposed to model spike trains earlier (Brillinger, 1988; Chornoboy et al, 1988), and Harris et al (2003) was among the first to apply GLMs to data, rather than Truccolo et al. 
In response to the rebuttal, the additional model comparison results are helpful, and the significant performance of the DPP is surprising. Nevertheless, exploring GLM-like models that can describe instantaneous coupling, as mentioned earlier, may still be worthwhile. The idea of using DPPs to model spike train data is promising, but the presentation could be improved for better clarity and focus.
