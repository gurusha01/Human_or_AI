This manuscript explores the contemporary issue of combining low-quality responses from crowds to achieve more precise outcomes, with a focus on determining the optimal number of control examples required to attain the highest accuracy. 
The key inquiry revolves around the quantity of control examples, with known ground truth labels, necessary for optimal results. 
Utilizing a straightforward Gaussian model that incorporates worker ability parameters, the authors assess the expected errors associated with two estimation strategies - two-stage estimation and joint estimation - thereby deriving the ideal number of control items. 
While the analysis appears sound and the experimental findings substantiate the claims under certain assumptions, a primary concern arises from the assumption of uniform task distribution among workers. 
In real-world crowdsourcing scenarios, this assumption often does not hold, as some workers complete a large number of tasks whereas most workers only undertake a few. 
The robustness of the proposed methodology to such non-uniform task assignments remains untested, as the experimental datasets conform to the uniform assumption. 
An exploration of the method's extension to discrete values would be a valuable addition. 
Furthermore, the authors should acknowledge relevant existing research that integrates control items into statistical quality control, such as the work by Tang and Lease (CIR11) and Kajino and Kashima (HCOMP12). 
Although the problem addressed is intriguing, the assumption of random task assignments may restrict the applicability of the proposed approach.
