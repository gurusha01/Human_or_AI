This paper addresses the support recovery problem in high-dimensional linear regression, where the goal is to identify non-zero entries in the regression parameter vector when the number of predictors exceeds the sample size. The authors propose a simple greedy algorithm, called SWAP, which iteratively swaps variables in the initial support set with those outside of it to improve the square loss, while maintaining the same sparsity level. SWAP can be used to enhance the performance of classical sparse recovery algorithms, such as LASSO, by using the latter as the initial guess.
A detailed theoretical analysis of SWAP is provided, including conditions for accurate support recovery and bounds on the number of iterations required. The analysis shows that the required assumptions are less stringent than the typical irrepresentability condition. The authors also present a numerical study demonstrating the benefits of SWAP on synthetic and genomic datasets.
The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with clear motivations and minimal technical requirements to introduce the SWAP procedure. The theoretical analysis is thorough and provides valuable insights into the method's limitations. However, several concerns and questions arise:
- In remark 3.3, the reference to "Line 3" is unclear, and the computational cost of the rank-k projection matrix is not explicitly stated. Quantitative results would be helpful to understand the additional cost of SWAP compared to a LASSO fit. Furthermore, Proposition 4.1 suggests that the number of iterations may become prohibitively large when the initial guess contains more than half false positives.
- The synthetic experiments fix the support size to the true value, which may introduce bias. In the genomics example, the sparsity level varies, but it is unclear how the optimal value of k is chosen in practice.
- The authors only report the true positive rate (TPR) and number of iterations in the synthetic examples, but not the false positive rate (FPR), making it difficult to assess the method's performance.
- The use of classification/binary response in the genomic data example is surprising, given the square loss used in SWAP. The methods used for initializing the support may not be well-suited for this scenario, and the comparison may be biased.
- Although SWAP is designed to handle correlated predictors, none of the existing methods for coping with high correlation (e.g., elastic-net, Trace-Lasso) are used for comparison, despite being widely available.
Overall, the paper presents a simple and appealing method with sound theoretical justifications. However, concerns regarding the numerical experiments and comparisons to state-of-the-art methods remain, making it unclear whether SWAP enhances existing sparse recovery algorithms in relevant settings.
