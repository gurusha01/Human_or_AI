This paper is exceptionally well-crafted, with impeccable spelling, grammar, and citation formatting, surpassing average standards. However, it would be beneficial to avoid starting sentences with citations, as per the NIPS style guidelines. The theoretical framework is concise and effectively utilizes notations such as f() and g() throughout the manuscript.
The research focuses on stochastic block models (SBM) and enhances the basic single-table instance of an IRM by incorporating the theory of Bayesian Rose trees. This integration enables the replacement of the CRP formulation of IRM with the more straightforward equation (7). The factoring over subtrees aligns with existing work on learning Bayesian network structures, such as Koivisto and Sood's JMLR 2004 section 3, where the posterior factorizes neatly based on the chosen class of constrained structures. This, in turn, facilitates greedy search, marginal likelihoods, handling of sufficient statistics, link prediction, and other processes.
Typically, evaluations of SBM are conducted against "gold standard" data with known partition structures, using metrics like NMI and other clustering measures to compare against known clusterings. The use of AUC in this context was initially unclear, as it deviates from the common practice of NMI evaluations for SBM. It is presumed that the approach involves deleting a few links and then attempting to predict their reinstatement; however, a detailed explanation is necessary to clarify this methodology. Moreover, recent SBM evaluations have utilized larger datasets, exceeding the size of the full NIPS dataset. Therefore, the small-scale evaluation presented in Figure 4 should be supplemented with results from a larger dataset. It is insufficient to solely compare against Bayesian non-parametric methods, as numerous published semi-parametric methods, including some mentioned in the paper, exist.
The primary contribution of this algorithm lies in its agglomerative method, which is succinctly summarized in Table 1. The paper successfully extends the simple single-table instance of an IRM by incorporating the theory of Bayesian Rose trees, presenting clear theory and algorithms, albeit relatively simple concepts and algorithms. However, the experimental work is more illustrative than comparative, falling short of being adequately comprehensive.
