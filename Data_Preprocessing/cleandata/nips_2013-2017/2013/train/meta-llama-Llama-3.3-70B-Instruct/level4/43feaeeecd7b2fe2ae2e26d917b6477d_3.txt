This paper presents a methodology for constructing multivariate distributions over unbounded counts that adhere to the Markov structure of an undirected network, a challenging problem that has been extensively studied by researchers such as Besag over the past three decades, with comprehensive treatments found in texts like Arnold et al.'s "Conditional Specification of Statistical Models" from 1999.
The authors' proposal has several notable strengths, including the ability to define marginal distributions over counts and the derivation of relatively straightforward estimation algorithms. However, there are also significant drawbacks, such as the QPGM's thinner tails and the lack of closed-form conditional distributions for SPGM, which somewhat undermines the purpose of developing a conditionally specified model. Furthermore, the characterization of SPGM as a Poisson distribution is questionable, and it is unclear how this model aligns with the traditional understanding of Poisson distributions. In fact, the Poisson distribution itself may not be the most suitable choice for modeling empirical count data, as it often fails to accurately capture the underlying patterns.
The paper would benefit from a plot of the probability mass function of the SPGM to provide a clearer understanding of its properties. Additionally, the selection of parameters R and R0, presumably considered as constants to ensure the models form exponential families, requires further clarification, along with guidance for practitioners on their choice.
Despite these concerns, the construction of multivariate distributions over counts that obey the independence model of Markov random fields is a complex task. The effort invested in this paper is appreciated, and the results hold theoretical significance for the NIPS community. However, the literature review appears somewhat superficial, with a notable lack of appreciation for existing works, such as the concept of copulas and specific references like [8], which aims to construct multivariate distributions for arbitrary discrete data, including count data, with established MCMC and approximate inference methods. The discussion of [11] also seems misplaced, given the book's focus on building discrete models with log-linear parameters without exponential growth in complexity with the number of variables.
A significant omission is the neglect of the extensive spatial statistics literature, where high-dimensional count data analysis has been a long-standing area of research. While some approaches, including the sparse precision Gaussian copula model of [8], do not explicitly model MRF-style independence constraints in the observable space, the theoretical contribution of this paper remains valid. Nevertheless, as a practitioner, the benefits of adhering to this model space over simpler alternatives, such as structured Gaussian random fields with Poisson measurement models, which have been standard practice for a long time, are not entirely convincing.
Lastly, an update on the current state of gene expression analysis, particularly a reference more recent than [20] regarding the replacement of microarrays with counts of sequencing reads, would be appreciated. Overall, the paper presents a method for constructing multivariate distributions for counts that are Markov with respect to undirected graphs, with both advantages and shortcomings, and a literature review that feels incomplete.
