This manuscript investigates the enhancement of computational efficiency in approximate nearest neighbor retrieval methods, effectively summarized in its abstract. The paper is engaging, well-structured, and presents a notable contribution, particularly through Property 1, which delineates the applicability of the proposed method to specific spaces.
However, upon initial review, it seemed that the contribution may not be closely aligned with the core themes of learning and neural computing, as the role of learning in the proposed methodology appears limited, primarily involving basic sampling and approximation techniques in low-dimensional spaces. This raised concerns regarding the paper's relevance to the NIPS conference, given its focus.
Comment after authors' feedback
Following the authors' response, my initial concerns have been addressed. The necessity and simplicity of learning in this method have been clarified, providing insight into why learning is integral yet must remain straightforward for the underlying problem. The paper remains well-written and interesting, offering a valuable exploration into improving the computational efficiency of approximate nearest neighbor retrieval methods.
