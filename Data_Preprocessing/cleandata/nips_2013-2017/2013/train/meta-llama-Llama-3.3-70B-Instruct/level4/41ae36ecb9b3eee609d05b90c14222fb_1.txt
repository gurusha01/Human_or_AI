Review-  Added after authors' feedback * 
The authors should provide a simulation demonstrating the convergence of the proximal gradient algorithm when the loss function is not strongly convex, but still exhibits linear convergence, across various stability levels. Furthermore, it is essential to discuss scenarios where the theoretical framework fails to hold. Additionally, an exploration of how this analysis can be applied to the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) would be beneficial.

This manuscript establishes the linear convergence of the proximal gradient method for trace-norm regularized learning problems, where the loss function takes the form f(X) = h(A(X)), with A being linear, and h being strongly convex on any compact set and possessing a Lipschitz gradient.
The work builds upon and extends the findings of Tseng [20] and Zhang et al. [22], which demonstrated linear convergence under the "error-bound condition" for lasso and group lasso, now generalized to the trace norm. Although this extension is non-trivial, the contribution appears to be primarily technical in nature.
The presentation of the proofs is generally clear and well-structured.
Strengths:
- The manuscript successfully extends the linear convergence result of the proximal gradient algorithm, initially established by Tseng et al., to the context of trace norm regularization.
Weaknesses:
- The contribution, while technically sound, does not introduce fundamentally new concepts.
- A numerical example illustrating the linear convergence of the algorithm would significantly enhance the manuscript, ideally through a semilog plot of the function value against the iteration number.
More details:
1. The proof outlines for Theorem 3.1 and Lemma 3.2 bear a strong resemblance to those presented in Tseng's work. To clarify their contribution, the authors should provide more precise references to the original work.
2. A numerical example demonstrating linear convergence would be highly beneficial, preferably in the form of a semilog plot.
3. The dependence of constants κ1, ..., κ4 on the choice of α and α is not clearly elucidated.
Minor issue:
4. The sequence of inequalities preceding inequality (13) may cause confusion. The last inequality holds due to the convexity of the trace norm and the fact that -Ḡ ∈ τ∂||X||*, rather than the intermediate inequality, as discussed on page 289 of [20].
This work represents an extension of previous linear convergence results, based on the "error-bound condition," from lasso and group lasso to the trace norm, offering a technical advancement in the field.
