This manuscript explores the application of compressive sensing techniques to 2-photon calcium population imaging, enabling the potential recording of larger neural populations by optimizing voxel measurements. The authors develop a linear model of the measurement process, incorporating a fixed baseline, AR(1) temporal dependence, and binary spikes, and present both a standard reconstruction algorithm and one that estimates neuron locations simultaneously. They analyze these algorithms through simulation and theoretical frameworks, albeit with a focus on the standard approach.
The presentation of the paper jumps between cases of known and unknown neuron locations, which disrupts the flow; focusing on the known locations case and providing additional details could strengthen the manuscript. Furthermore, the imaging matrix B contains weights of +-1, raising questions about the feasibility of "negative" imaging and its implications for the approach's applicability. The method's performance under conditions of sparse but potentially synchronized neural activity also warrants consideration.
While the analysis and methods appear sound, there are uncertainties regarding the approach's efficacy with real data. The theoretical aspects seem somewhat disconnected from the simulation results, and the paper's density and lack of detail hinder comprehension of the theory. Concentrating on key points and elaborating on them could enhance clarity. Although compressive sensing has been applied in other imaging domains, its application to 2-photon calcium imaging is novel. As a conceptual and speculative paper, its potential impact is substantial if successfully implemented, making it a compelling contribution to the field. Overall, the proposed algorithmic framework for calcium imaging using randomized measurements demonstrates promise for scaling neural population measurements, despite open questions regarding its applicability to real data, rendering it an interesting and potentially powerful idea worthy of presentation.
