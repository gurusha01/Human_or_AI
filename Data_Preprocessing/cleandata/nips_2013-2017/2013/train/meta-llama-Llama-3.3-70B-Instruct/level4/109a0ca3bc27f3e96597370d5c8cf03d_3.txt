This manuscript presents theoretical performance bounds for a convex tensor decomposition algorithm utilizing latent Schatten norm regularization, offering an improvement over existing results that employ overlapped Schatten norm regularization.
Quality: Theoretical contributions of this paper lie in its derivation of results for tensor decomposition under latent Schatten norm regularization. Notably, the dual characterization of both overlapped and latent Schatten norms is a highlight. However, the experimental section is concise and lacks detailed elaboration. Key questions remain unanswered, such as the methodology behind selecting Tucker ranks (r1, ..., rk) for the examples provided, the efficacy of group regularization techniques like l_1,âˆž when the tensor exhibits low rank across all modes, and a comparative analysis of the method's performance against non-convex approaches.
Clarity: The manuscript is well-structured and clear, facilitating easy comprehension of the presented concepts.
Originality: A significant original contribution is the establishment of duality between overlapped and latent Schatten norms, a result that holds independent interest and value.
Significance: Given the importance of tensor decomposition in a wide range of applications and the manuscript's improvement upon existing results, this work is deemed significant. The paper's theoretical findings are intriguing, and its clarity is commendable. Nevertheless, the brevity of the experimental section, particularly towards the conclusion, is noteworthy. Overall, the manuscript enhances our understanding of tensor decomposition, albeit with room for more comprehensive experimental analysis.
