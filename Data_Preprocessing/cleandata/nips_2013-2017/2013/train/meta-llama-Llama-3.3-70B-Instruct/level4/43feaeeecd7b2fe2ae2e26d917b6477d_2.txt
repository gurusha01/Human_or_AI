The construction of multivariate distributions suitable for count data is a crucial objective, and the authors accurately identify the limitations of existing approaches, although some reservations are noted. 
From a theoretical and conceptual standpoint, the paper presents several strengths. It begins by disproving the validity of previously proposed truncation methods, and subsequently, the authors propose alternative approaches. The TPGM truncation, although straightforward, is justified due to its intuitive interpretation. The QPGM and SPGM, while technically simple, offer novel insights by modifying the base measure and sufficient statistics of the exponential representation of the Poisson distribution. These modifications are well-motivated and appealing. However, the underlying theory closely follows the work of Yang et al., resulting in multiple model suggestions that require practical evaluation to assess their merit.
Given the above context, the experimental evaluation is underwhelming, particularly considering the paper's stated goal of addressing the practical limitations of Poisson graphical models. Although the synthetic experiment demonstrates some potential, the data appears to be tailored to the proposed models. Moreover, the real-world experiments lack a comparison with copula-based alternatives, and the reported results are largely anecdotal. A more objective evaluation, such as log-probability of test data, is necessary since all methods involve constructing joint distributions.
A more significant concern, which pertains to the need for the new model, is the overly simplistic treatment of copula competitors. Specifically, even when using a Gaussian copula, it would be more sensible to employ a reasonable marginal model rather than the one used in the non-paranormal, which lacks a density and was chosen for its asymptotic properties rather than practical merits. The similar performance to Glasso is suspicious, and it is likely that even basic Gaussian kernel density estimates would yield better results. Similarly, applying this to real-world data, the choice of R=11 could be translated into a choice for the marginal of the copula. While an in-depth exploration is not expected, a reasonable baseline is warranted.
The paper is generally well-written, and although the results are believed to be true, it is suggested that all proofs be included in the supplementary material. The end of section 3.1 is overly detailed, and the bound does not contribute significantly to the Gaussian-esque argument. In contrast, section 3.2 should be explored more thoroughly, as it is the core of the proposed method, and the figure should be presented and explained more intuitively rather than being relegated to the supplementary material.
Based on a conditional exponential construction, the authors propose alternatives to the Poisson graphical model, aiming to enable flexible joint modeling with a mix of positive and negative dependencies. The approach has some theoretical novelty and is appealing. However, the experimental evaluation is limited and somewhat biased, resulting in another multivariate Poisson-like model whose merit remains unclear.
