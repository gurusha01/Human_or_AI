This manuscript examines the category of zero-sum perfect-information simultaneous move games, which encompasses notable examples such as goofspiel and Tron. The authors conduct an analysis of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) combined with regret-matching for this specific class of games, demonstrating convergence to an approximate Nash equilibrium.
The paper is well-organized and clearly written, with results that are effectively presented. The primary contribution lies in the novel formal analysis, which builds upon previous work, such as Lanctot et al (2013) [20], that provided a more preliminary examination of the setup. The proof employed in the paper is inductive, relying on optimal strategies at the leaf nodes of the game tree.
A significant limitation of this approach is that it often yields unremarkable conclusions regarding the inner nodes of the game tree, thereby overlooking crucial concepts in game theory, including subgame perfect Nash equilibria. To enhance the paper, it would be beneficial to integrate the analysis with these concepts. A relevant reference that could inform this aspect is "Existence of subgame perfect equilibria in games with simultaneous moves" by C. Harris (1990). This study presents innovative analyses of the regret-matching strategy with MCTS in zero-sum perfect information simultaneous move games. Although the work is intriguing from a computational perspective, it would benefit from connecting its findings to the established framework of subgame perfect Nash equilibria, a topic extensively explored in game theory.
