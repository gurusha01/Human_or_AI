The authors derive two estimators for the Radon-Nikodym derivative, denoted as f = p/q, utilizing two equalities: (i) Ep(k(x,.)f) = Eq(k(x,.)) and (ii) Ep(k(x,.)f) â‰ˆ q(x). By replacing integral operators with empirical versions, the difference between the left and right sides is minimized over a set of test functions {k(x,.)}, which can be optimized using standard kernel methods.
Convergence guarantees are provided for both settings under assumptions of smoothness and boundedness on the densities, with the rate of convergence dependent on the dimension of the underlying space, as expected for density estimation. The work is well-executed and provides a nice contribution to the field.
Some comments and suggestions for improvement include:
- Providing an intuitive argument for why optimizing over {k(x,.)} guarantees convergence to the ratio in both settings, particularly in (i), would be beneficial.
- Motivating the choice of cost function, specifically the combination of L2,p and L2,q, and linking it to important applications would enhance the paper.
- Clarifying the motivation behind estimating q/p when both Ep and Eq are estimated to form the empirical cost function, and discussing the relevance of this setup to applications such as importance sampling, would be helpful.
- Exploring the relationship between smoothness assumptions on q and p and the smoothness of their ratio, as well as discussing the dependence of the convergence rates on the dimension, would provide valuable insights.
- Justifying the choice of the family of test functions U and discussing the generality of the approach, particularly in comparison to other methods such as [1], would strengthen the paper.
- Addressing the principled question of whether the proposed approach with {k(x,.)} is the most suitable for estimating the Radon-Nikodym derivative in the context of covariate shift would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the method's strengths and limitations.
Overall, the paper is timely, strong, and addresses a relevant problem, providing a convergence study and experimental results that contribute to the field.
