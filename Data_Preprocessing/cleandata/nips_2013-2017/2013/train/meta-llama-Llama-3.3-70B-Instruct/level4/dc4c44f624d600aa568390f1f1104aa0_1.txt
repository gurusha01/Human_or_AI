This manuscript explores a methodology for effectively integrating multiple rankings into a Plackett-Luce model, leveraging a concept known as breakings, which represent subsets of the overall ranking data. The authors demonstrate the significance of consistency, a property fulfilled by top-k rankings, such as (1,2 > 3,4,5), but not by adjacency rankings (1 > 2, 2 > 3, 3 > 4, 4 > 5).
The paper is acceptable, with the method's presentation occasionally coming across as overly formal, although the included examples help clarify the concept. However, the terminology "Generalized Method of Moments" is unclear, as it does not explicitly explain what the method of moments entails or how it has been generalized in this context. Initially, the abbreviation "MM" in the experimental comparison was mistaken for the standard method of moments, but it actually refers to "Minorize Maximization."
The authors seem to presume the reader's familiarity with the method of moments, which may hinder appreciation of the contribution for those unfamiliar with it. The claim that the method of moments is a standard approach for rank aggregation could be strengthened by considering alternative methods for comparison.
Furthermore, the asymmetry in structure between top-k and bottom-k breakings is not adequately justified, and the practical application of bottom-k breaking is unclear. 
In general, while the paper appears reasonable, its potential impact seems limited. The experimental results, showing improvement over the MM method on synthetic and Sushi datasets, are not sufficiently compelling to support the manuscript's claims.
