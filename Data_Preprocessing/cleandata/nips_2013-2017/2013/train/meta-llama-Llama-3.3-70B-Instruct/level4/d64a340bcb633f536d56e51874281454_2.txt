This paper addresses a crucial challenge in linear regression modeling, specifically the issue of correlations among covariates when estimating high-dimensional, sparse coefficient vectors, known as 'sparse recovery'. The goal is to identify a sparse set of non-zero coefficients, referred to as the support of the coefficient vector, which represents the covariates that the response variable depends on. However, correlations among covariates pose a significant obstacle to accurately identifying this support.
The authors propose a wrapper algorithm, called SWAP, which iteratively swaps covariates to optimize a desired objective function in a greedy manner, aiming to improve the selected set of covariates. The main contribution of this paper is that SWAP can recover the true support with high probability under certain conditions. Additionally, the authors demonstrate the superior performance of SWAP over state-of-the-art sparse recovery algorithms on both synthetic and real data.
However, there are two primary concerns that detract from the overall impact of this work. Firstly, the innovation in the actual procedure is limited, as the algorithm's performance heavily relies on the quality of the initial support, which is often obtained using well-established sparse recovery algorithms. In practice, the size of the true support is unknown, and there is no guarantee that these algorithms will recover a support of the correct size, leading to increased computational time and potential errors. The algorithm's efficiency is thus contingent upon the sophistication of the underlying sparse recovery algorithms.
Secondly, the presentation of the results is marred by inconsistencies and lack of clarity. For instance, Figure 1's description is confusing, with essential details introduced late in the discussion or not at all, such as the "sparsity level" expressed as numbers from 1 to 10. Furthermore, Figure 2's captions are incorrect, making it challenging to understand the results and relate them to the conclusions drawn in the text.
To strengthen the paper, it would be beneficial to report the "Sparse Recovery" probabilities for the parameters describing the applications mentioned in the results, including the gene expression application. A comparison to other wrapper methods is also noticeably absent.
Additionally, there are several minor comments: the claim of O(k) runtime complexity is not sufficiently supported, and the use of "roughly" in conjunction with O notation is unnecessary. Remark 3.2 appears to contradict the theoretical considerations in Proposition 4.1. There are also several typographical errors and suggestions for improvement in the writing, particularly in Section 5.1.
While this work tackles an essential problem in high-dimensional statistics and proposes a simple yet effective wrapper algorithm, its lack of novelty and significant contribution make it less suitable for a conference like NIPS. The paper is generally well-organized, but the English in Section 5.1 requires improvement, and the description of example A1 should be rewritten for clarity.
