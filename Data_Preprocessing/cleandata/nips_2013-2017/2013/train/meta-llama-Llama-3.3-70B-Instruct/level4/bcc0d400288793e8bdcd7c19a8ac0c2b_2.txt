This paper delves into the theoretical aspects of active sensing, where individuals actively gather information to achieve a specific goal. The authors propose an extension to the existing C-DAC model, which gathers information myopically to maximize a task-specific cost function. This model is compared to an alternative, Infomax, which prioritizes information without considering cost. The overall objective of the paper is intriguing and significant. However, the novelty of the paper is somewhat diminished as it builds upon the work of Ahmad & Yu (2013), extending it to handle action selection myopically. The importance of this aspect of the modeling is unclear, as it does not seem to play a central role in explaining the experiment.
There is prior research on this topic, notably Markant & Gureckis (2012), which investigated whether people optimize information or a task-specific cost function and found that information optimization better fit human behavior. The authors should consider this work in their research.
The paper's writing is subpar overall. The abstract is excessively long, and the paper exceeds the 8-page limit. The frequent citation of Ahmad & Yu (2013) is unnecessary, and the experiment design is difficult to comprehend. Key terms, such as "patch," are introduced without definition, making it challenging to understand the context. The paper focuses on the "confirmatory search" phenomenon, which seems to be identified ad-hoc in the data. The rationale behind selecting this phenomenon and its significance in differentiating the models is unclear.
The model results in Section 3 are not compelling, as both the full C-DAC and myopic models exhibit similar qualitative patterns. The authors fail to discuss the implications of this finding, leaving questions about the effectiveness of the chosen measures in distinguishing between the models. The lack of fit statistics or quantification of the advantage of the more limited model is notable, with the authors only describing it as "more psychologically plausible." Section 4 is also opaque, with unclear policy-space graphs in Figure 3 and an unexplained reference to "Greedy MAP."
The analysis in Figure 4 is unusual, as it does not mention human performance, raising questions about the model's purpose. While the myopic C-DAC model performs well on various metrics, it is essential to compare it to human observer performance to validate its effectiveness as a model of human behavior.
Initially, my evaluation was more negative, but after discussing with other reviewers, I have assigned a score of 7. Despite some critical comments, the paper has strengths, including its emphasis on multiple model comparison, empirical data, and the novelty of deriving theorems about the optimal stopping rule. The author's response was helpful, and editing the paper to address reviewer questions would improve its clarity if accepted. The paper proposes a myopic modification to a recent model of cost-sensitive active sensing, which is fit to data from a visual search task. Although the myopic model appears to fit the data fairly well, the full model performs similarly. Other aspects of the paper, including the graphs of policy-space functions, are difficult to understand. Overall, the paper presents interesting ideas but requires further development. The contribution beyond the original C-DAC model is unclear, except for being more psychologically plausible due to its myopic nature.
