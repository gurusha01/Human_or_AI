This paper presents a two-stage approach to distributed submodular maximization, referred to as GreeDi, and derives error bounds for the GreeDi algorithm, providing a theoretical guarantee on the greedy approximate solution relative to the centralized solution. The authors evaluate the effectiveness of their approach using six datasets.
My comments on the paper are as follows:
1. The notation in Theorem 4.2, specifically the use of both kappa and k, may be confusing due to their visual similarity, which can hinder readability.
2. A discussion on the tightness of the bound in Theorem 4.2 would be beneficial, particularly considering the presence of the min(m,k) factor within it.
3. In the experimental section, reporting generalized performance metrics such as negative log predictive probability would provide valuable insights. While the decrease in the objective functional is anticipated, understanding its impact on generalization is of significant interest.
4. It is not clear which experiments in Section 5 involve handling decomposable functions, and clarification on this point would be helpful.
5. The label on the x-axis of Figure 1(e) should be corrected to 'k' for consistency.
6. The ratio starting below 1 at the smallest m in Figure 1(f), unlike the starting point of 1 in Figures 1(a)-1(d), warrants an explanation for the discrepancy.
7. The dip observed when k=10 in Figure 1(c) requires an explanation to fully understand the behavior of the algorithm under these conditions.
8. Including references to the Today Module of Yahoo! would facilitate related research by providing readers with additional resources.
Overall, the study contributes interesting insights to the field of distributed data mining.
