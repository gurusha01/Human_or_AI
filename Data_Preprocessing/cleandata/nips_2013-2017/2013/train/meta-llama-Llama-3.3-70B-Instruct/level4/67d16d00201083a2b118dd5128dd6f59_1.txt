This paper presents a novel Bayesian inference approach for conditional bivariate copula models with multiple parameters, leveraging a combination of parameter mapping functions and latent functions with Gaussian process priors. The inference procedure utilizes expectation propagation and is validated through experiments on both synthetic and financial time series data, with comparisons to alternative copula-based models. A comprehensive overview of related methods is also provided.
The methodology proposed is robust and well-founded, with the authors offering a thorough discussion of related techniques, alongside the strengths and limitations of their own approach.
The manuscript is characterized by its clarity and concision, projecting a high level of maturity. The text is devoid of inconsistencies and typographical errors, with figures, tables, and equations that are not only well-explained but also complement the narrative seamlessly, contributing to an overall flawless presentation.
The originality of this work lies in its extension of a preceding conditional copula model, which was previously confined to copulas with a single parameter. This current research broadens the scope by accommodating copulas with multiple parameters, a novelty to the best of my knowledge.
The significance of this contribution is underscored by the limited flexibility of copula families restricted to a single parameter, making the applicability of more versatile families a substantial advantage. The notable performance improvements over alternative methods are particularly promising, indicating a valuable and well-executed contribution to the field through the extension of an inference procedure for conditional copula models.
