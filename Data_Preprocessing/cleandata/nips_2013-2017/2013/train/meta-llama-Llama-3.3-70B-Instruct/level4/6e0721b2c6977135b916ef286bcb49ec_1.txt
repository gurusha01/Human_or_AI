This paper presents a innovative approach to sampling from a sparse data matrix, utilizing the spectral norm as a quality metric. The methodology is tailored for the "streaming" scenario, where a fixed matrix is sampled from disk without requiring the entire matrix to be loaded into memory simultaneously.
The paper is well-structured and effectively communicates its assumptions and implications. For example, the definition of the data matrix in Section 2.1 initially appears arbitrary, but the authors provide a compelling argument for its validity in typical use cases. The background sections successfully contextualize this work within the broader landscape of existing techniques, and the experiments are clearly described and well-executed. The resulting procedure is distinct, relying on a uniquely weighted, data-dependent sampling approach, and the authors demonstrate its ability to match or surpass other matrix sampling methods.
However, the proof outline in Section 5 is challenging to follow, as it is unclear which proof it is intended to outline (presumably for Theorem 4.1) and how Lemmas 5.1, 5.2, and 5.3 are related and contribute to the conclusion of the proof.
Several minor issues were also noted:
- Equation 7 could be clarified by splitting it into two separate equations: Pij = θ |Aij| and θ = ...
- On page 4, line 210, the term "matrices B_i" may be a typo, and "B^(l)" might be the intended notation.
- The origin of the quadratic equation on page 6, line 315, is unclear.
- The calculation on page 7, line 349, yields 62 sqrt(2) / 29 ≈ 3.02, which exceeds 3.
- The blue "Bernstein" line is nearly invisible in several plots; adding arrows to indicate its location would enhance readability.
Overall, despite a few minor complaints, the paper is well-written and effectively conveys its contributions.
