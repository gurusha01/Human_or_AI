The paper proposes an interactive reinforcement learning approach where human feedback is directly utilized as policy labels, presenting a straightforward and easily comprehensible methodology. The underlying concept is sound and well-grounded in existing literature, to my understanding. 
A significant strength of the paper lies in the simplicity and efficiency of the proposed method, termed Advise. It requires fewer meta-parameters compared to state-of-the-art methods, with a single meta-parameter C, which represents the estimated consistency of human feedback and exhibits low sensitivity. When combined with the results showing Advise's performance as superior or equivalent to current state-of-the-art approaches, this method appears highly promising.
However, the paper also exhibits some weaknesses, particularly in the context of a NIPS submission. The benchmark examples used seem overly simplistic, and the theoretical differentiation from state-of-the-art methods is not substantial.
Despite these limitations, the intriguing idea and compelling methodology lead me to lean slightly towards recommending acceptance of the paper. 
Additionally, several minor points warrant attention: 
On Page 1, around lines 32 or 33, the text "In this paper WE introduce..." could be revised for better readability.
Page 2, approximately lines 75 or 76, contains the phrase "This is THE most common...," which might benefit from rephrasing.
Table 1 on Page 5 appears too small and could be enlarged for better clarity.
Figures 2-5, spanning Pages 6-8, are too small, particularly in printed form, making the ticks unreadable and the plots overly congested.
On Page 7, around lines 373 or 374, the phrase "interpret feedback is as a direction" would benefit from rephrasing.
Overall, the paper presents an interesting method for interactive reinforcement learning, characterized by its simplicity and fewer meta-parameters, achieving performance equal to or better than state-of-the-art methods. Nonetheless, it lacks significant theoretical innovation and only demonstrates performance on two relatively simple benchmarks.
