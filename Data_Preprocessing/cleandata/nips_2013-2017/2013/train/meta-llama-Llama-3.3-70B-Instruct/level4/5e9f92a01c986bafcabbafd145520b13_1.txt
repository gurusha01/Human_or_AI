This manuscript presents a novel approach to compressive sensing calcium imaging, leveraging the sparse nature of neuronal activity to substantially reduce the required number of measurements. By utilizing recently developed mathematical tools, the method effectively decodes these measurements, and employs state-of-the-art mathematical techniques to investigate the minimum number of measurements necessary for complete signal recovery.
A key strength of the paper lies in its innovative application of contemporary mathematical methodologies to tackle a pressing challenge in neuroscience. However, a notable limitation is the absence of any analysis of real-world data, which may be attributed to the current unavailability of suitable datasets. Nevertheless, it appears somewhat optimistic to assume that an experimentalist could readily implement a compressive sensing imaging protocol based solely on this paper. In my opinion, the core concept could be conveyed in a more straightforward manner than the current presentation, potentially enhancing its accessibility and impact in the field of modern compressive sensing calcium imaging.
