Summary: 
The authors utilize Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs) to model the spiking activity of simultaneously recorded neurons, capturing both stimulus dependence and pairwise competitive interactions between neurons. They apply this model to artificial data and hippocampal recordings, demonstrating its potential in neuroscience research.
Comments: 
1) The application of DPPs to neural recordings is a novel approach, addressing the open problem of incorporating instantaneous interactions into Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) for neurons while maintaining tractability. This makes the paper timely and relevant to the NIPS neuroscience audience.
2) The paper is well-written, introducing DPPs in an accessible manner, making it a readable contribution to the field, with some exceptions that require clarification.
3) A major concern is that the authors have not fully established the appropriateness of their model for multi-cell recordings. Given that most experimentally measured noise correlations in the cortex are positive, the DPP approach, which captures competitive interactions, may not be suitable. The authors should provide thorough arguments and citations to support the importance of exclusively competitive interactions in multi-cell recordings.
4) In Section 4.3, the application of the DPP-based model to hippocampal data lacks convincing evidence. Specifically, the authors should analyze the noise correlations between pairs of excitatory, inhibitory, and excitatory-inhibitory neurons to determine if they are mostly negative, which would justify the use of the DPP model. A more detailed description of the results in FIG4 and FIG3(a) is necessary, including the interpretation of the latent embedding and the kernel matrix. The discovery of theta oscillations, while interesting, is not surprising given the GLM component of the model and could be discussed more briefly. Enhancing Table 1 with comparisons between GLM components with and without the latent DPP part would strengthen the argument for the model's efficacy.
5) Section 3.3 introduces a potential redundancy with the inclusion of $w\nu$ for stimulus dependence, given that each neuron's stimulus dependence is already captured by $wn$. This redundancy should be addressed.
6) A more in-depth comparison between coupled GLMs and the DPP approach is missing. For instance, while coupled GLMs lack instantaneous coupling, this could be mitigated by analyzing the data on finer time scales, among other strategies.
Minor Comments: 
1) The notation around equations 4 and 5 appears to be inconsistent or unclear. Specifically, $\Pi^{(t)}$ should be defined as $diag(\sqrt{\lambda1^{(t)}},\ldots)$, and $K^{(t)}{St}$ in equation 5 likely only includes the $k\theta$ term, not the GLM part $\lambdan^{(t)}$. This suggests that $K^{(t)}{St}$ should be $K{St}$, with time dependence only through ${St}$. Furthermore, the normalizer in equation 5 should be independent of $St$, potentially containing $K{\mathcal S}$ instead of $K{St}$.
2) In the definition of $K_S$ in line 131, it would be beneficial to reiterate that $n,n' \in S$ for clarity. Overall, the paper is interesting and timely but would benefit from extended biological motivation for the proposed model and more detailed experimental analyses.
