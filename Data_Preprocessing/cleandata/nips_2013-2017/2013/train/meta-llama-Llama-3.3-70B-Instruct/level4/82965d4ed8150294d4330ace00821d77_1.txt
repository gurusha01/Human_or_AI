This manuscript presents an approach to accelerate template evaluations in object detection by leveraging vector quantization, wherein each HOG cell is represented by an index into a dictionary, reducing template evaluation to a series of table lookups and simple additions. When combined with prior work on detection speedup [5], this paper achieves a two-order-of-magnitude acceleration.
Quality: The paper is well-crafted and extensively evaluated, with Section 4's computational cost model being particularly noteworthy for clarifying the relationship to previous speedup research. The timing comparisons are persuasive.
Clarity: The manuscript is clearly written and well-organized.
A potential enhancement (not crucial for this review): Supplementing Section 4 with a graph illustrating the variation in end-to-end evaluation time for a single image as the number of categories increases could provide an alternative visualization to Table 1.
Originality: This is the sole drawback of the paper. Many of the concepts employed have been previously explored, such as the quantization of HOG cells, which was introduced in [10] (Section 5.2). Although [10] achieved a speedup factor of 2 using quantization alone, this paper demonstrates a significantly larger speedup of approximately 100 by combining multiple techniques. While the paper's novelty is limited, its innovative combination of existing techniques yields substantial gains.
Significance: This paper holds considerable importance for the computer vision community due to its substantial speedup, which can have a profound impact on subsequent applications. The authors' commitment to releasing the code will likely lead to its rapid adoption throughout the vision community. Although the paper does not introduce novel machine learning techniques, it convincingly demonstrates significant speedups in a crucial computer vision task.
