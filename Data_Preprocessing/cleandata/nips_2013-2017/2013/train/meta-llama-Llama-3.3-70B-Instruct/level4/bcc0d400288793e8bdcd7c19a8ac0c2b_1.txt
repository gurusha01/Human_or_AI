This paper presents a myopic variant of the C-DAC algorithm, a visual search method that incorporates both costs and benefits. It is expected that certain cost-benefit algorithms will outperform naive versions that do not account for these factors, making the specifics of the approach crucial. 
Figure 2 demonstrates that C-DAC exhibits strong performance across multiple dimensions of fit. 
However, several questions arise: 
Is C-DAC psychologically plausible, and if not, what are the reasons for this limitation? 
Furthermore, Figure 2 highlights the diagnostic importance of sets 9 and 1&3, but the rationale behind their significance is not entirely clear. 
The study provides evidence supporting a search algorithm that makes myopic adjustments for the costs associated with future visual saccades.
