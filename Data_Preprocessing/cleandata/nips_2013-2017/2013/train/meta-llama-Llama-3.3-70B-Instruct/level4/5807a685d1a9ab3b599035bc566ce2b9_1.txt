SUMMARY: This manuscript, adapted from an ArXiV publication and formatted for NIPS, employs a Fano/LeCam-style argument to establish a lower bound for estimation algorithms operating on private data in scenarios where the algorithm is not trusted by the data holder, with randomized response emerging as an optimal strategy under certain conditions.
As a preliminary note, this review is based solely on the main manuscript, without consideration of the supplementary materials.
PROS AND CONS:
- The manuscript provides valuable insights into the limitations of learning from privacy-perturbed data, offering a characterization of these limitations.
- However, the commentary on the results contains imprecisions that could confuse casual readers, as elaborated below.
- Furthermore, the discussion appears to lack connections to existing differential privacy results, which could enhance the context and relevance of the work.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS:
- The focus on local privacy, crucial for the derived results, distinguishes the privacy model significantly from the differential privacy model, a distinction that may not be immediately apparent to all readers. Statements such as those found at the bottom of page 4, which mention providing differential privacy at a level $\alpha$, might be perceived as overly broad or potentially incorrect, given the specific context of local privacy. It would be beneficial for the authors to clarify or avoid such statements to prevent confusion.
- The necessity of the restriction on $\alpha$ in Theorem 1 is questionable, particularly in light of experimental results suggesting that $\alpha \approx 1$ may be a practical limit for certain learning problems under differential privacy. This raises questions about the applicability of the bound to such cases.
- Including a discussion on the possible choices of $\rho$ could provide readers with a clearer understanding of how different utility measures are captured by the analysis, enhancing the manuscript's clarity and usefulness.
- A comparison with the M-estimation procedure of Lei would be insightful, given the relevance of this work to the topic at hand, despite its absence from the references.
- Considering the multitude of approaches to histogram estimation for discrete data, an evaluation of how other algorithms compare to the proposed density estimator in terms of convergence rates would offer a more comprehensive view of the manuscript's contributions.
ADDENDUM AFTER REBUTTAL:
* Clarifying the distinction between population and sample statistics at the outset of the paper is essential for reader understanding, as highlighted in the response to Rev.9.
* Incorporating a comparison with related works, including those by Lei and mentioned by other reviewers, is vital for situating the manuscript within the broader context of privacy and estimation research.
* Upon closer examination of [10], which has since been published, the additional contribution of this paper appears more nuanced: it offers a meticulous exposition of the local privacy model and novel bounds for density estimation. While the bounds are new, the exposition of the local privacy model is largely contained within [10], suggesting that the contribution, although valuable, is somewhat narrower than initially presented, with the difference in venues and audiences being a significant factor.
