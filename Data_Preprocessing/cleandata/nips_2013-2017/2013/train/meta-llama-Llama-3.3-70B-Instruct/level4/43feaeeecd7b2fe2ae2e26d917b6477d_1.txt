This paper presents several novel models for capturing the joint distribution of integer-count variables, addressing the limitations of the default model proposed by Yang et al., which can only accommodate negative correlations to ensure normalization. The authors propose a series of modifications, including a new truncation approach, the incorporation of a quadratic base measure statistic (demonstrated to be necessary), and the use of a sub-linear sufficient statistic. Experimental evaluations are conducted on both synthetic and real-world data.
The paper is well-structured and effectively communicates innovative solutions for representing count data, appearing to be original and yielding significant results.
However, the criticisms of the truncation and quadratic models seem somewhat unconvincing. The truncation method might be suitable for domains where counts are typically low, potentially performing well. Similarly, the quadratic model's "Gaussian-esque thin tails" could be appropriate in certain contexts.
The term "sparsistent" is unfamiliar, although it appears to have been used previously in the field.
Minor corrections are suggested: On page 3, above section 2.1.1, "graphical mode distributions" should be replaced with "model". On page 5, above section 3.1, the sentence "Note that the log..." might be more accurately phrased as "Note that although the log...". Overall, the paper is of high quality and effectively addresses the modeling of joint distributions over count variables.
