The authors provide an in-depth analysis of a class of Monte Carlo tree search algorithms, demonstrating their compatibility with virtually any no-regret selection method, subject to minor constraints. A key theoretical contribution is the proof of convergence to epsilon-Nash equilibrium in scenarios involving simultaneous moves.
A notable limitation of this work is the asymptotic nature of the convergence, with no explicit rates provided. This outcome is a direct consequence of the analysis, which relies on the selection method being epsilon-Hannan consistent. Although this may not be a significant drawback, given the absence of existing convergence proofs for MCTS methods in extensive-form games with simultaneous moves, the question of convergence rates remains important. Specifically, it would be valuable to investigate the rates achievable when assuming a specific regret rate for the selection method, such as the sqrt(T) guarantee offered by exponential weights.
The paper concludes with experimental results, comparing the approach of propagating mean reward values, as used in the analysis, to the standard method of propagating current sample values. The findings indicate that mean values exhibit slightly inferior performance in experimental settings. Additionally, the authors attempt to derive insights into the convergence rate through experimental means.
In summary, this is a technically sound and well-written paper. However, I have some reservations regarding its overall significance, primarily due to the lack of convergence rates. While establishing asymptotic convergence is a crucial first step, particularly given the practical effectiveness of MCTS methods, the incremental nature of the result, considering existing convergence results for MCTS with sequential moves, somewhat tempers its impact.
Minor corrections and suggestions include:
- Figure 1: "leafs" should be corrected to "leaves".
- Line 144: The term "negated" is more accurate than "inverted".
- Line 10 of Algorithm 1: The notation "(a1,a2)" could be clarified as "(i,j)" or "(σ1,σ2)", avoiding potential confusion with the previously introduced notation "a_{i,j}" for payoffs in single-stage matrix games.
- Line 172: Notational inconsistencies, such as the switch from "(i,j)" to "a's", should be addressed throughout the paper to enhance clarity. Despite these minor issues, the paper is engaging and well-structured, leaving me with some concerns regarding its broader impact due to the absence of convergence rates in the analysis.
