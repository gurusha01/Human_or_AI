This manuscript examines the robust single linkage algorithm for constructing the cluster tree when the density's support is confined to a manifold, extending previous work [1] that analyzed the algorithm for densities supported on the entire space. The key finding is that the same algorithm can be applied in the manifold setting, yielding rates that depend solely on the manifold's dimension rather than the ambient dimension. The proof strategy closely follows that of [1], with necessary adaptations to account for the manifold-supported density.
A crucial aspect of the paper, which could be more prominently highlighted, is that the RSL algorithm, based on Euclidean distance, achieves manifold-dimension-dependent rates even when the density lies on a manifold. Providing intuition for this result, potentially through a simple synthetic example, would greatly benefit the reader. Since the proofs largely mirror those in [1], the fundamental concept underlying this phenomenon is not immediately clear from the presentation.
Upon reviewing the proofs, they appear to be sound. However, additional discussion on the parameter $\rho$ would enhance reader understanding, which might also address the previous point. Furthermore, the terminology 'class of RSL algorithm' used by the authors is somewhat misleading, particularly in relation to the implications of the lower bound. The specification 'of the form described in the algorithm in Figure 1' seems to refer to a single algorithm, which raises questions about the definition of this 'class'. 
The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the robust single linkage algorithm in finding the cluster tree for manifold-supported densities, with the algorithm's performance dependent on the manifold's dimension rather than the ambient space's dimension.
