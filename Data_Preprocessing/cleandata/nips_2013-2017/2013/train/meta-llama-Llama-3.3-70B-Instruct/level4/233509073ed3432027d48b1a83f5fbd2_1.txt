Reaction to the author feedback:
I disagree with point (3): The research by Siracusa III and Fisher (AISTATS 2009) does not assume independent and identically distributed (iid) data and allows for variations in the "generating structure" within a limited set of graphical models. Although the proposed method offers greater flexibility, it is misleading to claim that it is the first to address this problem.
*
The paper proposes a hypothesis-testing-based approach for online learning of graphical models from time series data. This method is designed for scenarios where the underlying "data generating" graphical model may change frequently. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using both simulated and real data.
Quality
The results appear to be correct. However, the description of related work in Section 2 is somewhat misleading: typical score-based algorithms for learning Bayesian networks do not assume a single generating model for the data; instead, they assume the scoring function can be factorized into local terms. While it is true that commonly studied models often assume exchangeability (or iid data), this pertains to the model rather than the algorithm itself.
Clarity
The presentation of the paper is generally clear, but there is room for improvement. A major point of confusion is the actual learning task: is it to infer change points under specific assumptions, to infer the generating structure of the last observed data point, or something else? Additionally, it is unclear whether the work proposes a new model (formulations of assumptions and learning goals) or a new algorithm (computational means to achieve learning goals), or both.
The paragraph at the end of page 3 is difficult to follow, particularly the equation for \rho{r+1}; it is unclear if this equation defines \rho{r+1} or if the definition has been previously stated. The lack of periods at the end of sentences containing displayed equations is also noteworthy. Furthermore, the font size in Figures 1-4 could be increased for better readability, and including descriptions for the different colors used in Figures 1 and 2 would be beneficial. In Section 6, the idea that improved tracking could offset additional computational costs is confusing, as this seems to depend on domain-specific trade-offs between tracking accuracy and computational cost.
Originality
The work appears to be original but lacks a genuinely innovative or novel idea. Perhaps the construction of p-values contains some unique aspect, although this is not entirely clear.
Significance
The potential significance of this work, if published, lies in its potential to lead to the development of superior, presumably Bayesian, methods for addressing the problem. However, this should be viewed more as development rather than groundbreaking research. The approach seems heuristic and is applied to a somewhat unclearly defined learning problem, which existing machine learning techniques should already be able to solve.
