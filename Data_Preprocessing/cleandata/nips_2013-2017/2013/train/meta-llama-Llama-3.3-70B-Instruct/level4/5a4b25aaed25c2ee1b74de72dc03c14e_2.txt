The authors present a novel approach to enhance the mixing rate of Gibbs sampling in Ising models by reparameterizing the original model to satisfy the Dobrushin criterion, which is essential for rapid mixing. This reparameterization is formulated as a constrained optimization problem, where the constraints ensure that the new parameters reside in the same space as the original ones. The authors explore this projection under various distance and divergence measures.
In my view, the integration of stochastic and deterministic inference principles is a relatively unexplored area, making this concept intriguing. Although the idea of augmenting the original parameters to improve mixing time is straightforward, the explanation of the dual projection problem is somewhat unclear. For instance, it is unclear how the constraints $z{ij} * d{ij} = 0$ guarantee that the new parameterization spans the same space as the original parameters, rather than a subspace. Furthermore, the overall procedure is ambiguous - does one perform the projected gradient operations to completion before running the Gibbs sampler, or are the sampling and gradient updates interleaved? An algorithmic description would help clarify this process. Additionally, it is uncertain whether the proposed projected gradient descent strategy is guaranteed to converge.
The experimental results are somewhat unconvincing. In the initial set of experiments, the Gibbs sampler is run for 30,000 iterations, but a comparison based on time would be more equitable, given that a sampling method is being compared to deterministic methods. Moreover, the absence of error bars on the charts makes it difficult to determine the significance of the results. The second set of results demonstrates that the projection leads to faster mixing when comparing the original Gibbs sampler to Gibbs samplers under different projections. However, the time required to perform the projection operation is not accounted for in this comparison, which may impact the usefulness of the method. For example, if the projection takes one minute and the naive Gibbs sampler can generate 10,000 samples in that time, the projection may not be worthwhile. Lastly, the absence of a comparison to blocked Gibbs samplers or Gogate's "Lifted Gibbs Sampler" is notable.
Overall, the idea is promising, but the development of the projection problem and the proposed method require refinement. A more comprehensive set of experiments is necessary to demonstrate the utility of the method.
