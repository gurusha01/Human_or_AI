Review of "Low-rank matrix reconstruction and clustering"
This paper proposes a novel algorithm for low-rank matrix reconstruction based on the application of Belief Propagation (BP) message-passing to a Bayesian model of the reconstruction problem. As detailed in the supplementary material, the algorithm incorporates two simplifying approximations, assuming a large number of rows and columns in the input matrix. The algorithm is evaluated against Lloyd's K-means algorithm by formulating clustering as a matrix reconstruction problem and compared to Variational Bayes Matrix Factorization (VBMF), the only previous message-passing reconstruction algorithm.
However, there are several concerns regarding the paper. The evaluation of the new algorithm on a non-standard problem, such as clustering encoded as matrix factorization, makes it challenging to extrapolate the experimental results to predict its performance on conventional matrix reconstruction problems. For instance, the paper cites references for VBMF, including Lin and Teh (2007) and Raiko, Ilin, and Karhunen (2007), which use the Netflix dataset for evaluation. It would be ideal if the present paper had used the same dataset for comparison. The use of a new criterion for evaluating the BP variant raises doubts about its competitiveness, and the authors should explain why they did not use a standard dataset.
The algorithm itself appears to be a relatively straightforward application of BP to a problem previously addressed with Variational Message Passing. Although new, it is not groundbreaking. The most interesting aspect of the algorithm is the approximations introduced in the limit $N\to\infty$ and $m\to\infty$, where $m \times N$ is the dimension of the input matrix. However, the validity of these approximations, described only in the supplementary material, is not directly tested and could be explained more clearly.
There are serious issues regarding the citation of prior work. The paper implies that the application of matrix factorization to clustering is an original contribution, which is not the case. The connection between matrix factorization and clustering is well-known, and the paper should make this clear to the reader. Additionally, Expectation Propagation (EP) should be cited, as it is commonly referred to as the application of BP to continuous classes of distributions. The relationship between EP and the paper's algorithm should be explained, and the fact that the main algorithm is an application of Belief Propagation should be mentioned in the abstract.
On the positive side, the paper presents a new and potentially useful algorithm, and the mathematics are possible to follow. Although the evaluation criteria may be suspicious, the K-means problem may provide a fair comparison of the algorithms, and the experiments show a benefit for the new algorithm.
The clarity of the paper is a significant concern. The early presentation is easy to follow, but the derivation of the algorithm is only provided in the supplementary material. The experiments section is clear, but the mathematics is the weakest part of the presentation. The notation is cumbersome, with an excess of hats, tildes, subscripts, and superscripts. The authors should consider simplifying the notation and providing a clearer explanation of the algorithm.
There are several specific issues with the paper, including the use of a tilde to denote column vectors, which is not standard. The capitalization of "N" but not "m" is also inconsistent. In Section 5, a citation is needed to indicate the primary reference guiding the implementation of the competing algorithm VBMF-MA.
The supplementary material has some language issues and could be improved with additional diagrams. The mathematics seems interesting, and the algorithm should be published, but the paper needs significant work before it can be accepted. The lack of clarity and scholarship puts an unacceptable burden on readers, which would reflect poorly on a conference that accepted it in its present state.
