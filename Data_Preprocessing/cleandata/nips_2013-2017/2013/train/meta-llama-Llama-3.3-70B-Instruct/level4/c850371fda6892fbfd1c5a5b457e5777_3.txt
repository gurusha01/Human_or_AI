This manuscript introduces a comprehensive approach to designing differentially private online algorithms, applicable to both full information and bandit settings. 
The presentation is lucid and well-justified, with a thorough examination of its connection to existing literature. Although a detailed verification of the appendix was not conducted, the findings seem plausible. 
While the work may not represent a seminal contribution, the concepts explored are intriguing and warrant publication. 
Some suggestions for improvement include: 
- Integrating the discussion into the main body of the text, as the open problems, particularly the comparison with the findings in [1], are noteworthy and deserving of prominence. The manuscript effectively outlines a general method for designing differentially private online algorithms in both full information and bandit contexts, supported by clear and comprehensive theoretical outcomes.
