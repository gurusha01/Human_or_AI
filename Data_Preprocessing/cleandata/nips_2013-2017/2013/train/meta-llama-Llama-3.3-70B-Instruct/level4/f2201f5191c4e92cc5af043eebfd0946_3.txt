This paper presents an intriguing discussion on how firing rates in a balanced network can be viewed as solutions to a quadratic cost function, which measures the deviation between input signals and decoded output. The manuscript is well-structured and clear, with a few exceptions that require further clarification, as outlined below.
However, upon closer examination, it becomes apparent that the paper's conceptual contribution is relatively modest compared to existing work, particularly Ref. 13 (Bourdoukan et al., NIPS 2012) and the supplementary paper under revision. Notably, the entirety of Section 2 has been previously described by Bourdoukan et al. (NIPS 2012). Moreover, the finding that inhomogeneous networks can achieve performance comparable to homogeneous systems has been established not only by Bourdoukan et al. but also in several recent neuroscience publications. This leaves the calculation of firing rates as the primary novel contribution, although this too has been essentially addressed by Bourdoukan et al. (2012 NIPS), including the condition for spiking (Vi > Ti).
Another critical aspect that warrants attention is the specific structure of the proposed balanced networks, where the number of inputs equals the number of neurons in the recurrent network. This raises questions about how to account for divergence and convergence, which are characteristic features of neural circuits.
Several minor points require clarification:
-- Equation 3 appears to necessitate a lower integration limit of 0, with the upper limit potentially extending to infinity.
-- The legend for Figure 1 states that a spike occurs when the total input exceeds the spiking threshold, yet the number of spikes does not match the number of red dots in the upper panels, which are also indicated as marking spike times.
-- Line 187 mentions that the curves are highly nonlinear, whereas the curves in Figure 1c appear quite linear.
While the paper is engaging and well-written as a standalone contribution, its conceptual advancement relative to Ref. 13 is questionable, which may impact its overall significance.
