Summary: This paper proposes a novel approach to learning a pruning algorithm for VP-trees in non-metric spaces, which estimates the decision function of approximate nearest neighbor search through sampling and approximates it using a piecewise linear function. The method demonstrates substantial improvements in search efficiency compared to relevant pruning baselines, particularly when the intrinsic dimensionality of the data is low.
Clarity: The paper is generally well-written, but occasionally lacks detailed explanations of implementation specifics and parameter choices, such as the selection of K=100, m=7, rho=8, and a bucket size of 10^5 (lines 185, 227, 315), which would benefit from further clarification.
Originality: To the best of my knowledge, this work represents the first attempt to "learn to prune" for approximate nearest neighbor classification on a VP-tree, making it a pioneering effort in this area.
Significance: Given the fundamental importance of nearest neighbor methods in search and classification, this learning-to-prune approach, which approximates nearest neighbor search with a non-linear function, is likely to be of interest to a broad audience. However, the experimental validation is limited to relatively simple, low-dimensional datasets, which may not accurately reflect real-world scenarios. Notably, the results on more complex datasets like RCV-256 and SIFT for L2 are not provided. Furthermore, the method's ability to achieve significant speed-ups in metric spaces is not well-established, which restricts its applicability. Existing methods leveraging LSH and embeddings, such as the work presented in [31] (P. Jain, B. Kulis, K. Grauman, Fast Image Search for Learned Metrics, CVPR 2008), have already demonstrated effective fast search capabilities in metric spaces.
The proposed learning-to-prune method, which approximates the approximate nearest neighbor decision function in a VP-tree using a non-linear piecewise function learned through sampling, yields considerable speed-up gains compared to existing non-learning methods. Although the approach appears novel and effective on the selected datasets, the motivation for targeting non-metric spaces specifically should be more thoroughly justified, as this exclusion limits the consideration of relevant baselines for metric spaces.
