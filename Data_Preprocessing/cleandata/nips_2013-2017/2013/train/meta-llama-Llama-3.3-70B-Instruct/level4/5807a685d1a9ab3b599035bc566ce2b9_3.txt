Review- Local Privacy and Minimax Bounds: Sharp Rates for Probability Estimations 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
This paper explores the concept of local privacy, where each user generates an $\alpha$-differentially private signal based on their own type and the signals of the other $n-1$ users, and reports their type to the data curator. The authors employ the framework of min-max expected error, where the adversary selects a distribution over inputs (types for the $n$ users) and they choose an $\alpha$-DP local scheme to minimize the distance between an estimation derived from the original data and a similar estimation derived from the reported signals, typically involving sums, aggregations, or averages. The authors establish a lower bound for the min-max rate for $l_2$ distance estimations and users drawn from a discrete distribution over $d$ types, demonstrating that the simple technique of randomized response achieves this bound and is therefore optimal. Furthermore, they analyze the problem of density estimations, where the lower bound on the min-max rate is met by a perturbation scheme in which each person perturbs only their own type.
The paper is well-written and significant, as it shows that a classic procedure is the best achievable, meeting certain lower bounds. The NIPS community will likely find it interesting, and I recommend acceptance.
However, I have some reservations. Firstly, the explanation of min-max bounds could be simplified, and the paper's notation is cumbersome, particularly since all bounds apply to the $l2$ norm. It would be more straightforward to phrase the bounds with respect to this norm. Secondly, I would appreciate a comment on the $l1$ norm, which is more restrictive, or a comparison of the given bounds to $l_1$ norms, as well as other lower bounds in differential privacy, which, although applicable to a classical non-local setting, provide a useful reference. Lastly, the min-max bounds discussed seem tailored to the local-privacy setting, and I wish the authors had considered a broader range of settings and provided min-max lower bounds for them as well. Nevertheless, I appreciate that the local setting allows users to randomize the type they report based on the remaining $n-1$ users, yet the simple scheme where each person randomizes the report solely based on their type is optimal. I suggest the authors explicitly state this in the text.
Additionally, with the recent publication of the FOCS 2013 accepted papers, I now view this paper as an extension of existing work, particularly the results in Section 3. While I still recommend acceptance, my endorsement is not as strong as it was initially. The paper's analysis of the local privacy framework using min-max rate bounds, providing lower bounds on the rate, and demonstrating that the upper bound is met by randomized response, is a nice result.
