This paper commences by noting the similarity between rooted DAGs and binary decision trees, and subsequently demonstrates through a series of experiments that fixing the number of child nodes in rooted DAGs (RDAGs) yields favorable comparisons to various baseline models. The experimentation highlights the potential practical significance of RDAGs, presenting a distinct type of regularization that diverges from typical approaches used in randomized trees. In my assessment, the primary contribution lies in the empirical evidence showcasing the potential practical importance of RDAGs. Although further experimentation is always possible, the authors have comprehensively covered multiple aspects.
The authors establish in Section 2 that binary decision trees and rooted binary decision DAGs exhibit considerable similarity, a notion that underpins the remainder of the paper. However, the abstract, title, and introduction suggest a broader similarity, which I find misleading and somewhat frustrating, as it is not substantiated by the subsequent content. To improve clarity, the authors should temper their initial statements to align with the paper's actual scope.
Additionally, while the DAG abbreviation is widely recognized, its meaning should be explicitly stated at its first occurrence, specifically in the abstract. The paper explores RDAGs (rooted directed acyclic graphs) and their ensembles, with experiments indicating that fixing the number of child nodes leads to promising results compared to other randomized tree classifiers.
