The authors propose a hierarchical extension of the IRM for network modeling, drawing on key concepts from the Bayesian rose tree paper, specifically: 1) utilizing the hierarchy to define a mixture over consistent node partitions, and 2) learning this hierarchy through an efficient greedy agglomerative procedure. The paper presents qualitative results on the Sampson's monks dataset and the full NIPS dataset, as well as quantitative results on the NIPS-234 dataset. Notably, the proposed inference method achieves similar predictive performance to the IRM at a significantly lower computational cost.
In terms of quality and clarity, the paper is exceptionally well-written, with a clear and concise exposition of the core ideas. 
The originality of the work lies in adapting the Bayesian rose tree concepts to the relational data setting, which required significant effort to maintain computational complexity. 
The significance of this research cannot be overstated, as scaling Bayesian nonparametric models, particularly network models, is a crucial challenge for their practical application. Although the basic algorithm's n^2 scaling may be prohibitive for larger networks, the sparse version is expected to remain feasible. However, it would be beneficial to include timings for larger real-world networks, such as the full NIPS dataset, to demonstrate the method's scalability. For instance, how long does the inference take on the full NIPS dataset, and how would it perform on gene networks with tens of thousands of nodes or larger social networks? 
Furthermore, investigating the greedy method's performance in relation to the optimal tree, potentially through exhaustive search on a smaller scale, would provide valuable insights. Additionally, exploring theoretical support for the method, such as submodularity, could further strengthen the contribution. 
Minor corrections include: 
Line 48, page 1: "whilst... but" should be revised for clarity, "pair of trees" should be corrected, and "A fruitful next steps" should be rephrased. 
While the ideas presented are familiar from the BRT work, the contribution remains significant, and this paper deserves acceptance.
