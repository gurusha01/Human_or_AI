The authors propose a scalable approximate inference algorithm for the "triangle model" of networks, introducing a robust subclass of the model that cleverly shares parameters. By leveraging stochastic variational inference, they successfully infer the posterior in extremely large networks. The paper is well-structured and effectively executed, leading me to consider it acceptable.
On page 1, the concept of "parsimonious" modeling is introduced, which may be unfamiliar in the context of probabilistic models. It would be beneficial to provide a brief explanation of this term, as it plays a significant role in the paper.
Also on page 1, the statement regarding the introduction appears to be misleading, as down-sampling zeros does not compromise accuracy according to Gopalan et al.
On page 4, while the triangle model is pragmatically justifiable, the comparison to LDA is not entirely accurate. Unlike LDA, which generates a coherent document through its generative process, the triangle model can produce objects that do not resemble networks. Although this does not detract from the model's practicality, the LDA analogy is not a suitable defense.
On page 5, it is essential to cite Hoffman et al., including Amari and Sato, as their work provides the necessary theoretical foundation for the scenario presented, which involves "local variables." Sato's algorithm is not applicable in this context, and Hoffman's theory fills this gap.
Page 6 lacks clarity regarding the generation of power law networks in the latent space, and this point should be elaborated upon. Furthermore, since Gopalan et al.'s algorithm is mentioned as a means to accelerate MMSB, a comparison with their algorithm, in addition to or instead of MMSB batch, would be beneficial.
Minor comments include correcting "mixture-membership" to "mixed-membership" on page 2 and considering the removal of the last sentence on page 8, as the second-to-last sentence provides a stronger conclusion. Additionally, the JMLR version of "Stochastic Variational Inference" should be cited in the bibliography.
