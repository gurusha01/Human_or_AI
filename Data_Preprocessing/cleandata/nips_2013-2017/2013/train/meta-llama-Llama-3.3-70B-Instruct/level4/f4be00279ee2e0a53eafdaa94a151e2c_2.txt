This manuscript employs approximate inference techniques, specifically by taking the continuous-time limit of expectation-propagation, to tackle nonlinear diffusion equations, yielding a tracking algorithm that offers substantial speed improvements over sampling-based approaches and demonstrates notable accuracy in the presented experiments. An intriguing question arises as to whether an alternative approach, involving the linearization of the loss function coupled with the iterative application of the Kalman-Bucy filter (or its extended version), could potentially lead to enhanced or diminished algorithmic effectiveness. Furthermore, conducting more comprehensive experiments, such as those utilizing high-frequency financial data where established benchmarks exist, would provide valuable insights. 
The technical quality of the paper is robust, with clear and organized writing that facilitates easy comprehension. The originality of the work is noteworthy, and its significance is underscored by the potential importance of the achieved speedup over Monte Carlo methods. By applying expectation-propagation to nonlinear diffusion processes, the authors achieve a considerable acceleration over traditional sampling methods, presenting their work in a clear and accessible manner.
