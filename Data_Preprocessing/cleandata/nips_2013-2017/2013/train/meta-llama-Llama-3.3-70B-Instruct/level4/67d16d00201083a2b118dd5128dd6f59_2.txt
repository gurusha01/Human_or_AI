This manuscript proposes a novel framework for capturing dependencies between variables using Gaussian process conditional copulas, where Gaussian process priors are utilized to model the interactions of latent functions. An alternating Expectation Propagation (EP) algorithm is then introduced for approximate Bayesian inference. The experimental results, encompassing both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrate the superior performance of conditional copula models, with a notable emphasis on the model based on the Student t copula.
Overall, the paper is well-structured and potentially valuable for modeling dependencies in time series data. The EP inference method proposed is also feasible for deriving the posterior distribution. However, a significant drawback is the omission of crucial details: 
(1) The calculation method for parameters within the copula model, such as \alpha, \beta, and \omega for the Symmetrized Joe Clayton Copula, is not provided. It is presumed that these parameters are set as constants, but the criteria for selecting them for specific time series data are unclear.
(2) The specifics regarding the parameters of the exponential covariance function in the Gaussian process are lacking.
(3) The process for determining the optimal number of latent functions, denoted as k, is not discussed.
The paper explores an intriguing topic and presents a viable inference method. Nonetheless, it falls short by not providing essential details pertaining to parameter settings, which are critical for the comprehensive understanding and implementation of the proposed methodology.
