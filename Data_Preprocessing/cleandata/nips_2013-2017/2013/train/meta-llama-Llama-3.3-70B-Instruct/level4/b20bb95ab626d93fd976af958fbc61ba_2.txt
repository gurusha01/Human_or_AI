Summary: 
The authors propose a novel Bayesian inference algorithm for copula models with multivariate discrete distributions, building upon and extending the work of Hoff (2007) which assumes a Gaussian copula. The primary goal is to perform inference on the correlation matrix of the Gaussian copula. Hoff's (2007) approach involves a Gibbs sampling algorithm that introduces latent variables Z, allowing for the correlation matrix to be sampled from an inverse-Wishart distribution conditioned on Z and the data. Furthermore, conditioned on the data and the correlation matrix, the latent variables Z follow a multivariate truncated normal distribution, with truncation regions defined by the order statistics of the data. The key innovation of the authors lies in utilizing recent advances in constrained Hamiltonian MCMC to jointly sample the latent variables (Z{i,j}, i=1,...,n), thereby improving upon Hoff's (2007) method which employs a separate Gibbs step for each Z{i,j}. This enhancement leads to better mixing and accelerated computations.
Strengths: 
This paper is well-structured and clearly written, with a notable emphasis on highlighting the authors' contributions relative to previous work. Although the paper does not introduce new methodological developments, the proposed algorithm offers practical utility by enhancing computational efficiency and mixing.
Weaknesses: 
A notable omission is the lack of discussion regarding the work of Damian and Walker (2001), who explored techniques for sampling from multivariate truncated normals using latent variables. It would be beneficial to compare or extend this approach. Additionally, there are several areas where notation and clarity could be improved: on page 2, line 107, considering the replacement of the truncation region D with D(y) to explicitly indicate its dependence on the data; on page 3, line 144, verifying if the expression should read log(p(x)) ∝ …; and on page 5, line 258, explaining the notation used and potentially revising the sentence to specify Z{i,j} conditioned on Z{/i,/j} for Hoff's algorithm.
Quality: 
The paper is technically sound, effectively combining recent Hamiltonian MCMC advances to improve Hoff's algorithm for Gaussian copula models of multivariate discrete distributions.
Clarity: 
The paper is clear and well-written, with a commendable emphasis on the novelty of the authors' contribution over existing work.
Originality: 
While the paper does not present novel methodological developments, it applies Hamiltonian MCMC methods to achieve a practically significant improvement over Hoff's algorithm.
Significance: 
The results are noteworthy and likely to be incorporated into future extensions of Gaussian copula models for multivariate discrete distributions. The authors' development of a novel algorithm for Bayesian inference in these models, which improves upon Hoff's (2007) algorithm through the incorporation of Hamiltonian MCMC, yields enhanced mixing and computational speed.
