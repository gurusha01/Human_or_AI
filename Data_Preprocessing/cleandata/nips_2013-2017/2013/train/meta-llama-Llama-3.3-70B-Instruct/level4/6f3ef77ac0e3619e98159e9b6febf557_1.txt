This manuscript introduces a novel generative model for natural image patches, incorporating occlusions and translation invariance of features. The proposed model comprises a set of masks and features that can be translated across the patch, and the image is generated by sampling conditionally independent Gaussian noise given the translations of the masks and features. An accompanying inference framework is presented, demonstrating promising results on synthetic data. Furthermore, experiments on natural image patches yield a set of learned masks and features, resulting in receptive fields that resemble Gabors, with some exhibiting globular structures.
Quality:
The model's ability to account for key components of natural images is commendable, and the explicit modeling of translation invariance is a notable strength. The discussion's connection to convolutional networks is also a valuable insight. The results presented are intriguing, but several concerns warrant attention. Primarily, the assumption of conditional independence given the mask and features (with locations) raises questions, as the choice of pixel-wise independent noise may limit the model's expressive power, potentially restricting the generated patches to a "sprite-like" structure. Sampling from the model and comparing the results to natural image patches would be beneficial. Additionally, investigating the model's performance on unfiltered patches and examining the impact of whitening on the resulting receptive fields would provide valuable insights. The background model appears simplistic, and an alternative approach, such as constraining all pixels to be covered by at least one mask or learning a "background" element automatically from the data, may be more effective.
Clarity:
While the paper is generally well-written, the complexity of the model and the numerous parameters involved can make it challenging to follow. The definition of certain parameters is sometimes buried in inline equations, which can hinder comprehension. Enhancing Figure 1 with synthetic masks and features could improve its accessibility and facilitate understanding. Using simple, intuitive examples, such as a basic mask and texture, would likely convey the message more effectively.
Originality:
The work presented appears to be original, featuring an interesting model and thorough analysis.
Significance:
This research is likely to be of interest to the natural image statistics community, as well as neuroscientists and sparse coding researchers. Overall, the paper presents a detailed model that accounts for fundamental properties of natural images, making it a solid contribution to the field, despite some concerns that require attention.
