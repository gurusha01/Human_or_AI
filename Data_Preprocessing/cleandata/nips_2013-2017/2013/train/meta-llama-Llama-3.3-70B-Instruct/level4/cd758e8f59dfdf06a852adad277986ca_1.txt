The paper explores the estimation of cluster trees when the probability density function is supported on a d-dimensional manifold embedded in a D-dimensional space. It demonstrates that the RSL algorithm, as proposed in reference (1), is consistent, with a convergence rate that roughly depends on the dimension of the manifold (d) rather than the ambient space (D). However, this convergence rate is also influenced by the conditional number (tau) and an epsilon^{d+2} factor, differing from the epsilon^2 factor seen in other contexts.
The main contribution of the paper is achieved by extending the technique outlined in reference (1). To accomplish this, the authors establish two key bounds: first, a bound on the size of an s-net within the manifold setting, and second, bounds on the deformation of volume, ensuring that the volume of the intersection of a ball with the manifold roughly equals the volume of a d-dimensional ball of the same radius. These bounds are derived under the assumption of a small conditional number.
The investigation into how the convergence rate changes under the manifold assumption is intriguing, and the paper provides both lower and upper bounds that are non-trivial. Although the convergence rate depends on unknown quantities such as the dimension of the manifold and the conditional number, the results remain interesting for their theoretical insights.
However, the writing is often unclear, and certain definitions are confusing or incorrect. Specifically, the statement in Theorem 4 is incorrect, as it misrepresents the consistency proven in Theorem 6 of reference (1). Theorem 6 guarantees uniform separation and connectedness for all sets satisfying a certain separation condition with high probability, which is a stronger statement than what Theorem 4 claims.
Furthermore, Definition 3 lacks clarity regarding the variable "n" and the term "C_n", which seems to be a random variable but is not explicitly defined within the paper. The reader is forced to refer to reference (1) to understand the intended meaning.
The application of Lemma 16 could be improved with clearer step-by-step explanations, including the specific inequalities used at each stage. For instance, the final step appears to utilize an inequality that simplifies to (1+4r/t(1+4r/t))(1+4r/t) < (1+6r/t), but this is not explicitly stated or justified.
In Lemma 18, there seems to be a missing factor of 1/2 in the definition of v_cap. Additionally, the use of Gamma(1/2) equals sqrt(pi) should be explicitly mentioned to avoid confusion.
The lower bounds produced in the paper depend on the conditional number and do not improve upon those found in reference (1) but rather offer a different perspective. It would be beneficial to acknowledge this distinction, especially considering scenarios like linear subspaces where the conditional number's inverse is zero, rendering the new lower bound meaningless while reference (1) provides a sensible bound.
The choice of the salience parameter 2\sigma > tau could be simplified by assuming (3\sigma/16) < (tau/16), potentially streamlining the analysis. The authors successfully demonstrate how to generalize results to the manifold case by deriving interesting bounds on s-nets. Despite the lack of clarity and the error in Definition 3, the paper contributes to the understanding of cluster tree estimation under manifold assumptions.
