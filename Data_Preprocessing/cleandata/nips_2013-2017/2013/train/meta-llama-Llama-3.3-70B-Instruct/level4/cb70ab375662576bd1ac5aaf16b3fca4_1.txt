This manuscript presents a spectral approach to learning Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) from non-sequential observations, drawing inspiration from various scientific examples. The authors propose a sampling model for non-sequential data that bears similarities to the generative model underlying Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). By leveraging recent spectral techniques for learning LDA, HMMs, and mixture models, they establish sample bounds for recovering HMM parameters with continuous output from data generated according to this model. A simple simulation is provided to illustrate the algorithm's behavior on a synthetic example, with detailed proofs included in the supplementary material.
The primary contribution of this work lies in identifying a sampling model for non-sequential HMM data that is amenable to theoretical analysis using spectral learning techniques, and in deriving finite-sample bounds under this model. However, the experimental evaluation is limited and potentially unnecessary, given the paper's focus on theoretical contributions. The space devoted to this section could be more effectively utilized to highlight novel aspects of the proofs presented in the appendix.
Overall, the paper is well-written, with the authors providing clear explanations for the intuitions behind their results. Nevertheless, the mathematical presentation is somewhat dry, particularly with regards to the sample bounds, which prioritize precision over asymptotic behavior and can be challenging to comprehend.
While the paper's content is not highly original, the proposed generative model for non-sequential data and its analysis do offer some novelty. The proof techniques, although involved, resemble those employed in other spectral learning analyses. Furthermore, the problem of utilizing non-sequence data in spectral HMM learning algorithms has been previously explored (e.g., "Spectral Learning of Hidden Markov Models from Dynamic and Static Data" by T. Huang and J. Schneider, ICML 2013).
The significance of the proposed method hinges on its performance on real-world data, which may not conform to the sampling model defined in the paper. Although the authors leave this as future work, the reported sample sizes required for good results on a synthetic target suggest potential limitations in applicability to problems with small sample sizes.
A minor typo is noted: on line 107, "V2" should be replaced with "X2". This manuscript provides the first finite-sample bounds for learning HMMs from non-sequence data under a reasonable sampling model. The usefulness of this approach will depend on its ability to perform well on real-world problems that motivated the model.
