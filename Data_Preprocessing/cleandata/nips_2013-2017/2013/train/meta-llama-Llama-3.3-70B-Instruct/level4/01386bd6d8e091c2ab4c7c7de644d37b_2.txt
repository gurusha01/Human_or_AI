This manuscript demonstrates the feasibility of inferring large network properties by sequentially sampling subnetworks and integrating the resulting sub-models. The potential extension to point-process data is notable, as it could be applied to numerous datasets where a subset of channels is modified daily. The concept appears to be novel, with the work by J. W. Pillow and P. Latham being the closest similar study. The idea seems powerful, but its limitations, particularly with regards to data that deviates from linear-Gaussian assumptions, are not clearly established.
The practical implications of this method are uncertain, especially when the full model can be estimated from a single subset, and it is unclear how much additional information is gained by incorporating other subsets. Furthermore, the requirement for overlap between populations in the real data experiments raises questions about the model's constraints and the role of overlap in improving model performance.
The experiments on real data, where linearity assumptions are likely violated, also prompt concerns about the distinction between common input and direct pairwise couplings in explaining noise correlations. It is possible that latent variables could provide a better model for noise correlations than pairwise couplings. 
The authors provide an extensive introduction and discussion but lack detailed explanations of the estimation process. The equation for the M step, presented as a key contribution, is not adequately derived or explained, which may undermine the novelty of the paper for readers without expertise in linear dynamical systems. The idea is promising, but clearer explanations are necessary to convey the significance of the results.
Overall, the manuscript presents an intriguing concept tested on real data, but certain aspects require further clarification to fully appreciate the method's potential and limitations.
