The paper explores random utility models incorporating the concept of "types," defined as a formula combining an agent's attributes with those of a given alternative to yield a perceived value. This does not imply that agents of the same "type" share identical tastes or preference profiles, rendering the model quite expressive. The observations consist of complete rankings of alternatives based on perceived values.
The theoretical contributions of this work include: 
(1) the identifiability of the model when types are known, and 
(2) the identifiability of the model with unobserved types for a specific class of cumulative distribution functions (cdfs) governing the noise.
From an algorithmic standpoint, the paper proposes a reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) heuristic for recovering model parameters from observations. The experiments involve both synthetic data and data from a sushi preference experiment cited in [26].
Strengths:
---------
The model presents a novel approach, as far as can be determined. The sushi experiment provides some justification by indicating that assuming three "types" yields a better fit than assuming a single "type". The identifiability result (2) is noteworthy, whereas result (1) is less surprising, analogous to the full rank requirement in linear regression.
Weaknesses:
----------
1. Although the model is original, it is unclear why latent "types" are preferable to assuming additional latent features for individuals and alternatives, a common approach in collaborative filtering. This alternative method would result in a non-convex optimization problem, similar to the model presented. A comparison between these approaches would be beneficial.
2. The paper claims to enable inference at finer levels, such as the individual level, unlike cited works (e.g., [7]). However, the experiments do not demonstrate this capability, and a comparison with the cited works would be valuable. The finding that the sushi data fits best with three types does not support the claim of "individual level inference".
Detailed Comments:
-----------------
The last paragraph on page 1, continuing onto page 2, discusses an "unresolved issue" regarding restrictive functional assumptions about the distribution. The reader anticipates that this work will resolve this issue, but it is unclear how, as assumptions about the "taste shock" are still made.
Section 3.1's first sentence is poorly written. The last sentence on page 4 refers to an unspecified equality, which should be displayed and referenced using \ref{}. The last sentence on page 5 poses a problem with a theorem without clear justification. On page 6, "a enough" should be corrected to "enough".
Overall, the paper presents a random utility model with "types," accompanied by statistical identifiability results, a proposed algorithm, and experiments. While the model is new and exhibits some theoretical novelty, the experiments are somewhat disappointing.
