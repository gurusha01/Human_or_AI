This paper addresses the challenge of fitting conditional copula models, extending beyond traditional constant copula functions to accommodate cases where copula parameters vary as a function of other dynamic aspects of the problem.
At its core, the proposed solution involves modeling the parameter space using Gaussian Processes, initiating with a Gaussian Process prior and integrating observed data through Expectation Propagation to approximate the posterior distribution.
The manuscript is exceptionally well-crafted, making it straightforward to comprehend. The problem statement is compelling, and the inclusion of examples based on Hidden Markov Models and multivariate time series copulas is particularly noteworthy. The experimental section is also adequately comprehensive. Overall, the paper presents a compelling investigation of a novel problem, offering a sensible solution accompanied by outstanding experimental demonstrations.
