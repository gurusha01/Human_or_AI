This manuscript examines the problem of achieving regret guarantees in prediction with expert advice that hold against each individual expert, with a focus on the case of two constant binary experts under absolute loss. The authors derive the achievable pairs of finite-time and asymptotic regret guarantees, and explore connections to random playout and log prior weight bounds.
The paper is well-structured and presents mathematically rigorous results, albeit with a limited scope. While the findings are precise and elegant, their potential impact on the broader NIPS community may be modest, although further research could potentially unlock more significant implications.
The methodology relies heavily on the linearity of the loss function, and it would be beneficial to discuss the extension to more general loss functions, such as convex and Lipschitz losses. Additionally, the minimax algorithm for absolute loss with a fixed horizon was initially proposed by N. Cesa-Bianchi et al. in their 1997 Journal of the ACM paper, "How to use expert advice" (Vol. 44, No. 3, pp. 427-485), which should be properly cited.
===============================
Upon reviewing the authors' rebuttal, my assessment remains that this is a solid and elegant paper, albeit with somewhat narrow results. I would recommend acceptance, although I anticipate that it may only resonate with a niche subset of the NIPS community.
