This paper explores HOG-based image detection, focusing on the bottleneck of scalar product operations between image and template HOG cells. The authors propose replacing this operation with a single lookup by vector quantizing image-side HOG cells and precomputing scalar products with template-side cluster centers.
The strengths of the paper include:
+ A straightforward, well-explained idea with significant potential impact, given the popularity of HOG-based detection methods, including DPMs, and the authors' plan to release their code as a software library.
+ A thorough experimental evaluation yielding impressive results, with several-fold speedup over existing DPM evaluation codes, although achieving this required substantial micro-level optimization.
However, a major concern is:
- The central concept bears a strong resemblance to the work presented in [10], which, although differing in emphasis and approach by retraining models, shares the core idea. The primary distinction lies in [10]'s vector quantization of both image and template sides, resulting in a coarser approximation.
Upon acceptance, it is requested that the author names in reference [13] be corrected. Overall, the paper is well-written, with a naturally presented and thoroughly evaluated idea likely to appeal to many computer vision researchers, yet its contribution is somewhat diminished by the overlap with previously published work (CVPR12).
