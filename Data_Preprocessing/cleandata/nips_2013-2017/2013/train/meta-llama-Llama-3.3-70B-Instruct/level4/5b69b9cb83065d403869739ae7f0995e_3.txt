This paper presents an approximate message passing algorithm for matrix factorization, demonstrating its connection to the clustering problem. The authors derive the message passing algorithm for matrix factorization and specialize it for clustering, with experimental comparisons to the k-means++ algorithm.
Quality: The mathematical derivations in this manuscript are somewhat lacking in detail, omitting crucial steps even in the appendix.
1) The justification for the second term of equation (11) being O(1/\sqrt(m)) in line 139 of the appendix is unclear, particularly with regards to the treatment of \beta in Section 2.
2) Certain analyses, such as the derivation of equation (19), appear to assume that m and n grow at the same rate, which may not be explicitly stated; the asymptotic analysis in this section could be more comprehensive to ensure mathematical rigor.
3) The assertion that m \tauw^2 represents the expectation of A{il}^2 in line 167 requires clarification, as A is observed data and m\tau_w^2 corresponds to the variance of the likelihood, necessitating verification of the underlying rationale.
4) The convergence of the message passing algorithm for finite \beta to the MAP problem is not clearly established, given that the message passing algorithm minimizes the KL divergence, but the limit of the minimum KL divergence as \beta approaches infinity may not necessarily equal the minimum of the limit of the KL divergence.
5) The proof of Proposition 1 is concise and lacks detail, particularly in the derivation of equation (17), which warrants further explanation.
Clarity: The manuscript is well-organized, making it relatively easy to comprehend its primary contribution.
Originality: The algorithm's focus on estimating the first and second moments of the marginal posterior suggests a potential connection to Expectation-Propagation (EP) applied to matrix factorization, a concept already explored in existing literature, such as http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/79460/www09.pdf. The updated procedures in Section 1 of the appendix seem to follow standard EP protocols, raising questions about the novelty of the approach. Furthermore, an intriguing connection may exist between the proposed clustering algorithm and the clutter problem in the original EP paper, http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/minka/papers/ep/minka-ep-uai.pdf, if the likelihood of the clutter problem is modified to a uniform mixture of Gaussian distributions.
Significance: While the authors primarily apply their algorithm to clustering, the comparison to only k-means++ may be insufficient to demonstrate the practical utility of the algorithm, given the extensive literature on clustering. The sketchy proofs, even in the appendix, hinder a thorough evaluation of the manuscript's technical correctness, and the potential application of expectation-propagation to matrix factorization, as previously done by Stern et al., http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/79460/www09.pdf, may impact the manuscript's overall significance.
