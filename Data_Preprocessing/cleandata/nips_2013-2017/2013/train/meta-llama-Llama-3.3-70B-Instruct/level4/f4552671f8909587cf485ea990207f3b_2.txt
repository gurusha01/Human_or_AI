The authors propose an associative memory model designed for pattern completion of integer-valued data, beyond binary values, with a purported capacity to store a number of patterns that scales exponentially with the number of neurons. The core contribution of this paper lies in its analysis of how intrinsic neural noise affects the performance of this memory model. Notably, both analytical and simulation results demonstrate that intrinsic noise can paradoxically enhance the model's performance. 
Comments: 
1) To substantiate the claim of exponential pattern storage capacity, it is crucial to include either theoretical analyses that derive the storage capacity or simulation results that illustrate how recall error changes as the number of stored patterns increases.
2) For the sake of making the paper self-contained, a detailed description of the learning algorithm referenced in [10], at the very least its fundamental principles, should be provided.
3) Given the integer-valued nature of the data, limiting external additive noise to the discrete values -1, 0, or 1 seems somewhat restrictive. An investigation into whether the model can robustly handle larger additive noise values would be beneficial.
4) While the discussion highlights the model's relevance to neurobiology, it is also important to acknowledge and discuss the aspects of the algorithm that are not biologically plausible, such as the negative activity in control neurons and the iterative loops in Alg1 and Alg2.
5) Incorporating key proof lines from the appendix into the main body of the paper would enhance its clarity and readability in the final version.
6) Consider omitting the redundant 3D figure, Fig 4, which largely duplicates information presented in Fig 5, to conserve space. 
The proposal outlines an associative memory mechanism tailored for the completion of patterns in non-binary, integer-valued data, with claims suggesting the model's storage capacity for patterns can exponentially increase with the neuron count.
