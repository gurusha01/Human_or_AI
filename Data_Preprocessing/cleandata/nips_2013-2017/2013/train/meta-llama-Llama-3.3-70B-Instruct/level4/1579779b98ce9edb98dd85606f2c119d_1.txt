This manuscript examines the application of Monte Carlo tree search in zero-sum extensive form games characterized by perfect information and simultaneous moves, demonstrating the convergence of the MCTS algorithm to an approximate Nash equilibrium under specific conditions, which is corroborated by empirical evidence.
The detailed commentary is as follows:
1. Overall, the paper is deemed satisfactory as it establishes a sufficient condition for the convergence of MCTS algorithms, yielding a useful result presented in a clear manner. However, given the primary contribution lies in the theoretical aspect, concerns arise regarding the novelty of the employed proof technique.
2. While UCB algorithms are prevalent in the literature, their analysis is notably absent in this paper. Considering existing analyses of UCB for trees, it would be beneficial for the authors to incorporate UCB algorithms into their comparison with other algorithms presented.
3. The proof solely addresses the convergence of the mean propagation, yet experimental results suggest that the propagation of the current sample value also exhibits good convergence under various criteria. An explanation for this observation would be appreciated.
The paper presents an interesting study on Monte Carlo tree search in zero-sum extensive form games with perfect information and simultaneous moves. Although the findings are intriguing, from a technical standpoint, the paper does not demonstrate exceptional outstandingness.
