The paper presents theoretical bounds on the search performance of a basic tree-based nearest neighbor search algorithm, which are dependent on the vector quantization performance of the tree. The authors argue that this implies trees with good vector quantization performance are beneficial for nearest neighbor search, and extend this statement to large margin splits.
However, the paper's title, "which space partitioning tree to use for search?", is misleading, as it would be more accurate to ask "which tree results in the strongest performance guarantees?" The paper primarily focuses on theoretical analysis, with little discussion on practical performance, due to the use of an overly simplified search procedure. This is a common issue, as a better performance guarantee does not necessarily translate to better practical performance, especially when the bounds are not tight.
The analysis of Algorithm 1 is thorough, but its relevance is questionable, as it does not perform backtracking and only finds an approximate nearest neighbor. The algorithm's decision to traverse branches is based on a pre-specified parameter, rather than being data-dependent, which limits its usefulness. Since all results are restricted to this algorithm, the paper's relevance is called into question.
A more realistic approach would involve analyzing the computational complexity of methods with backtracking, which, although more challenging, is essential for understanding the behavior of practical algorithms. The current analysis seems to have been conducted because it is possible, rather than because it is relevant.
The paper's conclusion, that good vector quantization performance implies good search performance for Algorithm 1, does not generalize to more elaborate tree search procedures. The title and other statements suggest a more general conclusion, but this is not supported by the analysis. Therefore, this paper does not provide an answer to the question of which search tree to use in practice.
The empirical evaluation is limited, using only four non-standard datasets, and the results, although consistent with the analysis, do not provide insight into computational time or the potential benefits of backtracking. The simplified analysis reduces the relevance of the paper to practical purposes.
Despite these concerns, the author feedback has addressed these points convincingly, leading to a revised assessment of the paper.
