The authors propose a novel class of approaches for learning sparse Bayesian Networks, comprising three primary methods. Initially, they introduce a Dynamic Programming (DP) approach that incorporates the Lasso as a scoring function, which is then modified to utilize an A search algorithm with the Lasso scoring method. This modification employs a heuristic function that is both admissible and consistent, guaranteeing the discovery of the optimal solution while enabling pruning. Their third method approximates A by restricting the queue size, demonstrating that moderate limits can significantly enhance speed with minimal degradation in solution quality, whereas very small queues compromise solution quality.
The authors observe that many existing methods prune the search space as a preliminary step, followed by identifying the optimal Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) within this reduced space as a separate step, potentially excluding the optimal solution. In contrast, their approach appears to be an effective means of avoiding this issue.
The experimental section appears to be comprehensive and well-executed.
The paper is well-structured and clearly written.
Regarding Figure 3, it is unclear what parameter was varied to generate the curves - was it Lambda? This question arises due to the unexpected non-monotonicity observed in the Hailfinder 2 plot. Furthermore, it seems unusual that the SBN method drops below the "random guessing" line in four instances, which may indicate an anomaly.
Minor comments include:
- Line 21: A missing space is present in the term "two-stageapproach".
- Line 130: The notation "U\in V" should be corrected to "U\subseteq V".
- Line 140: An empty citation is present, denoted by [].
- Lines 157 and 175: The phrase "and and" is used redundantly.
- Lines 169 and 171: Both sentences start with the phrase "On the other hand", which is unnecessary.
- Line 180: The term "heuristic" is misspelled.
- Line 258: "CLOSE" should be corrected to "CLOSED".
- Line 356: The term "least square" is misspelled.
- Line 357: The indefinite article "a" is missing before the term "prediction".
- Line 430: The sentence is incomplete, but the paper presents a promising set of methods for learning Bayesian Networks through an A* search with a Lasso-based scoring function.
