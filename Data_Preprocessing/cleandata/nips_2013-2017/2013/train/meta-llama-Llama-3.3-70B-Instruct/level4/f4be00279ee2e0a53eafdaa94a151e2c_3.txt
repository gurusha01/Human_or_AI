This paper presents a theoretically sound and intriguing proposal for a novel EP-type inference approach tailored to continuous-time stochastic dynamical systems. The structure of the paper is clear, and the theoretical foundations are well-articulated. Nevertheless, the motivation behind the proposed approach could be more compelling, particularly with a more comprehensive experimental section. The comparison to existing methods is limited, primarily confined to a benchmark against a MCMC approach in the initial example of Section 3.1. Given that the proposed method performs comparably to the MCMC approach, it is essential to elucidate the advantages of adopting this new method. The authors should provide a detailed discussion on this aspect. In the third example, while the results appear similar to those reported by Zammit Mangion et al., the justification for the proposed approach is based on computational grounds. To make the introduction of this new approach meaningful, it is crucial to quantify its benefits over existing methods. Specifically, the authors should provide concrete metrics or comparisons that highlight the characteristics and advantages of their approach relative to others. This quantification is necessary for the scientific community to assess the value of the proposed method. Although the paper is very interesting, the experimental section falls short of being fully satisfactory, and addressing these concerns, especially with quantitative insights during the rebuttal period, would be highly appreciated.
