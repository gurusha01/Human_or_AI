This paper tackles the challenge of training a two-layer network for classification tasks involving latent variables by introducing a convex SDP relaxation of the initially non-convex training problem. The authors also present an approximate optimization algorithm designed to solve the formulated SDP. Experimental results demonstrate the algorithm's potential, showing it outperforms globally optimized single-layer models and the same two-layer model optimized using local alternating minimization.
The novel reformulation enabling SDP relaxation is noteworthy and innovative. The paper is generally well-structured and clear, although certain sections are dense. From a technical standpoint, the paper appears to be sound.
However, a significant weakness lies in the complexity of the resulting SDP problem. The authors should provide more details about the basic properties of the proposed optimization algorithm, such as the computational time required for benchmark problems and whether the algorithm yields a precise solution, including the stopping condition used. This information is crucial because a convex problem does not necessarily imply an easily solvable problem; a convex relaxation can be practically intractable, and it is essential to clarify this aspect. Nonetheless, the proposed relaxation retains its value even if it presents practical challenges.
Several minor points require attention:
- Equation (17) is missing a variable beneath the first minimum.
- In equation (18), the condition defining the set should include \(N = \Phi'^*\Phi\).
- There is a typographical error in "line 331: (d) Synhetic results," which should likely read "Synthetic results."
- The rationale behind using transductive evaluation without computing network responses or knowing \(W\) and \(V\) is unclear, as stated in line 356.
- The actual size of the problem instances (21) solved in the experiments is not specified.
The proposed SDP relaxation represents an intriguing approach to approximating a significant instance of non-convex training problems more effectively. Although the current algorithm may not be practical for immediate use, it has the potential to inspire the development of more efficient methodologies.
