This manuscript presents a novel bounded-staleness approach for a parameter server in iterative distributed learning, leveraging vector clocks to achieve a balanced trade-off between asynchronous updates and synchronized methods. The concept is straightforward, offering a parameterized spectrum that bridges the gap between purely asynchronous designs, such as Hogwild or Yahoo LDA, and those with strict synchronization barriers, akin to recent SGD publications. Although the paper does not introduce groundbreaking theoretical contributions, it effectively builds upon the analytical framework established in [17], demonstrating a clear understanding of the underlying principles. The writing is of high quality, with the description of the SSPtable design being particularly noteworthy for its clarity.
The experimental findings are persuasive, especially the trade-offs between computation and communication, as well as the detailed analysis of clock cycles, worker efficiency, and time utilization. To further enhance the manuscript, several aspects warrant consideration: 
- The evaluation of Lasso is currently restricted to a simplistic synthetic dataset; expanding this to more comprehensive and real-world datasets would significantly strengthen the results.
- A direct performance comparison with state-of-the-art distributed learning frameworks, such as Yahoo LDA and Hogwild, would provide valuable insights.
- Incorporating a single-worker baseline would offer a more complete picture of the system's efficiency.
- Clarification on the data partitioning strategy is necessary, as this detail is currently omitted.
Potential avenues for future exploration include:
- Integrating the proposed method with Gemulla et al.'s sub-epoch approach for matrix factorization, which involves sequential operation on non-overlapping parameter blocks, could yield interesting results.
- Discussing the feasibility of enforcing slower workers to synchronize at an incomplete iteration threshold to prevent staleness-induced blocking would add depth to the analysis.
Overall, the manuscript is well-structured, presents an intuitive concept, and offers compelling experimental evidence, with opportunities for refinement in a few key areas.
