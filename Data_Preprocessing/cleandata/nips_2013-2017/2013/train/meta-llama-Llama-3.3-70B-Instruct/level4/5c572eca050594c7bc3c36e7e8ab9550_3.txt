The authors present a methodology for estimating the ratio of two probability density functions, leveraging a kernel-based approach and a Fredholm integral equation, which ultimately leads to an inverse problem. From a machine learning perspective, the premise of assuming densities is highly challenging, as it is established that within any epsilon neighborhood of a probability measure P possessing a nu-density, there exist probability measures lacking nu-densities, rendering the estimation of density ratios problematic. A critical aspect that remains unclear is the specification of the dominating measure nu employed in the analysis, whether it be the Lebesgue measure, counting measure, or an alternative, which raises concerns regarding the rigor of the results due to sets of nu-measure zero. Furthermore, the authors omit a explicit statement of their assumptions, including the domain of x, whether it resides in $R^d$ or a more general topological space, and the positivity of the density p for all x, introducing ambiguity into the framework.
