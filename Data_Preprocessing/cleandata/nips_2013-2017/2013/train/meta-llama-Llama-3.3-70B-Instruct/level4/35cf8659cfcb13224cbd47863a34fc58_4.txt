This paper presents a scalable approach to clustering networks into hierarchical communities using an agglomerative method. The underlying prior over trees and algorithmic structure remain largely unchanged from previous work on Bayesian rose trees, with modifications made to the likelihood to accommodate networks. The authors also demonstrate how to efficiently cache sufficient statistics. The presentation is clear, and experimental results show favorable comparisons to a baseline model with a flat community structure. However, a notable limitation is the lack of comparison to other hierarchical network models.
Regarding significance and related work, the paper is well-written and technically sound. Section 3's presentation is dense and could potentially be simplified, particularly in the notation and explanation of equation (9) and its subsequent components. The experiments primarily demonstrate the benefits of modeling hierarchy in relational datasets but do not compare the proposed method to existing hierarchical methods. For instance, the "multiscale community blockmodel for Network exploration" and the "Mondrian Process" are two Bayesian nonparametric models that hierarchically model latent community structure, which are not mentioned in the paper.
In terms of originality and clarity, the proposed model appears to be an adaptation of the Bayesian rose tree with a standard block-model likelihood. The innovations lie in how the new likelihood affects the recursive update of sufficient statistics in the greedy agglomerative clustering. The likelihood computation in O(Nodes + Edges) time is a notable feature. However, the description of this process and the recursive updating of sufficient statistics could be improved for better understanding.
The use of the term "nonparametric" is questionable, as it seems to contradict the interpretation by Blundell et al., who discuss the rose tree approach in terms of model selection and contrast it with nonparametric methods.
The experiments, including the qualitative analysis on Sampson's data and the comparison to the IRM, are satisfactory in demonstrating the benefits of averaging over multiple hypotheses for prediction. Nonetheless, the absence of comparisons to other hierarchical network models remains a significant limitation. While the paper discusses scalability, the tested networks are not particularly large. Overall, the work effectively combines prior research on Bayesian rose trees with stochastic block model likelihoods for networks and extends efficient agglomerative clustering methods to this context, enabling effective hierarchical community discovery, albeit with notable gaps in comparative analysis.
