This manuscript presents a novel application of determinantal point processes (DPP) to modeling neural population activity, demonstrating its feasibility on both simulated and real neural data. 
However, a crucial aspect that is lacking in this work is a thorough comparison with existing methodologies, such as Generalized Linear Models (GLMs), to establish the superiority of the proposed DPP approach. Specifically, in Section 4, the authors should conduct a performance comparison between DPP and GLM on identical datasets, highlighting instances where DPP outperforms GLM.
The authors argue that DPP offers an advantage over GLM by capturing inhibitory interactions between neurons. Nevertheless, it is essential to clarify whether GLMs can also model inhibitory interactions through their coupling filters, and if so, what makes the DPP's approach superior. Providing a brief intuitive explanation of how equation (1) encapsulates inhibitory interactions would be beneficial. Furthermore, while the manuscript emphasizes DPP's capability to capture inhibitory interactions, it should also be acknowledged that DPP can model excitatory interactions.
Figures 2b, 3, and 4 were challenging to interpret, and it would be helpful if the authors could explicitly state the key observations or trends that the reader should discern from these figures. Additionally, relating Figures 3 and 4 to the identification of excitatory versus inhibitory neurons could offer valuable insights.
On page 8, the authors claim that the model accurately captures the dichotomy of neurons, but it is unclear where in Section 4 this finding is demonstrated. 
In Section 3.2, a detailed explanation of how to determine the dimensionality of y and how to learn the kernel parameters (if applicable) would be beneficial. While this work exhibits promise, it appears to be in its early stages of development. The advantages of using DPP over existing methods for modeling neural population activity need to be more clearly articulated to establish its significance.
