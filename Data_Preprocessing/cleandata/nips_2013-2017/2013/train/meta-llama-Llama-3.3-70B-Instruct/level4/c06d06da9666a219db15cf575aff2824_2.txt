The authors pose the problem of learning an undirected graphical model as a complex constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) with a large number of constraints. Specifically, they aim to identify the junction tree, T, that maximizes the marginal likelihood p(X|T) given observations of variables X. Instead of exhaustively searching the space of possible junction trees, they formulate a weighted CSP and suggest utilizing an existing CSP solver to find the optimal junction tree.
The paper primarily focuses on formulating the CSP, including the characterization of a junction tree as a set of cliques and separators over a balanced maximum weight spanning tree. Although the paper is well-written and appears to be novel, its practical applicability may be limited due to the exponential number of constraints required to formulate the CSP. In other words, the benefits of casting the structure learning problem as a CSP are unclear. A more desirable approach might involve formulating an approximate CSP that relaxes certain conditions while remaining tractable, or a bounded CSP that learns the most likely junction tree with a limited clique size. Furthermore, incorporating a non-uniform prior on graph structures could be beneficial, particularly for learning sparse or low-treewidth models. The authors propose a novel CSP-based formulation of structure learning and introduce a useful tool, the balanced spanning tree, for analyzing and developing algorithms involving junction trees. However, the approach has limited practical value due to the exponential constraint requirement, which outweighs its potential benefits.
