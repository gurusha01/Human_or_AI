This manuscript presents a novel approach to accelerating ridge regression via the subsampled randomized Hadamard transform (SRHT), significantly reducing dimensionality and computational costs. The core concept involves applying the randomized Hadamard transform followed by uniform feature sampling, with accompanying theoretical analyses on the algorithm's risk. Theoretical findings inform the estimation of the optimal number of subsampled features, denoted as p_subs. A comparative analysis with principal component regression is also provided. Empirical evaluations utilizing synthetic and UCI datasets demonstrate the proposed algorithm's efficacy.
The paper introduces an intriguing algorithm that is straightforward to follow. The underlying idea is relatively simple, with the crux lying in the efficient execution of the SRHT. This simplicity belies an interesting approach, particularly in how it addresses the drawbacks of other random projection algorithms, which often incur significant costs in generating random projection matrices and computing their products with design matrices. The innovation here is the integration of these steps into a single, efficiently implemented process.
However, the empirical studies could be strengthened. Notably, the use of classification accuracy as a metric for UCI datasets seems misplaced, given the paper's focus on ridge regression and the derivation of theoretical risk bounds. A more appropriate evaluation might focus on regression errors.
A minor error appears in Eq. (3), where the right-hand side of the inequality includes a coefficient of 2 within the square root, which is absent in subsequent discussions, suggesting a typographical mistake. Without having reviewed the cited references, this discrepancy stands out.
In summary, the manuscript proposes a straightforward yet efficient method for ridge regression using SRHT. While the concept is compelling, both the theoretical underpinnings and empirical validations could benefit from further reinforcement to solidify the algorithm's merits.
