Paper Summary: 
The authors provide a formal proof for the longstanding notion that partition trees exhibiting superior quantization rates also demonstrate enhanced nearest neighbor search performance. This insight prompts the proposal of the 'max margin' partition tree, which establishes a relationship between search performance and margin. Experimental validation using real-world data confirms that 'max margin' and partition trees with favorable quantization errors yield effective nearest neighbors.
Review: 
I appreciate the authors' effort in formalizing the long-held assumption that partition trees with improved quantization rates tend to exhibit better nearest neighbor search performance. The formalism and conditions presented in Theorem 3.1 are logical, and the performance is nicely correlated with the 'expansion constant', a formal representation of the intrinsic dimension of the input sample. However, the bound provided in Eq. 4 can be further refined.
I have several suggestions for the authors to consider incorporating into the current text: 
- Although utilizing the expansion dimension is intuitive, it necessitates a strong assumption like condition C1 to hold for every convex set in the underlying space. I speculate that employing the doubling dimension instead might obviate the need for explicitly assuming C1, thereby enhancing the text's readability. Perhaps a note can be added to indicate that bounded doubling dimension also implies the result?
- A brief discussion on the scenario where the input S originates from an underlying distribution could be added.
- The notation '\tilde c' for the expansion constant could be simplified to 'c' (Theorem 3.1).
- I believe the bound in Eq. 4 can be tightened. Shouldn't the ratio in lines 531-532 always be less than 1, potentially leading to a significant improvement in Eq. 14?
Quality: 
The paper presents a systematic exploration of the connection between vector quantization and nearest neighbor search, offering a sound theory and convincing experiments. However, the bound appears to be looser than expected.
Clarity: 
The paper is well-written and clear.
Originality: 
The work is original and innovative.
Significance: 
I consider this work highly significant, as it formalizes the long-standing belief that partition trees with better quantization rates tend to exhibit better nearest neighbor search performance. This research has the potential to encourage formal analysis of other fast nearest neighbor schemes.
Update after author response: 
Thank you for the clarifications. Recently, I came across a relevant COLT2013 paper, "Randomized Partition Trees for Exact Nearest Neighbor Search", which the authors should discuss and compare their results with. The authors have done an excellent job in formalizing the longstanding intuition that partition trees with better quantization rates tend to exhibit better nearest neighbor search performance. A tighter analysis could further improve the bound. The experiments using real data corroborate that the theoretical intuition translates well to practical applications.
