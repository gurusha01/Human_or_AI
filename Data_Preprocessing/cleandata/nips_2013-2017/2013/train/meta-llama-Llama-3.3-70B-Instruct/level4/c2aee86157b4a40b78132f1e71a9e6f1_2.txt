This paper introduces a determinized sparse partially observable tree for online POMDP planning, accompanied by a derived output-sensitive performance bound. This bound suggests that the proposed online approach is effective when a simple policy exists, as it searches a sparsely sampled belief tree to balance policy size and value estimate accuracy. Experimental results indicate that the algorithm scales better than existing online methods.
However, the work appears to be incremental and may not have significant impact, despite being technically sound and well-executed. From an originality standpoint, it seems to be a technical attempt to improve scalability. Unfortunately, this attempt has several limitations. 
Firstly, the proposed regularization does not seem to benefit the RockSample(n,k) scenario, even in mostly deterministic cases. Secondly, the initial lower bound suggested by the authors does not meet the requirements for Theorem 1, and its practical importance is unclear. Thirdly, the algorithm relies on tree search, which is sensitive to the branching factor (i.e., the number of observations), yet this is not theoretically or experimentally addressed. Although the authors mention that "Theorem 1 indicates that R-DESPOT may still perform well when the observation space is large", the phrase "may still" is too vague, and a formal, practical analysis of observation space impact is needed.
Table 1 is unclear, as it is uncertain what the values represent. If they indicate running time, the presence of negative values (e.g., -6.03, -6.19) is puzzling. 
The correct reference for AEMS is ROSS and CHAIB-DRAA (2007), whereas reference [2] provides a general overview of online POMDP approaches. The authors repeatedly state that "the algorithm works well if a simple policy exists", but the meaning of "simple policy" is unclear. What constitutes a simple policy, and what actions should be taken if such a policy does not exist?
Overall, this incremental online POMDP planning approach neglects the branching factor and presents unconvincing experiments, limiting its potential impact.
