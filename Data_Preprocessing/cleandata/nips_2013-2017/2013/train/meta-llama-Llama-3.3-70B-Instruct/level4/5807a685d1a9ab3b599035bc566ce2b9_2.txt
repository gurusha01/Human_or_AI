This manuscript examines the minimax bounds for estimating probabilities while maintaining individual data privacy, specifically under the local privacy constraint. The authors investigate two estimation problems: multinomial and density estimation, deriving sharp minimax rates of convergence for both. Notably, for discrete multinomial estimation, the imposition of local privacy results in a quadratic reduction in effective sample size relative to the privacy parameter alpha, although this reduction may not significantly impact the sample size due to alpha often being a small constant. In contrast, for density estimation, preserving local privacy renders the optimal non-private rate unattainable.
The findings presented are intriguing, with the proofs appearing to be correct based on the review. The derivation of the minimax bound for density estimation under a privacy constraint seems to be a novel contribution, as this specific problem has not been addressed previously to the best of my knowledge.
A key observation is that the minimax bound for multinomial estimation bears a close relationship to prior works on noise complexity in differential privacy, notably the research by Hardt & Talwar ("On the geometry of differential privacy," STOC 2010) and De ("Lower bounds in differential privacy," TCC 2012). These studies explored worst-case lower bounds for the error in linear queries under differential privacy constraints, which shares similarities with the probability estimation problem considered here, including the use of the L_2 metric for error measurement. The primary distinction lies in the type of privacy considered, with this paper focusing on local differential privacy, which imposes stronger constraints than differential privacy. Given that lower bounds for differential privacy also apply to local privacy, it would be enlightening to understand whether the bounds presented for local privacy offer an improvement over previous bounds for differential privacy.
Regarding the density estimation problem, the presentation of the results could be clarified. The statement that the lower bound under local privacy exceeds that of the non-private setting might be misleading without specifying whether the non-private lower bound (equation 13) applies to the general Sobolev space defined in Definition 1 or is restricted to the special case of a trigonometric basis. A fair comparison necessitates that the non-private lower bound pertains to the trigonometric basis scenario.
Further, in response to the rebuttal, while it partially addresses the connection to prior worst-case lower bounds, the work of Nikolov, Talwar, and Zhang ("The Geometry of Differential Privacy: The Sparse and Approximate Cases," STOC 2013), which also considers Mean Square Error, should be acknowledged. Incorporating these explanations and references into the manuscript would enhance its completeness.
In summary, this paper provides interesting results on minimax bounds for probability and density estimation with privacy guarantees, presenting them in a well-structured manner. However, it lacks a comprehensive discussion of existing research on noise complexity lower bounds for differential privacy, which is highly relevant and should be integrated into the paper for a more thorough analysis.
