This manuscript addresses the challenge of demand estimation in multi-heterogeneous agents by proposing a methodology to classify agents and estimate the preferences of each agent type based on their ranking data of various alternatives. The significance of this problem lies in its substantial practical implications for understanding the underlying preference distributions of multiple agents. To address this challenge, the authors employ generalized random utility models (GRUM) and develop RJMCMC algorithms for parameter estimation, while also theoretically establishing the conditions necessary for model identifiability. The effectiveness of the model is demonstrated through experiments conducted on both synthetic and real datasets.
Overall, this paper presents a thorough and rigorous piece of work, offering not only a detailed algorithm for parameter estimation and experimental validation but also a non-trivial theoretical analysis of the conditions required for model identifiability. Upon reviewing the extensive proof, no errors were found, which lends credibility to the work. Although the GRUM model was initially proposed in earlier research at UAI, which somewhat diminishes the novelty of this contribution, the paper's comprehensive approach and rigorous methodology justify its acceptance.
A few minor recommendations for improvement are suggested:
1) The authors should provide a clearer explanation of how their work relates to the original GRUM models, including a discussion of what previous studies have accomplished and what aspects, such as identifiability analysis, require further investigation. This information should be incorporated into the Related Literature section.
2) To further validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, the scope of the experiments could be expanded, as the current settings (e.g., K=4 and L=3, which correspond to the number of features) may not capture sufficient information about the agents and alternatives.
The manuscript investigates a significant problem and proposes a well-founded solution, making it a valuable contribution.
