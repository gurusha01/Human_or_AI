The authors have reformulated the learning of chordal Markov networks into a constraint satisfaction problem. 
This paper is well-structured and clearly written, with the authors demonstrating the efficacy of their approach in determining the optimal structure for certain previously unresolved problems. 
However, it is evident that this method has inherent limitations, primarily due to the exponential increase in propositional variables required, which restricts its scalability to larger examples beyond those currently considered. 
To further enhance the paper, a comparative analysis with existing literature on Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) learning, such as the works of Koivisto and Sood, would be beneficial, given the subset relationship between chordal Markov networks and DAGs. 
Overall, the paper is well-crafted and contributes significantly to the advancement of exact structure learning, with potential for additional insight through comparisons to research on Bayesian Network learning.
