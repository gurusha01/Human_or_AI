This paper presents a multiple model learning framework, which can be viewed as an extension of clustering, where cluster centers are represented by learning models. 
In this approach, each learning model is associated with weighted data, and the average weights across models are constrained to be uniform with an L2 regularization term. 
The incorporation of this regularization term enables the derivation of a straightforward alternating optimization algorithm. 
Additionally, theoretical performance bounds are established, demonstrating the method's robustness to outliers. 
The motivation behind the work is well-articulated, and the theoretical analysis appears to be mathematically rigorous. 
However, it is worth noting that some notation, such as P_delta, is defined in the appendix but not in the main text, so the authors should ensure that the main manuscript is self-contained. 
Since each set of weighted data can be linked to an empirical distribution, it would be beneficial to discuss the properties of the regularization from the perspective of probabilistic mixture models, rather than solely from an optimization standpoint. 
The proposed method, based on L2 regularization of average data weights, offers a novel approach to multiple model learning, and numerical experiments demonstrate its effectiveness and strong performance.
