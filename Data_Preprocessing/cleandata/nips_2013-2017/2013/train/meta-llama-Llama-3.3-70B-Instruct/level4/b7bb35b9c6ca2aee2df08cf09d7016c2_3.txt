This paper presents a novel application of Stale Synchronous Parallel (SSP) computation to machine learning, accompanied by an implementation and a pioneering analysis of its relationship to key machine learning metrics, specifically for Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). The empirical validity of this approach is convincingly demonstrated through comprehensive experiments.
The paper's clarity and readability are commendable, making it a pleasure to review. Overall, I recommend acceptance. However, to further enhance the paper's clarity and positioning within the broader literature, a few suggestions are offered. The primary contribution of this work, in my view, lies not in the suggestion to apply SSP to machine learningâ€”a connection that, while perhaps not previously formalized in academic discourse, has been intuitively recognized by practitioners. Instead, the core contributions are the rigorous execution of this concept and, more critically, the provision of a detailed analysis that bridges systems-level parameters, such as staleness, with fundamental machine learning concepts like learner convergence.
It would be beneficial to allocate more space to this analysis, potentially including additional examples beyond SGD, either within the main text or as an appendix, as the current omission seems to be due to space constraints. 
Additionally, a minor point of clarification is suggested regarding the comparison between SSPtable and Hadoop on page 7, Line 376. The assertion that SSPtable is more general than Hadoop may be considered somewhat simplistic, given that SSPtable is optimized for handling small, incremental updates, whereas Hadoop is capable of managing the aggregation of large objects. Furthermore, Hadoop incorporates a robust shuffle phase, which is not a requirement for SSPtable. Therefore, it might be prudent to temper this statement to maintain the paper's overall precision and excellence. In conclusion, this is an outstanding paper that successfully explores the intersection of SSP and machine learning, with excellent presentation and content, warranting a straightforward acceptance.
