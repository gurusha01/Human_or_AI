This manuscript presents a novel graph-theoretic framework, referred to as b-matching anonymity, which extends the traditional concept of k-anonymity. The authors model the correspondences between records before and after anonymization as a bipartite compatibility graph. If this graph is k-anonymized, it forms a k-regular bipartite graph. Unlike existing k-anonymity approaches, which require k-anonymous records to form fully-connected k-cliques, the proposed b-matching anonymity relaxes this condition, allowing each record to set its anonymity parameter independently based on the desired level of privacy. 
The key contributions of this work include: 
(1) the development of polynomial-time algorithms for finding b-matching anonymized records through the alternating execution of the max-flow algorithm and the minimization of a variational upper bound, 
(2) a characterization of b-matching anonymity against adversaries with limited knowledge of the graph's edges, and 
(3) an empirical evaluation of the utility of the proposed approach. 
The paper is well-structured, with clear explanations of the notions and theorems presented. However, it would be beneficial to discuss the relationship between b-matching anonymity and similar concepts introduced in other studies, such as those presented in [A] and [B]. The characterization of b-matching anonymity against adversaries with background knowledge is a novel contribution that opens up new avenues for research in this field. 
While the paper is technically sound, I question its suitability for the NIPS audience, as its content may be more aligned with the focus of conferences like STOC or FOCS.
