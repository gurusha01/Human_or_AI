This paper presents a novel heuristic criterion for active label acquisition in the context of Gaussian Random Field (GRF) models for semi-supervised classification. The authors demonstrate that the E-optimal criterion effectively minimizes survey risk, as previously described by Garnett et al. The theoretical foundations of this work are particularly noteworthy, exhibiting desirable properties such as sub-modularity, which yields near-optimal guarantees for greedy applications, and suppressor-free conditions. Furthermore, the analysis provides valuable insights, including the use of Cauchy-Schwarz inequality-based arguments, which suggest that the criterion tends to favor graph cluster centers over outliers. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms most alternative approaches. Overall, this is a strong paper that offers sufficient novelty, rigorous theoretical underpinnings, clear explanations, and well-designed experiments, making it a suitable candidate for a top-tier conference like NIPS.
