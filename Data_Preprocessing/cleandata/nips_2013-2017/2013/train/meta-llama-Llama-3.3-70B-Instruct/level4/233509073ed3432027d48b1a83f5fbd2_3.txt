This manuscript proposes a systematic approach to enable structure learning for Structural Equation Models (SEMs) to accommodate data sets that exhibit local independence and identically distributed (i.i.d.) properties, where the underlying models may change over time. The paper is well-structured, clear, and tackles a crucial issue, namely, learning from time-dependent data, which has been overlooked by many widely-used algorithms for structure learning. The techniques presented to extend learning to time-dependent data are straightforward yet effective, as demonstrated by experiments using the PC method.
To further clarify the paper's contributions, two suggestions are proposed. Firstly, the assertion that "any other standard graphical model structure learning algorithms would perform similarly" in the experiments may be too broad. The differences between structure learning methods can be substantial. It would be more accurate to rephrase this statement to specify that the experiments focus on the PC method for time-independent and time-dependent data, and then speculate that similar results might be observed with other methods, or provide a detailed explanation to support this claim.
Secondly, the conclusion discusses the potential challenges of applying these ideas to learn the structure of Bayesian networks due to difficulties in maintaining sufficient statistics. Although this issue is not central to the proposal, it highlights that extending the learning procedure to other models may require more than minor modifications. Therefore, it is recommended that the paper clearly disclose this limitation from the outset, presenting its goal and scope specifically in the context of SEM models, while acknowledging the potential for extension to other models, albeit with additional complexities. In essence, the paper could benefit from a sharper definition of its scope. Overall, this is a well-written paper that presents a simple and implementable formulation for learning the graph structure of SEMs under the assumption of local i.i.d. data, with promising experimental results, albeit currently limited to a comparison using the PC method. The author feedback has been reviewed and considered.
