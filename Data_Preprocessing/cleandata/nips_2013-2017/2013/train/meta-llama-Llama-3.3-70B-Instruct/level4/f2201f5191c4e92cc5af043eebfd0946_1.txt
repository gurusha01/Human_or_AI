A fundamental inquiry in neuroscience pertains to the interplay between network architecture and functionality. However, a significant challenge in establishing this relationship lies in the multi-faceted complexity of neural systems, characterized by nonlinearity, variability, and stochasticity. The current study focuses on networks of spiking neurons that aim to optimally represent time-varying input signals. The performance cost function is comprised of a quadratic error term and a penalty for high activity levels. The authors demonstrate how the intrinsic network dynamics of a spiking neural network can be described as minimizing this cost function, resulting in a so-called balanced state, which is widely regarded as a natural state for biological neuron dynamics. A notable aspect of this formulation is its departure from linear approximations commonly used in the past, thereby providing a more accurate representation of the true dynamics. Within this framework, the authors calculate the firing rates as the solution to a quadratic problem subject to non-negativity constraints on the rates, enabling them to express the solution in closed form as a piece-wise linear function. Furthermore, they relate the types of tuning curves obtained (monotonic or bell-shaped) to the nature of the input and show that optimal performance can be achieved using heterogeneous tuning curves, consistent with observations in biological systems.
Overall, I found this paper to be engaging and insightful, and, in conjunction with reference [13] which addresses synaptic plasticity, it constitutes an original contribution to the understanding of the structure-function relationship.
Specific comments:
1) The form of the energy function E in equation (6) implies that the weight matrix W must be symmetric, as the anti-symmetric component of W does not contribute to the quadratic term. However, equation (7) itself does not appear to necessitate symmetry. The authors should address this discrepancy.
2) Equation (6) suggests that the energy function E must have a minimum at which the derivative of E with respect to the firing rate nu is zero, resulting in a stable state where the membrane potential V is constant. However, it is unclear why this minimum entails Vi = 0 (balanced state) rather than Vi = constant.
3) Typographical error: Line 330, the term $\beta I$ seems to be incomplete, as something appears to be missing.
This paper presents an intriguing motivation for the balanced state in spiking neural networks as a solution to an optimal representation problem, offering an original and insightful contribution to the field.
