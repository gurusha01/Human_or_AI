Here is a paraphrased version of the review:
Response to Rebuttal:
The authors have provided a revised version of Theorem 1, which includes a sufficient condition for signal recovery. The condition states that the population of neurons must be large enough, with a specific bound on the number of neurons (N >= SUMm[(2L1+1)(2L2+1)â€¦(2L{n_m-1} + 1)]). Additionally, the total number of spikes must exceed a certain threshold. While this clarification is helpful, it raises further questions about the potential for synchronized spikes across neurons, which could render the signal uninformative.
The authors also address the concern about filter kernels being identical, stating that even if all filters are the same, signal recovery is still possible if the neurons have distinct parameters (e.g., bias, capacitance, threshold). However, this clarification is not explicitly mentioned in the definition of the IAF-TEM (eqn3 and following), which assumes identical parameters for all neurons.
Review of "Multisensory Encoding, Decoding, and Identification":
The paper presents an extension of Time Encoding Machines (TEM) to the multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) setting, utilizing the framework of Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RHKS). The approach is motivated by neuroscientific principles, highlighting the benefits of multisensory integration and processing. The paper provides necessary conditions for perfect decoding and system identification, demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed algorithms on an audio/video decoding task and an audio/video encoder identification task.
Clarity:
The paper is generally well-written, although the notation in section 3 is cumbersome. However, it is unclear whether this could be improved without compromising the technical content.
Originality:
The paper's most significant contribution is the extension of TEMs to the MIMO setting. While the connection to brain function is intriguing, it remains tenuous.
Quality:
Some aspects of the paper require improvement before publication. Specifically, Theorem 1 needs further clarification, and the assumption of identical neuron parameters in the IAF-TEM definition should be addressed.
Significance:
From a technical perspective, the paper demonstrates the potential of TEMs for multi-modal encoding, which may have applications in decoding and neuroscience. However, the contribution to neural coding is limited to the introductory motivation, and the claim of being the first tractable computational model for multisensory integration is incorrect.
Detailed Comments:
* Line 100: "bandlmited" should be corrected to "bandlimited".
* Line 137: The complex unit "j" should be defined.
* Line 144: The notation for un in eqn.(1) and un^i in figure 1 should be clarified to avoid confusion.
* Line 166: The term "BIBO-stable" should be defined, and the concept of spatio-temporal support for video filters in example 2 should be clarified.
* Line 177: The filter coefficients h{l1 \ldots l_n} should be explicitly connected to Theorem 1.
* Line 182: The term "IAF" should be defined as "integrate and fire", and the index k in eqn. 3 should be clarified as the spike index.
* Line 185: A brief introduction to IAF-TEMs would be helpful, as the paper transitions from continuous signals to spikes.
* Line 195-195: The statement "Then there exists a number N ... can be perfectly recovered" appears to be a sufficient condition, but the proof only shows a necessary condition, leaving Theorem 1 unproven.
* Figures 1, 2, and 4: The purpose of the variables v_i should be clarified, as they are not mentioned elsewhere in the paper.
* Section 5: The examples are instructive, but using real video and audio data would strengthen the connection to neuroscience and demonstrate the approach's effectiveness on relevant datasets.
* Line 417: The claim of being the first tractable computational model for multisensory integration is incorrect and should be removed.
Overall, the extension of TEMs to the MIMO setting may be of interest for technical applications and decoding in neuroscience. However, Theorem 1 requires further clarification, and the paper's contribution to neural coding is limited.
