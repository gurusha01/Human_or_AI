This paper presents a novel statistical approach to integrate sequentially imaged sets of neurons, effectively increasing the population size for characterizing population dynamics beyond the limitations of simultaneous imaging. By applying this method to both simulated and experimental calcium imaging data in mice, the authors demonstrate the ability to estimate correlations in variability across two non-simultaneously imaged populations. 
The authors formulate the problem as fitting a latent dynamical system with missing observations, utilizing a simple linear Gaussian system with four defined parameters: a functional coupling matrix, a stimuli receptive fields' matrix, and two covariance matrices for neural and measurement noise. These parameters are estimated from experimental data using a variant of the standard EM algorithm.
In terms of quality, the model performs well on simulated data with non-overlapping populations, but requires a certain level of overlap between populations when applied to real data to yield reasonable results. It is notable that overlap was not necessary in the simulated data example, raising questions about the underlying differences. Additionally, the authors do not address the significant discrepancy in correlation values between the simulated data (Figure 2c) and real data (Figure 3b) results. A key strength of the model is its ability to recover pairwise correlations between non-simultaneously measured neuron pairs.
The paper is well-written, although figure legends lack descriptive detail, and the accompanying text in the body of the paper could provide more elaboration on the figures. 
In terms of originality, the authors cite several studies that have addressed inferring functional connectivity from 2-photon imaging data or electrophysiological measurements. However, these works do not focus on inferring functional connections between non-simultaneously imaged neurons, highlighting the novelty of the present approach.
The significance of this work lies in its potential to overcome fundamental limits on the number of neurons that can be simultaneously imaged, thereby expanding our capabilities to reveal neural computation at the circuit level. Overall, this is a strong model paper that leverages a relatively simple linear dynamics model to capture measures that are otherwise difficult to obtain.
