This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of game theory and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithms. The authors introduce a general template for MCTS algorithms in zero-sum extensive-form games with perfect information and simultaneous moves, which can be instantiated using various selection methods. They formally prove that if the selection method is -Hannan consistent and satisfies additional requirements on exploration, the MCTS algorithm eventually converges to an approximate Nash equilibrium (NE) of the extensive-form game.
The paper is well-structured, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, followed by a detailed description of the MCTS algorithm and its variants. The formal analysis is rigorous and well-presented, and the authors provide a thorough discussion of the results and their implications.
The experimental evaluation is also well-designed and provides valuable insights into the performance of the algorithms. The authors compare the convergence rates of different variants of the MCTS algorithm and show that the algorithms converge to an approximate NE of the game.
The paper has several strengths, including:
* The introduction of a general template for MCTS algorithms in zero-sum extensive-form games with perfect information and simultaneous moves.
* The formal proof of convergence to an approximate NE of the extensive-form game.
* The experimental evaluation of the algorithms and the comparison of their convergence rates.
However, the paper also has some weaknesses, including:
* The lack of clarity in some of the notation and definitions, which may make it difficult for non-experts to follow the paper.
* The limited scope of the paper, which focuses on zero-sum extensive-form games with perfect information and simultaneous moves.
* The absence of finite-time convergence bounds for the algorithms, which is an important open problem in the field.
Overall, the paper is well-written and provides a significant contribution to the field of game theory and MCTS algorithms. The authors demonstrate a deep understanding of the subject matter and provide a thorough analysis of the results.
