This paper introduces novel models for representing joint distributions over integer-count variables, addressing the limitations of existing Poisson graphical models that can only model negative correlations. The authors propose three approaches: the Truncated Poisson Graphical Model (TPGM), the Quadratic Poisson Graphical Model (QPGM), and the Sublinear Poisson Graphical Model (SPGM). These models can capture both positive and negative conditional dependencies between count-valued variables.
The paper is well-written, and the results are significant. The authors provide a thorough introduction to the background and motivation of the problem, and the technical sections are clear and well-organized. The experimental results on both synthetic and real data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed models.
The TPGM approach truncates the Poisson distribution, allowing for both positive and negative dependencies, but has limitations on the domain of the variables and the types of dependencies that can be modeled. The QPGM approach modifies the base measure of the Poisson density to scale quadratically, permitting both positive and negative edge-parameters, but has a Gaussian-esque thin tail. The SPGM approach uses sub-linear sufficient statistics, allowing for heavier tails and a broader set of feasible pairwise parameters.
The paper has several strengths. Firstly, it addresses a significant limitation of existing Poisson graphical models, which can only model negative correlations. Secondly, the proposed models are well-motivated and theoretically sound. Thirdly, the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed models in recovering network structures from count-valued data.
However, there are some concerns and minor errors. The truncation approach in TPGM may not be suitable for all types of count data, and the QPGM approach may not be suitable for data with heavy tails. There is a typo in "graphical mode distributions" (should be "graphical model distributions"). Additionally, some sentences could be rephrased for clarity, such as the sentence on page 5.
In terms of the conference guidelines, this paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, originality, and significance. The paper is technically sound, well-written, and provides significant contributions to the field of graphical models for count data. The results are important and can be used to build on existing work in the field.
