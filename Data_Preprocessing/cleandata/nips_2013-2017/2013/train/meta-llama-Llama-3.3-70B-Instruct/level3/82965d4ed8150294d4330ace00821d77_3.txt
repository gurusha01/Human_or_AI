This paper proposes methods to improve the scalability of symbolic planning under uncertainty with factored states and actions. The authors introduce two main contributions: Factored Action Modified Policy Iteration (FA-MPI) and Opportunistic Policy Iteration (OPI). FA-MPI conducts exact policy evaluation steps by treating the policy as a constraint on normal Bellman backups, while OPI addresses the issue of large space requirements by enforcing the policy constraint opportunistically, only when it does not increase the size of the value function representation.
The paper tackles an important problem in the field of planning under uncertainty and provides a clear and well-organized presentation of the ideas. The use of algebraic decision diagrams (ADDs) to represent the value function and policy is a key aspect of the approach, allowing for compact and efficient computation. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, particularly OPI, in scaling to large action spaces and improving over state-of-the-art algorithms.
However, the paper's novelty is somewhat diminished by the fact that similar ideas and methods have been presented in previous work, such as references [1], [2], and [3]. The authors could have done a better job of clearly differentiating their work from existing research and highlighting the unique contributions of their approach.
The paper has several strengths, including its simplicity, the promise to publish source code, and the tackling of an important problem. However, it also has some weaknesses, such as the incremental nature of the work, confusing experiments, and a lack of clarity on implementation details. To increase the paper's significance and novelty, the authors should provide more explicit information on implementation details, estimate the importance of each approximation 'trick', and compare their work with related references.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, and significance. The technical soundness of the paper is good, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The paper is clearly written and well-organized, making it easy to follow and understand. The results are important and have the potential to be used by other researchers and practitioners in the field.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, but with some revisions to address the issues mentioned above. The authors should provide more context and comparison to existing work, clarify the implementation details, and highlight the unique contributions of their approach.
