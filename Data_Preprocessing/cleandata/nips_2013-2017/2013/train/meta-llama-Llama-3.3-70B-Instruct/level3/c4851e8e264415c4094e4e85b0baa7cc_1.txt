This paper proposes a novel approach to speed up object detection by approximating the scoring function using Vector Quantization (VQ). The authors demonstrate that their method can achieve a substantial speedup over existing state-of-the-art methods without sacrificing accuracy. The key idea is to quantize the feature vectors in each cell of the HOG feature pyramid into a set of clusters, and then use a lookup table to approximate the dot product between the template and the feature vector.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of their approach. The experimental results are impressive, with the proposed method achieving a speedup of up to two orders of magnitude over existing methods on the PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset. The authors also provide a thorough analysis of the computation cost and demonstrate that their method can be used to speed up both deformable part models and exemplar SVM detectors.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposed method is simple and efficient, making it easy to implement and integrate into existing object detection systems.
* The experimental results are comprehensive and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on a variety of datasets and detection algorithms.
* The authors provide a detailed analysis of the computation cost and demonstrate that their method can be used to speed up both deformable part models and exemplar SVM detectors.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The proposed method relies on the quality of the clustering, and the choice of the number of clusters (c) can affect the performance of the method.
* The method may not be suitable for detection tasks that require high accuracy, as the approximation of the scoring function may introduce some errors.
* The authors do not provide a comparison with other speedup techniques, such as cascade detection or transform methods, which could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed method.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the proposed method is efficient and effective. However, further research is needed to fully understand the limitations and potential applications of the method.
