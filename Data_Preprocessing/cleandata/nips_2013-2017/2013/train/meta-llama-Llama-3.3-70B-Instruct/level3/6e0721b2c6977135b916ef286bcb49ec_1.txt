This paper introduces a novel technique for reducing the number of parameters in deep neural networks by exploiting the structure in the weight matrices. The authors propose a method for predicting the weights of a network using a low-rank approximation of the weight matrix, which is achieved by representing the weight matrix as the product of two smaller matrices. The key to this approach is the careful construction of one of the factors, which is used to predict the remaining weights.
The paper is well-written, with clear explanations of the assumptions and implications of the proposed technique. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the method, including a discussion of the relationships between the different components of the weight matrix and the implications of the low-rank approximation. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the technique, with significant reductions in the number of parameters achieved without a substantial drop in accuracy.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to provide a clear and concise explanation of the proposed technique, making it easy to understand and follow. The authors also provide a thorough discussion of the related work, highlighting the differences between their approach and other methods for reducing the number of parameters in neural networks.
However, there are some minor issues with the paper, including some confusing equation notation and unclear derivations. Additionally, some of the plots could be improved for better visibility. The proof outline section is also difficult to follow, lacking clarity on the proof being outlined and the relationships between lemmas.
