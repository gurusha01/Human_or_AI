This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of game theory and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithms. The authors provide a general template for MCTS algorithms in zero-sum extensive-form games with perfect information and simultaneous moves, and formally prove that if the algorithm uses an -Hannan consistent selection function, it eventually converges to a subgame perfect -Nash equilibrium of the extensive form game.
The paper is well-structured and clearly written, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments. The introduction provides a thorough background on the topic, and the definitions and notation are well-explained. The formal analysis is rigorous and well-presented, and the empirical evaluation provides valuable insights into the performance of the algorithms.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The provision of a general template for MCTS algorithms in zero-sum extensive-form games with perfect information and simultaneous moves.
* The formal proof of convergence to a subgame perfect -Nash equilibrium, which is a significant contribution to the field.
* The empirical evaluation, which provides valuable insights into the performance of the algorithms and demonstrates their effectiveness in practice.
However, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement:
* The paper assumes that the reader is familiar with game theory and MCTS algorithms, which may make it difficult for non-experts to follow.
* The notation and definitions are sometimes dense and require careful reading to understand.
* The empirical evaluation could be more comprehensive, with more experiments and comparisons to other algorithms.
Overall, the paper is well-written and provides a significant contribution to the field. The authors demonstrate a deep understanding of the topic and provide a thorough analysis of the algorithms. The paper is suitable for publication in a top-tier conference, and the results have the potential to be widely cited and influential in the field.
