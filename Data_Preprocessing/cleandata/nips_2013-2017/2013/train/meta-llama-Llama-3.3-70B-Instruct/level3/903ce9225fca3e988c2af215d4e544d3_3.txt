This paper explores the problem of learning half-spaces over 3 sparse input and presents a significant gap between statistical and computational complexity in learning. The authors demonstrate that while a sample complexity of n/eps^2 is information-theoretically achievable, it is not efficiently learnable. Furthermore, they prove a hardness result for improper learning, showing that it is not possible to efficiently learn using order n^{1+mu}/eps^2 samples under a stronger hardness assumption.
On the positive side, the authors show that half-spaces can be efficiently learned with a sample size of n^2/eps^2, highlighting a gap between statistical and computational complexity. However, the paper leaves open the question of extending the positive result to learning H{n,k}, and whether it is possible to extend a key lemma to deal with H{n,k} with a dependence on k.
The paper is well-written and insightful, providing a new hardness result for improper learning without using usual cryptographic hardness assumptions. The authors' approach is novel and contributes to the understanding of the complexity of learning half-spaces. The paper's strengths include its technical soundness, clarity, and originality. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the problem and present their results in a clear and concise manner.
The weaknesses of the paper are limited, but one potential area for improvement is the extension of the positive result to learning H_{n,k}. Additionally, the authors could provide more context and discussion on the implications of their results and how they relate to previous work in the field.
Overall, the paper is a worthwhile publication, and its contributions to the field of machine learning and computational complexity are significant. The arguments in favor of acceptance include:
* The paper presents a novel and significant result in the field of learning half-spaces
* The authors provide a thorough and technical analysis of the problem
* The paper is well-written and clear, making it accessible to a wide range of readers
* The results have implications for the understanding of the complexity of learning half-spaces and related problems
The arguments against acceptance are limited, but include:
* The paper leaves open the question of extending the positive result to learning H_{n,k}
* The authors could provide more context and discussion on the implications of their results and how they relate to previous work in the field.
However, these weaknesses do not outweigh the paper's strengths, and it is recommended that the paper be accepted for publication.
