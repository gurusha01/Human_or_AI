This paper introduces a new theory for reducing sample complexity in transductive multi-label learning using side information, demonstrating its effectiveness through experiments. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the problem, including a proof that assumes orthonormal matrices A and B. However, it is suggested that the results should be clarified for non-orthogonal matrices and potentially simplified using linear combinations of column vectors.
The paper also presents an unconstrained optimization problem similar to one previously solved, and it is recommended that the algorithm be compared to existing solutions. Additionally, recent efforts to address performance issues are mentioned, but it is noted that some papers provide efficient algorithms with convergence guarantees, contradicting the claim of losing performance guarantees.
A typo is found in the proof of Lemma 1 in the supplementary material, where a perpendicular symbol is missing in the equation. Furthermore, the authors' results on sample complexity for matrix completion should be compared to existing work, such as Bach (2008), which analyzed a similar problem.
The paper's strengths include its novel approach to reducing sample complexity and its thorough analysis of the problem. However, its weaknesses include the need for clarification on non-orthogonal matrices and the comparison to existing solutions.
