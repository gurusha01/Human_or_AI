This paper presents a novel approach to reducing the number of parameters in deep neural networks by exploiting the structure of the weights and using kernel ridge regression for parameter interpolation. The authors propose a general framework for predicting parameters in deep models, which can be applied to various architectures, including multilayer perceptrons, convolutional networks, and reconstruction ICA.
The paper is well-written, and the ideas are original and interesting. The authors provide a clear motivation for their approach, discussing the limitations of current methods for reducing parameters in deep networks. They also provide a detailed explanation of their technique, including the use of kernel ridge regression and the construction of dictionaries for feature prediction.
The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, showing that it can achieve significant reductions in the number of dynamic parameters without sacrificing performance. The results are impressive, with the authors able to predict more than 95% of the parameters in some cases.
However, the experiments are limited to small image datasets with simple patterns, which makes it difficult to assess the method's effectiveness on more realistic datasets like ImageNet. Additionally, the authors claim that their approach is general and can be applied to non-image tasks, but they provide limited experimental evidence to support this claim.
The strengths of the paper include its originality, clarity, and the potential impact of the proposed approach on the field of deep learning. The weaknesses include the limited scope of the experiments and the lack of comparison to other state-of-the-art methods for reducing parameters in deep networks.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper presents a novel and interesting approach to reducing parameters in deep neural networks.
* The authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of their technique.
* The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The experiments are limited to small image datasets with simple patterns.
* The authors provide limited experimental evidence to support their claim that the approach is general and can be applied to non-image tasks.
* The paper lacks comparison to other state-of-the-art methods for reducing parameters in deep networks.
Overall, I believe that the paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of deep learning, but the authors need to provide more comprehensive experimental results and comparisons to other state-of-the-art methods to fully demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach.
