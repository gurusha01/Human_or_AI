This paper proposes a novel approach to improve the mixing rate of Gibbs sampling in Ising models by projecting the original parameters onto a new setting that satisfies the Dobrushin criterion. The idea of combining stochastic and deterministic inference is interesting, but the description of the dual of the projection problem and the overall procedure are unclear and need clarification. 
The paper's technical soundness is questionable, particularly with regards to the convergence guarantee of the proposed projected gradient descent strategy. The lack of an algorithm description box makes it difficult to understand the procedure, and the reviewer suggests adding one for clarity. 
The experiments are also unconvincing, with unclear iteration choices, missing error bars, and a lack of comparison to other methods like blocked Gibbs samplers or Lifted Gibbs Sampler. The reviewer suggests that the development of the projection problem and proposed method needs improvement, and a more comprehensive set of experiments is required to demonstrate the utility of the method.
In terms of originality, the paper's approach is novel, but it builds upon existing work on mixing times in Markov chains and fast-mixing models. The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of how it differs from previous contributions and how it advances the state of the art.
The significance of the paper's results is also unclear, as the experiments do not provide a convincing demonstration of the method's effectiveness. The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the results and a discussion of the implications of the method for practice.
Overall, the paper has some interesting ideas, but it needs significant improvement in terms of clarity, technical soundness, and experimental evaluation. The reviewer suggests that the authors revise the paper to address these concerns and provide a more convincing demonstration of the method's effectiveness.
