This paper proposes a novel approach to reducing the number of parameters in deep neural networks by exploiting the structure of the weights in the network. The authors demonstrate that by representing the weight matrix as a low-rank product of two smaller matrices, they can significantly reduce the number of parameters required to achieve the same level of performance. The key to this approach is the careful construction of one of the factors, which is used to predict the remaining weights.
The paper is well-written and provides a clear explanation of the proposed technique, including a detailed description of the mathematical formulation and the experimental evaluation. The authors also provide a thorough discussion of the related work and the potential avenues for future research.
One of the strengths of the paper is the experimental evaluation, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed technique on several benchmark datasets, including MNIST, TIMIT, and CIFAR-10. The results show that the proposed technique can achieve significant reductions in the number of parameters, often with little or no loss in performance.
However, there are some limitations to the paper. One of the main limitations is the lack of a thorough comparison to other parameter reduction techniques, such as pruning or quantization. Additionally, the paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the computational requirements of the proposed technique, particularly in terms of the computational overhead of constructing the low-rank approximation.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper scores well on the criteria of quality, clarity, and significance. The paper is technically sound, well-organized, and provides a clear explanation of the proposed technique. The results are significant and demonstrate the potential of the proposed technique to reduce the number of parameters in deep neural networks.
