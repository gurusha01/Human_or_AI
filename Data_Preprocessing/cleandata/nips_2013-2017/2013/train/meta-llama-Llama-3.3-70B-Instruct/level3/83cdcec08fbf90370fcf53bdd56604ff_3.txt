This paper, "Distributed Submodular Maximization: Identifying Representative Elements in Massive Data Sets", presents a novel approach to solving submodular maximization problems in a distributed manner. The authors propose a two-stage protocol, GREEDI, which is designed to work with MapReduce-style computations and can be easily implemented in parallel computing architectures.
The paper addresses the problem of maximizing a submodular function subject to cardinality constraints, which is a common problem in machine learning and data mining. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the performance of their approach, including theoretical guarantees and experimental results on several applications, including exemplar-based clustering and active set selection.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposed approach, GREEDI, is simple, efficient, and scalable, making it suitable for large-scale data sets.
* The authors provide a thorough theoretical analysis of the performance of GREEDI, including bounds on the approximation ratio and the running time.
* The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of GREEDI in practice, showing that it outperforms other distributed benchmarks and can scale to very large data sets.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The analysis of GREEDI assumes that the submodular function is monotone, which may not always be the case in practice.
* The authors do not provide a detailed comparison with other distributed submodular maximization algorithms, which would be useful for understanding the relative strengths and weaknesses of GREEDI.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise presentation of their approach and results. The paper makes a significant contribution to the field of distributed optimization and has the potential to impact a wide range of applications in machine learning and data mining.
