This paper presents a novel approach to understanding the relationship between network structure and function in neuroscience, specifically in networks of spiking neurons that attempt to optimally represent time-varying input signals. The authors describe the natural network dynamics as minimizing a cost function, leading to a balanced state, which is a natural state for biological neuron dynamics, without relying on linear approximations. This is a significant contribution to the field, as it provides a new perspective on the structure-function relationship in neural networks.
The authors compute firing rates as the solution of a quadratic problem, allowing them to express the solution in closed form as a piece-wise linear function, and relate tuning curves to the nature of the input. This is a major strength of the paper, as it provides a clear and concise framework for understanding the complex relationships between firing rates, input, and connectivity.
The paper is considered an original contribution to the structure-function relationship, particularly when combined with another reference that deals with synaptic plasticity. The authors' approach is well-motivated and well-executed, and the results are interesting and insightful, motivating the balanced state in spiking neural networks as a solution to an optimal representation problem.
However, there are some specific comments that need to be addressed. For example, the symmetry of the weight matrix is assumed, but it is not clear how this assumption affects the results. Additionally, the derivation of the balanced state could be more clearly explained, and there is a typo in equation 6. Despite these minor issues, the paper is well-written and easy to follow, making it accessible to a broad audience.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, originality, and significance.
