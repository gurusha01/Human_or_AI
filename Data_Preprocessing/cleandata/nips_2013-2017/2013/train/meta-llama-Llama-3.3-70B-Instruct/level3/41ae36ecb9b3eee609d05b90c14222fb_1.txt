This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of machine learning by establishing the linear convergence of the proximal gradient method (PGM) for solving trace-norm regularized problems. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the convergence rate of the PGM, which is a popular method for solving such problems. The paper's main result shows that the PGM achieves a linear convergence rate for a large class of loss functions, without requiring strong convexity.
The paper is well-organized, and the authors provide a clear and concise presentation of the proofs. The introduction provides a good overview of the problem and its significance in machine learning. The authors also provide a detailed discussion of the related work and the contributions of their paper.
One of the strengths of the paper is the development of a new Lipschitzian error bound for trace-norm regularized problems. This error bound is a key ingredient in the proof of the linear convergence result and may be of independent interest.
The numerical experiments presented in the paper demonstrate the effectiveness of the PGM in practice. The authors provide results for two problems: matrix completion and matrix classification. The results show that the PGM achieves a linear convergence rate in both cases, which is consistent with the theoretical analysis.
However, there are a few areas where the paper could be improved. Firstly, the authors could provide more numerical examples to illustrate the linear convergence of the PGM. Additionally, the paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the implications of the linear convergence result for machine learning applications.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets all the criteria. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise presentation of the results. The paper is also well-organized, and the authors provide a good overview of the problem and its significance in machine learning.
