This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of graphical models for count data, addressing a major limitation of existing Poisson graphical models. The authors propose three novel approaches to model count-valued variables, allowing for both positive and negative conditional dependencies. The paper is well-organized, and the ideas are clearly presented, making it easy to follow and comprehend.
The strengths of the paper include:
1. Theoretical contributions: The authors provide a thorough analysis of the limitations of existing Poisson graphical models and propose novel solutions to address these limitations. The theoretical results are sound, and the proofs are well-presented.
2. Novel approaches: The three proposed approaches, Truncated Poisson Graphical Model (TPGM), Quadratic Poisson Graphical Model (QPGM), and Sublinear Poisson Graphical Model (SPGM), offer new perspectives on modeling count data.
3. Empirical evaluation: The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approaches through simulation studies and a case study on breast cancer microRNA networks.
However, there are some weaknesses:
1. Limited experimental evaluation: While the simulation studies and case study provide some evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed approaches, more comprehensive experiments would strengthen the paper.
2. Lack of comparison to other methods: The authors could have compared their approaches to other existing methods for modeling count data, such as log-linear models or copula-based approaches.
3. Some notation and terminology: A few notation and terminology choices, such as the use of "W" for the domain of the variables, may be unclear to some readers.
In terms of originality, the paper presents novel approaches to modeling count data, which is a significant contribution to the field. The significance of the paper lies in its ability to address a major limitation of existing Poisson graphical models, making it a valuable contribution to the field of graphical models.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, as it presents significant theoretical and practical contributions to the field of graphical models for count data. However, I suggest that the authors address the weaknesses mentioned above, particularly by providing more comprehensive experimental evaluations and comparisons to other methods.
