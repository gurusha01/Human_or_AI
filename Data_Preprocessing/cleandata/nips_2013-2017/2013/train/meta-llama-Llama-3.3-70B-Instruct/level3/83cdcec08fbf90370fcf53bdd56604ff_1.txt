This paper introduces a novel distributed protocol, GREEDI, for maximizing submodular functions subject to cardinality constraints. The authors provide a thorough theoretical analysis of the protocol's performance, demonstrating its ability to achieve solutions competitive with the centralized greedy solution under certain natural conditions. The paper is well-organized and clearly written, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments and understand the significance of their contributions.
The strengths of the paper include its innovative approach to distributed submodular maximization, its thorough theoretical analysis, and its extensive experimental evaluation using Hadoop. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of GREEDI on several applications, including exemplar-based clustering and active set selection, and show that it can scale well to very large datasets.
One weakness of the paper is the lack of comparison with similar notions introduced in other papers, such as [A] and [B]. This comparison would provide a more comprehensive understanding of GREEDI and its place within the broader literature on submodular optimization.
The characterization of GREEDI's performance against adversaries with background knowledge is a significant contribution, opening up a new area of research in the field. The authors' use of geometric structure to prove stronger results is also noteworthy, as it highlights the importance of considering the underlying structure of the data when designing distributed algorithms.
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The paper introduces a novel and effective distributed protocol for submodular maximization.
* The theoretical analysis is thorough and well-supported by experimental results.
* The paper demonstrates the scalability of GREEDI on very large datasets.
* The characterization of GREEDI's performance against adversaries with background knowledge is a significant contribution.
Arguments con acceptance:
* The paper lacks comparison with similar notions introduced in other papers.
* The experimental evaluation, while extensive, may not be comprehensive enough to fully demonstrate the effectiveness of GREEDI in all possible scenarios.
Overall, I believe that the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of submodular optimization and distributed algorithms, and I recommend acceptance. However, I suggest that the authors consider addressing the weaknesses mentioned above in a future revision.
