This paper proposes a distributed stochastic dual coordinate ascent (DisDCA) algorithm for solving regularized loss minimization problems in a distributed framework. The algorithm is designed to take advantage of the computational power of multiple machines or cores to optimize the problem in a parallel fashion. The paper provides a thorough analysis of the tradeoff between computation and communication, and presents a practical variant of the algorithm that enjoys substantial improvements over the basic variant.
The paper is well-written and clearly organized, making it easy to follow and understand. The authors provide a detailed introduction to the problem, related work, and the proposed algorithm, as well as a thorough analysis of the convergence rates and tradeoff between computation and communication. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and its competitiveness with other distributed algorithms.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel distributed algorithm that combines the strengths of stochastic dual coordinate ascent and distributed optimization.
* A thorough analysis of the tradeoff between computation and communication, which provides valuable insights into the design of distributed algorithms.
* The presentation of a practical variant of the algorithm that enjoys substantial improvements over the basic variant.
* The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and its competitiveness with other distributed algorithms.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes that the loss function is convex and the regularization term is strongly convex, which may not be the case in all scenarios.
* The analysis of the tradeoff between computation and communication is based on a simplified model, which may not capture all the complexities of real-world distributed systems.
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with other distributed algorithms, including a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of each approach.
Overall, the paper is of high quality and makes a significant contribution to the field of distributed optimization. The proposed algorithm and analysis provide valuable insights into the design of distributed algorithms and have the potential to impact a wide range of applications.
