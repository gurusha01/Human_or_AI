This paper presents a novel approach to interactive reinforcement learning, where human feedback is interpreted directly as policy labels. The method is sound and well-based on existing literature, making it a significant contribution to the field. The paper's strongest point is its simplicity, requiring fewer meta-parameters and performing better or equal to state-of-the-art approaches. This simplicity makes it an interesting method, and its ability to outperform or match existing methods is a notable achievement.
However, the paper also has some weaknesses. The use of easy benchmarks and the lack of significant theoretical innovation compared to state-of-the-art methods are notable limitations. Despite these weaknesses, the reviewer tends to suggest acceptance of the paper due to its interesting idea and compelling method.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of the work. The paper is clearly written, well-organized, and adequately informs the reader.
The originality of the paper lies in its novel approach to interactive reinforcement learning. While the problems and approaches are not entirely new, the paper presents a unique combination of familiar techniques. The related work is adequately referenced, and the paper clearly differs from previous contributions.
The significance of the paper lies in its potential to improve the state of the art in interactive reinforcement learning. The results are important, and other researchers or practitioners are likely to use these ideas or build on them. The paper addresses a difficult problem in a better way than previous research and provides a unique theoretical or pragmatic approach.
Minor issues with the paper include formatting and readability problems, such as small tables and figures, and some grammatical errors that need to be rephrased. However, these issues do not detract from the overall quality of the paper.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of interactive reinforcement learning, and its simplicity, technical soundness, and potential impact make it a valuable addition to the conference. The reviewer recommends acceptance of the paper, pending minor revisions to address the formatting and readability issues.
