This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of symbolic dynamic programming for Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with factored state and action spaces. The authors introduce two novel algorithms, Factored Action Modified Policy Iteration (FA-MPI) and Opportunistic Policy Iteration (OPI), which improve upon existing state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of scalability.
The paper is well-organized and clearly written, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments and understand the technical details. The introduction provides a thorough background on the problem of symbolic dynamic programming and motivates the need for new algorithms that can handle large action spaces. The authors also provide a clear explanation of the key concepts and techniques used in the paper, such as Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) and algebraic decision diagrams (ADDs).
The technical contributions of the paper are significant. FA-MPI is a novel algorithm that uses a new form of policy backup, which avoids enumerating all actions and instead uses a BDD representation of the policy. OPI is an extension of FA-MPI that uses a pruning procedure to reduce the size of the value function representation, making it more efficient in practice. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the algorithms, including proofs of convergence and bounds on the size of the value function representation.
The experimental results are also impressive, demonstrating the scalability of OPI and its ability to outperform existing algorithms on several benchmark domains. The authors provide a detailed comparison of OPI with other algorithms, including symbolic value iteration and factored action regression, and show that OPI achieves significant speedups and improved scalability.
One of the strengths of the paper is its clarity and organization. The authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem and the key concepts, making it easy for readers to understand the technical details. The paper is also well-structured, with each section building on the previous one to provide a clear and logical flow of ideas.
However, there are a few areas where the paper could be improved. One potential weakness is the lack of comparison with other related work, such as asynchronous policy iteration. The authors mention this algorithm briefly, but do not provide a detailed comparison or analysis of its relationship to OPI. Additionally, the paper could benefit from more discussion of the potential limitations and challenges of the algorithms, such as the growth of the value and policy diagrams with problem complexity.
Overall, this paper presents a significant contribution to the field of symbolic dynamic programming and provides a thorough and well-organized presentation of the technical details. The experimental results are impressive, and the paper provides a clear and concise introduction to the problem and the key concepts. With some minor revisions to address the potential weaknesses, this paper has the potential to make a significant impact in the field.
