This paper presents a novel approach to speeding up object detection algorithms by approximating template evaluation using Vector Quantization (VQ). The authors propose a method that achieves a substantial end-to-end speedup over existing methods without loss of accuracy. The key idea is to quantize the feature vectors in each cell of the HOG feature pyramid into a fixed number of clusters, and then use a lookup table to approximate the dot product between the template and the feature vector.
The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with a clear explanation of the methodology and experimental results. The authors provide a thorough review of previous work in the area and demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on two well-known object detection algorithms: deformable part models and exemplar SVM detectors.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposed method is simple and efficient, with a significant speedup over existing methods.
* The authors provide a thorough evaluation of their approach on a standard benchmark dataset (PASCAL VOC 2007).
* The implementation of the method is available online, making it easy for others to reproduce the results.
However, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement:
* The paper lacks details on how to choose the number of clusters (c) for the Vector Quantization, which is a crucial parameter that affects the trade-off between speed and accuracy.
* The authors do not provide a clear explanation of how the lookup table is constructed and how the dot product is approximated.
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the computational cost of the proposed method and how it compares to existing methods.
* The authors mention that the method can be used for other computer vision tasks, but they do not provide any experimental results or analysis to support this claim.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of object detection and has the potential to be useful for a wide range of applications. However, the authors need to address the weaknesses and areas for improvement mentioned above to make the paper more complete and convincing.
