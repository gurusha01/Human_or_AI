This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of game theory and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithms. The authors provide a formal analysis of the convergence of MCTS algorithms in zero-sum extensive-form games with perfect information and simultaneous moves. They prove that any -Hannan consistent algorithm can be used to create a MCTS algorithm that provably converges to an approximate Nash equilibrium of the game.
The paper is well-structured and clearly written, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments. The introduction provides a thorough background on the topic, and the definitions and notation are well-explained. The formal analysis is rigorous and convincing, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the proof techniques used.
The empirical evaluation of the algorithms is also well-done, and the results are interesting. The authors show that the algorithms converge to an approximate Nash equilibrium, and they provide a comparison of the convergence rates of different variants of the algorithm.
One of the strengths of the paper is its clarity and readability. The authors have done an excellent job of explaining complex concepts in a clear and concise manner, making the paper accessible to a wide range of readers. The paper is also well-organized, with a clear structure and a logical flow of ideas.
However, there are some areas where the paper could be improved. One potential concern is the novelty of the proof technique. While the authors provide a clear and convincing proof, it is not entirely clear how novel the technique is. The authors could provide more context and comparison to existing work in the field to help clarify the significance of their contribution.
Another potential area for improvement is the analysis of the UCB algorithm. The authors mention that UCB is a widely used algorithm, but they do not provide a detailed analysis of its convergence properties. Adding such an analysis could strengthen the paper and provide a more complete picture of the convergence properties of different MCTS algorithms.
In terms of significance, the paper makes an important contribution to the field of game theory and MCTS algorithms. The authors' results provide a rigorous foundation for the use of MCTS algorithms in zero-sum extensive-form games, and their empirical evaluation provides valuable insights into the performance of different variants of the algorithm.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication. The authors have made a significant contribution to the field, and their paper is well-written and clear. With some minor revisions to address the concerns mentioned above, the paper has the potential to be a valuable addition to the literature on game theory and MCTS algorithms.
