This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between the vector quantization performance of binary space-partitioning (BSP) trees and their nearest-neighbor search performance. The authors establish a theoretical connection between the two, showing that BSP-trees with better vector quantization performance have better search performance guarantees. They also demonstrate that large margin partitions in the tree can improve search performance.
The paper is well-written and easy to follow, making it a pleasure to read and review. The authors provide comprehensive experiments that validate their approach, using various datasets and comparing the performance of different BSP-trees. The main contribution of the paper is not just suggesting the use of BSP-trees for machine learning, but rather providing a rigorous analysis that connects systems-level parameters to machine learning concepts.
The analysis connecting systems-level parameters like staleness to machine learning concepts like convergence of the learner is a key contribution and deserves more space. The authors provide a detailed explanation of the conditions under which their theoretical results hold, including the expansion constant of the data, the balance of the tree, and the absence of outliers. They also provide empirical validation of their results, showing that the max-margin tree (MM-tree) and the 2-means tree (2M-tree) have the best empirical performance in terms of search error.
The comparison between the MM-tree and other BSP-trees, such as the kd-tree and the random-projection tree, is interesting and highlights the importance of considering both quantization performance and partition margins when choosing a BSP-tree for search. The authors also discuss the potential applications of their analysis beyond BSP-trees, including locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) based search schemes.
Overall, the paper is technically sound, well-organized, and clearly written. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the relationship between vector quantization performance and search performance, and their results have significant implications for the design of efficient search algorithms.
Arguments for acceptance:
1. The paper provides a rigorous analysis of the relationship between vector quantization performance and search performance in BSP-trees.
2. The authors establish a theoretical connection between the two, showing that BSP-trees with better vector quantization performance have better search performance guarantees.
3. The paper provides comprehensive experiments that validate the approach, using various datasets and comparing the performance of different BSP-trees.
4. The analysis has significant implications for the design of efficient search algorithms, including LSH based search schemes.
Arguments against acceptance:
1. The paper assumes that the data has a bounded expansion constant, which may not always be the case in practice.
2. The authors do not provide a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of their approach, which could be a limitation in practice.
3. The paper focuses primarily on BSP-trees, and it is not clear how the results generalize to other types of search algorithms.
Suggestions for improvement:
1. Provide a more detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the approach.
2. Consider relaxing the assumption of a bounded expansion constant, and provide a more robust analysis of the results.
3. Explore the application of the analysis to other types of search algorithms, including LSH based search schemes.
