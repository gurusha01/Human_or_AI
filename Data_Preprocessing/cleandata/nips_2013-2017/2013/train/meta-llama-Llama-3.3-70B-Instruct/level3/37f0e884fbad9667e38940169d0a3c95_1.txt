This paper proposes a novel distributed algorithm, GREEDI, for maximizing a submodular function subject to cardinality constraints. The algorithm is designed to work in a parallel computing environment, such as MapReduce, and is shown to achieve performance close to the centralized greedy solution under certain natural conditions.
The paper is well-written and provides a clear explanation of the problem, the proposed algorithm, and its theoretical analysis. The authors also provide extensive experimental results, including large-scale experiments using Hadoop, to demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to handle decomposable submodular functions, which are common in many machine learning applications. The authors provide a theoretical analysis of the algorithm's performance on such functions and demonstrate its effectiveness in practice.
However, there are some areas where the paper could be improved. For example, the authors could provide more discussion on the limitations and drawbacks of their approach, particularly in comparison to existing algorithms. Additionally, the paper could benefit from more high-level comments and explanations to help readers understand the key insights and ideas behind the algorithm.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets most of the criteria. It is well-written, clearly organized, and provides a good balance of theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors also provide a clear explanation of the problem and its significance, and demonstrate the potential impact of their work on the field.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper to the conference. It presents a novel and effective algorithm for distributed submodular maximization, and provides a thorough theoretical analysis and experimental evaluation. With some minor revisions to address the areas mentioned above, the paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field.
