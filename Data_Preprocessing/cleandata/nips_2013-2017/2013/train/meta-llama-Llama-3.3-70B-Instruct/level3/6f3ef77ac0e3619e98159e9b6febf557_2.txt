This paper presents a novel approach to approximate inference in high-treewidth graphical models by projecting an intractable distribution onto a "fast-mixing" set, where Gibbs sampling is guaranteed to converge rapidly to the stationary distribution. The authors demonstrate the feasibility of this approach on Ising models, providing a technical advance over previous work on mean-field and variational methods.
The paper is well-written, clearly organized, and provides a thorough introduction to the background and related work. The technical contributions are sound, and the authors provide a detailed analysis of the proposed methods. The experimental evaluation is comprehensive, comparing the proposed methods to several standard variational methods and Gibbs sampling on the original parameters.
The main strengths of the paper are:
* The proposal of a new notion of "tractability" based on parameter-space conditions ensuring rapid mixing of Gibbs sampling, which provides a fresh perspective on approximate inference.
* The derivation of a dual algorithm for projecting onto the fast-mixing set under the Euclidean distance, which is a significant technical contribution.
* The extension of the approach to more probabilistic divergences, including a novel "piecewise" divergence and the KL-divergence, which demonstrates the flexibility of the proposed framework.
However, there are some weaknesses and concerns:
* The looseness of the spectral norm bound, which may be too conservative in some cases, as discussed in Section 7.
* The potential for the proposed methods to converge to incorrect solutions, as noted in the experiments.
* The lack of a tighter bound on when rapid mixing will occur, which would be more informative and useful in practice.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of approximate inference, and the proposed approach has the potential to be useful in practice. However, further work is needed to address the weaknesses and concerns mentioned above.
