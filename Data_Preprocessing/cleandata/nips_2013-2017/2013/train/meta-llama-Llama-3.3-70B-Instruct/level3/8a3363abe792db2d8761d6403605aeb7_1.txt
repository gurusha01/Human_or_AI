This paper proposes a novel algorithm for estimating sparse precision matrices in high dimensions using the CLIME estimator. The authors develop an inexact alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm that can scale to millions of dimensions and trillions of parameters, making it suitable for large-scale applications. The algorithm is shown to outperform existing methods in terms of scalability and computational efficiency.
The paper is well-written, clear, and technically sound, providing a significant contribution to the field of sparse precision matrix estimation. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the algorithm's convergence rates and demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real datasets.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to leverage the sparse and low-rank structure of the problem to reduce computational complexity. The authors propose a block cyclic distribution scheme for matrix multiplication, which achieves load balancing and minimizes cache misses. This scheme is particularly effective in distributed-memory architectures, where it enables the algorithm to scale almost linearly with the number of cores.
However, there are some areas where the paper could be improved. For example, the authors could provide more discussion on the relevance of using hypergraphs to represent the data, as well as comparisons to other semi-supervised and clustering techniques. Additionally, the paper could benefit from more analysis on the potential performance without using unlabeled samples.
