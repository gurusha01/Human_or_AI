This paper proposes a novel distributed protocol, GREEDI, for maximizing a submodular function subject to cardinality constraints. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the protocol's performance, demonstrating its effectiveness in achieving solutions competitive with the centralized greedy solution. The paper is well-structured, and the writing is clear and concise.
The key strengths of the paper are:
1. Novelty: The proposed GREEDI protocol is a significant contribution to the field of distributed optimization, addressing the challenge of maximizing submodular functions in a distributed setting.
2. Theoretical analysis: The authors provide a rigorous theoretical analysis of the protocol's performance, including bounds on the approximation ratio and the impact of the number of partitions and the cardinality constraint.
3. Experimental evaluation: The paper presents an extensive experimental evaluation of GREEDI, demonstrating its effectiveness on various datasets and comparing its performance to other distributed benchmarks.
However, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement:
1. Complexity: The protocol's analysis and implementation may be complex, which could limit its adoption in practice.
2. Scalability: While the authors demonstrate the protocol's scalability on large datasets, further experimentation on even larger datasets would be beneficial to confirm its performance.
3. Comparison to other methods: The paper could benefit from a more comprehensive comparison to other distributed optimization methods, including those specifically designed for submodular functions.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper presents a novel and significant contribution to the field of distributed optimization.
* The theoretical analysis is rigorous and well-supported by experimental results.
* The protocol has the potential to be widely applicable in various domains, including machine learning and data mining.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The protocol's complexity may limit its adoption in practice.
* The experimental evaluation, while extensive, may not be comprehensive enough to fully demonstrate the protocol's scalability and effectiveness.
Overall, I recommend accepting this paper, as it presents a significant contribution to the field of distributed optimization, and its strengths outweigh its weaknesses. However, the authors should consider addressing the areas for improvement mentioned above to further enhance the paper's quality and impact.
