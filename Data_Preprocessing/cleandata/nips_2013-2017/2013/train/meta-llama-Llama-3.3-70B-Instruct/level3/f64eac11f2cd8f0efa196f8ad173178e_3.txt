This paper proposes a novel approach to scalable symbolic planning under uncertainty with factored states and actions. The authors introduce two main contributions: Factored Action Modified Policy Iteration (FA-MPI) and Opportunistic Policy Iteration (OPI). FA-MPI conducts exact policy evaluation steps by treating the policy as a constraint on normal Bellman backups, while OPI addresses the issue of large space requirements by enforcing policy constraints opportunistically.
The paper is well-structured and clear, with a strong theoretical foundation. The authors provide a thorough explanation of the algorithms and their properties, including proofs and examples. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of OPI in scaling to large action spaces and improving over state-of-the-art algorithms.
The strengths of the paper include:
* A novel and efficient approach to symbolic planning with factored actions
* A thorough theoretical analysis of the algorithms and their properties
* Experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of OPI in scaling to large action spaces
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper gets a bit crammed towards the end, with some sections feeling a bit rushed
* Some minor issues with formatting and missing information, although the author response addresses most of these points
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of symbolic planning and is well-written and clear. The results are interesting and demonstrate the potential of OPI in scaling to large action spaces.
