This paper proposes a new approach to online Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) planning, called Determinized Sparse Partially Observable Tree (DESPOT). The method constructs a sparse tree by sampling scenarios from the current belief and then searches for a policy that balances the size of the policy and its estimated performance under the sampled scenarios. The authors also introduce an anytime approximation of the algorithm, called Anytime Regularized DESPOT (AR-DESPOT), which uses heuristic search and branch-and-bound pruning to improve online planning performance.
The paper provides a thorough theoretical analysis of the approach, including a bound on the error of the estimated policy value and a proof that the algorithm can find a near-optimal policy with high probability. The experimental results show that AR-DESPOT outperforms two of the fastest online POMDP planning algorithms, AEMS2 and POMCP, on several benchmark problems, including a very large problem with approximately 10^56 states.
The strengths of the paper include its novel approach to online POMDP planning, its thorough theoretical analysis, and its strong experimental results. The paper also provides a clear and well-organized presentation of the material, making it easy to follow.
However, there are some weaknesses to the paper. The notation and mathematics are sometimes loose, and the English level is poor in some places, which can make it difficult to understand certain sections of the paper. Additionally, the experiment section lacks details, making it difficult to understand the figures and results, and fails to compare with other methods for specific tasks. The choice of the trade-off parameter α needs a longer discussion, including both theoretical and practical aspects.
Overall, the paper requires significant revisions to improve its clarity and presentation. The authors should provide more details on the experimental setup, compare their results with other methods, and discuss the choice of the trade-off parameter α in more depth. Despite these weaknesses, the paper presents a novel and promising approach to online POMDP planning, and with revisions, it has the potential to be a strong contribution to the field.
