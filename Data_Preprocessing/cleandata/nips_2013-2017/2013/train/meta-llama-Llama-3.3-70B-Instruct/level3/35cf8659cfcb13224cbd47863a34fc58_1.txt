This paper proposes a hierarchical extension of the IRM for network modeling using a mixture over consistent partitions of nodes and an efficient greedy agglomerative procedure to learn the hierarchy. The authors present qualitative and quantitative results on various datasets, demonstrating that the proposed inference is computationally cheaper than the IRM while obtaining similar predictive performance. 
The paper is well-written and clearly expositions the key ideas, making it easy to understand the proposed methodology. The originality of the paper lies in adapting the Bayesian rose tree ideas to the relational data setting while maintaining computational complexity. The significance of the paper is in scaling BNP models to network models, which is an important challenge for practical applications.
However, the authors could provide more timings on larger real-world networks to further demonstrate the efficiency of their approach. Additionally, the authors could investigate the optimality of the greedy method and provide theoretical support, such as submodularity, to further strengthen the paper's contribution.
The paper's strengths include its ability to provide a hierarchical representation of network data, which can be useful for understanding the underlying structure of the data. The authors also provide a clear and concise explanation of their methodology, making it easy to follow and understand.
The paper's weaknesses include the lack of theoretical guarantees for the optimality of the greedy method and the limited experimental evaluation on larger real-world networks. Additionally, the authors could provide more comparison with other existing methods for network modeling to further demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach.
Overall, the paper presents a novel and efficient approach for hierarchical network modeling, and with some additional theoretical guarantees and experimental evaluations, it has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field.
