This paper proposes a novel approach to learning graphical models from time series data using a hypothesis-testing based method. The authors claim that their method is the first to address the problem of learning graphical models with non-iid data, which is a significant contribution to the field. However, I disagree with this claim as existing work by Siracusa III and Fisher has already addressed this problem.
The paper presents a clear and well-organized description of the proposed method, including the algorithms and experimental setup. The authors also provide a thorough review of related work, although I find the description of typical score-based algorithms in Section 2 to be misleading. The paper lacks clarity on the actual learning task, making it unclear whether the work proposes a new model, algorithm, or both.
The presentation of the paper is subpar, with issues such as font size, equation formatting, and figure descriptions. The work appears original but lacks innovation or novel ideas, with the construction of p-values being a potential exception. The significance of the work lies in its potential to lead to the development of superior methods, but I view it as more of a development than a research contribution.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. However, the authors could be more careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of the work. The paper is clearly written, but the organization could be improved, and the authors could provide more information to help the reader reproduce the results.
The originality of the paper is limited, as the problems and approaches are not entirely new. The related work is adequately referenced, but the authors could have done a better job of highlighting the differences between their work and existing contributions.
The significance of the paper is moderate, as the results are important, but other people may not use these ideas or build on them immediately. The paper addresses a difficult problem, but the solution is not significantly better than previous research. Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, but with revisions to address the issues mentioned above.
