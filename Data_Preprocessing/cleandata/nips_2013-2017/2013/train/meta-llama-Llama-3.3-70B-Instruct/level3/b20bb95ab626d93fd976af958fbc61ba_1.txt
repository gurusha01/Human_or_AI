This paper proposes a novel approach to efficient posterior sampling in copula models for discrete data using the Hoff extended rank likelihood. The authors build on the Hamiltonian MC approach but introduce a new method to reduce computational burden to O(n) using the Hough Envelope algorithm. The paper is well-written, and the ideas are interesting.
Initially, I had concerns about the significance of the paper, as the experimental results in the initial submission were weak, and the proposed algorithm seemed more complicated and had a higher computational burden than existing methods like Hoff's algorithm. However, the authors addressed these concerns in their rebuttal with new, more compelling experiments.
The strengths of the paper include its ability to scale to millions of dimensions and trillions of parameters, making it a significant contribution to the field of machine learning. The authors also provide a thorough analysis of the algorithm's convergence rates and scalability.
The weaknesses of the paper include the complexity of the algorithm, which may make it difficult to implement and understand for some readers. Additionally, the paper could benefit from more comparisons with existing methods and a more detailed analysis of the algorithm's limitations.
