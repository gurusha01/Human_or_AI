This paper presents a novel method for calculating firing rates in tightly balanced networks, a type of neural network that provides an optimal spike-based signal representation while producing cortex-like spiking activity. The authors develop a new technique that directly identifies the non-linear relationship between firing rates, connectivity, input, and optimal signal representation, without requiring linearizing approximations. The method is based on the idea that the spiking activity of a tightly balanced network can be interpreted as an algorithm that optimizes a loss function, which is a quadratic function of the firing rates.
The paper is well-written and clearly explains the theoretical framework and the results of the simulations. The authors provide a detailed analysis of the relationship between firing rates, connectivity, and input, and demonstrate the effectiveness of their method in calculating firing rates in various network models. The results show that the method can accurately predict firing rates and tuning curves in networks with different types of connectivity and input.
One of the strengths of the paper is its originality and significance. The method presented is the first to calculate firing rates in tightly balanced networks without linearizing approximations, and it has the potential to be useful in a wide range of applications, from data analysis to the study of computational neurodegeneration. The paper also provides a new perspective on the interpretation of tuning curve shape and its relationship to neural computation.
However, there are some limitations to the paper. The authors focus on simple, low-dimensional networks, and it is not clear how the method would perform in more complex networks or in networks with non-symmetric connectivity. Additionally, the paper could benefit from more detailed explanations of the implementation details and parameter choices, such as the selection of specific values for the leak, membrane potential noise, and other parameters.
Overall, I would argue in favor of accepting this paper, as it presents a novel and significant contribution to the field of neuroscience. The method has the potential to be useful in a wide range of applications, and the paper provides a clear and detailed explanation of the theoretical framework and the results of the simulations. However, I would suggest that the authors address the limitations of the paper and provide more detailed explanations of the implementation details and parameter choices.
