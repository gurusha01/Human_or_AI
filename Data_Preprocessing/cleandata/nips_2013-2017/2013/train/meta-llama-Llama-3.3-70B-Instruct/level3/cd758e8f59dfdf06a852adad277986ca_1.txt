This paper presents a novel approach to estimating the cluster tree of a d-dimensional manifold in a D-dimensional space. The main result is achieved by establishing bounds on the size of an s-net in the manifold setting and the deformation of volume under the assumption of a small conditional number. The paper provides both lower and upper bounds on the convergence rate, which are interesting despite depending on unknown sizes such as the manifold's dimension and conditional number.
However, the writing is unclear, with certain definitions being confusing, such as definition 3, which is also incorrect. The paper contains errors, including a wrong statement in theorem 4, and lacks clarity in proofs, such as in lemma 16, where steps are not clearly explained. To improve the paper, I suggest indexing and mentioning which inequality is used in each step, and providing clearer definitions, such as the definition of v_cap in lemma 18.
The lower bound produced in the paper is not an improvement over the lower bound in a previous work, but rather different, and the choice of salience parameter 2σ > τ may not be sensible. The paper demonstrates how to generalize results to the manifold case by providing interesting bounds on s-net, but overall, the paper is not clear enough.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, but the claims are not well-supported by theoretical analysis or experimental results. The paper is not a complete piece of work, and the authors are not careful about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of the work. The clarity of the paper is also a major issue, with unclear writing and confusing definitions.
The originality of the paper is limited, as the problems or approaches are not new, and the paper does not provide a novel combination of familiar techniques. The significance of the paper is also limited, as the results are not important, and other people are unlikely to use these ideas or build on them. The paper does not address a difficult problem in a better way than previous research, and it does not advance the state of the art in a demonstrable way.
Overall, I would not recommend accepting this paper in its current form. The authors need to revise the paper to address the clarity issues, correct the errors, and provide clearer definitions and proofs. Additionally, the authors need to demonstrate the significance and originality of the paper, and provide more convincing results to support their claims.
