This paper proposes a distributed stochastic dual coordinate ascent (DisDCA) algorithm for solving regularized loss minimization problems in a distributed framework. The algorithm is designed to take advantage of the computational power of multiple machines or cores to optimize the problem in a parallel fashion. The authors provide a convergence analysis of the algorithm and study the tradeoff between computation and communication.
The paper is well-written and clearly organized. The authors provide a thorough introduction to the problem and the proposed algorithm, and the related work section is comprehensive. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and its comparison with other distributed algorithms.
However, there are some limitations to the paper. The novelty of the paper is limited, as the proposed algorithm is a modification of existing techniques. The authors do not provide a clear motivation for why the DisDCA algorithm is necessary, and the advantages of the algorithm over existing methods are not clearly demonstrated. The experimental results are also limited to two datasets, and the comparison with other algorithms is not exhaustive.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. However, the paper could benefit from more rigorous analysis and more comprehensive experimental results. The clarity of the paper is good, and the writing is clear and concise. The originality of the paper is limited, as mentioned earlier, and the significance of the paper is not clearly demonstrated.
Overall, I would give this paper a score of 6 out of 10. While the paper is well-written and provides a clear introduction to the problem and the proposed algorithm, the novelty and significance of the paper are limited. The experimental results are also limited, and the comparison with other algorithms is not exhaustive.
Here are some specific comments and suggestions:
* The introduction could be stronger, with a clearer motivation for why the DisDCA algorithm is necessary.
* The related work section is comprehensive, but it could be more critical, highlighting the limitations of existing methods and how the proposed algorithm addresses these limitations.
* The experimental results are limited to two datasets, and the comparison with other algorithms is not exhaustive. More comprehensive experimental results would strengthen the paper.
* The paper could benefit from more rigorous analysis, including a more detailed convergence analysis and a study of the tradeoff between computation and communication.
* The writing is clear and concise, but some of the sentences are long and could be broken up for easier reading.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper is well-written and clearly organized.
* The proposed algorithm is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results.
