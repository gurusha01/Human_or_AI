This paper proposes a novel approach to improve the scalability of symbolic planning under uncertainty with factored states and actions. The authors introduce two main contributions: Factored Action Modified Policy Iteration (FA-MPI) and Opportunistic Policy Iteration (OPI). FA-MPI extends the traditional Modified Policy Iteration (MPI) to handle factored action spaces, while OPI addresses the issue of large space requirements in FA-MPI by enforcing policy constraints opportunistically.
The paper is well-written, and the ideas are clearly explained. The experimental evaluation shows significant improvements in scalability over state-of-the-art algorithms, particularly in the Inventory Control and SysAdmin domains. The results demonstrate that OPI is consistently better than traditional value iteration (VI) and that more policy evaluation steps lead to better performance.
However, the paper has some weaknesses. The idea of using vector quantization to speed up the scalar product operation in HOG-based image detection, as mentioned in the key points, is not relevant to this paper. Moreover, the paper's central idea has a major overlap with previously published work, specifically [10], which also uses vector quantization. This overlap undermines the paper's potential impact, as it may not be considered novel or original.
The experimental evaluation is thorough, but it would be beneficial to see more comparisons with other state-of-the-art algorithms and more detailed analysis of the results. Additionally, the paper could benefit from more discussion on the limitations of the approach and potential avenues for future work.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, and significance. The paper is technically sound, well-organized, and provides enough information for the expert reader to reproduce the results. The ideas are novel, and the approach has the potential to be widely used and cited. However, the overlap with previous work is a significant concern.
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel approach to improve the scalability of symbolic planning under uncertainty with factored states and actions.
* The experimental evaluation shows significant improvements in scalability over state-of-the-art algorithms.
* The paper is well-written, and the ideas are clearly explained.
Arguments con acceptance:
* The paper's central idea has a major overlap with previously published work, specifically [10].
* The experimental evaluation could be more comprehensive, with more comparisons with other state-of-the-art algorithms.
* The paper could benefit from more discussion on the limitations of the approach and potential avenues for future work.
Overall, I would recommend accepting the paper, but with revisions to address the concerns mentioned above. The authors should clarify the novelty of their approach, provide more comprehensive experimental evaluation, and discuss the limitations and potential avenues for future work.
