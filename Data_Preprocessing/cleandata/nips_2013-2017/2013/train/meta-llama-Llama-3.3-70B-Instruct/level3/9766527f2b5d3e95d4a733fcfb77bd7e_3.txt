This paper proposes a novel approach to estimating conditional copulas, which is a crucial problem in the analysis of financial time series. The authors introduce a Bayesian framework that models the parameters of a copula as non-linear functions of arbitrary conditioning variables, using Gaussian processes (GPs) to approximate these functions. The paper is well-written, and the intuition behind the idea is clear, making it a potentially valuable contribution to the field.
The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, showing consistent performance gains compared to static copula models and other dynamic copula methods. The results are impressive, and the authors provide a thorough evaluation of their method on various financial time series.
However, there are some weaknesses to the paper. One major concern is that the approach is limited to bivariate copulas, and it is unclear how to extend it to higher-dimensional copulas. Additionally, the authors do not provide a clear comparison to other related work, such as the conditional copula model of [12], which is only briefly mentioned. The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the relationships between the proposed approach and existing methods.
Another weakness is that the experimental comparisons between the proposed approach and other methods are limited and feel overstated. The authors only evaluate their method on a few specific datasets, and the hyperparameters are chosen arbitrarily. A more thorough evaluation on a wider range of datasets and hyperparameters would strengthen the paper.
Furthermore, the paper raises questions about the applicability of the approach to subgradients and the potential for diminishing returns or practical tradeoffs, which are not fully addressed. The authors should provide more discussion on these limitations and potential future directions.
Despite these weaknesses, the paper is well-written, and the proposed approach is novel and interesting. The authors' response to the reviewer's comments is satisfactory, and the reviewer is happy to modify their score accordingly.
