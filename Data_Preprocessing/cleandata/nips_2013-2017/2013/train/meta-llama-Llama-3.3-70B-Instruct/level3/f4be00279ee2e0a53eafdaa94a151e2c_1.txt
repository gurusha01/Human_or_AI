This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of game theory and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithms. The authors provide a formal analysis of the convergence of MCTS algorithms in zero-sum extensive-form games with perfect information and simultaneous moves. They show that any -Hannan consistent algorithm can be used to create a MCTS algorithm that provably converges to an approximate Nash equilibrium of the game.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the problem, the proposed solution, and the experimental evaluation. The formal analysis is rigorous and well-presented, and the authors provide a thorough discussion of the results and their implications.
One of the strengths of the paper is the combination of theoretical and empirical results. The authors provide a formal proof of the convergence of the MCTS algorithm, which is complemented by an experimental evaluation that shows the effectiveness of the algorithm in practice. The experimental results are interesting and provide insights into the behavior of the algorithm in different scenarios.
The paper also raises some interesting questions and directions for future research. For example, the authors mention that the convergence rate of the algorithm is not given, and they provide an empirical analysis of the convergence rate. However, a more detailed analysis of the convergence rate would be interesting and could provide valuable insights into the behavior of the algorithm.
Another direction for future research is the generalization of the results to more general classes of extensive-form games with imperfect information. The authors mention that they plan to focus on this direction in their future research, which could lead to significant advances in the field.
In terms of the quality of the paper, I would rate it as excellent. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the problem, the proposed solution, and the experimental evaluation.

The originality of the paper is also high. The authors provide a new and interesting perspective on the problem of MCTS algorithms in extensive-form games, and they provide a formal proof of the convergence of the algorithm. The experimental results are also interesting and provide insights into the behavior of the algorithm in different scenarios.
The significance of the paper is also high. The authors provide a significant contribution to the field of game theory and MCTS algorithms, and their results have the potential to impact a wide range of applications, from game playing to decision making under uncertainty.
