This paper proposes a novel distributed algorithm, GREEDI, for large-scale submodular function maximization using MapReduce, which provides approximation guarantees. The algorithm's performance is thoroughly validated through experiments, showing its potential for large-scale real-world applications. The paper addresses a novel and challenging problem, and its practical impact could be significant.
The strengths of the paper include its ability to provide a simple, parallel protocol for distributed submodular maximization, which can be easily implemented in MapReduce style parallel computation models. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach on various submodular maximization problems, including sparse Gaussian process inference and exemplar-based clustering, on large datasets.
However, the theoretical analysis is considered weak, with guarantees that seem almost linear in certain parameters, which is discouraging. Additionally, the paper lacks clarity on how to evaluate graph-based submodular functions in a distributed setting, which is a major issue that needs to be addressed.
To improve the paper, I suggest explaining the proof of Theorem 4.1 better, comparing GREEDI to the actual greedy algorithm, and providing timing analysis and memory requirements in the experimental results. Furthermore, the authors should consider addressing the issue of evaluating graph-based submodular functions in a distributed setting.
Overall, the paper has both strengths and weaknesses, and its acceptance should be based on the significance of the problem it addresses, the quality of the experimental results, and the potential impact of the proposed algorithm on large-scale real-world applications.
