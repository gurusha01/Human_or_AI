This paper proposes a theoretical framework to analyze the performance of binary space-partitioning (BSP) trees for nearest-neighbor search. The authors establish a connection between the vector quantization performance of BSP-trees and their search performance, providing a data-dependent analysis of the quality of the results from defeatist BSP-tree search. The paper also explores the impact of partition margins on search performance, introducing the max-margin tree (MM-tree) as a BSP-tree that explicitly maximizes the margin of every partition.
The paper's main contributions include:
1. A theoretical guarantee for the search performance of BSP-trees, linking their nearest-neighbor performance to their vector quantization performance.
2. An analysis of the impact of partition margins on search performance, showing that larger margin partitions can improve tree search performance.
3. The introduction of the MM-tree, which explicitly maximizes the margin of every partition, and a theoretical guarantee for its quantization performance.
The paper's strengths include:
* A clear and well-organized presentation of the theoretical framework and analysis.
* A thorough discussion of the related work and the paper's contributions to the field.
* A detailed empirical evaluation of the proposed approach on several datasets.
However, the paper also has some weaknesses:
* The theoretical analysis relies on several assumptions, such as the absence of outliers and the bounded expansion constant, which may not always hold in practice.
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with other existing sparse learning algorithms, such as elastic net, OSCAR, and grouping pursuit.
* The description of the proposed algorithm, particularly the definitions and notations, could be clarified for better understanding.
Overall, the paper provides a significant contribution to the field of nearest-neighbor search and BSP-trees, and its results have the potential to impact the development of more efficient and effective search algorithms.
