This paper presents a novel generative model for natural image patches that accounts for occlusions and translation invariance of features. The model consists of a set of masks and features that can be translated throughout the patch, and generates patches by sampling conditionally independent Gaussian noise. The authors demonstrate convincing results on synthetic and natural image data, showing that the model can extract components and correctly identify occlusive components.
The reviewer finds the model interesting and appreciates the explicit modeling of translation invariance. However, there are concerns about the conditional independence assumption and the simplistic background model. The model's expressive power is limited by the pixel-wise independent noise assumption, and it would be beneficial to see samples from the model and comparisons to natural image patches.
The paper is well-written, but the complex model and many parameters make it hard to follow at times. The reviewer suggests making Figure 1 more approachable with synthetic examples. The work appears to be original, with an interesting model and good analysis, and would be significant to the natural image statistics, neuroscience, and sparse coding communities.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The model's ability to account for occlusions and translation invariance, which is a significant improvement over previous models.
* The use of a generative approach, which allows for the estimation of the underlying causes of the data.
* The demonstration of convincing results on synthetic and natural image data.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The conditional independence assumption, which may not be realistic for natural images.
* The simplistic background model, which may not capture the complexity of natural images.
* The limited expressive power of the model due to the pixel-wise independent noise assumption.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of natural image statistics and neuroscience, and the model has the potential to be useful for a variety of applications, including image compression, object recognition, and neural coding. However, further work is needed to address the limitations of the model and to fully explore its potential.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper presents a novel and interesting model that addresses a significant problem in the field.
* The results are convincing and demonstrate the potential of the model.
* The paper is well-written and easy to follow, despite the complexity of the model.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The conditional independence assumption may not be realistic for natural images.
* The simplistic background model may not capture the complexity of natural images.
* The limited expressive power of the model due to the pixel-wise independent noise assumption may limit its usefulness for certain applications.
