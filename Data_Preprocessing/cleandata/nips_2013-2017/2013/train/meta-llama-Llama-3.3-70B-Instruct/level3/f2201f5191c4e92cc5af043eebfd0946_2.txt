This paper presents a novel approach to decision tree learning, introducing the concept of "decision jungles" as ensembles of rooted decision directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). The authors propose two local search-based algorithms, LSearch and ClusterSearch, to jointly optimize the structure of the DAG and the features of the split nodes. The results show that decision jungles can achieve superior generalization performance and reduced memory consumption compared to traditional decision forests.
The paper is well-written, and the technical approach is sound. The authors provide a clear motivation for their work, discussing the limitations of traditional decision trees and the potential benefits of using DAGs. The methodology is well-explained, and the experiments are thorough and convincing. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of decision jungles in various classification tasks, including image segmentation and UCI datasets.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The introduction of a new and interesting approach to decision tree learning
* The provision of a clear and well-motivated technical approach
* The thorough and convincing experimental evaluation
* The demonstration of improved generalization performance and reduced memory consumption
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The limited exploration of the parameter space, particularly with regards to the model width M
* The lack of comparison to other state-of-the-art methods, such as gradient boosting machines
* The limited discussion of the potential applications and extensions of decision jungles
Overall, I believe that this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of machine learning and decision tree learning. The approach is novel, well-motivated, and thoroughly evaluated. While there are some limitations to the paper, I believe that it has the potential to inspire further research and development in this area.
