This paper proposes a novel approach to solving trace norm-regularized problems, which are commonly used in machine learning applications. The authors establish the linear convergence of the proximal gradient method (PGM) for a class of problems, without requiring strong convexity of the objective function. This is a significant contribution, as it provides a faster convergence rate than previously known results.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem and their approach. The technical sections are also well-organized, and the proofs are detailed and easy to follow. The authors use a variety of tools, including matrix perturbation theory and error bounds, to establish their results.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to provide a unified framework for analyzing the convergence of the PGM for a wide range of problems. The authors show that their approach can be applied to various machine learning applications, including matrix completion and matrix classification. The numerical experiments provided in the paper demonstrate the effectiveness of the PGM in practice, and the authors provide a detailed analysis of the results.
In terms of originality, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field by establishing a linear convergence rate for the PGM without strong convexity. The authors also provide a new error bound for trace norm-regularized problems, which could be of independent interest.
The significance of the paper lies in its ability to provide a faster convergence rate for a wide range of machine learning problems. The authors' approach has the potential to be applied to various other problems, and their results could lead to significant improvements in the performance of machine learning algorithms.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication. The authors have made a significant contribution to the field, and their results have the potential to impact a wide range of machine learning applications.
