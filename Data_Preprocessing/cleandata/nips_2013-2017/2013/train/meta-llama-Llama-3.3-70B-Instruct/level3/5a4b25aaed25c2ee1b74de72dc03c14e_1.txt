This paper proposes a novel approach to improve the mixing rate of Gibbs sampling in Ising models by projecting pairwise interactions onto a "fast-mixing" model. The technical content builds upon prior results establishing conditions for rapid mixing, but the idea of projecting onto the nearest rapidly mixing model is a new and innovative approach. The experiments demonstrate improved marginal estimates in some regimes, particularly when interaction strengths are strong and limited time is available for sampling.
The paper is well-organized, and the presentation is generally clear. However, there are areas that require reorganization and clarification, such as referencing "standard results" without proof or reference. The experiments have some limitations, including not accounting for the computation required for projection and not testing on larger models, which raises concerns about the applicability of the approach.
The comparison between the proposed method and mean field is notable, with a large difference in error between the two, and deserves further discussion. The idea of approximating slow-mixing models by projecting to the closest fast-mixing model is elegant, but there are concerns about experimental comparisons and the limited range of models to which this approach is applicable.
The paper's strengths include its originality, technical soundness, and potential significance. The approach is novel and has the potential to improve the efficiency of Gibbs sampling in Ising models. The technical content is sound, and the experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in some regimes.
However, the paper's weaknesses include its limited scope, lack of clarity in some areas, and concerns about the applicability of the approach. The approach is limited to Ising models, and it is unclear whether it can be extended to more general Markov random fields. The paper could benefit from further clarification and discussion of the results, particularly with regards to the comparison with mean field and the limitations of the approach.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, but with revisions to address the concerns mentioned above. The paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field, and with further clarification and discussion, it could be even stronger.
