This paper proposes a novel approach to modeling neural population activity using determinantal point processes (DPP) and demonstrates its ability to fit both simulated and real neural data. The authors claim that DPP can capture inhibitory interactions between neurons, which is a significant advantage over existing methods. However, the paper lacks a clear comparison with Generalized Linear Models (GLM), which is a widely used approach in the field.
The paper's main contribution is the characterization of the achievable and Pareto optimal regret trade-offs for the absolute loss game. The authors provide a combinatorial characterization of the set of T-realizable trade-offs and construct an optimal strategy for each Pareto optimal trade-off. They also study the asymptotic regret rate trade-off profile and show that the expected √T 〈√−ln(q), √−ln(1−q)〉 trade-off is achievable for any prior probability q ∈ [0, 1], but not tight.
The paper has several strengths, including its novel approach to modeling neural population activity and its thorough analysis of the regret trade-offs. However, it also has some weaknesses, such as the lack of comparison with GLM and the unclear explanation of how DPP captures inhibitory interactions between neurons. Additionally, some figures, such as 2b, 3, and 4, are unclear and require more explanation.
To improve the paper, the authors should provide a clear comparison with GLM and explain how DPP captures inhibitory interactions between neurons. They should also clarify the methodology for determining the dimensionality of variables and learning kernel parameters in Section 3.2. Furthermore, the authors should provide more explanation for the figures and make sure that the paper is well-organized and easy to follow.
In terms of originality, the paper proposes a novel approach to modeling neural population activity using DPP, which is a significant contribution to the field. The paper also provides a thorough analysis of the regret trade-offs, which is a well-studied problem in online learning. However, the paper's significance is limited by the lack of comparison with existing methods and the unclear explanation of the results.
Overall, I would give this paper a score of 7 out of 10. While it has some significant strengths, it also has some weaknesses that need to be addressed. With some revisions to address the weaknesses, this paper has the potential to be a strong contribution to the field.
