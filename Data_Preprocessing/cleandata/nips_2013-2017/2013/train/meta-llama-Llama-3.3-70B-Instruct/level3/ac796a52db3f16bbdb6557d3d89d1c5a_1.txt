This paper presents a novel approach to approximate inference in high-treewidth graphical models by projecting the intractable distribution onto a "fast-mixing" set, which guarantees rapid convergence of Gibbs sampling. The authors propose a dual algorithm to solve the projection under several divergences, including Euclidean distance, piecewise KL-divergence, and reversed KL-divergence. The experimental results show that the proposed methods are more accurate than variational approximations and Gibbs sampling on the original parameters with finite time.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem and their approach. The mathematical framework is sound, and the theorems and lemmas are well-proven. The experimental evaluation is thorough, and the results are convincing.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a new notion of "tractability" based on parameter-space conditions ensuring rapid mixing of Gibbs sampling.
* The derivation of a dual algorithm to solve the projection under several divergences.
* The experimental evaluation, which shows the effectiveness of the proposed methods.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The looseness of the spectral norm bound, which may be too conservative in some cases.
* The lack of discussion on the robustness to noise and power consumption considerations.
* The limitation of the approach to Ising models, which may not be easily extendable to general Markov random fields.
Overall, I believe that this paper is a significant contribution to the field of approximate inference in graphical models. The proposed approach is novel, and the experimental results are convincing. However, the authors should address the weaknesses mentioned above to further improve the paper.
