This paper presents a novel distributed protocol, GREEDI, for maximizing a submodular function subject to cardinality constraints. The authors provide a thorough theoretical analysis of the algorithm's performance, demonstrating that it achieves a competitive solution with the centralized greedy algorithm under certain natural conditions. The paper also includes an extensive experimental evaluation, showcasing the effectiveness of GREEDI on various applications, including exemplar-based clustering and active set selection, using large-scale datasets.
The strengths of the paper include its clear and well-organized presentation, making it easy to follow and understand the proposed method and its analysis. The authors provide a comprehensive review of related work, highlighting the importance of distributed submodular maximization and the limitations of existing approaches. The theoretical analysis is rigorous and well-supported by proofs, providing a solid foundation for the algorithm's performance guarantees.
The experimental evaluation is also a significant strength of the paper, demonstrating the scalability and effectiveness of GREEDI on large-scale datasets using Hadoop. The results show that GREEDI outperforms other distributed benchmarks, achieving a solution close to the centralized greedy algorithm.
However, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement. One limitation of the paper is that it assumes the submodular function is given as a black box, which may not always be the case in practice. The authors do provide some discussion on handling decomposable functions, but this could be explored further. Additionally, the paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with other distributed optimization algorithms, such as those using gradient-based methods or parallel coordinate descent.
Another potential area for improvement is the analysis of the algorithm's performance in the presence of noise or errors in the data. The paper assumes that the data is clean and accurate, but in practice, this may not always be the case. Providing some robustness analysis or discussing ways to handle noisy data could strengthen the paper.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of distributed optimization, providing a novel and effective algorithm for submodular maximization. With some additional work on handling decomposable functions, comparing with other algorithms, and analyzing robustness to noise, the paper could be even stronger.
