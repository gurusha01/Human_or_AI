This paper proposes a novel approach to studying regret trade-offs in online learning, specifically in the context of the absolute loss game. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the achievable regret trade-offs and develop an optimal strategy for each trade-off. The paper is well-structured, and the authors do an excellent job of explaining the problem, the approach, and the results.
The main strengths of the paper are:
1. Originality: The paper tackles a new and interesting problem in online learning, providing a fresh perspective on the field.
2. Technical soundness: The authors demonstrate a deep understanding of the subject matter, and the technical proofs and derivations are rigorous and well-explained.
3. Clarity: The paper is well-written, and the authors take the time to explain the key concepts and ideas, making it accessible to a broad audience.
However, there are some areas where the paper could be improved:
1. Motivation: While the authors provide a clear explanation of the problem, it would be helpful to have a more detailed discussion of the motivations behind studying regret trade-offs in online learning.
2. Related work: The authors could provide a more comprehensive overview of related work in the field, highlighting the key differences and similarities between their approach and existing methods.
3. Experimental evaluation: The paper is primarily theoretical, and it would be beneficial to include some experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in practice.
