This paper proposes a novel approach to Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) in zero-sum extensive-form games with perfect information and simultaneous moves. The authors present a general template for MCTS algorithms that can be instantiated with various selection methods, and they formally prove that if the selection method is -Hannan consistent and satisfies additional requirements on exploration, the MCTS algorithm eventually converges to an approximate Nash equilibrium (NE) of the extensive-form game.
The paper is well-written and well-organized, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem and the proposed approach. The formal analysis is rigorous and well-presented, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the proof and the underlying assumptions.
One of the strengths of the paper is the empirical evaluation of the proposed approach, which shows that the MCTS algorithm converges to an approximate NE of the game in practice. The authors also provide a comparison with other MCTS variants, which shows that the proposed approach is competitive with state-of-the-art methods.
However, there are some weaknesses in the paper. One of the main limitations is that the authors do not provide a finite-time convergence bound for the algorithm, which makes it difficult to predict the performance of the algorithm in practice. Additionally, the authors assume that the game has perfect information, which may not be the case in many real-world applications.
Another limitation is that the authors do not provide a clear explanation of how to choose the exploration parameter γ, which is critical to the performance of the algorithm. The authors also do not provide a comparison with other algorithms that are specifically designed for extensive-form games, such as counterfactual regret minimization (CFR).
In terms of originality, the paper presents a novel approach to MCTS in extensive-form games, and the formal analysis is a significant contribution to the field. However, the idea of using -Hannan consistent algorithms in MCTS is not new, and the authors build on existing work in this area.
Overall, I would rate this paper as a strong accept, as it presents a novel approach to MCTS in extensive-form games and provides a rigorous formal analysis and empirical evaluation. However, the authors should address the limitations mentioned above in future work, such as providing a finite-time convergence bound and comparing with other algorithms specifically designed for extensive-form games.
