This paper explores the concept of regret guarantees in online learning, specifically in the context of prediction with expert advice. The authors focus on the absolute loss game with two constant binary experts and provide a characterization of the achievable regret trade-offs. The results are mathematically elegant and precise, but the scope of the paper is somewhat narrow, which may limit its impact on the NIPS community.
The paper's strengths include its thorough analysis of the regret trade-offs and the provision of an optimal strategy for each sample size. The authors also explore the relation between priors and regret bounds, showing that the form of the regret bound suggested by previous work is achievable but sub-optimal. The paper's techniques, which rely on the linearity of the loss, could be extended to convex and Lipschitz losses, potentially broadening the paper's applicability.
One weakness of the paper is that the minimax algorithm for absolute loss and fixed horizon has been previously proposed by N. Cesa-Bianchi et al. in 1997, and the reference should be corrected. Additionally, the paper's focus on absolute loss and two experts may limit its relevance to more general online learning settings.
Despite these limitations, the paper is well-written and provides a solid contribution to the field of online learning. The authors' analysis of the asymptotic regret rate trade-off profile is particularly noteworthy, and their conclusion that the expected trade-off is achievable but not tight is an important insight.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper provides a precise and elegant characterization of the achievable regret trade-offs in the absolute loss game with two experts.
* The authors provide an optimal strategy for each sample size and explore the relation between priors and regret bounds.
* The paper's techniques could be extended to more general losses, potentially broadening its applicability.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The paper's scope is somewhat narrow, focusing on a specific setting (absolute loss with two experts) that may not be of broad interest to the NIPS community.
* The minimax algorithm for absolute loss and fixed horizon has been previously proposed, and the reference should be corrected.
* The paper's results may not have a significant impact on the field of online learning, as they are primarily focused on a specific setting and do not provide a major breakthrough.
Overall, I recommend accepting the paper, as its strengths outweigh its weaknesses, and it provides a solid contribution to the field of online learning. However, the authors should be encouraged to broaden the scope of their work and explore more general settings to increase its relevance and impact.
