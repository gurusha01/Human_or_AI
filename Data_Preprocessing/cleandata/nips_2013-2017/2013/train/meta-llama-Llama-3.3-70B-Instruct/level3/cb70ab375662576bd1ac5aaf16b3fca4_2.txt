This paper presents a novel approach to modeling count data using graphical models, addressing the limitations of existing Poisson graphical models. The authors propose three new classes of Poisson-like graphical models: the Truncated Poisson Graphical Model (TPGM), the Quadratic Poisson Graphical Model (QPGM), and the Sublinear Poisson Graphical Model (SPGM). These models can capture both positive and negative conditional dependencies between count-valued variables, overcoming the restrictive assumptions of traditional Poisson graphical models.
The paper is well-structured, and the authors provide a clear introduction to the problem and the motivations behind their work. The technical contributions are sound, and the theorems and propositions are well-proven. The experiments section is also well-presented, with a clear comparison of the proposed models with existing methods.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of new classes of graphical models that can handle count data with both positive and negative dependencies.
* The provision of theoretical guarantees for the normalizability of the proposed models.
* The demonstration of the effectiveness of the proposed models in simulation studies and a real-world case study.
However, there are some weaknesses:
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with existing methods, such as the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm.
* The experiments section could be enhanced by showing a relationship between empirical findings and theoretical bounds.
* The presentation of the paper could be improved by defining the model earlier and reducing the review of tensor decomposition framework.
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of graphical models for count data and provides a promising approach for modeling complex dependencies in high-dimensional data. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their proposed models in various settings, and the paper is well-written and easy to follow.
