This paper presents a theoretical analysis of the connection between the search performance of binary space-partitioning (BSP) trees and their vector quantization performance. The authors establish a bound on the search error of BSP-trees, which depends on the quantization performance of the tree and the margin size of the partitions. The bound is demonstrated to be tight through empirical experiments on several datasets.
The paper's main contribution is the establishment of a theoretical link between the search performance of BSP-trees and their vector quantization performance. This connection is demonstrated through a complex bound, which depends on several parameters, including the expansion coefficient, the quantization performance, and the margin size of the partitions. The authors also provide empirical evidence to support their theoretical results, showing that trees with better quantization performance and larger margin sizes tend to have better search performance.
However, the bound's tightness is questionable, and its looseness can be demonstrated through specific cases, such as copying and transposing a dataset. This suggests that a local approach might be more effective. Additionally, the bound's parameters, such as the expansion coefficient, depend on the query point, making it impractical for actual error bounds computation during search.
The paper's technical writing can be improved by simplifying notation, avoiding unnecessary accents and indices, and clarifying definitions and terminology. The authors should also demonstrate the bound's tightness empirically, similar to Figure 2, to strengthen their claims.
The paper's strengths include its novel contribution to the understanding of BSP-trees and its potential to inform the development of more efficient search algorithms. The authors' use of empirical experiments to validate their theoretical results is also a strength. However, the paper's weaknesses include the looseness of the bound and the impracticality of computing the bound's parameters during search.
Overall, the paper is well-organized and clearly written, but could benefit from improvements in technical writing and empirical validation. The authors' contributions are significant, and their work has the potential to advance the state of the art in nearest-neighbor search.
