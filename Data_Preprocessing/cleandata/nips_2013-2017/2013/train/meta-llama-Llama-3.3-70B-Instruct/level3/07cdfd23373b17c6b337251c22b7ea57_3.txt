This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of game theory and artificial intelligence, providing a formal analysis of the convergence of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithms in zero-sum extensive-form games with perfect information and simultaneous moves. The authors develop a general template for MCTS algorithms that can be instantiated with various selection methods, and they formally prove that if the selection method is -Hannan consistent and satisfies additional requirements on exploration, the MCTS algorithm eventually converges to an approximate Nash equilibrium of the extensive-form game.
The paper is well-written and well-organized, making it easy to follow and understand the authors' arguments. The introduction provides a clear motivation for the research and a concise overview of the related work. The definitions and background section provides a thorough explanation of the concepts and notation used in the paper.
The formal analysis is rigorous and well-presented, with clear explanations of the proofs and lemmas. The authors provide a detailed analysis of the convergence of the MCTS algorithm, including the influence of propagating the mean values instead of the current sample value. The empirical analysis provides valuable insights into the convergence rate of the algorithms and the performance of different variants.
The paper has several strengths, including the provision of a formal analysis of the convergence of MCTS algorithms, the development of a general template for MCTS algorithms, and the empirical evaluation of the convergence rate of the algorithms. The authors also provide a clear and concise conclusion, summarizing the main contributions and outlining future research directions.
However, there are some minor weaknesses and areas for improvement. For example, the paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the implications of the results and the potential applications of the MCTS algorithms in practice. Additionally, some of the notation and terminology used in the paper may be unfamiliar to readers without a strong background in game theory and artificial intelligence.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, originality, and significance.
