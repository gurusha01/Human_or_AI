This paper presents a comprehensive study on flat and hierarchical classification strategies in the context of large-scale taxonomies. The authors propose two novel bounds on the generalization error of multiclass, hierarchical classifiers, providing a theoretical explanation for the performance of flat and hierarchical classification strategies. The first bound, a hierarchical Rademacher data-dependent bound, sheds light on the trade-off between flat and hierarchical classification, while the second bound, an asymptotic approximation error bound, is used to design a simple and effective node pruning strategy.
The paper is well-structured, clearly written, and thoroughly supported by careful experiments and insightful discussions of model mismatch and real-world applications. The authors demonstrate the practical effects of model misspecification and provide valuable recommendations for practitioners on choosing between flat and hierarchical classification strategies. The experimental results, conducted on two widely used taxonomies, are in line with the theoretical developments and justify the pruning strategy adopted.
The strengths of the paper include its novelty, as it is the first time that such bounds are introduced and that a theoretical explanation is provided for the performance of flat and hierarchical classification strategies in large-scale taxonomies. The paper also provides a well-founded way to simplify a taxonomy by selectively pruning some of its nodes, through a meta-classifier. The features retained in this meta-classifier derive from the error generalization bounds proposed, making it a highly practical and important contribution to the field of crowdsourcing.
The weaknesses of the paper are minimal, but one potential limitation is that the authors assume a specific form of the taxonomy, namely a rooted tree or a directed acyclic graph. It would be interesting to explore the extension of the results to more general forms of taxonomies.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The paper is also well-organized, making it easy to follow and understand. The clarity of the paper is excellent, with clear and concise language used throughout.
The originality of the paper is high, as it introduces novel bounds and provides a theoretical explanation for the performance of flat and hierarchical classification strategies in large-scale taxonomies. The significance of the paper is also high, as it provides valuable recommendations for practitioners and contributes to the advancement of the field of crowdsourcing.
Overall, I highly recommend this paper for acceptance, as it makes a significant contribution to the field of crowdsourcing and provides a thorough and well-supported study on flat and hierarchical classification strategies in large-scale taxonomies.
