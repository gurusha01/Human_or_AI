This paper presents a method for speeding up object detection by approximating template evaluation using Vector Quantization (VQ). The authors demonstrate that their approach can achieve a substantial speedup over existing methods without sacrificing accuracy. The paper is well-structured and easy to follow, with a clear introduction, related work, and experimental results.
The main contribution of the paper is the application of VQ to speed up template evaluation, which is a crucial component of many object detection algorithms. The authors show that by quantizing the feature vectors in each cell of the HOG feature pyramid, they can reduce the computational complexity of template evaluation from O(mnd) to O(mn), where m and n are the dimensions of the template and d is the dimensionality of the feature vectors. This reduction in complexity leads to a significant speedup in practice.
The paper also presents several techniques for further improving the speed of template evaluation, including exploiting cascades, fast deformation estimates, packed lookup tables, sparse lookup tables, and fixed-point arithmetic. These techniques are well-motivated and effectively demonstrated through experiments.
The experimental results are impressive, with the authors demonstrating a speedup of up to two orders of magnitude over existing methods on the PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset. The results are also well-analyzed, with a clear discussion of the trade-offs between speed and accuracy.
However, there are some areas where the paper could be improved. One issue is that the writing could be more precise and consistent, with some sentences being unclear or awkwardly phrased. Additionally, some of the notation and terminology could be better defined or explained. Furthermore, the paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the limitations and potential applications of the proposed method.
In terms of novelty, the paper builds on existing work on VQ and template evaluation, but the specific application of VQ to object detection and the combination of techniques presented are new and interesting. The paper also provides a useful contribution to the field by making the implementation available online, which will facilitate future research and applications.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, as it presents a significant contribution to the field of object detection and has the potential to impact a wide range of applications. However, I would suggest that the authors revise the paper to address the issues mentioned above and provide a more polished and precise presentation of their work.
