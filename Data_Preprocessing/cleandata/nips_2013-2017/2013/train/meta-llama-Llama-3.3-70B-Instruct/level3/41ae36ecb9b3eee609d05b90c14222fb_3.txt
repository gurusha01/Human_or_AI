This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of machine learning by establishing the linear convergence of the proximal gradient method (PGM) for solving a class of trace norm-regularized problems. The authors prove a local error bound for trace norm regularized risk minimization, allowing for asymptotic linear convergence of the PGM under a relaxed form of strong convexity.
The paper is technically sound, and the proof follows a well-established framework, with a new observation enabling simultaneous diagonalization of matrices, which is the main original contribution of the paper. However, there is a minor gap in the appendix that requires clarification on the choice of a parameter.
The clarity of the paper is good, but could be improved by reorganizing the presentation of main claims and technical proofs. The originality of the paper is moderate, with the new observation on matrix diagonalization being the most interesting aspect. The significance of the paper is mainly theoretical, with limited impact on algorithm design, and is lowered by the asymptotic nature of the proof.
The paper provides a thorough analysis of the convergence rate of the PGM, and the numerical experiments demonstrate the linear convergence of the algorithm in practice. The authors also discuss the implications of their results and provide suggestions for future research directions.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the authors have made a significant contribution to the field. However, there are some areas that require improvement, such as clarifying the gap in the appendix and reorganizing the presentation of the main claims and technical proofs.
