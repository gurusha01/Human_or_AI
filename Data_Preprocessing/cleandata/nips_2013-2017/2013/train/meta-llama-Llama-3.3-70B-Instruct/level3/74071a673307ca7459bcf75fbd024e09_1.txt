This paper explores the concept of regret against individual actions in the full-information online prediction setting, specifically characterizing achievable "regret profiles" for binary prediction with absolute loss. The authors define a profile as T-realizable if an algorithm guarantees regret against constant predictions and provide an example of a trivial T-realizable profile. They exactly characterize the Pareto-front of all T-realizable profiles for two actions and absolute loss, and use this result to prove an asymptotic bound.
The paper provides algorithms that achieve the realizable profiles, but these algorithms are highly inefficient computationally. The work opens a new line of research in regret analysis, providing optimal bounds for regret-profiles against each constant action in online learning. However, the paper lacks discussion on how the new bounds relate to the old uniform regret bound, and could benefit from more efficient algorithms with near-optimal regret bounds.
The authors consider a non-oblivious adversary model, but this could be explicitly mentioned earlier in the paper to avoid confusion. The paper's results have implications for the design of online learning algorithms, particularly in situations where the number of experts is large or infinite. The authors show that the expected trade-off profile is achievable for any prior probability, but that it is not tight, and provide a formula for the optimal constant.
The paper's strengths include its novel approach to regret analysis, its exact characterization of the Pareto-front of all T-realizable profiles, and its provision of algorithms that achieve the realizable profiles. However, its weaknesses include the computational inefficiency of the algorithms, the lack of discussion on the relation to the old uniform regret bound, and the potential for confusion regarding the adversary model.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, with well-supported claims and a clear exposition of the results. The paper is well-organized and clearly written, making it easy to follow for an expert reader. The originality of the paper lies in its novel approach to regret analysis, and its significance lies in its potential to impact the design of online learning algorithms.
Arguments for acceptance include:
* The paper's novel approach to regret analysis
* The exact characterization of the Pareto-front of all T-realizable profiles
* The provision of algorithms that achieve the realizable profiles
* The paper's potential to impact the design of online learning algorithms
Arguments against acceptance include:
* The computational inefficiency of the algorithms
* The lack of discussion on the relation to the old uniform regret bound
* The potential for confusion regarding the adversary model
Overall, I would recommend acceptance of the paper, as its strengths outweigh its weaknesses, and it has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of online learning. However, I would suggest that the authors address the weaknesses mentioned above in a revised version of the paper.
