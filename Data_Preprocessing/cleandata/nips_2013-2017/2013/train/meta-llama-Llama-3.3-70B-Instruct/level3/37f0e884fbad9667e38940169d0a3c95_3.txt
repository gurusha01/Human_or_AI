This paper proposes a novel distributed protocol, GREEDI, for maximizing a submodular function subject to cardinality constraints. The authors provide a thorough theoretical analysis of the algorithm's performance, demonstrating its ability to achieve solutions competitive with the centralized greedy solution under certain natural conditions. The paper also presents extensive experimental results, showcasing the effectiveness of GREEDI on various submodular maximization problems, including exemplar-based clustering and active set selection, on large-scale datasets.
The strengths of the paper include its clear and well-organized presentation, making it easy to follow and understand the proposed approach. The theoretical analysis is rigorous and provides valuable insights into the algorithm's performance. The experimental results are impressive, demonstrating the scalability and effectiveness of GREEDI on large-scale datasets.
However, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement. The paper assumes that the submodular function is given as a black box, which may not always be the case in practice. The authors also assume that the function is monotone and submodular, which may not hold for all applications. Additionally, the paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with existing distributed submodular maximization algorithms.
