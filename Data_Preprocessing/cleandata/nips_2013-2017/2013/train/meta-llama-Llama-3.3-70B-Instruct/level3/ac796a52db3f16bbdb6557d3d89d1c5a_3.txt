This paper proposes a novel approach to approximate inference in high-treewidth graphical models by projecting the intractable distribution onto a "fast-mixing" set, where Gibbs sampling is guaranteed to converge rapidly to the stationary distribution. The authors derive a dual algorithm to solve the projection under several divergences, including Euclidean distance, piecewise KL-divergence, and reversed KL-divergence.
The paper is well-organized and clearly written, with a thorough introduction to the background and related work. The authors provide a detailed explanation of the proposed approach, including the derivation of the projection algorithm and the experimental evaluation. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in comparison to several standard variational methods and Gibbs sampling on the original parameters.
However, there are some weaknesses in the paper. Firstly, the proposed approach lacks a connection to real biological systems, which contradicts the authors' claim of biological inspiration. Secondly, the application of the model is thorough, but its relevance and potential impact are questionable. The authors could have provided more discussion on the potential applications and implications of the proposed approach.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of the work. The paper is original, and the approach is novel, but it builds upon existing work in the field.
The clarity of the paper is good, but the complexity of the content makes it difficult to fully understand and follow. The authors could have provided more intuitive explanations and examples to help readers understand the proposed approach.
The significance of the paper is moderate, as it provides a new perspective on approximate inference in high-treewidth graphical models. The results are important, but the potential impact is limited to a specific area of research. The paper does not address a difficult problem in a significantly better way than previous research, but it provides a useful contribution to the field.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, but with some revisions to address the weaknesses mentioned above. The authors should provide more discussion on the potential applications and implications of the proposed approach, as well as more intuitive explanations and examples to help readers understand the content.
