This paper proposes a novel approach to Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) in zero-sum extensive-form games with perfect information and simultaneous moves. The authors provide a general template for MCTS algorithms that can be instantiated with various selection methods, and they formally prove that if the selection method is -Hannan consistent and satisfies additional requirements on exploration, the MCTS algorithm eventually converges to an approximate Nash equilibrium (NE) of the extensive-form game.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem and the proposed approach. The theoretical analysis is thorough, and the authors provide a detailed proof of the convergence of the MCTS algorithm to an approximate NE. The experimental evaluation is also well-designed, and the authors provide a comparison of the proposed approach with other MCTS variants.
However, there are some weaknesses in the paper. The experimental section is limited, and the authors only evaluate the proposed approach on a small set of randomly generated games and a few worst-case games. The authors do not provide a comprehensive comparison with other state-of-the-art algorithms, and the evaluation metrics are limited to the exploitability of the first player's strategy.
Additionally, the authors do not provide a clear discussion of the computational complexity of the proposed approach, and the implementation details are not fully specified. The authors also do not provide a detailed analysis of the sensitivity of the proposed approach to the hyperparameters, such as the exploration rate and the number of iterations.
Overall, the paper provides a significant contribution to the field of game theory and MCTS, and the proposed approach has the potential to be applied to a wide range of games and domains. However, the paper could be improved with a more comprehensive experimental evaluation, a clearer discussion of the computational complexity, and a more detailed analysis of the sensitivity to hyperparameters.
