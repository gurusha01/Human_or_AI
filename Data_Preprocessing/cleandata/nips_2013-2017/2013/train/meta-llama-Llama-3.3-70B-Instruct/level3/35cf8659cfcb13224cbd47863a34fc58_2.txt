This paper proposes a novel approach to hierarchical classification in large-scale taxonomies by introducing a data-dependent bound on the generalization error of multiclass, hierarchical classifiers. The authors provide a theoretical explanation for the performance of flat and hierarchical classification strategies, which has been a topic of debate in the literature. The key insight is that the trade-off between the empirical error and the Rademacher complexity of the class of classifiers determines the preference for flat or hierarchical classification.
The paper is well-structured, and the authors provide a clear overview of the problem, the proposed approach, and the experimental results. The theoretical developments are sound, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of the bounds and their implications. The experimental results are convincing, and the proposed pruning strategy leads to statistically significant better results compared to both the original taxonomy and a randomly pruned one.
However, the writing quality, clarity, and presentation of the paper could be improved. There are several distracting errors, vague phrasing, and confusing math and figures. For example, the notation is not consistently used throughout the paper, and some of the equations are difficult to follow.
Despite these issues, the proposed approach has enough novelty and strong results to warrant publication. The authors address an interesting and relevant problem, and the theoretical developments provide a significant contribution to the field. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, and the pruning strategy has the potential to be applied to other domains.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, originality, and significance. The authors provide a clear and thorough analysis of the problem, and the proposed approach is well-motivated and sound. The experimental results are convincing, and the paper has the potential to make a significant impact in the field.
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The paper addresses an interesting and relevant problem in hierarchical classification.
* The proposed approach is novel and has the potential to make a significant impact in the field.
* The theoretical developments are sound, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of the bounds and their implications.
