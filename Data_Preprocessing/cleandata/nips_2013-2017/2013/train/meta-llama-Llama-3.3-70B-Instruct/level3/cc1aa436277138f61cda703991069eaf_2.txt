This paper explores the trade-off between flat and hierarchical classification strategies in large-scale taxonomies, providing theoretical results and empirical evaluations to support its claims. The authors introduce a data-dependent bound on the generalization error of multiclass, hierarchical classifiers, which sheds light on the performance of flat and hierarchical classification strategies. The bound suggests that hierarchical classifiers are well-suited for unbalanced, large-scale taxonomies, while flat classifiers are preferred for well-balanced taxonomies.
The paper also proposes a meta-classifier-based approach to simplify a taxonomy by selectively pruning some of its nodes. The features used in the meta-classifier are derived from the error generalization bounds, and the approach is shown to lead to statistically significant improvements in classification performance compared to both the original taxonomy and a randomly pruned one.
The strengths of the paper include its thorough theoretical analysis, which provides a clear understanding of the trade-offs between flat and hierarchical classification strategies. The empirical evaluations are also well-designed and provide strong support for the theoretical claims. The paper's contributions are significant, as it provides a theoretical explanation for the performance of flat and hierarchical classification strategies in large-scale taxonomies, and proposes a well-founded approach to simplify a taxonomy.
However, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement. The paper assumes that the taxonomy is a rooted tree, which may not always be the case in practice. Additionally, the meta-classifier-based approach to pruning nodes may not be scalable to very large taxonomies. The paper could also benefit from more detailed comparisons with other related work, and a more thorough discussion of the implications of the results for real-world applications.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the authors have made a significant contribution to the field of large-scale taxonomy classification. The results have important implications for the design of classification systems, and the paper provides a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners working in this area.
