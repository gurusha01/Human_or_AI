This paper proposes a Bayesian inference procedure for conditional bivariate copula models with multiple parameters, using expectation propagation for inference. The authors extend previous work on conditional copula models to accommodate copulas with multiple parameters, which is an important improvement as it allows the use of a richer set of copulas. The proposed method is sound, with a clear description of related methods and strengths and weaknesses of the approach.
The paper is well-written and clearly explains the equations, with flawless text and effective use of figures and tables. The model and its inference procedure are a novel extension of a similar conditional copula model, generalizing to allow more than one copula parameter. The flexibility of the proposed approach has significant advantages, with remarkable performance gains compared to alternative methods, making it a promising and important contribution.
The authors evaluate the proposed Gaussian process conditional copula models (GPCC) on a one-step-ahead prediction task with synthetic data and financial time series, using time as the conditioning variable. The results show that GPCC outperforms static copula models and other dynamic copula models, with GPCC-T being the best performing method. The authors also demonstrate that the proposed method can capture changes across time in the parameters of the Student's t copula, which is important for modeling dependencies in financial time series.
The paper has several strengths, including:
* A clear and well-motivated introduction to the problem of estimating dependencies in financial time series
* A thorough review of related work on conditional copula models and dynamic covariance models
* A novel and well-explained extension of previous work on conditional copula models to accommodate copulas with multiple parameters
* A comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method on synthetic and real-world data, with impressive performance gains compared to alternative methods
However, there are some potential weaknesses and areas for future work, including:
* The computational cost of the proposed method, which may be high for large datasets
* The need for further evaluation of the proposed method on higher-dimensional copulas and more complex datasets
* The potential for overfitting, particularly when using Gaussian processes with many hyperparameters
Overall, this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of conditional copula models and dynamic covariance modeling, and has the potential to be a highly cited and influential work. The proposed method is well-motivated, clearly explained, and thoroughly evaluated, and the results demonstrate its effectiveness in modeling dependencies in financial time series.
