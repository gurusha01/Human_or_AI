This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of game theory and artificial intelligence, providing a formal analysis of the convergence of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithms in zero-sum extensive-form games with perfect information and simultaneous moves. The authors propose a general template for MCTS algorithms that can be instantiated with various selection methods, and they formally prove that if the selection method is -Hannan consistent and satisfies additional requirements on exploration, the MCTS algorithm eventually converges to an approximate Nash equilibrium of the extensive-form game.
The paper is well-written and clearly presents new results in formal analysis, building upon previous work by Lanctot et al in 2013. The authors provide a comprehensive introduction to the problem, including definitions and background information, and they present a detailed description of the MCTS algorithm and its variants. The formal analysis is thorough and well-structured, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the proof and its implications.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to provide a general framework for analyzing MCTS algorithms in a wide range of games. The authors demonstrate the applicability of their framework by evaluating the convergence of two different selection methods, regret matching and Exp3, and they show that both methods converge to an approximate Nash equilibrium in various games.
However, one of the weaknesses of the approach is its inability to prove interesting things about the inner nodes of the game tree, missing out on key concepts like subgame perfect Nash equilibria. The authors acknowledge this limitation and suggest that incorporating concepts like subgame perfect equilibria could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the games.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of their work. The paper is clearly written, well-organized, and provides enough information for the expert reader to reproduce the results.
The originality of the paper lies in its ability to provide a formal analysis of MCTS algorithms in a new domain, and the authors demonstrate a novel combination of familiar techniques to achieve this goal. The related work is adequately referenced, and the authors provide a clear explanation of how their work differs from previous contributions.
The significance of the paper lies in its ability to provide a new perspective on the convergence of MCTS algorithms in extensive-form games. The results have important implications for the development of artificial intelligence and game-playing systems, and the authors suggest that their work could be generalized to include more complex games and scenarios.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication, as it provides a significant contribution to the field of game theory and artificial intelligence. The paper is well-written, technically sound, and provides a clear and comprehensive analysis of the convergence of MCTS algorithms in extensive-form games.
