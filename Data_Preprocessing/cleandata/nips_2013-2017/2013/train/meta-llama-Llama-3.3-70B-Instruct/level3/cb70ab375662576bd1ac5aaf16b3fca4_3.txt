This paper proposes a novel approach to learning Markov models and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) in a non-sequential setting from sparse realizations obtained at random times. The authors derive a spectral learning-based algorithm and provide proper proofs for empirical moments and a sample complexity bound. 
The paper is well-structured and clearly written, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments. The introduction provides a thorough background on the problem of learning Markov models and HMMs, and the authors clearly motivate the need for a non-sequential approach. The technical sections are well-organized, and the authors provide detailed proofs of their results.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to handle sparse realizations, which is a common challenge in many applications. The authors' approach is based on a spectral learning algorithm, which is a popular method for learning Markov models and HMMs. The authors provide a detailed analysis of the algorithm's performance and show that it is able to recover the underlying model parameters with high accuracy.
However, there are some areas where the paper could be improved. For example, the authors could provide a more detailed comparison with existing methods for learning Markov models and HMMs in non-sequential settings. Additionally, the authors could provide more experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on real-world datasets.
In terms of originality, the paper proposes a novel approach to learning Markov models and HMMs in a non-sequential setting, which is a significant contribution to the field. The authors' use of spectral learning algorithms and their analysis of the algorithm's performance are also novel contributions.
