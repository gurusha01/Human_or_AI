This paper presents a novel approach to image encoding using a generative model with non-linear feature combinations and explicit position encoding. The authors propose a model that captures occlusions and invariances in image patches, which is a crucial aspect of visual perception. The model is based on a probabilistic framework, where the image patch is represented as a combination of components, each with its own mask and feature parameters.
The paper is well-structured and clearly written, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments. The introduction provides a thorough overview of the background and motivation for the work, and the related work section is comprehensive and well-referenced. The technical sections are detailed and well-explained, with a clear description of the model, the inference algorithm, and the experimental setup.
The strengths of the paper include the novelty of the approach, the thorough evaluation of the model on both artificial and natural image data, and the clear presentation of the results. The authors also provide a detailed discussion of the implications of their work and its potential applications.
One potential weakness of the paper is the complexity of the model and the inference algorithm, which may make it difficult to implement and apply in practice. Additionally, the authors could provide more insight into the choice of the cost function and the motivation behind the setup, particularly in the context of importance sampling.
The paper is original and significant, as it presents a new approach to image encoding that captures occlusions and invariances, which is a challenging problem in computer vision. The results are impressive, with the model learning meaningful components and receptive fields that are similar to those found in the visual cortex.
The paper is well-suited for the NIPS conference, as it presents a novel and significant contribution to the field of computer vision and machine learning. The authors demonstrate a clear understanding of the background and related work, and the paper is well-written and easy to follow.
