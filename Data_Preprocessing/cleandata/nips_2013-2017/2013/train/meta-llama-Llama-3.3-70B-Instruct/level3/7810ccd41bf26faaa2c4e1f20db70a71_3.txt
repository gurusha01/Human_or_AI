This paper proposes a novel method for speeding up object detection algorithms by approximating template evaluation using Vector Quantization (VQ). The authors argue that their approach, which they call Fast Template Vector Quantization (FTVQ), can achieve a substantial end-to-end speedup over existing methods without sacrificing accuracy. The key idea is to quantize the feature vectors in each cell of the image pyramid into a set of clusters, and then use a lookup table to approximate the dot product between the template and the feature vector.
The paper is well-written and clearly explains the motivation, methodology, and experimental results. The authors provide a thorough review of previous work in the area and demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on several benchmark datasets, including PASCAL VOC 2007. The results show that FTVQ can achieve a significant speedup over existing methods, including deformable part models and exemplar SVM detectors, while maintaining comparable accuracy.
One of the strengths of the paper is its clarity and organization. The authors provide a clear overview of the methodology and experimental results, making it easy to follow and understand the paper. The paper also provides a thorough analysis of the computational cost of the proposed method and compares it to existing methods.
However, one potential weakness of the paper is that it does not provide a detailed analysis of the trade-offs between speed and accuracy. While the authors demonstrate that FTVQ can achieve a significant speedup without sacrificing accuracy, it would be useful to see a more detailed analysis of the relationship between the number of clusters and the accuracy of the method.
Another potential weakness is that the paper does not provide a clear comparison to other state-of-the-art methods. While the authors compare their method to several existing methods, it would be useful to see a more comprehensive comparison to other recent methods in the area.
Overall, the paper is well-written and provides a significant contribution to the field of object detection. The proposed method has the potential to be widely adopted in practice, and the authors provide a clear and thorough explanation of the methodology and experimental results.
