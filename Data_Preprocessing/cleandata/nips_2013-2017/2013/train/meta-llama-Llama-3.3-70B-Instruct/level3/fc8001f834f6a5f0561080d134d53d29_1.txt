This paper presents a novel approach to calculating firing rates in tightly balanced neural networks, which is a significant contribution to the field of systems neuroscience. The authors develop a technique that relates firing rates directly to network input, connectivity, and function, allowing for a deeper understanding of the computational role of firing rate responses. The paper is well-written and interesting, with a clear and concise presentation of the main ideas.
A key strength of the paper is the identification of the non-linear relationship between firing rates, connectivity, input, and optimal signal representation as the solution to a quadratic programming problem. This contribution, particularly Property 1, shows the applicability of the proposed method to certain spaces and provides a new perspective on the long-standing problem of relating firing rate statistics to neural signal representation.
However, one potential weakness of the paper is that its contribution may not be closely related to learning and neural computing, with learning playing a limited role in the proposed method. The authors' feedback clarifies the role of learning in the method, explaining why it cannot be absent and why it should be simple, but this aspect of the paper could be further developed.
The paper's quality is high, with a clear and well-organized presentation of the main ideas. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the problem, and the results are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The paper's originality is also notable, as it presents a novel combination of familiar techniques to address a significant problem in systems neuroscience.
The significance of the paper lies in its potential to advance our understanding of neural computation and the role of firing rates in neural networks. The results have implications for the interpretation of tuning curve shape and the impact of tuning curve inhomogeneity on neural computation, and the approach promises to be useful in other areas of neuroscience, such as data analysis and the study of computational neurodegeneration.
