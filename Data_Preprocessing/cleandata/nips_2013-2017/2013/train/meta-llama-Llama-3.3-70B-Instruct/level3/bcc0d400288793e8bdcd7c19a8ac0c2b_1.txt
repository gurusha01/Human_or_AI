This paper proposes a novel approach to playing the game of Tetris using approximate dynamic programming (ADP) algorithms. The authors conjecture that Tetris is a game in which good policies are easier to represent and learn than their corresponding value functions, and therefore, ADP algorithms that search in a policy space should perform better than those that search in a value function space. To test this conjecture, the authors apply a classification-based modified policy iteration (CBMPI) algorithm to Tetris and compare its performance with the cross-entropy (CE) method and the λ-policy iteration (λ-PI) algorithm.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and detailed description of the CBMPI algorithm and its application to Tetris. The experimental results show that CBMPI outperforms the CE method and λ-PI algorithm in both small and large boards, and achieves a new record in the large board of Tetris with an average score of 51,000,000 lines.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The authors provide a clear and detailed description of the CBMPI algorithm and its application to Tetris.
* The experimental results are well-presented and demonstrate the effectiveness of the CBMPI algorithm.
* The paper provides a thorough comparison with other state-of-the-art methods, including the CE method and λ-PI algorithm.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The authors do not provide a clear explanation of why the CBMPI algorithm performs better than the CE method and λ-PI algorithm.
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the CBMPI algorithm and its comparison with other methods.
* The authors do not provide a clear discussion of the limitations of the CBMPI algorithm and its potential applications to other domains.
Overall, the paper is well-written and provides a significant contribution to the field of ADP and Tetris. The experimental results are impressive, and the paper provides a thorough comparison with other state-of-the-art methods. However, the authors could provide more insight into the reasons behind the effectiveness of the CBMPI algorithm and its potential limitations.
