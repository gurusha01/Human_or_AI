This paper proposes a novel method for speeding up object detection algorithms by approximating the scoring function using Vector Quantization (VQ). The authors demonstrate that their approach can achieve a substantial speedup over existing methods without sacrificing accuracy. The paper is well-written, easy to follow, and provides clear illustrations and sufficient experiments to support the proposed solution.
The key strength of this paper is its ability to trade off speed and accuracy by adjusting the number of VQ levels and rescoring windows. The authors show that their method can be directly plugged into any recognition system that relies on linear templates, making it a versatile and widely applicable solution. The experimental results demonstrate a significant speedup over existing methods, including a two-order-of-magnitude speedup over the original deformable part model implementation.
One of the weaknesses of the paper is that it relies on a simple k-means procedure for quantizing the feature vectors, which may not be optimal for all cases. Additionally, the authors do not provide a detailed analysis of the computational cost of their method, which could be an important consideration for practical applications.
In terms of originality, the paper builds on existing work on VQ and cascade detection, but the combination of these techniques and the application to object detection is novel. The authors provide a clear discussion of related work and demonstrate how their approach differs from existing methods.
The significance of this paper lies in its potential to enable fast and accurate object detection in a wide range of applications, including real-time systems and large-scale detection tasks. The authors provide a detailed discussion of the implications of their work for training and demonstrate how their method can be used to speed up detector training algorithms.
