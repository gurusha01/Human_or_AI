This paper presents a novel approach to calculating firing rates in nonlinear state-space models using a Gaussian process prior and particle Markov chain Monte Carlo inference mechanism. The authors discuss computational efficiencies, including sparsity and low-rank Cholesky updates, to improve the performance of the proposed method. The use of ancestor sampling and online marginalisation of transition dynamics is a significant contribution, making the paper technically sound and strong.
The paper has the potential to stimulate discussion on inference methods for non-Markovian state-space models and the advantages of learning transition dynamics. The empirical results are brief but sufficient, although additional discussion on out-of-sample prediction and forecasting would be beneficial. The paper could be improved with clearer presentation of results, including an additional column in Table 1 to show out-of-sample prediction errors.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear explanation of their approach. However, there are some minor issues, such as the early use of an undefined abbreviation. Overall, the paper is a strong and novel contribution to the field.
