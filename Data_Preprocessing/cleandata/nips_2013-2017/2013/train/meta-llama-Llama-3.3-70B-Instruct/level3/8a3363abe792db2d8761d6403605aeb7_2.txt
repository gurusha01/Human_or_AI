This paper proposes a large-scale distributed framework for estimating sparse precision matrices using the CLIME estimator. The framework is based on an inexact alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm, which decomposes the constrained optimization problem into elementary matrix multiplications and element-wise operations. The authors establish convergence rates for both the objective and optimality conditions and demonstrate the scalability of their approach on shared-memory and distributed-memory architectures.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear overview of the problem, the proposed approach, and the experimental results. The use of block cyclic distribution to achieve load balancing is a key innovation, and the authors demonstrate its effectiveness in reducing the computational complexity of matrix multiplication.
The experimental results are impressive, with the proposed approach outperforming state-of-the-art methods in terms of scalability. The authors demonstrate that their approach can scale to millions of dimensions and run on hundreds of machines, making it a promising solution for large-scale precision matrix estimation.
One potential concern is the lack of comparison with other distributed optimization algorithms, such as those based on gradient descent or stochastic gradient descent. Additionally, the authors could provide more details on the implementation of the block cyclic distribution and the choice of block size, as these may have a significant impact on the performance of the algorithm.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of large-scale precision matrix estimation, and the proposed approach has the potential to be applied to a wide range of problems in machine learning and statistics.
