This paper proposes a novel approach to online POMDP planning, called Regularized DESPOT (R-DESPOT), which balances the size of a policy and its estimated performance under sampled scenarios. The algorithm constructs a Determinized Sparse Partially Observable Tree (DESPOT) and searches for a near-optimal policy using dynamic programming. The paper provides theoretical support for the approach, including a bound on the error of the estimated policy value, and demonstrates its effectiveness through experiments on several domains.
The strengths of the paper include its ability to scale up to large POMDPs, its robustness to outliers, and its improved performance compared to other online POMDP planning algorithms. The paper also provides a clear and detailed explanation of the algorithm and its theoretical foundations.
However, the paper has some weaknesses. The descriptions in the text and mathematical notations are sometimes unclear, making it difficult to understand certain concepts and definitions. The empirical results section lacks clarity on the setting of the alpha parameter and its sensitivity to changes, which is important for the formulation. Additionally, the paper's originality is not high, as it builds upon existing work in the field.
