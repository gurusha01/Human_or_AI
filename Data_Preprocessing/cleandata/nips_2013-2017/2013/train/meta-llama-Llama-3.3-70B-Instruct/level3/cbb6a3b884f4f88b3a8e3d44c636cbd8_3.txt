This paper proposes a novel approach to playing the game of Tetris using approximate dynamic programming (ADP) algorithms. The authors conjecture that Tetris is a game in which good policies are easier to represent and learn than their corresponding value functions, and therefore, ADP algorithms that search in a policy space should perform better than those that search in a value function space. To test this conjecture, the authors apply a classification-based modified policy iteration (CBMPI) algorithm to Tetris and compare its performance with the cross-entropy (CE) method and the λ-policy iteration (λ-PI) algorithm.
The paper is well-written and of high quality, with interesting technical content that appears to be sound. The authors provide a clear and detailed description of the CBMPI algorithm and its application to Tetris, as well as a thorough analysis of the experimental results. The results show that CBMPI outperforms the CE method and λ-PI in the small 10×10 board and achieves comparable performance with considerably fewer samples in the large 10×20 board.
However, there are some limitations to the proposed method. One limitation is that the CBMPI algorithm considers hierarchical classification as only classifying leaf nodes, which may not be realistic in real-world cases. Additionally, the paper's assumption that hierarchical classification is only about leaf node classification may not be accurate, and top-down methods may be more effective when classification is carried out in internal nodes. Furthermore, the proposed bounds may not be strict enough, as they do not consider feature distribution or relevance, which can have a significant impact on text categorization.
The paper could benefit from a closer comparison with other methods, such as those cited by the authors or other relevant research papers. The authors should also acknowledge the potential flaws in their theory and provide a more nuanced discussion of the results, rather than making overly broad claims. Nevertheless, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of ADP and Tetris, and the results are impressive and noteworthy.
