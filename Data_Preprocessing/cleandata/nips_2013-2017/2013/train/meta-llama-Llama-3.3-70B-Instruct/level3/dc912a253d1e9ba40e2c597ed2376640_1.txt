This paper proposes a novel distributed optimization algorithm, Distributed Stochastic Dual Coordinate Ascent (DisDCA), for solving regularized loss minimization problems in a distributed framework. The algorithm is designed to take advantage of the computational power of multiple machines or cores, and it enjoys strong theoretical guarantees and competitive practical performances.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, related work, and the proposed algorithm. The DisDCA algorithm is carefully designed, and the authors provide a rigorous analysis of its convergence rates and the tradeoff between computation and communication. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and its practical variant, which outperforms other distributed algorithms, including stochastic gradient descent and alternating direction methods of multipliers.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel distributed optimization algorithm that leverages the strengths of stochastic dual coordinate ascent methods.
* A rigorous analysis of the algorithm's convergence rates and the tradeoff between computation and communication.
* Competitive experimental results that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes a star network topology, which may not be applicable to all distributed optimization scenarios.
* The algorithm's performance may be sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters, such as the number of samples per iteration and the regularization parameter.
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with other distributed optimization algorithms and a more thorough analysis of the algorithm's scalability and robustness.
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of distributed optimization and provides a valuable addition to the existing literature. The proposed algorithm has the potential to be widely adopted in practice, and the authors' analysis and experimental results provide a solid foundation for further research and development.
