This paper presents a systematic approach to applying approximate dynamic programming (ADP) algorithms to the game of Tetris, a challenging optimization problem. The authors conjecture that Tetris is a game in which good policies are easier to represent and learn than their corresponding value functions, and therefore, ADP algorithms that search in a policy space should perform better than those that search in a value function space. To test this conjecture, the authors apply a classification-based modified policy iteration (CBMPI) algorithm to Tetris and compare its performance with the cross-entropy (CE) method and the λ-policy iteration (λ-PI) algorithm.
The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with a clear explanation of the algorithms and their implementation. The experimental results show that CBMPI outperforms the other ADP algorithms, including λ-PI, and achieves performance comparable to the CE method, but with significantly fewer samples. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the results, including a comparison of the best policies learned by each algorithm.
The strengths of the paper include its clear and concise writing style, the thorough experimental evaluation, and the interesting insights into the performance of ADP algorithms in Tetris. The authors also provide a detailed description of the algorithms and their implementation, which makes it easy to reproduce the results.
One potential weakness of the paper is that it focuses primarily on the performance of CBMPI in Tetris, without providing a more general analysis of the algorithm's strengths and weaknesses. Additionally, the authors could provide more discussion on the potential difficulties of applying the proposed ideas to other domains, and how the results might generalize to other problems.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, with well-supported claims and a clear explanation of the algorithms and their implementation. The authors are careful to evaluate both the strengths and weaknesses of the work, and provide a detailed analysis of the results. The paper is also well-organized and easy to follow, with a clear structure and concise writing style.
In terms of originality, the paper presents a novel application of CBMPI to Tetris, and provides new insights into the performance of ADP algorithms in this domain. The authors also provide a detailed comparison of CBMPI with other ADP algorithms, including λ-PI and CE, which adds to the originality of the paper.
In terms of significance, the paper addresses an important problem in the field of ADP, and provides new insights into the performance of ADP algorithms in Tetris. The results have the potential to impact the development of ADP algorithms and their application to other domains, and the paper provides a clear and concise explanation of the algorithms and their implementation, which makes it easy to reproduce the results.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, as it presents a well-written and technically sound contribution to the field of ADP, with a clear and concise explanation of the algorithms and their implementation, and a thorough experimental evaluation. The paper provides new insights into the performance of ADP algorithms in Tetris, and has the potential to impact the development of ADP algorithms and their application to other domains.
