This paper presents a novel approach to online Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) planning, called Determinized Sparse Partially Observable Tree (DESPOT). The authors propose an algorithm, Regularized DESPOT (R-DESPOT), which searches a DESPOT for an approximately optimal policy while balancing the size of the policy and the accuracy of its value estimate. The paper also introduces an anytime approximation of R-DESPOT, called Anytime Regularized DESPOT (AR-DESPOT).
The paper is well-motivated, clearly written, and thoroughly discusses its relation to relevant literature, making it easy to follow. The results in the paper appear correct, and the ideas presented are interesting and deserving of publication. The authors provide a thorough theoretical analysis of their approach, including a bound on the error of the estimated value of a policy derived from a DESPOT.
The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of AR-DESPOT in various domains, including Tag, LaserTag, RockSample, and Pocman. The results show that AR-DESPOT outperforms two of the fastest online POMDP planning algorithms, AEMS2 and POMCP, in some cases. The authors also provide a detailed discussion of the construction of upper and lower bounds for AR-DESPOT, which is an important aspect of the algorithm.
The strengths of the paper include its novel approach to online POMDP planning, its thorough theoretical analysis, and its experimental evaluation. The weaknesses of the paper include the fact that the appendix was not thoroughly checked, and some of the proofs and derivations are not provided in the main text.
Overall, I believe that this paper has value and deserves to be published. The ideas presented are interesting, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach. However, I would like to see some minor revisions to improve the clarity and readability of the paper.
