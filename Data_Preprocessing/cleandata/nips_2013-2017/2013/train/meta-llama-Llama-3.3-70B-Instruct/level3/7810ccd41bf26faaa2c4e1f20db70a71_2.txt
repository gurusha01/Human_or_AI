This paper proposes a method to speed up object detection by approximating scores using Vector Quantization (VQ) and combining it with a cascade framework. The authors demonstrate that their approach can achieve a substantial end-to-end speedup over existing methods without loss of accuracy. The key idea is to quantize the feature vectors in each cell of the HOG feature pyramid into clusters and pre-compute the partial dot product of each template cell with all possible centroids. This allows for fast approximation of the dot product using a lookup table.
The paper is well-written and clearly explains the methodology and experimental results. The authors provide a thorough comparison with existing methods and demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on two well-known object detection algorithms: deformable part models and exemplar SVM detectors. The results show that the proposed method can achieve a significant speedup, with a 25-fold speedup in convolution and an 8-fold speedup in overall detection time, without sacrificing accuracy.
One of the strengths of the paper is its clarity and organization. The authors provide a clear overview of the methodology and experimental results, making it easy to follow and understand. The paper also provides a thorough discussion of the related work and the advantages and limitations of the proposed approach.
However, there are a few areas where the paper could be improved. For example, the authors could provide more details on the computational complexity of the proposed method and compare it with existing methods. Additionally, the authors could discuss the potential applications of the proposed method in real-time object detection tasks and provide more insights into the trade-offs between speed and accuracy.
In terms of originality, the paper proposes a novel combination of Vector Quantization and cascade framework for fast object detection. While Vector Quantization has been used in other contexts, its application to object detection is new and interesting. The paper also provides a thorough evaluation of the proposed method and demonstrates its effectiveness on two well-known object detection algorithms.
Overall, the paper is well-written, clearly explains the methodology and experimental results, and demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of object detection and could be of interest to researchers and practitioners working in this area.
