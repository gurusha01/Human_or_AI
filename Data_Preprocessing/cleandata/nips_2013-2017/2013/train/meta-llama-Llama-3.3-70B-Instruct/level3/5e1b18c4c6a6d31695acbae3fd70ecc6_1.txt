This paper proposes a novel approach to accelerating the processing of documents in tasks like classification by compressing them using a coding scheme related to the Lempel-Ziv algorithm. The method is formulated as a combinatorial optimization problem and solved approximately using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). The authors demonstrate that their approach achieves gains in memory and computational efficiency with only a minor loss in precision.
The paper's method for minimizing a certain equation involves computing the Fenchel conjugate of a norm, which can be done using existing algorithms for projecting on the simplex. The proposed approach seems novel and performs well, with experiments demonstrating its effectiveness in text classification problems.
The reviewer finds the approach interesting but has minor remarks, including the need for clarification on the optimality of the coding scheme and the interpretation of the reweighting scheme. However, the paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear explanation of their methodology and results.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of their work. The paper is also well-organized and clearly written, making it easy to follow and understand.
Regarding originality, the paper proposes a new approach to document compression and classification, which is a novel combination of familiar techniques. The authors adequately reference related work and clearly explain how their approach differs from previous contributions.
The significance of the paper lies in its potential to improve the efficiency of document processing in various applications, including text classification. The results are important, and other researchers or practitioners are likely to use or build upon these ideas. The paper advances the state of the art in a demonstrable way, providing a unique theoretical and pragmatic approach to document compression and classification.
Overall, the reviewer recommends accepting the paper, citing its novelty, technical soundness, and potential impact on the field. The minor remarks can be addressed through revisions, and the paper's strengths outweigh its weaknesses.
