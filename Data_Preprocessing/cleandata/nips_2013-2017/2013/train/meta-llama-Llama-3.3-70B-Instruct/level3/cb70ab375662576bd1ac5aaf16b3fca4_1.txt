This paper proposes a novel approach to modeling multivariate count data using graphical models. The authors introduce three new classes of Poisson-like graphical models, namely the Truncated Poisson Graphical Model (TPGM), the Quadratic Poisson Graphical Model (QPGM), and the Sublinear Poisson Graphical Model (SPGM), which can capture both positive and negative conditional dependencies between count-valued variables.
The paper is well-organized and clearly written, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments. The introduction provides a thorough overview of the existing literature on graphical models for count data, highlighting the limitations of current approaches. The authors then present their new models, providing detailed derivations and proofs of their properties.
The TPGM is a natural extension of the Poisson graphical model, obtained by truncating the domain of the Poisson distribution. The QPGM and SPGM are more innovative, modifying the base measure and sufficient statistics of the Poisson distribution to allow for positive and negative dependencies. The authors provide theoretical guarantees for the normalizability of these models and demonstrate their performance on simulated and real-world data.
The experimental evaluation is thorough, comparing the proposed models to existing approaches, including Gaussian graphical models and the original Poisson graphical model. The results show that the TPGM and SPGM outperform these methods, especially in high-dimensional settings. The case study on breast cancer microRNA networks is particularly impressive, highlighting the potential of these models in real-world applications.
The paper's strengths include its clear exposition, rigorous theoretical analysis, and comprehensive experimental evaluation. The authors also provide a detailed discussion of the limitations and potential extensions of their work.
However, there are some areas for improvement. The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison to other existing methods for modeling count data, such as log-linear models and copula-based approaches. Additionally, the authors could provide more insight into the interpretation of the model parameters and the conditional dependencies captured by the proposed models.
In terms of originality, the paper builds upon existing work on graphical models and Poisson distributions, but the authors' contributions are significant and novel. The proposed models address a long-standing limitation of Poisson graphical models, and the experimental evaluation demonstrates their potential in practice.
Overall, this paper is a strong contribution to the field of graphical models and count data analysis. The authors' work has the potential to impact various applications, including genomics, neuroscience, and social network analysis. I recommend accepting this paper for publication, with minor revisions to address the suggestions mentioned above.
