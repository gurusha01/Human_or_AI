This paper introduces a distributed stochastic dual coordinate ascent (DisDCA) algorithm for solving regularized loss minimization problems in a distributed framework. The algorithm is designed to optimize the dual problem of the regularized loss minimization problem, and it enjoys a strong guarantee of convergence rates for smooth or non-smooth loss functions. The paper provides a rigorous analysis of the tradeoff between computation and communication, and it presents a practical variant of the DisDCA algorithm that yields substantial improvements over the basic variant.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear motivation for their work. The introduction provides a good overview of the problem and the related work, and the technical sections are well-organized and easy to follow. The authors also provide a thorough analysis of the tradeoff between computation and communication, which is a key aspect of distributed optimization algorithms.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The DisDCA algorithm is a novel contribution to the field of distributed optimization, and it has the potential to be widely applicable to many machine learning problems.
* The paper provides a rigorous analysis of the tradeoff between computation and communication, which is a key aspect of distributed optimization algorithms.
* The practical variant of the DisDCA algorithm yields substantial improvements over the basic variant, and it is a useful contribution to the field.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes that the loss function is convex and the regularization function is strongly convex, which may not be the case in all machine learning problems.
* The paper does not provide a thorough comparison with other distributed optimization algorithms, such as distributed stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and distributed alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM).
* The paper does not provide a clear discussion of the limitations of the DisDCA algorithm and the potential challenges of implementing it in practice.
Overall, the paper is a strong contribution to the field of distributed optimization, and it has the potential to be widely applicable to many machine learning problems. However, the authors could improve the paper by providing a more thorough comparison with other distributed optimization algorithms and a clearer discussion of the limitations of the DisDCA algorithm.
