This paper presents a novel approach to learning chordal Markov networks by reformulating it as a constraint satisfaction problem. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method in computing optimal structures for previously unresolved problems. The key strengths of this paper include its ability to provide a new perspective on the field, its capability to solve complex problems, and its potential to advance the state of the art in exact structure learning.
However, the approach has scalability limitations due to the exponential growth in propositional variables, which restricts its application to larger examples. Additionally, the paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison to existing literature on learning DAGs, such as the works by Koivisto and Sood, to provide valuable context and insights.
The paper is well-written, and the authors have made a significant contribution to the field. The use of a new approach to learn chordal Markov networks is a notable strength, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the method. The paper also provides a clear and concise explanation of the technical details, making it easy to follow.
To further improve the paper, I would suggest the following:
* Provide a more detailed comparison to existing literature on learning DAGs to contextualize the contribution of the paper.
* Discuss potential ways to address the scalability limitations of the approach.
* Consider exploring the application of the method to other areas of research, such as Bayesian Network learning.
Overall, I believe that this paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field, and with some revisions, it could be even stronger.
