This paper proposes a novel approach to symbolic planning under uncertainty with factored states and actions, addressing the scalability issues of existing methods. The authors introduce two main contributions: Factored Action Modified Policy Iteration (FA-MPI) and Opportunistic Policy Iteration (OPI). FA-MPI extends Modified Policy Iteration to factored action spaces, while OPI is a more conservative variant that opportunistically enforces policy constraints to prevent growth in the representation of the value function.
The paper is well-structured, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the background, motivations, and technical details of their approach. The empirical evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of OPI in improving scalability over state-of-the-art symbolic planners, particularly in domains with large action spaces.
The strengths of the paper include:
* A clear and well-motivated introduction to the problem of symbolic planning under uncertainty with factored states and actions
* A thorough explanation of the technical details of FA-MPI and OPI, including pseudocode and examples
* An empirical evaluation that demonstrates the effectiveness of OPI in improving scalability over state-of-the-art symbolic planners
However, there are some weaknesses and limitations:
* The empirical evaluation is limited to a few domains, and it would be beneficial to see more extensive experiments to demonstrate the generality of the approach
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison to other related work, such as approximate value iteration methods
* The authors mention that the growth of the value and policy diagrams with problem complexity is a bottleneck toward scalability, but they do not provide a clear solution to this issue
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of symbolic planning under uncertainty, and the proposed approach has the potential to improve scalability in large action spaces. However, further work is needed to address the limitations and weaknesses mentioned above.
