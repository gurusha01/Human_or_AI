This paper proposes a novel distributed optimization algorithm, Distributed Stochastic Dual Coordinate Ascent (DisDCA), for solving regularized loss minimization problems in a distributed framework. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the tradeoff between computation and communication, and their experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of DisDCA in comparison to other distributed algorithms.
The paper is well-written and well-organized, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments and understand their contributions. The introduction provides a clear motivation for the work, and the related work section provides a comprehensive overview of existing distributed optimization techniques.
The technical contributions of the paper are significant, and the authors provide a rigorous analysis of the convergence rates of DisDCA. The practical variant of DisDCA, which leverages up-to-date information for updating dual variables, is a notable improvement over the basic variant. The comparison with ADMM provides valuable insights into the differences between the two algorithms and highlights the advantages of DisDCA.
The experimental results are thorough and demonstrate the effectiveness of DisDCA in optimizing SVMs. The tradeoff between communication and computation is well-visualized, and the results show that DisDCA is a strong competitor to other distributed algorithms.
However, there are some minor errors and areas for improvement. For example, there are some missing spaces and incorrect notations in the text. Additionally, some of the figures could be improved for better clarity.
Overall, I would rate this paper as a strong accept. The technical contributions are significant, and the paper is well-written and well-organized. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of DisDCA, and the comparison with ADMM provides valuable insights.
