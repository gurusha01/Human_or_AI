This paper presents a novel approach to approximate inference in high-treewidth graphical models by projecting the intractable distribution onto a "fast-mixing" set, where Gibbs sampling is guaranteed to converge rapidly to the stationary distribution. The authors propose a dual algorithm to solve the projection under several divergences, including Euclidean distance, piecewise KL-divergence, and reversed KL-divergence.
The paper's technical contributions, such as the extension of TEMs to the MIMO setting, are notable. However, the connection to neuroscience is tenuous, and the significance of the work is limited. The examples in section 5 are instructive, but the use of real video and audio datasets would have strengthened the connection to neuroscience and demonstrated the approach's practical applicability.
One of the major concerns is with Theorem 1, which needs to be corrected or clarified. The sufficient and necessary conditions for signal recovery are not clearly stated, and the condition for signal recovery may not be sufficient if all filter kernels are the same. A linear independence condition may be needed to guarantee signal recovery.
Additionally, the definition of the IAF-TEM does not appear to account for neurons having different parameters, which could affect the signal recovery process. The paper's claim that it constitutes the first tractable computational model for multisensory integration is incorrect, as other works, such as those by Wei & Koerding and Ernst & Banks, precede it.
The notation in section 3 is cumbersome, and some terms, such as "BIBO-stable" and "j" as the complex unit, need to be defined or clarified. The paper's technical contributions are notable, but the connection to neuroscience is limited, and the significance of the work is not fully demonstrated.
