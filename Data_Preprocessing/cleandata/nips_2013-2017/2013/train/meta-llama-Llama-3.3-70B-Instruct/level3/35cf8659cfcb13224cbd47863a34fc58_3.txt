This paper presents a comprehensive study on flat and hierarchical classification strategies in the context of large-scale taxonomies. The authors propose a multiclass, hierarchical data-dependent bound on the generalization error of classifiers deployed in large-scale taxonomies, which provides an explanation for several empirical results reported in the literature. They also introduce a well-founded way to select nodes that should be pruned in the original taxonomy, using a meta-classifier that derives features from the error generalization bounds.
The paper is well-written, with good spelling, grammar, and citations. However, there are some areas that could be improved. For instance, some sentences start with citations, which could be rephrased for better clarity. The theory presented is succinct and builds upon existing work on learning Bayesian network structures, using functions like f() and g() throughout the paper.
The evaluation method using AUC is unclear and needs explanation, and the experimental results should be presented for a larger dataset. The contribution of the algorithm is the agglomerative method, which is well-summarized in Table 1, but the experimental work is illustrative rather than comparative.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of the work. The paper is clearly written, well-organized, and adequately informs the reader.
The originality of the paper lies in the introduction of a data-dependent error generalization bound for multiclass, hierarchical classifiers, which provides a theoretical explanation for the performance of flat and hierarchical classification strategies in large-scale taxonomies. The significance of the results is that they provide a well-founded way to simplify a taxonomy by selectively pruning some of its nodes, and the experimental results are in line with the theoretical developments.
The pros of accepting this paper include:
* The paper presents a comprehensive study on flat and hierarchical classification strategies in large-scale taxonomies.
* The authors propose a well-founded way to select nodes that should be pruned in the original taxonomy.
* The experimental results are in line with the theoretical developments.
The cons of accepting this paper include:
* The evaluation method using AUC is unclear and needs explanation.
* The experimental results should be presented for a larger dataset.
* The experimental work is illustrative rather than comparative.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, as it presents a significant contribution to the field of machine learning and provides a well-founded way to simplify a taxonomy by selectively pruning some of its nodes. However, the authors should address the areas mentioned above to improve the clarity and quality of the paper.
