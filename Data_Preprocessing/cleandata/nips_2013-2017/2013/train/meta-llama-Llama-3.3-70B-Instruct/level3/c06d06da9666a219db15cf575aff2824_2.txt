This paper presents a novel approach to approximate inference in high-treewidth graphical models by projecting the original distribution onto a "fast-mixing" set, where Gibbs sampling is guaranteed to converge rapidly. The authors formulate the problem as a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) and propose several divergences to measure the distance between the original and projected distributions.
The paper's main strengths lie in its originality and significance. The idea of using fast-mixing distributions as a tractable family is innovative and has the potential to advance the state of the art in approximate inference. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the problem, including a detailed discussion of the spectral norm bound and its looseness. The experimental evaluation is also comprehensive, comparing the proposed methods to several standard variational methods and Gibbs sampling on the original parameters.
However, the paper also has some weaknesses. The approach has limited practical value due to the exponential number of constraints required to formulate the CSP problem, which limits its scalability. The authors acknowledge this limitation and suggest exploring approximate or bounded CSP formulations that relax certain conditions to remain tractable. Additionally, the spectral norm bound used to guarantee rapid mixing is conservative, and a tighter bound would be more informative.
To improve the paper, I suggest the authors explore the following directions:
1. Investigate approximate or bounded CSP formulations that can reduce the computational complexity of the approach.
2. Develop a tighter bound on the spectral norm that can guarantee rapid mixing, which would make the approach more informative and useful in practice.
3. Incorporate a non-uniform prior on graph structures to learn sparse or low-treewidth models, which could improve the accuracy and efficiency of the approach.
Overall, I believe that this paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of approximate inference, and with some revisions to address the limitations and suggestions mentioned above, it could be even stronger.
