This paper proposes a novel method for calculating firing rates in tightly balanced networks, which is a significant contribution to the field of systems neuroscience. The authors develop a technique that directly identifies the non-linear relationship between firing rates, connectivity, input, and optimal signal representation, without requiring linearizing approximations. The approach is based on the idea that balanced network dynamics can be interpreted as an algorithm that optimizes a loss function, which is a quadratic programming problem.
The paper is well-organized and clearly written, with convincing experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the relationship between firing rates, input, connectivity, and function, and explore the computational function of tuning curve shapes and the network mechanisms that generate these tuning curves.
The strengths of the paper include its originality, technical soundness, and significance. The proposed method is a novel contribution to the field, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of its strengths and weaknesses. The paper is also well-written and easy to follow, making it accessible to a broad audience.
The weaknesses of the paper are minor. One potential limitation is that the method is limited to tightly balanced networks, which may not be representative of all neural networks. Additionally, the authors could provide more discussion on the potential applications of the proposed method in other areas of neuroscience, such as data analysis and computational neurodegeneration.
Overall, I believe that this paper is a strong contribution to the field of systems neuroscience and deserves to be accepted. The proposed method has the potential to advance our understanding of neural computation and provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying neural activity.
