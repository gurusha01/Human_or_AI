This paper proposes novel graphical models for count-valued data, addressing the limitations of existing Poisson graphical models which can only capture negative conditional dependencies. The authors introduce three new approaches: the Truncated Poisson Graphical Model (TPGM), the Quadratic Poisson Graphical Model (QPGM), and the Sublinear Poisson Graphical Model (SPGM). These models can capture both positive and negative dependencies among variables, making them more suitable for real-world applications.
The paper is well-organized, and the authors provide a clear overview of the limitations of existing models and the motivations behind their new approaches. The technical derivations are sound, and the numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed models in recovering network structures from count-valued data.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of novel graphical models that can capture both positive and negative dependencies among count-valued variables.
* The thorough analysis of the limitations of existing Poisson graphical models and the motivations behind the new approaches.
* The sound technical derivations and the demonstration of the effectiveness of the proposed models through numerical experiments.
However, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement:
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with existing methods, particularly in terms of computational efficiency and scalability.
* Some of the figures and tables could be improved for better clarity and readability.
* The authors could provide more insights into the interpretation of the results and the implications of the proposed models for real-world applications.
