This paper proposes a relevance topic model (RTM) that integrates sparse Bayesian learning and replicated softmax for automatic classification of unstructured social group activity videos. The RTM jointly learns discriminative topics and sparse classifier weights, demonstrating better performance compared to other supervised topic models and baseline algorithms. The paper is well-organized and well-motivated, with adequate citations of relevant research papers, and proposes ideas useful in video scene analysis, classification, and recognition.
The strengths of the paper include its ability to jointly learn discriminative topics and sparse classifier weights, which leads to improved performance. The use of sparse Bayesian learning and replicated softmax is also a notable contribution. Additionally, the paper provides a clear and well-structured presentation of the proposed model and its experimental results.
However, there are some weaknesses in the paper. The use of sparsity on the BOW representation, classifier, and hierarchical prior on the weight is not clearly explained, and the significance of the proposed RTM compared to previous research is not well-established. The mathematical equations in Section 3.3 are complex and difficult to follow, making it hard to understand the technical details of the proposed model. Furthermore, the experimental results show good performance, but the experimental backup is weak due to poor generalization and limited comparison to other baseline methods.
To improve the paper, I suggest comparing the proposed algorithm to other baselines that extract topics via previous replicated softmax models but learn classifier weights separately to reveal the strength of the joint learning approach. This would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the proposed model and help to establish its significance in the field.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, but the claims could be better supported by theoretical analysis or experimental results. The paper is a complete piece of work, but the authors could be more careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of the work. The clarity of the paper is good, but the mathematical equations in Section 3.3 could be improved for better understanding. The originality of the paper is notable, but the authors could provide more references to related work to establish the significance of the proposed model. The significance of the paper is good, but the authors could provide more insights into the potential applications and impact of the proposed model.
Overall, I would rate this paper as a good scientific contribution to the field, but with some areas for improvement. With some revisions to address the weaknesses mentioned above, the paper has the potential to be a strong contribution to the field of video scene analysis and classification.
