This paper proposes decision jungles, a novel approach to classification problems using ensembles of rooted decision directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). The authors argue that traditional decision trees face a fundamental limitation due to their exponential growth with depth, which can be problematic for memory-constrained hardware. Decision jungles aim to address this issue by jointly optimizing the features and structure of the DAGs, resulting in compact and powerful discriminative models.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear explanation of their approach, including the formulation of the objective function and the optimization methods used. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of decision jungles in reducing memory consumption while improving generalization on several classification tasks.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to provide a novel solution to a well-known problem in machine learning. The authors have successfully demonstrated that decision jungles can outperform traditional decision forests and other baselines in terms of memory efficiency and generalization. The paper also provides a thorough evaluation of the approach, including a comparison of different optimization methods and an analysis of the effect of model width on performance.
However, there are some limitations to the paper. The conceptual advance is relatively small compared to previous work, such as Ref. 13 by Bourdoukan et al. Much of the content has already been described in previous publications, and the paper's contribution is mostly limited to the calculation of firing rates, which was also essentially done by Bourdoukan et al in 2012. Additionally, the proposed balanced networks have a specific structure that limits their ability to model divergence and convergence, hallmark features of neural circuits.
To improve the paper, the authors could provide more clarification on certain points, such as the corrections to Eq. 3, Figure 1 legend, and Line 187. They could also consider addressing the limitations of their approach and providing more discussion on the potential applications and extensions of decision jungles.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, and significance. The paper is technically sound, well-organized, and provides enough information for the expert reader to reproduce the results. The authors have also demonstrated the importance of their work and its potential impact on the field.
