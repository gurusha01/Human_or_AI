This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of graphical models for count data, addressing a major limitation of existing Poisson graphical models. The authors propose three novel approaches to modify the Poisson distribution, allowing for the capture of both positive and negative conditional dependencies between count-valued variables. The paper is well-organized, and the writing is clear, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments.
The strengths of the paper include:
1. Originality: The paper introduces new and innovative approaches to modeling count data, which is a significant contribution to the field.
2. Technical soundness: The mathematical analysis is thorough, and the authors provide rigorous proofs to support their claims.
3. Significance: The paper addresses a crucial limitation of existing Poisson graphical models, making it a valuable contribution to the field.
However, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement:
1. Clarity: While the writing is generally clear, some sections, such as the derivation of the Quadratic Poisson Graphical Model, could be improved for better readability.
2. Figures and tables: Figure 3, which depicts the sublinear statistic, could be resized and reorganized for better presentation.
3. Minor corrections: Equations 7, 25, and 26 require minor corrections, including formatting issues and potential notation errors.
The paper's claim about p_i = 0.5 giving the highest level of regularization needs further clarification to justify the current heuristic in dropout. Additionally, the authors could provide more insight into the choice of R and R0 in the Sublinear Poisson Graphical Model.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the authors have made a significant contribution to the field. With some minor revisions to address the mentioned weaknesses, the paper has the potential to be a high-quality publication.
