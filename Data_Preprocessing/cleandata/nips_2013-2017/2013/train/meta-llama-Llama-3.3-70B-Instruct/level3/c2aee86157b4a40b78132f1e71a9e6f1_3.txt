This paper presents a novel online POMDP planning algorithm, Regularized DESPOT (R-DESPOT), which combines classical search methods and Monte Carlo sampling to alleviate the difficulties of POMDP planning. The algorithm constructs a Determinized Sparse Partially Observable Tree (DESPOT) to capture the execution of all policies under a set of sampled scenarios, and then searches for a near-optimal policy by balancing the size of the policy and its estimated value under the sampled scenarios.
The paper is well-written and provides a clear explanation of the algorithm and its theoretical analysis. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of R-DESPOT and its anytime approximation, AR-DESPOT, in comparison to other state-of-the-art online POMDP planning algorithms. The results show that AR-DESPOT is competitive with AEMS2 on smaller POMDPs and scales up better on large POMDPs, and it outperforms POMCP on problems with large observation spaces.
However, there are some areas that could be improved. The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the algorithm's strengths and weaknesses, including intuitive examples of problems where the algorithm should do well or poorly. Additionally, the authors should address whether the algorithm requires prior knowledge to perform well and provide empirical comparisons with an uninformed default policy. The introduction claims that the algorithm has better worst-case behavior, but this depends on the optimal policy tree being "small", which may not always be the case.
The experiments may not be a fair comparison, as the algorithm is given a domain-specific default policy, which constitutes prior knowledge not supplied to other methods. The paper could also benefit from more discussion on the construction of upper and lower bounds, which are crucial for the performance of AR-DESPOT.
Overall, the paper presents a novel and interesting approach to online POMDP planning, and the experimental results demonstrate its potential as a viable alternative to UCT-like algorithms. However, further work is needed to fully understand the strengths and weaknesses of the algorithm and to improve its performance in practice.
