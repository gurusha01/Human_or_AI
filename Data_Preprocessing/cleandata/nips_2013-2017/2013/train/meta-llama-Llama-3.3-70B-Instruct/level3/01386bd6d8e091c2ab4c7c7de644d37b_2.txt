This paper proposes a distributed stochastic dual coordinate ascent (DisDCA) algorithm for solving regularized loss minimization problems in a distributed framework. The algorithm is designed to take advantage of the computational power of multiple machines or cores to optimize large-scale machine learning problems. The paper provides a detailed analysis of the tradeoff between computation and communication, and presents a practical variant of the algorithm that yields substantial improvements over the basic variant.
The paper is well-written and clearly organized, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments and understand the proposed algorithm. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the convergence rates of the algorithm and demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments on real-world datasets.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to bridge the gap between stochastic dual coordinate ascent algorithms and distributed optimization. The authors provide a clear motivation for their research and demonstrate how their algorithm can be applied to various machine learning problems.
However, there are some limitations to the paper. The authors assume that the loss function is convex and the regularization term is strongly convex, which may not always be the case in practice. Additionally, the paper does not provide a detailed comparison with other distributed optimization algorithms, such as distributed stochastic gradient descent or distributed alternating direction methods of multipliers.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound and provides a clear and concise presentation of the proposed algorithm and its analysis. The authors provide a thorough discussion of the tradeoff between computation and communication and demonstrate the effectiveness of their algorithm through experiments.
The clarity of the paper is also excellent, with clear and concise writing and well-organized sections. The authors provide a detailed introduction to the problem and the proposed algorithm, making it easy for readers to understand the context and the contributions of the paper.
The originality of the paper is also high, as it proposes a new algorithm that bridges the gap between stochastic dual coordinate ascent and distributed optimization. The authors provide a clear motivation for their research and demonstrate how their algorithm can be applied to various machine learning problems.
The significance of the paper is also high, as it provides a new approach to distributed optimization that can be applied to large-scale machine learning problems. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their algorithm through experiments and provide a clear analysis of the tradeoff between computation and communication.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication. The paper is well-written, technically sound, and provides a clear and concise presentation of the proposed algorithm and its analysis. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their algorithm through experiments and provide a clear motivation for their research.
