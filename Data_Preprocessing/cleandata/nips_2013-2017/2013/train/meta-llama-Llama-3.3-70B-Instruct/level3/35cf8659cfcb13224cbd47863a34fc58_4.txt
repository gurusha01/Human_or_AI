This paper proposes a novel approach to hierarchical classification in large-scale taxonomies, providing a data-dependent bound on the generalization error of multiclass hierarchical classifiers. The authors introduce a meta-classifier to select nodes to prune in the taxonomy, leading to improved classification performance. The paper is well-structured, and the theoretical developments are sound. However, there are some limitations and areas for improvement.
The paper's main strengths are its novel theoretical contributions, including the introduction of a hierarchical Rademacher data-dependent bound and an asymptotic approximation error bound for multiclass logistic regression classifiers. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed pruning strategy, and the results are in line with previous studies.
However, the paper could benefit from more comparisons to other hierarchical network models, which would help assess the performance of the proposed approach. Additionally, the description of the new likelihood function and the recursive updating of sufficient statistics could be improved for better clarity. The use of the term "nonparametric" is also questionable, as the approach seems more akin to model selection than nonparametric methods.
The experiments, while demonstrating the benefits of hierarchical community discovery, are limited by the small size of the tested networks and the lack of comparison to other hierarchical network models. Furthermore, the paper builds on prior work on Bayesian rose trees but fails to mention other relevant Bayesian nonparametric models that could potentially discover more refined latent structures.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, but the claims could be better supported by more extensive experimental results. The clarity of the paper is good, but some sections, such as the description of the meta-classifier, could be improved. The originality of the paper lies in its novel theoretical contributions and the proposed pruning strategy, which is a significant improvement over existing methods. The significance of the paper is high, as it addresses a difficult problem in hierarchical classification and provides a well-founded way to simplify taxonomies.
