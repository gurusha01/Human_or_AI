This paper studies the problem of matrix completion with side information on rows and columns, which is a fundamental problem in machine learning. The authors propose a model that decomposes the matrix of interest using known side information, resulting in fewer degrees of freedom and better sample complexity guarantees. The paper analyzes an extension of nuclear norm minimization and achieves a sample complexity of O(μ^2 r (ra + rb) log n) for an n x n matrix of rank r.
The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their algorithm through simulations and experiments in multi-label learning, outperforming standard matrix completion algorithms and baselines. However, the paper's contribution is considered small, with novel but not particularly innovative proof techniques. The experiments could be presented better with graphs instead of tables.
The reviewer raises questions about the role of certain conditions and parameters in the paper, such as Ω0 and Ω1, and the necessity of an upper bound on the sample complexity. The reviewer also suggests that the paper's title is misleading, implying a focus on computational speedup rather than the actual contribution to matrix completion literature.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The paper is clearly written, and the organization is good. However, the originality of the paper is limited, and the problems or approaches are not entirely new. The significance of the results is moderate, and the paper addresses a difficult problem in a better way than previous research, but the improvement is not substantial.
Overall, the reviewer recommends accepting the paper, but with some revisions to address the raised questions and improve the presentation of the experiments. The pros of accepting the paper include its technical soundness, clear writing, and moderate significance. The cons include the limited originality, small contribution, and misleading title.
