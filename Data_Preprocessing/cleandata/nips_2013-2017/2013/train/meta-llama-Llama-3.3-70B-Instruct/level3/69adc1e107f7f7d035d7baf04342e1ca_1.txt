This paper explores the concept of decision jungles, which are ensembles of rooted decision directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), as a means to obtain compact and accurate classifiers. The authors demonstrate that decision jungles can reduce memory consumption while improving generalization compared to standard decision forests and their variants. The paper's key contribution is the experimentation demonstrating the practical importance of rooted DAGs, which is a worthwhile empirical observation.
The paper is well-structured and easy to follow, with a clear introduction to the problem of exponential growth in decision trees and the proposed solution of decision jungles. The authors provide a thorough review of related work and clearly explain their methodology, including the two local search-based algorithms for optimizing the DAGs. The experimental results are comprehensive and demonstrate the effectiveness of decision jungles on various classification tasks.
However, the writing could be improved in some areas. The authors' statements about the similarity between binary decision trees and rooted DAGs could be toned down, as the paper does not actually explore a more general similarity between the two. Additionally, the abbreviation "DAG" should be defined at its first occurrence in the text.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of their work. The paper is also well-organized and clearly written, making it easy for the reader to understand the methodology and results.
The originality of the paper lies in the proposal of decision jungles as a means to obtain compact and accurate classifiers. While the concept of DAGs is not new, the authors' approach to training them as ensembles and jointly optimizing the structure and features is novel. The paper also provides a unique combination of familiar techniques, such as decision trees and local search-based optimization.
The significance of the paper lies in its potential to improve the state of the art in classification tasks, particularly in applications where memory is a limited resource. The authors demonstrate that decision jungles can achieve better generalization and memory efficiency than standard decision forests and their variants, making them a promising approach for real-world applications.
