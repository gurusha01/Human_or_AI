This paper proposes a technique for reducing the number of parameters in deep neural networks by exploiting the structure in the weights. The authors demonstrate that by representing the weight matrix as a low-rank product of two smaller matrices, they can predict a significant portion of the weights without a substantial drop in accuracy. The technique is shown to be effective on several benchmark tasks, including MNIST, TIMIT, CIFAR-10, and STL-10.
The paper is well-written and clearly explains the intuition behind the technique. The experiments are thorough and demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the results and discuss the implications of their findings.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to reduce the number of parameters in deep networks while maintaining accuracy. This has significant implications for large-scale industrial implementations of deep networks, where reducing the number of parameters can lead to significant computational savings.
However, there are some limitations to the paper. The technique is not especially novel, building on recent work by other researchers. Additionally, the authors do not provide a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of their approach, which would be useful for understanding its scalability.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound and well-supported by experimental results. The claims made by the authors are well-supported by the data, and the paper provides a clear and concise explanation of the technique.
The clarity of the paper is also good, with clear and concise explanations of the technique and the experiments. The paper is well-organized and easy to follow, making it accessible to a wide range of readers.
