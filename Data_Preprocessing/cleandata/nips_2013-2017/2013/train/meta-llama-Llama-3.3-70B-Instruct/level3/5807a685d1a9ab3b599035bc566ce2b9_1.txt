This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of symbolic dynamic programming for Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with factored state and action spaces. The authors introduce two new algorithms, Factored Action Modified Policy Iteration (FA-MPI) and Opportunistic Policy Iteration (OPI), which improve upon existing state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of scalability.
The paper is well-organized and clearly written, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments and understand the technical details. The introduction provides a thorough background on the problem of symbolic dynamic programming for MDPs with factored state and action spaces, and the authors clearly motivate the need for new algorithms that can handle large action spaces.
The technical contributions of the paper are significant. FA-MPI is a novel algorithm that uses a new form of policy backup, which avoids enumerating all actions and instead uses a binary decision diagram (BDD) to represent the policy. OPI is an extension of FA-MPI that uses a pruning procedure to reduce the size of the value function representation, making it more scalable.
The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, showing significant improvements in scalability over state-of-the-art algorithms. The authors also provide a thorough analysis of the results, discussing the impact of policy evaluation, pruning, and memory-bounding on the performance of the algorithms.
One of the strengths of the paper is its clarity and organization. The authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, and the technical sections are well-structured and easy to follow. The experimental results are also well-presented, with clear tables and figures that illustrate the performance of the algorithms.
However, there are some areas where the paper could be improved. One potential weakness is the lack of connections to existing results on differential privacy, which could provide additional context and insights into the limitations of the proposed algorithms. Additionally, the restriction to local privacy and the choice of alpha in Theorem 1 may be limiting, and further explanation or justification would be helpful.
Another potential area for improvement is the comparison to other approaches, such as M-estimation procedures and histogram estimation algorithms. While the authors provide some comparisons to existing algorithms, a more thorough analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches would be helpful in understanding the contributions of the paper.
Overall, this is a strong paper that makes significant contributions to the field of symbolic dynamic programming for MDPs with factored state and action spaces. The authors provide a clear and well-organized presentation of their results, and the experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.
