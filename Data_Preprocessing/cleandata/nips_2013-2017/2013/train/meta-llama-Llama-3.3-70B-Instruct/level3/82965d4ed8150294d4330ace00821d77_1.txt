This paper proposes a method to accelerate template evaluations in object detection using vector quantization, achieving a significant two-order magnitude speedup. The approach replaces HOG cells with dictionary indices, allowing for a substantial reduction in computational complexity. The paper is well-written, thoroughly evaluated, and clearly organized, with a convincing computational cost model and timing comparisons.
The strengths of the paper include its ability to trade off speed and accuracy, allowing for flexible deployment in various applications. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method by plugging it into existing recognition systems, such as the Exemplar SVM detector and Deformable Part models, resulting in significant speedups without loss of accuracy. The paper also provides a detailed analysis of the computational cost model, highlighting the importance of considering both per-image and per-category terms.
However, the paper lacks originality, as the idea of quantizing HOG cells has been explored before. While the combination of techniques achieves a significant speedup, the core concept is not entirely new. Nevertheless, the paper's significance lies in its ability to provide a substantial speedup, making it extremely valuable to the computer vision community.
The arguments in favor of acceptance include:
* Significant speedup: The paper achieves a two-order magnitude speedup, making it a substantial contribution to the field.
* Flexibility: The method allows for trading off speed and accuracy, making it suitable for various applications.
* Thorough evaluation: The paper provides a detailed analysis of the computational cost model and timing comparisons, demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach.
The arguments against acceptance include:
* Lack of originality: The idea of quantizing HOG cells has been explored before, which may reduce the paper's impact.
* Limited novelty: While the combination of techniques achieves a significant speedup, the core concept is not entirely new.
Overall, I recommend accepting this paper due to its significant contribution to the field, thorough evaluation, and flexibility. While it may lack originality, the paper's impact on the computer vision community and its potential to accelerate object detection tasks make it a valuable addition to the conference.
