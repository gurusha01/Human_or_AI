This paper presents a novel approach to modeling count data using graphical models, addressing the limitations of existing Poisson graphical models. The authors propose three new classes of Poisson-like graphical models: the Truncated Poisson Graphical Model (TPGM), the Quadratic Poisson Graphical Model (QPGM), and the Sublinear Poisson Graphical Model (SPGM). These models can capture both positive and negative conditional dependencies between count-valued variables, overcoming the restrictive assumptions of traditional Poisson graphical models.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of their methodology. The mathematical derivations are sound, and the theorems and propositions are well-supported. The numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed models in recovering network structures from simulated and real-world data.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The authors address a significant limitation of existing Poisson graphical models, providing a more flexible and realistic approach to modeling count data.
* The proposed models are well-motivated, and the mathematical derivations are rigorous and well-supported.
* The numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed models in various scenarios, including simulated and real-world data.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The manuscript could benefit from some minor corrections, such as typos and formatting issues.
* Some of the notation and terminology may be unfamiliar to non-experts, and additional explanations or references could be helpful.
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the implications of the proposed models for practical applications, such as genomics and neuroscience.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of graphical models and count data analysis. The proposed models have the potential to be widely applicable and could lead to new insights and discoveries in various fields.
