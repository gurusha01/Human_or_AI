This paper proposes a novel model for associative memory with a recall algorithm, which is capable of learning and recalling an exponential number of patterns. The model is based on a graph code-based architecture, where patterns are represented as vectors in a high-dimensional space, and the recall algorithm uses a combination of forward and backward iterations to correct external errors. The paper also introduces internal noise to the model, which is shown to improve the performance of the recall algorithm, up to a certain threshold.
The paper's main contribution is the analytical characterization of the recall performance in the presence of internal noise, which is a significant departure from previous work that assumes noiseless computations. The authors show that internal noise can actually improve the performance of the recall algorithm, by helping to avoid stopping sets that can cause the noiseless algorithm to fail. This result is supported by both theoretical analysis and computational experiments.
However, the paper's approach to associative memory differs from other approaches, such as the Bayesian inference process proposed by Lengyel et al, which does not require additional noise for recall. This raises questions about the necessity of noise in the proposed recall rule, and whether the benefits of internal noise can be achieved through other means.
The paper's architecture is similar to Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM), and the finding that intrinsic noise improves recall performance may not be novel, as RBM also uses intrinsic noise to adapt to data. Nevertheless, the paper's contribution lies in its analytical characterization of the recall performance in the presence of internal noise, which provides new insights into the role of noise in associative memory models.
The paper is well-written and clearly organized, with a thorough introduction to the background and motivation of the research.
