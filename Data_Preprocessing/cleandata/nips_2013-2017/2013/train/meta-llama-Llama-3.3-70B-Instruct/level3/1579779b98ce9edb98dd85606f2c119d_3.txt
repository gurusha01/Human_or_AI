This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the achievable regret trade-offs in the context of online learning with expert advice. The authors focus on the absolute loss game, where the learner competes against two experts, and provide a characterization of the set of realizable trade-offs. They also study the asymptotic regret rate trade-off profile and show that the expected trade-off is achievable but not tight.
The paper is well-written and technically sound, with a clear and well-organized structure. The authors provide a thorough introduction to the problem, including a review of related work, and clearly state their contributions. The technical sections are detailed and easy to follow, with appropriate use of notation and mathematical derivations.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to provide a complete characterization of the set of realizable trade-offs for the absolute loss game. The authors show that the set of realizable trade-offs is a convex polygon, and they provide a explicit formula for the vertices of this polygon. They also show that the optimal strategy for achieving a given trade-off can be computed using a random walk-based method.
The paper also makes a significant contribution to the understanding of the asymptotic regret rate trade-off profile. The authors show that the expected trade-off is achievable, but that it is not tight. They also provide a formula for the optimal constant in the trade-off, which is an important result for practitioners.
The experimental results are limited, but they do provide some insight into the performance of the proposed approach. The authors compare the performance of their approach to a standard approach, and show that their approach slightly underperforms. However, this is not a major concern, as the focus of the paper is on the theoretical analysis of the regret trade-offs.
One potential weakness of the paper is that it focuses primarily on the absolute loss game, which may not be the most realistic or practical setting. The authors do provide some extensions to more general settings, such as linear losses and multiple experts, but these extensions are limited and could be further developed.
In terms of significance, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of online learning, as it provides a detailed analysis of the achievable regret trade-offs in a fundamental setting. The results of the paper could be used to inform the design of online learning algorithms, and could potentially lead to the development of new algorithms with improved performance.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, as it makes a significant contribution to the field of online learning and provides a detailed and well-written analysis of the achievable regret trade-offs in the absolute loss game.
