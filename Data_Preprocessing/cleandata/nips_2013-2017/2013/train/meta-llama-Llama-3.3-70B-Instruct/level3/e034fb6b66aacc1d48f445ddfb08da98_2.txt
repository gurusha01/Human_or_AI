This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of online learning, specifically in the context of prediction with expert advice. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the achievable regret trade-offs in the absolute loss game, which is a fundamental problem in online learning. The paper's main strength lies in its ability to characterize the set of realizable trade-offs, providing a complete and exact characterization of the Pareto optimal trade-offs for the absolute loss game with two experts.
The authors' approach is rigorous and well-motivated, and they provide a clear and concise explanation of their results. The paper is well-organized, and the authors do an excellent job of connecting their work to previous research in the field. The use of random walks to implement the optimal strategy is a nice touch, and the authors provide a clear explanation of how this works.
One of the paper's key contributions is the characterization of the asymptotic regret rate trade-off profile, which provides a smooth limit curve that approximates the Pareto frontiers for increasing T. The authors show that the parametric curve featuring square root negative log prior is asymptotically realizable, but sub-optimal, which has significant implications for the design of online learning algorithms.
The paper also explores the extension of the results to more general settings, including beyond absolute loss and more than two experts. The authors provide a clear and concise explanation of how their results can be applied to these more general settings, and they highlight the potential for future research in these areas.
In terms of weaknesses, the paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the implications of the results for practical applications. While the authors provide some insight into the potential applications of their work, a more thorough discussion of how the results could be used in real-world scenarios would be helpful.
Additionally, the paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison to previous work in the field. While the authors provide some references to previous research, a more thorough comparison of their results to existing work would help to provide context and highlight the significance of the contributions.
Overall, however, this is a strong paper that makes significant contributions to the field of online learning. The authors provide a rigorous and well-motivated analysis of the achievable regret trade-offs in the absolute loss game, and their results have significant implications for the design of online learning algorithms.
