This paper proposes a novel method for speeding up object detection algorithms by approximating template evaluation using Vector Quantization (VQ). The authors demonstrate that their approach, called Fast Template Vector Quantization (FTVQ), can achieve a substantial speedup over existing methods without sacrificing accuracy. The key idea is to quantize the feature vectors in each cell of the image pyramid into a fixed number of clusters, and then use a lookup table to approximate the dot product between the template and the feature vectors.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of their approach. The experimental results are impressive, showing that FTVQ can speed up object detection algorithms by up to two orders of magnitude without losing accuracy. The authors also provide a thorough analysis of the computation cost model, which helps to understand the performance benefits of their approach.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to trade off speed and accuracy by adjusting the number of clusters used in the VQ approximation. This allows the authors to demonstrate that their approach can be used in a variety of scenarios, from fast but less accurate detection to more accurate but slower detection.
The paper also has some weaknesses. For example, the authors do not provide a detailed analysis of the sensitivity of their approach to the choice of clustering algorithm or the number of clusters. Additionally, the authors do not compare their approach to other methods that use VQ for template evaluation, such as [12].
Overall, I believe that this paper is a significant contribution to the field of object detection, and it has the potential to impact a wide range of applications. The authors have demonstrated that their approach can achieve substantial speedups without sacrificing accuracy, which is a critical requirement for many real-world applications.
