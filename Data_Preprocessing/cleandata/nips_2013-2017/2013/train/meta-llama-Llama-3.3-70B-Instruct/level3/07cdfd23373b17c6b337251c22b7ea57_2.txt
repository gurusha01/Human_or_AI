This paper proposes a novel approach to learning latent structure in social network data by fitting a model to triangle count statistics. The authors combine aMMSB with MMTM, allowing for a more efficient parameterization of between-community interactions. However, the presentation of this material could be improved for better clarity.
The authors provide an intuitive approximation for the local update rule in the learning algorithm, which is a direct application of stochastic variational inference. This is a significant contribution, as it enables a more scalable implementation of the model.
One potential direction for future work is to extend the methods to directed networks. A detailed discussion on this would be welcome, as it could significantly broaden the applicability of the proposed approach.
The paper's claim that the PTM is a "latent space counterpart" to ERGMs is unclear, and the reviewer questions the interpretability of the inferred latent space. Furthermore, the reviewer raises several concerns, including the lack of clarity on the difference between Delta^1 and Delta^2, the adequacy of subsampling triangles, and the robustness of the latent space recovery results.
The complexity of the PTM CGS algorithm is stated to be O(K^3), despite the model having O(K) parameters. This discrepancy warrants further explanation, as it may impact the scalability of the approach.
The method's performance when fewer edges are observed is also a concern, and the fact that the method beats MMSB on a synthetic network generated via MMSB is counterintuitive. The paper's use of stochastic variational inference allows for a more scalable O(NK) algorithm, but the reviewer has several ongoing concerns about the model and its implementation.
Overall, the paper presents an interesting approach to learning latent structure in social networks, but requires further clarification and justification to fully address the reviewer's concerns. The strengths of the paper include its novel combination of aMMSB and MMTM, as well as its scalable implementation using stochastic variational inference. However, the weaknesses include the lack of clarity in certain aspects of the presentation, the unclear interpretability of the latent space, and the potential concerns regarding the model's performance and complexity.
