This paper presents a new approach to online Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) planning, called Determinized Sparse Partially Observable Tree (DESPOT). The authors introduce a Regularized DESPOT (R-DESPOT) algorithm, which searches a DESPOT for a near-optimal policy by balancing the size of the policy and its estimated performance under sampled scenarios. The paper also presents an anytime approximation of R-DESPOT, called Anytime Regularized DESPOT (AR-DESPOT), which applies heuristic search and branch-and-bound pruning to improve online planning performance.
The paper is well-motivated, and the theoretical analysis is mathematically sound. The authors provide a clear explanation of the DESPOT construction and the R-DESPOT algorithm, and they demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through numerical experiments. The results show that AR-DESPOT outperforms two of the fastest online POMDP planning algorithms, AEMS2 and POMCP, on several benchmark problems, including Tag, LaserTag, RockSample, and Pocman.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to scale up to large state spaces and observation spaces. The authors demonstrate that AR-DESPOT can handle problems with extremely large state spaces, such as Pocman, which has approximately 10^56 states. The paper also provides a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the algorithms and demonstrates that AR-DESPOT can be computed efficiently.
However, there are some areas for improvement. The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the relationship between the DESPOT approach and other online POMDP planning algorithms. Additionally, the authors could provide more insight into the choice of the regularization parameter and its effect on the performance of the algorithm.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, originality, and significance. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the technical details. The approach is novel and contributes to the state of the art in online POMDP planning.
