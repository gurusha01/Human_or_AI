This paper presents a novel method for speeding up object detection algorithms by approximating the scoring process using Vector Quantization (VQ). The authors propose a fast and accurate approximation technique that reduces the computational complexity of template evaluation, making it possible to achieve significant speedups without sacrificing accuracy. The method is compatible with various object detection algorithms, including deformable part models and exemplar SVM detectors.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their approach. The theoretical analysis is sound, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The authors also provide a detailed comparison with state-of-the-art algorithms, showing that their approach outperforms most of them in terms of speed and accuracy.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to trade off speed and accuracy by adjusting the number of VQ levels and the rescoring threshold. This allows the method to be tailored to specific applications and requirements. The authors also provide a thorough analysis of the computational cost model, which helps to understand the performance of the algorithm.
The paper has several contributions, including the proposal of a new VQ-based approximation technique, the development of a fast score estimation method, and the demonstration of the effectiveness of the approach on various object detection algorithms. The authors also make their implementation available online, which will facilitate future research and applications.
The weaknesses of the paper are minor. One potential limitation is that the method requires a preprocessing step to compute the VQ codes, which may add some overhead. However, the authors show that this overhead is negligible compared to the overall speedup achieved by the method. Another potential limitation is that the method may not be suitable for very large-scale object detection tasks, where the number of templates and images is extremely large. However, the authors demonstrate that their method can handle large-scale datasets, such as the PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset.
In terms of novelty, the paper presents a new and original approach to speeding up object detection algorithms. The use of VQ for approximating the scoring process is a novel contribution, and the authors demonstrate its effectiveness in various experiments. The paper also provides a thorough review of related work, which helps to understand the context and significance of the proposed method.
