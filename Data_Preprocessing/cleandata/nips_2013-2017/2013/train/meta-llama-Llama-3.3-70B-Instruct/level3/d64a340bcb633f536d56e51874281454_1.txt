This paper proposes a theoretical framework to analyze the performance of binary space-partitioning (BSP) trees for nearest-neighbor search. The authors establish a connection between the search performance of BSP-trees and their vector quantization performance, providing conditions for accurate support recovery and bounds for the number of iterations required. The paper also presents a numerical study on synthetic and genomic data sets, demonstrating the benefits of using BSP-trees with better quantization performance and large partition margins.
The strengths of the paper include its thorough theoretical analysis, which provides a deeper understanding of the factors influencing BSP-tree search performance. The authors also provide empirical evidence to support their theoretical results, using a variety of datasets and BSP-tree constructions. The paper's focus on the relationship between quantization performance and search performance is a significant contribution, as it provides a framework for evaluating and improving BSP-tree search algorithms.
However, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement. The experimental design and comparisons to state-of-the-art methods could be more comprehensive, as the authors only consider a limited set of BSP-tree constructions and datasets. Additionally, some technical points, such as the complexity of Line 3 in Algorithm 1 and the cost of the rank k projection matrix, could be clarified. The size of the support remains the same as the initial one with the proposed algorithm, which may bias the results in synthetic experiments. The authors could also report the false positive rate (FPR) in addition to the true positive rate (TPR) to provide a more complete evaluation of the algorithm's performance.
Furthermore, the use of classification/binary response in the genomic data example is surprising, and the authors could consider using continuous outcomes instead. The paper's results on the benefits of large margin partitions are interesting, but the authors could provide more discussion on the computational cost of constructing such partitions. Comparisons to other methods that can handle high correlation, such as elastic-net and Trace-Lasso, are also lacking.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, as it is technically sound and provides a complete piece of work. The paper is also well-written and clearly organized, making it easy to follow. The originality of the paper is high, as it presents a novel combination of familiar techniques and provides new insights into the relationship between quantization performance and search performance. The significance of the paper is also high, as it addresses a difficult problem in a better way than previous research and provides a unique theoretical and pragmatic approach.
Overall, the paper is well-written and provides a significant contribution to the field of nearest-neighbor search. With some revisions to address the weaknesses and areas for improvement, the paper has the potential to be a strong candidate for acceptance.
