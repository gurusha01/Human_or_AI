This paper presents an interesting approach to solving the game of Tetris using a classification-based modified policy iteration (CBMPI) algorithm, a type of approximate dynamic programming (ADP) method. The authors' conjecture that Tetris is a game in which good policies are easier to represent and learn than their corresponding value functions is well-motivated and supported by the literature. The experimental results show that CBMPI outperforms other ADP algorithms and achieves comparable or better performance than the state-of-the-art cross-entropy (CE) method, while using significantly fewer samples.
The paper is well-organized, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the CBMPI algorithm and its implementation in Tetris. The experimental setup is thorough, and the results are presented in a clear and concise manner. The comparison with other algorithms, including CE and Î»-PI, is helpful in evaluating the performance of CBMPI.
However, there are some limitations to the paper. The evaluation of the method is mostly empirical, and the authors do not provide a thorough theoretical analysis of the algorithm's convergence properties or sample complexity. Additionally, the paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the features used in the experiments and their impact on the performance of the algorithm.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by the experimental results. The authors are careful in evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of their approach and provide a balanced discussion of the results.
The clarity of the paper is good, and the writing is clear and concise. The organization of the paper is logical, and the authors provide a clear introduction to the problem and the proposed solution.
The originality of the paper is high, as it presents a novel application of CBMPI to the game of Tetris and achieves state-of-the-art performance. The significance of the paper is also high, as it demonstrates the potential of ADP methods in solving complex problems like Tetris.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, as it presents a significant contribution to the field of ADP and reinforcement learning. However, I would suggest that the authors provide more theoretical analysis and discussion of the features used in the experiments to further strengthen the paper.
