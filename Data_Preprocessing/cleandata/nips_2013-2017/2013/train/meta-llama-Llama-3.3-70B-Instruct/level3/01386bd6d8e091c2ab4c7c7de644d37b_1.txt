This paper presents a distributed stochastic dual coordinate ascent (DisDCA) algorithm for solving regularized loss minimization problems in a distributed framework. The algorithm is designed to optimize the dual problem of the regularized loss minimization problem, and it enjoys a strong guarantee of convergence rates for smooth or non-smooth loss functions.
The paper is well-written and provides a clear introduction to the problem and the proposed algorithm. The authors also provide a thorough analysis of the tradeoff between computation and communication, which is a key aspect of distributed optimization algorithms. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and its competitiveness with other distributed algorithms, such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM).
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to bridge the gap between stochastic dual coordinate ascent algorithms and distributed optimization. The authors provide a rigorous analysis of the convergence rates of the DisDCA algorithm and demonstrate its effectiveness in practice. The paper also provides a practical variant of the DisDCA algorithm, which improves the performance of the basic variant.
However, there are some areas where the paper could be improved. For example, the authors could provide more details on the implementation of the DisDCA algorithm and its variants. Additionally, the paper could benefit from more extensive experimental results, including comparisons with other distributed algorithms and evaluations on different datasets.
In terms of originality, the paper presents a novel combination of stochastic dual coordinate ascent algorithms and distributed optimization. The authors also provide a unique analysis of the tradeoff between computation and communication, which is a key aspect of distributed optimization algorithms.
The significance of the paper lies in its potential to improve the performance of distributed optimization algorithms for regularized loss minimization problems. The DisDCA algorithm and its variants have the potential to be widely adopted in practice, particularly in applications where distributed optimization is necessary.
Here is a list of arguments pro and con acceptance:
