This paper presents a novel approach to studying regret trade-offs in online learning, specifically in the context of the absolute loss game. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the achievable regret trade-offs and develop an optimal algorithm for achieving these trade-offs. The paper is well-written, and the authors do an excellent job of introducing the necessary background and notation.
The main strengths of the paper are its clarity, originality, and significance. The authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem of regret trade-offs in online learning, and their analysis is thorough and well-motivated. The paper presents a number of novel results, including the characterization of the set of achievable regret trade-offs and the development of an optimal algorithm for achieving these trade-offs. The significance of the paper lies in its potential to impact the field of online learning, particularly in the development of algorithms that can adapt to different regret trade-offs.
One potential weakness of the paper is the lack of comparison to other existing algorithms. While the authors do provide some comparison to existing results, such as the Hedge algorithm, a more thorough comparison to other algorithms would be helpful in understanding the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed approach.
Another potential area for improvement is the extension of the results to more general settings. The authors do provide some discussion of how their results can be extended to more general settings, such as the case of multiple experts, but a more thorough analysis of these extensions would be helpful.
