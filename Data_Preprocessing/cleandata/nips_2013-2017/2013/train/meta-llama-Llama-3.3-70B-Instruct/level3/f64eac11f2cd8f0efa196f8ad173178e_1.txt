This paper proposes a novel approach to symbolic planning under uncertainty with factored states and actions, addressing the scalability issues of existing methods. The authors introduce two main contributions: Factored Action Modified Policy Iteration (FA-MPI) and Opportunistic Policy Iteration (OPI). FA-MPI extends Modified Policy Iteration to factored action spaces, while OPI is a more conservative policy backup that opportunistically enforces policy constraints without increasing the size of the value function representation.
The paper is well-organized, clearly motivated, and provides potentially useful theoretical analyses. The proposed methods have the same computational complexity as ordinary policy gradient methods and work well when the fixed standard deviation is large enough. The experimental results show significant improvements in scalability over state-of-the-art symbolic planners.
The strengths of the paper include its originality, technical soundness, and clarity. The authors provide a thorough explanation of the proposed methods and their relationship to previous work. The experimental evaluation is comprehensive, covering various domains and comparing the proposed methods to existing baselines.
However, there are some weaknesses to consider. The paper lacks experimental comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, such as EM policy search, which would make the results more convincing. Additionally, the conclusion section is missing, and some experimental results require further clarification. The authors could also provide more discussion on the potential applications and limitations of the proposed methods.
