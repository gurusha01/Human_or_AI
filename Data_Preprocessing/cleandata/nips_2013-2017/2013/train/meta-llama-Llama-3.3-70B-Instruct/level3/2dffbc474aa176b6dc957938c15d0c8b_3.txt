This paper presents a novel approach to calculating firing rates in tightly balanced networks, a type of neural network that has been shown to be optimal for signal representation. The authors develop a technique that directly identifies the non-linear relationship between firing rates, connectivity, input, and optimal signal representation, without requiring linearizing approximations. The approach is based on the idea that the spiking activity of the network can be interpreted as an algorithm that optimizes a loss function, which is a quadratic function of the firing rates.
The paper is well-written and clearly organized, with a good balance between theoretical derivations and numerical simulations. The authors provide a detailed analysis of the properties of the tightly balanced networks and demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach in calculating firing rates and understanding tuning curve shapes.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to provide a unified framework for understanding the computational role of firing rate responses and the underlying network mechanisms. The authors show that their approach can be used to investigate poorly understood features of experimentally recorded tuning curves, such as tuning curve inhomogeneity, and provide new insights into the impact of this inhomogeneity on neural computation.
However, the paper could benefit from a more detailed evaluation of the challenges in implementing the proposed approach, particularly in terms of the computational resources required and the potential limitations of the method. Additionally, the authors could provide more discussion on the relationship between their approach and previous work on population coding models and spiking networks.
In terms of originality, the paper presents a novel combination of familiar techniques, including quadratic programming and loss function optimization, to address a long-standing problem in systems neuroscience. The approach is significant because it provides a new perspective on the computational role of firing rate responses and the underlying network mechanisms, and has the potential to be useful in a wide range of applications, from data analysis to the study of computational neurodegeneration.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, as it presents a significant contribution to the field of systems neuroscience and has the potential to be of broad interest to the NIPS community. However, I would suggest that the authors address the minor criticisms mentioned above to strengthen the paper and provide a more comprehensive evaluation of their approach.
