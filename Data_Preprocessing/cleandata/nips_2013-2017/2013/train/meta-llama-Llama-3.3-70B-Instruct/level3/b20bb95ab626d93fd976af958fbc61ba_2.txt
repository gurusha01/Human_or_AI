This paper presents a novel algorithm for sparse precision matrix estimation in high dimensions using the CLIME estimator. The authors develop an inexact alternating direction method of multiplier (ADMM) algorithm for CLIME, which improves upon existing methods by jointly sampling latent variables, resulting in improved mixing and faster computations. The algorithm is technically sound, clear, and well-written, with a clear emphasis on its contribution over previous work.
The paper's key strength is its ability to scale to millions of dimensions and trillions of parameters, making it a practically useful contribution to the field. The authors demonstrate the algorithm's scalability through experiments on both shared-memory and distributed-memory architectures, showing that it achieves almost linear speedups with the number of cores.
However, the paper has some weaknesses. One notable weakness is the lack of comparison with existing work, such as Damian and Walker (2001), which discusses techniques for sampling from multivariate truncated normals using latent variables. Additionally, the paper has some notation issues, such as the truncation region D not being explicitly dependent on the data, and some sentences requiring clarification or correction.
Despite these weaknesses, the paper is significant and likely to be influential in the field. The results are important and likely to be incorporated into future extensions of Gaussian copula models for multivariate discrete distributions, with the potential to improve upon existing algorithms and methods.
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The paper presents a novel and scalable algorithm for sparse precision matrix estimation in high dimensions.
* The algorithm is technically sound and well-written, with a clear emphasis on its contribution over previous work.
* The paper demonstrates the algorithm's scalability through experiments on both shared-memory and distributed-memory architectures.
Arguments con acceptance:
* The paper lacks comparison with existing work, such as Damian and Walker (2001).
* The paper has some notation issues and sentences requiring clarification or correction.
* The paper could benefit from more discussion on the limitations and potential extensions of the algorithm.
Overall, I recommend accepting this paper, as its strengths outweigh its weaknesses, and it is likely to make a significant contribution to the field. However, I suggest that the authors address the notation issues and provide more comparison with existing work to strengthen the paper.
