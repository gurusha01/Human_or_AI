This paper presents a theoretical analysis of the relationship between the quantization performance of binary space-partitioning (BSP) trees and their nearest-neighbor search performance. The authors propose a new type of BSP tree, called the max-margin partition tree, which is designed to optimize the margin between partitions. The paper provides a rigorous analysis of the search performance guarantees of BSP trees, including the max-margin tree, and demonstrates that trees with better quantization performance and larger partition margins have better search performance guarantees.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the theoretical results. The empirical evaluation of the proposed approach on several datasets demonstrates its effectiveness in practice. The paper is original, significant, and well-structured, making it a strong contribution to the field.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to relate the search performance of BSP trees to their quantization performance, which is a novel contribution. The authors also provide a thorough analysis of the conditions under which the proposed approach is effective, including the expansion constant of the data and the balance of the tree.
However, there are a few areas where the paper could be improved. The bound provided in Equation 4 seems looser than expected, and the authors may want to consider tightening it. Additionally, the ratio in lines 531-532 should always be less than 1 to improve Equation 14. The authors may also want to consider using doubling dimension instead of expansion dimension to avoid strong assumptions like condition C1 and improve readability.
Furthermore, the paper could benefit from a discussion on what happens if the input comes from an underlying distribution. The authors may also want to consider changing the notation for the expansion constant from '\tilde c' to 'c' to improve clarity.
Overall, the paper is a significant contribution to the field, and the authors have made a compelling case for the use of max-margin partition trees for nearest-neighbor search. With some minor revisions to address the areas mentioned above, the paper has the potential to be even stronger.
