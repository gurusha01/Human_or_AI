This paper presents a method to speed up object detection by approximating scores using vector quantization (VQ) and combining it with a cascade of speedup techniques. The main claim of the paper is that their method achieves a substantial end-to-end speedup over the best current methods without loss of accuracy. The authors demonstrate their method by speeding up the original Exemplar SVM detector and Deformable Part models by an order of magnitude and two orders of magnitude, respectively, with no loss of accuracy.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear explanation of their method and its advantages over existing approaches. The use of VQ to approximate scores is a novel contribution, and the authors demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments on the PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset. The paper also provides a thorough analysis of the computation cost model and compares their approach to other state-of-the-art algorithms.
The strengths of the paper include its clear presentation, thorough experimentation, and significant performance improvements over existing methods. The authors also provide a detailed discussion of the limitations of their approach and potential avenues for future work.
The weaknesses of the paper include the fact that the authors do not provide a detailed analysis of the trade-off between speed and accuracy, and the choice of the number of VQ clusters (c = 256) seems to be arbitrary. Additionally, the authors do not provide a comparison to other methods that use VQ or similar techniques for object detection.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of object detection, and the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through thorough experimentation. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear explanation of their method and its advantages over existing approaches.
