This paper proposes a Bayesian framework for estimating conditional copulas, which are used to model dependencies between multiple variables in financial time series. The authors extend previous work by allowing copula parameters to depend on arbitrary conditioning variables, rather than just time. They use Gaussian processes (GPs) to approximate the latent functions that relate the conditioning variables to the copula parameters and develop an alternating expectation propagation (EP) algorithm for approximate Bayesian inference.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem of estimating dependencies in financial time series. They also provide a thorough review of related work, including dynamic copula models and other approaches to modeling multivariate covariance.
The proposed method, GPCC, is evaluated on several datasets, including synthetic data and real-world financial time series. The results show that GPCC outperforms static copula models and other dynamic copula models, including those that use regime switching or GARCH-style updates to copula parameters.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel and flexible framework for estimating conditional copulas
* The use of GPs to approximate the latent functions, which allows for non-linear relationships between the conditioning variables and copula parameters
* The development of an efficient and scalable algorithm for approximate Bayesian inference
* The thorough evaluation of the proposed method on several datasets, including real-world financial time series
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The assumption that the copula parameters are functions of a single conditioning variable (time), which may not always be the case in practice
* The use of a simple GP prior, which may not be sufficient to capture complex relationships between the conditioning variables and copula parameters
* The lack of comparison to other models of multivariate covariance, such as vector autoregressions or factor models
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of financial time series analysis and provides a useful framework for estimating conditional copulas. The results are promising, and the proposed method has the potential to be widely adopted in practice.
