This paper provides a detailed study of the estimation of probability distributions under local differential privacy constraints. The authors establish sharp minimax rates of convergence for estimation in these settings, exhibiting fundamental trade-offs between privacy and convergence rate. The paper makes several key contributions, including the development of a theoretical framework for characterizing optimal estimation under privacy constraints, the derivation of lower bounds on the convergence rates of any estimator, and the construction of efficiently implementable algorithms that achieve these lower bounds.
The paper is well-written, clearly organized, and provides a thorough introduction to the problem of probability estimation under local differential privacy. The authors provide a detailed overview of the relevant literature, including the work of Warner on randomized response and the development of differential privacy. The technical contributions of the paper are significant, and the authors provide a clear and concise presentation of their results.
The paper's main claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and numerical experiments. The authors provide a detailed analysis of the minimax risk of estimation under local differential privacy, and they derive sharp lower bounds on the convergence rates of any estimator. They also construct efficiently implementable algorithms that achieve these lower bounds, including a privatized histogram estimator and an orthogonal series estimator.
