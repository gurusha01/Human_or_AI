This paper proposes a class of efficient Generalized Method-of-Moments (GMM) algorithms for computing parameters of the Plackett-Luce model, which is a popular statistical model for rank aggregation. The main contribution of the paper is to introduce a new approach to estimate the parameters of the Plackett-Luce model by breaking down full rankings into pairwise comparisons and then solving a set of generalized moment conditions.
The paper is well-written and provides a clear overview of the problem, the proposed approach, and the experimental results. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the consistency and computational complexity of their algorithms and compare them with existing methods, such as the Minorize-Maximization (MM) algorithm.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a new and efficient approach to estimate the parameters of the Plackett-Luce model, which is a significant improvement over existing methods.
* A thorough analysis of the consistency and computational complexity of the proposed algorithms.
* Experimental results that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on both synthetic and real-world data.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes that the data is generated from the Plackett-Luce model, which may not always be the case in practice.
* The authors do not provide a detailed comparison with other existing methods, such as the Rank Centrality algorithm.
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the limitations and potential extensions of the proposed approach.
Overall, the paper is well-written and provides a significant contribution to the field of rank aggregation. The proposed approach is efficient, consistent, and effective, and the experimental results demonstrate its potential in practice.
