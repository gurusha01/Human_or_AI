This paper presents a novel approach to active learning on Gaussian Random Fields (GRFs) by introducing a new criterion called Σ-optimality. The authors argue that the commonly used V-optimality criterion, which minimizes the L2 loss, may not be the best choice for active learning in classification problems. Instead, they propose Σ-optimality, which minimizes the sum of the elements in the predictive covariance matrix, and show that it outperforms V-optimality and other related methods on real-world graphs with both synthetic and real data.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, the proposed approach, and the theoretical results. The experiments are thorough, and the results are impressive, showing that Σ-optimality outperforms other methods by a large margin, especially during the first few queries.
The main claims of the paper are:
1. Σ-optimality is a better criterion for active learning on GRFs than V-optimality.
2. The greedy application of Σ-optimality has a (1− 1/e) global optimality guarantee.
3. GRFs satisfy the suppressor-free condition, which is a sufficient condition for the submodularity of the risk reduction function.
The support for these claims is strong, with theoretical proofs and experimental results that demonstrate the effectiveness of Σ-optimality. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the differences between Σ-optimality and V-optimality, showing that Σ-optimality tends to select cluster centers, while V-optimality goes after outliers.
The usefulness of the ideas presented in the paper is high, as they can be applied to a wide range of active learning problems on GRFs. The paper also provides a new perspective on the problem of active learning, highlighting the importance of considering the predictive covariance matrix in the selection of nodes to query.
The field knowledge demonstrated by the authors is excellent, with a thorough understanding of the relevant literature and a clear explanation of the relationships between different concepts. The novelty of the work is also high, as the authors introduce a new criterion for active learning and provide a detailed analysis of its properties.
The completeness of the paper is good, with a clear and concise presentation of the results and a thorough analysis of the experiments. The limitations of the work are also acknowledged, with the authors noting that the exact reason for the superiority of Σ-optimality is still an open question.
Overall, this is a strong paper that makes a significant contribution to the field of active learning on GRFs. The ideas presented are novel, well-motivated, and thoroughly analyzed, and the results are impressive. The paper is well-written, and the authors demonstrate a deep understanding of the relevant literature and concepts.
