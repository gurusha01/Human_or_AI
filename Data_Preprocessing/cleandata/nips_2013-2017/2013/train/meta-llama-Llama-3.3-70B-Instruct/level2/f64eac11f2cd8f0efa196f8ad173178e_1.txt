This paper proposes a novel approach to determine the learning rate in policy gradient methods by maximizing a lower bound to the expected performance gain. The authors derive a lower bound that is a second-order polynomial of the step size and show how it can be maximized when the gradient is estimated from trajectory samples. The approach is evaluated empirically in a linear-quadratic regulator problem, demonstrating its effectiveness in avoiding oscillations and divergence issues.
The paper's main claim is that the proposed approach guarantees an improvement at each step, thus avoiding oscillation and divergence issues. The support for this claim comes from the derivation of the lower bound and its empirical evaluation. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the bound's properties, including its maximization and the effect of the step size on the convergence speed.
The ideas presented in the paper are practically useful, as they provide a new approach to tuning the step size in policy gradient methods. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach in a specific problem, which suggests that it could be applied to other problems in the field. However, the paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the potential limitations and challenges of implementing the approach in more complex scenarios.
The paper reflects common knowledge in the field, as it builds upon existing research on policy gradient methods and reinforcement learning. The authors provide a clear and concise overview of the background and related work, demonstrating their understanding of the field. The paper's originality lies in its novel approach to determining the learning rate, which is a significant contribution to the field.
The paper is well-organized and clearly written, making it easy to follow. The authors provide a detailed derivation of the lower bound and its properties, which is helpful for understanding the approach. The empirical evaluation is also well-presented, with clear tables and figures that illustrate the results.
The limitations of the paper are acknowledged by the authors, who note that the approach is limited to Gaussian policies and that the derivation of the bound relies on several assumptions. The authors also discuss the potential challenges of implementing the approach in more complex scenarios, such as those with high-dimensional state and action spaces.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of reinforcement learning, providing a novel approach to determining the learning rate in policy gradient methods. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach in a specific problem and provide a clear and concise overview of the background and related work.
