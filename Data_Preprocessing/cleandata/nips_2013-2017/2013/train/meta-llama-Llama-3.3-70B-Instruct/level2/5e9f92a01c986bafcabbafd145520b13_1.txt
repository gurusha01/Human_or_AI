This paper proposes a novel framework for compressive calcium imaging, which enables the monitoring of large neuronal populations with high temporal resolution. The authors develop scalable nonnegative deconvolution methods for extracting neuronal spike time series from randomized projection observations and address the problem of demixing spatial locations of neurons using rank-penalized matrix factorization methods.
The paper's main claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and numerical experiments. The authors demonstrate that the number of measurements needed per timestep is significantly smaller than the total number of neurons, allowing for fast monitoring of large neural populations. The paper also provides a thorough analysis of the phase transition curve in the noiseless case, which characterizes the number of measurements required for perfect deconvolution as a function of the number of spikes.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the proposed framework and its underlying mathematics. The numerical experiments are thorough and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in various scenarios. The paper also provides a good review of the existing literature on compressive sensing and calcium imaging.
The paper's strengths include its novelty, technical soundness, and potential impact on the field of neuroscience. The proposed framework has the potential to enable the imaging of large neural populations at higher imaging rates than currently available, which could lead to significant advances in our understanding of neural circuits and their function.
However, the paper also has some limitations. The analysis is idealistic and neglects several issues that can arise in practice, such as motion correction for brain movement and the effect of noise on the measurements. Additionally, the paper assumes that the random projection matrices can be constructed quickly, which may not be the case in practice.
In terms of novelty, the paper presents a significant improvement over existing approaches to calcium imaging. The use of compressive sensing and low-rank matrix factorization enables the extraction of neuronal spike time series and spatial locations from a limited number of measurements, which is a significant advancement over traditional raster-scanning protocols.
The paper's significance is high, as it has the potential to enable the imaging of large neural populations at higher imaging rates than currently available. The proposed framework could lead to significant advances in our understanding of neural circuits and their function, which could have important implications for the diagnosis and treatment of neurological disorders.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication. The paper's strengths, including its novelty, technical soundness, and potential impact, outweigh its limitations. The paper provides a significant contribution to the field of neuroscience and has the potential to enable important advances in our understanding of neural circuits and their function.
