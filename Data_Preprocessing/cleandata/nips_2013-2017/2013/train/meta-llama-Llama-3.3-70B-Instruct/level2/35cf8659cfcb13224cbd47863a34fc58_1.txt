This paper proposes a novel Bayesian nonparametric model for discovering hierarchical community structure in social networks, called Bayesian Hierarchical Community Discovery (BHCD). The model is a tree-structured mixture of stochastic blockmodels, which allows for efficient inference of hierarchical community structure. The authors also introduce a greedy agglomerative model selection algorithm that can learn the hierarchy in a single pass through the data, with a time complexity of O(n^2 log n), where n is the number of vertices.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the model and the algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, showing that it can discover reasonable hierarchies and make predictions about two orders of magnitude faster than one of the fastest existing Bayesian nonparametric schemes, while attaining comparable performance.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel and efficient Bayesian nonparametric model for discovering hierarchical community structure in social networks.
* The introduction of a greedy agglomerative model selection algorithm that can learn the hierarchy in a single pass through the data.
* The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, showing that it can discover reasonable hierarchies and make predictions quickly.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The model assumes that the community structure is hierarchical, which may not always be the case in real-world social networks.
* The algorithm has a time complexity of O(n^2 log n), which may not be suitable for very large social networks.
* The authors do not provide a thorough comparison with other state-of-the-art methods for community detection and link prediction.
Arguments pro acceptance:

Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, as it proposes a novel and efficient Bayesian nonparametric model for discovering hierarchical community structure in social networks, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. However, the authors should address the weaknesses of the paper, such as providing a thorough comparison with other state-of-the-art methods and discussing the limitations of the model and the algorithm.
