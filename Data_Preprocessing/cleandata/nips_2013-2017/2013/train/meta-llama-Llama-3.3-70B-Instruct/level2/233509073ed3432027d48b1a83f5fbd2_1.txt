This paper presents a novel algorithm, LoSST, for learning graphical model structure in an online manner, capable of tracking changes in the underlying generating process. The main claim of the paper is that LoSST performs comparably to batch-mode learning when the generating graphical structure is globally stationary and significantly better when it is only locally stationary. The authors support this claim through simulations and an application to real-world data.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear overview of the related work and the limitations of existing approaches. The LoSST algorithm is described in detail, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of its properties, including convergence and diligence. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of LoSST in tracking changes in the underlying structure, and the application to real-world data shows its potential in practice.
The strengths of the paper include its novelty, clarity, and thoroughness. The authors provide a clear motivation for the problem, a detailed description of the algorithm, and a comprehensive analysis of its properties. The simulation results and the application to real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of LoSST and its potential in practice.
The weaknesses of the paper include the complexity of the algorithm and the lack of a clear comparison to other online learning algorithms. The authors mention that LoSST is capable of exhibiting different long-run properties, depending on its parameters, but they do not provide a clear comparison to other algorithms in terms of convergence and diligence. Additionally, the authors mention that the algorithm can be extended to have the current learned model influence the weights, but they do not provide a clear description of how this can be done.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear overview of the related work and the limitations of existing approaches. The LoSST algorithm is novel, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of its properties. The simulation results and the application to real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of LoSST and its potential in practice.
