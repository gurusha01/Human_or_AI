This paper proposes an extension of factorized asymptotic Bayesian (FAB) inference to latent feature models (LFMs), which have been a challenging problem due to the lack of a specific condition on the Hessian matrix of the complete log-likelihood. The authors provide an asymptotic analysis of the Hessian matrix of LFMs, showing that the factorized information criterion (FIC) for LFMs has the same form as that for mixture models. This allows for the derivation of FAB inference for LFMs, which offers several desirable properties, including automatic hidden state selection and parameter identifiability.
The paper is well-written and clearly explains the technical details of the proposed method. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the FAB algorithm for LFMs, including a convex concave procedure (CCCP) interpretation and a shrinkage acceleration method. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of computational speed, model selection accuracy, and prediction performance.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel FAB inference method for LFMs, which addresses a challenging problem in the field.
* The provision of a thorough analysis of the FAB algorithm, including a CCCP interpretation and a shrinkage acceleration method.
* The demonstration of the effectiveness of the proposed method through experimental results.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes a certain level of background knowledge in Bayesian inference and latent feature models, which may make it difficult for non-experts to follow.
* The experimental results are limited to a few datasets, and it would be beneficial to see more extensive evaluations on a wider range of datasets.
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the limitations of the proposed method and potential avenues for future research.
Overall, the paper is well-written and makes a significant contribution to the field of Bayesian inference and latent feature models. The proposed FAB inference method for LFMs has the potential to be a useful tool for practitioners and researchers in the field.
