This paper proposes a scalable approach for making inference about latent spaces of large networks. The authors introduce a parsimonious triangular model (PTM) that represents networks as a bag of triangular motifs, reducing the dimensionality of the parameter space from O(K3) to O(K), where K is the number of latent roles. They also develop a fast stochastic variational inference algorithm with a time complexity of O(NK), which is significantly faster than existing methods.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the proposed model and algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, showing that it can achieve competitive or improved accuracy for latent space recovery and link prediction on synthetic and real networks, while being orders of magnitude faster than recent work on scalable latent space network modeling.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposed PTM model is novel and effective in reducing the dimensionality of the parameter space, making it possible to scale to large networks.
* The stochastic variational inference algorithm is well-designed and efficient, allowing for fast convergence to the optimal solution.
* The experimental results are comprehensive and demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach over existing methods.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes that the number of latent roles K is known in advance, which may not always be the case in practice.
* The proposed algorithm may not be suitable for networks with a large number of latent roles, as the time complexity is still O(NK).
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the limitations and potential extensions of the proposed approach.
Overall, the paper is well-written and presents a significant contribution to the field of network analysis. The proposed approach has the potential to be widely adopted in practice, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the methodology and results.
