This paper presents active learning algorithms for structured prediction problems, which aim to reduce the amount of labeling required to learn good models. The authors propose two active learning algorithms, separate and joint, that select the most informative random variables to label based on local entropies. The separate algorithm learns from labeled and weakly labeled examples and then performs inference to query the next random variable, while the joint algorithm takes advantage of unlabeled data during learning and computes the entropies directly from the learned model.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear overview of the problem, related work, and their approach. The experimental evaluation is thorough, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in reducing the amount of labeling required to achieve state-of-the-art performance.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The authors address a significant problem in structured prediction, which is the need for large amounts of labeled data.
* The proposed algorithms are novel and well-motivated, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the intuition behind them.
* The experimental evaluation is comprehensive, and the results are impressive, demonstrating that the proposed algorithms can achieve state-of-the-art performance with significantly less labeling.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes that the graphical model is given, and the authors do not discuss how to learn the model structure.
* The authors do not provide a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed algorithms, which could be a limitation in practice.
* The paper could benefit from more discussion on the potential applications of the proposed algorithms beyond the specific task of 3D room layout prediction.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the proposed algorithms are novel and effective. The authors demonstrate the potential of active learning in reducing the amount of labeling required for structured prediction problems, and the paper is a significant contribution to the field.
