This paper proposes an approximate inference algorithm for continuous-time Gaussian Markov process models with both discrete and continuous-time likelihoods. The main claim of the paper is that the continuous-time limit of the expectation propagation (EP) algorithm exists and results in a hybrid fixed-point iteration, which combines EP updates for discrete-time terms and variational updates for the continuous-time term. The authors also introduce post-inference correction methods to improve the accuracy of the marginals.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and detailed derivation of the algorithm. The experimental results on real and simulated data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in accurately reconstructing marginal posterior distributions. The paper also provides a thorough discussion of the related work and the potential applications of the proposed methodology.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel approximate inference algorithm for continuous-time Gaussian Markov process models with both discrete and continuous-time likelihoods.
* The derivation of the algorithm is clear and detailed, and the authors provide a thorough discussion of the related work.
* The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in accurately reconstructing marginal posterior distributions.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes a latent linear diffusion process, which may not be applicable to all types of diffusion processes.
* The authors do not provide a thorough discussion of the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm, which may be an important consideration in practice.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the proposed algorithm is a significant contribution to the field of approximate inference for continuous-time stochastic processes. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method in accurately reconstructing marginal posterior distributions and provides a thorough discussion of the related work.
