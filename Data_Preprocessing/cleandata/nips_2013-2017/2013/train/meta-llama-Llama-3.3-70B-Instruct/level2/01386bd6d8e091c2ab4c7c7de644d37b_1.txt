This paper presents a statistical method for "stitching" together sequentially imaged sets of neurons into one model, allowing for the characterization of population dynamics beyond the number of simultaneously imaged neurons. The authors propose a latent dynamical system model that can predict correlations between non-simultaneously recorded neuron pairs. The method is demonstrated on both simulated and real calcium imaging data from the mouse somatosensory cortex.
The main claim of the paper is that the proposed method can accurately predict correlations between non-simultaneously recorded neurons, which is supported by the results on both simulated and real data. The authors show that their method outperforms a naive approach that separately fits dynamical system models to each imaging session and then combines their parameters.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the method and its application to real data. The results are impressive, and the authors demonstrate the potential of their method for expanding our understanding of neural circuits.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel method for stitching together sequentially imaged sets of neurons
* The demonstration of the method on both simulated and real data
* The comparison of the method to a naive approach and a fully observed model
* The discussion of the potential applications and limitations of the method
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The assumption of a linear Gaussian dynamical system, which may not capture the complexity of real neural circuits
* The need for a significant overlap between the different populations of neurons, which may not always be possible in practice
* The lack of a clear discussion of the computational complexity of the method and its potential scalability to larger datasets
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of neuroscience and neural circuits, and the proposed method has the potential to be widely applicable. However, further work is needed to address the limitations of the method and to demonstrate its scalability to larger datasets.
