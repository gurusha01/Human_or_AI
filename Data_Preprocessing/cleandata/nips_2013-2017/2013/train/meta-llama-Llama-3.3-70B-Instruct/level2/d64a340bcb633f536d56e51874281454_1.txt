This paper presents a novel greedy algorithm, called SWAP, for sparse recovery in high-dimensional settings with correlated measurement matrices. The main claim of the paper is that SWAP can accurately recover the support of a sparse vector even when the measurement matrix contains highly correlated columns. The authors support this claim through a combination of theoretical analysis and numerical simulations.
The theoretical analysis provides conditions under which SWAP can guarantee accurate support recovery, including a restricted eigenvalue condition and a condition on the correlations between the columns of the measurement matrix. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the algorithm's performance, including its convergence rate and computational complexity.
The numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of SWAP in comparison to other sparse recovery algorithms, including the Lasso, Thresholded Lasso, Forward-Backward, CoSaMP, and Marginal Regression. The results show that SWAP outperforms these algorithms in terms of true positive rate and false positive rate, especially in cases where the measurement matrix contains highly correlated columns.
The paper is well-written and clearly organized, with a thorough introduction to the problem and a detailed explanation of the algorithm and its analysis. The authors also provide a comprehensive review of related work in the field and discuss the limitations and potential extensions of their approach.
The strengths of the paper include its novel contribution to the field of sparse recovery, its thorough theoretical analysis, and its impressive numerical results. The weaknesses of the paper include the fact that the algorithm's performance can depend on the choice of initialization and the fact that the computational complexity of the algorithm can be high for large datasets.
