This paper presents a fully Bayesian approach to inference and learning in nonlinear nonparametric state-space models. The authors propose a Gaussian process prior over the state transition dynamics, allowing for a flexible model that can capture complex dynamical phenomena. To enable efficient inference, they marginalize over the transition dynamics function and instead infer directly the joint smoothing distribution using a tailored particle Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler.
The main claims of the paper are: (1) the proposed approach retains the full nonparametric expressivity of the model, and (2) it allows for efficient inference and learning of the state transition dynamics. The authors support these claims through a series of experiments, including learning a nonlinear system benchmark and a cart and pole system.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their approach. The use of a Gaussian process prior over the state transition dynamics is a novel and interesting idea, and the authors demonstrate its effectiveness in capturing complex dynamical phenomena.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposed approach is fully Bayesian, allowing for a principled and coherent treatment of uncertainty.
* The use of a Gaussian process prior over the state transition dynamics provides a flexible and expressive model.
* The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through a series of experiments.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The computational complexity of the proposed approach may be high, particularly for large datasets.
* The authors do not provide a detailed comparison with other state-of-the-art methods for inference and learning in state-space models.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of state-space models and Gaussian processes. The proposed approach is novel, well-motivated, and demonstrated to be effective in practice. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their approach.
