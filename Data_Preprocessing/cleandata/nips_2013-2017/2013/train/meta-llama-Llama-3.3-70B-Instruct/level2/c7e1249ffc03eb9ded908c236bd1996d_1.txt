This paper proposes a model for demand estimation in multi-agent, differentiated product settings, extending the popular setup in Berry, Levinsohn, and Pakes (1995) to allow for data-driven classification of agents' types using agent-level data. The authors develop an algorithm involving a novel application of reversible jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) techniques to classify agents' types and estimate the parameters associated with each type.
The main claims of the paper are: (1) the proposed model extends the existing setup to allow for data-driven classification of agents' types, (2) the algorithm using RJMCMC techniques can effectively classify agents' types and estimate the parameters, and (3) the model provides a better fit to real-world data.
The support for these claims comes from theoretical analysis, simulations, and experiments on real-world data. The authors establish conditions for identifiability of the model and uni-modality of the likelihood function when types are observable. They also provide experimental results on synthetic data, showing that the algorithm can successfully estimate the number of types and parameters, and on real-world data, demonstrating that models with multiple types provide a significantly better fit.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the model, algorithm, and theoretical results. The use of RJMCMC techniques is novel and provides a flexible way to classify agents' types and estimate parameters. The experimental results are convincing, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of the performance of the algorithm.
However, there are some limitations to the paper. The authors assume that the number of types is unknown and needs to be estimated, which can be challenging in practice. The algorithm may not perform well if the number of types is large or if the data is noisy. Additionally, the authors do not provide a comparison with other existing methods for demand estimation, which would be useful to assess the performance of the proposed model.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of demand estimation, and the proposed model and algorithm have the potential to be useful in practice. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the theoretical properties of the model and demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments. With some minor revisions to address the limitations, the paper is ready for publication.
