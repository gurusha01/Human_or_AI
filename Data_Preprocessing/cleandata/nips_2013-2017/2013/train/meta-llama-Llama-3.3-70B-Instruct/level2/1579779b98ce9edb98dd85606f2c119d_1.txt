This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of game theory and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithms. The authors provide a formal analysis of the convergence of MCTS algorithms in zero-sum extensive-form games with perfect information and simultaneous moves. The main claim of the paper is that any -Hannan consistent algorithm can be used to create a MCTS algorithm that provably converges to an approximate Nash equilibrium of the game.
The paper is well-structured and clearly written, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments. The introduction provides a thorough background on the topic, and the related work is well-referenced. The authors also provide a clear explanation of the MCTS algorithm and its variants, which is helpful for readers who may not be familiar with the topic.
The formal analysis is rigorous and well-presented, with clear definitions and lemmas that support the main theorem. The authors provide a detailed proof of the convergence of the MCTS algorithm to an approximate Nash equilibrium, which is a significant contribution to the field.
The empirical evaluation of the algorithm is also well-done, with a clear explanation of the experimental setup and results. The authors provide a comparison of the convergence rates of different MCTS variants, which is helpful for understanding the performance of the algorithm in practice.
The paper has several strengths, including:
* A clear and well-structured presentation of the material
* A rigorous and well-presented formal analysis of the convergence of the MCTS algorithm
* A thorough empirical evaluation of the algorithm
* A clear explanation of the related work and background on the topic
However, there are also some weaknesses, including:
* The paper assumes a high level of background knowledge in game theory and MCTS algorithms, which may make it difficult for readers who are not familiar with the topic to follow
* The empirical evaluation is limited to a specific class of games, and it is not clear how the results would generalize to other types of games
* The paper does not provide a clear comparison of the MCTS algorithm to other algorithms for solving extensive-form games
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication, as it makes a significant contribution to the field of game theory and MCTS algorithms. However, I would suggest that the authors consider revising the paper to make it more accessible to readers who are not familiar with the topic, and to provide a clearer comparison of the MCTS algorithm to other algorithms for solving extensive-form games.
