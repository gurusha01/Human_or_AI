This paper presents a novel approach to understanding human active sensing, specifically in the context of visual search. The authors propose a goal-directed, context-sensitive, Bayesian control strategy called C-DAC, which optimizes behavioral costs and adapts to changing task conditions. They also introduce a myopic approximation to C-DAC, which reduces computational complexity while retaining context-sensitivity. The paper compares the performance of C-DAC, myopic C-DAC, and Infomax, a previously proposed algorithm that maximizes expected cumulative future information gain, against human behavioral data from a visual search experiment.
The main claims of the paper are: (1) C-DAC and myopic C-DAC outperform Infomax in explaining human behavioral data, particularly in capturing the confirmation bias phenomenon; (2) myopic C-DAC is a psychologically more plausible and computationally efficient approximation to C-DAC; and (3) the proposed bound on the stopping threshold for Infomax and myopic C-DAC allows for context-sensitive decision-making.
The support for these claims is strong, with the authors providing a thorough theoretical analysis and experimental results that demonstrate the superiority of C-DAC and myopic C-DAC in modeling human behavior. The paper is well-organized, and the writing is clear and concise. The authors provide a comprehensive review of previous work in the field and situate their contributions within the broader context of active sensing research.
The usefulness of the ideas presented in the paper is high, as they have implications for both brain sciences and the development of artificial systems. The authors demonstrate the potential of C-DAC and myopic C-DAC in explaining human behavioral data and highlight the limitations of Infomax in capturing context-sensitive decision-making.
The paper reflects common knowledge in the field, with the authors demonstrating a thorough understanding of relevant literature and terminology. The novelty of the work is significant, as the authors propose a new approach to active sensing that takes into account behavioral costs and context-sensitivity.
The completeness of the paper is good, with the authors providing sufficient details for reproducibility. However, some aspects of the experimental design and data analysis could be further elaborated upon.
The limitations of the paper are acknowledged by the authors, who note that C-DAC requires high representational complexity and that myopic C-DAC is an approximation that may not fully capture the nuances of human behavior.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the ideas presented are novel and significant. The authors provide strong support for their claims, and the paper has the potential to make a substantial contribution to the field of active sensing.
