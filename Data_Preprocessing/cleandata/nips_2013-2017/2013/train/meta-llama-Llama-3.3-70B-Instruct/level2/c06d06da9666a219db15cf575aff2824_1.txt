This paper presents a novel approach to learning the structure of Markov networks from data using constraint satisfaction techniques. The authors introduce a characterization of Markov network structure using a balancing condition on separators between cliques, which enables the use of existing solver technology to compute optimal networks. The paper provides a clear and well-organized presentation of the problem, the proposed approach, and the experimental evaluation.
The main claims of the paper are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors demonstrate that their approach can be used to learn optimal Markov networks from data, and that it outperforms previous methods in terms of computational efficiency and accuracy.
