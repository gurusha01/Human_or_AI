This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of machine learning, addressing the question of whether more data can be used to speed up computation time for learning tasks. The authors provide a positive answer to this question for a natural supervised learning problem, specifically agnostic PAC learning of halfspaces over 3-sparse vectors. The main claim of the paper is that, under a widely believed assumption about the hardness of refuting random 3CNF formulas, it is impossible to efficiently learn this class using only O(n^2) examples, while a new algorithm can learn this class efficiently using Ω̃(n^2) examples.
The support for this claim is based on a novel, non-cryptographic technique for establishing computational-statistical tradeoffs. The authors show that, under the µ-R3SAT hardness assumption, there exists no efficient learning algorithm that learns the class Hn,3 using O(n^(1+µ)) examples. They also provide a new algorithm that learns Hn,3 efficiently using O(n^2 log^3(n)) examples.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their results. The use of a novel technique for establishing computational-statistical tradeoffs is a significant contribution to the field. The paper also provides a good discussion of the related work and the implications of the results.
The usefulness of the ideas presented in the paper is high, as they provide a new perspective on the tradeoff between sample and computational complexity for learning tasks.

Arguments pro acceptance:
* The paper presents a significant contribution to the field of machine learning.
* The results have implications for the design of learning algorithms and the understanding of the limitations of current algorithms.
* The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their results.

Arguments con acceptance:
* The paper assumes a widely believed assumption about the hardness of refuting random 3CNF formulas, which may not be true.
* The gap between the lower and upper bounds is still open, and the authors conjecture that Hn,3 can be learnt efficiently using a sample of Õ(n^1.5) examples.
* The paper does not provide a comprehensive evaluation of the new algorithm, and the authors suggest that this is an open question for future research.
