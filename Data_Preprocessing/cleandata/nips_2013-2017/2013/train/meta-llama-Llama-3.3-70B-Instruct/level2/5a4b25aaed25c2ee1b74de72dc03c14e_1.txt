This paper proposes a novel approach to approximate inference in high-treewidth graphical models by projecting the intractable distribution onto a "fast-mixing" set, where Gibbs sampling is guaranteed to converge rapidly to the stationary distribution. The authors derive a dual algorithm to solve the projection under several divergences, including Euclidean distance, piecewise KL-divergence, and reversed KL-divergence. The experimental results show that the proposed methods are more accurate than variational approximations and Gibbs sampling on the original parameters with finite time.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem and their approach. The technical contributions are significant, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of the proposed methods. The experimental evaluation is comprehensive, and the results are promising.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel approach to approximate inference in high-treewidth graphical models
* The derivation of a dual algorithm to solve the projection under several divergences
* The comprehensive experimental evaluation, which shows the effectiveness of the proposed methods
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The looseness of the spectral norm bound, which may be too conservative in some cases
* The lack of a tighter bound on when rapid mixing will occur
* The need for further work to extend the approach to general Markov random fields
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the authors provide a significant contribution to the field of approximate inference in graphical models. The proposed approach has the potential to be useful in practice, and the experimental results are promising. However, further work is needed to address the weaknesses of the paper and to extend the approach to more general cases.
