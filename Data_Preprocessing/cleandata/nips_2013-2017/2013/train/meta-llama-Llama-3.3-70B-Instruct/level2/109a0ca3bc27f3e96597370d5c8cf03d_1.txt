This paper presents a comprehensive study on structured Schatten norms for tensors, with a focus on the "latent" approach for tensor decomposition. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the performance of this approach, both theoretically and empirically, and demonstrate its superiority over the "overlapped" approach in certain settings.
The paper is well-organized and clearly written, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments. The introduction provides a good background on tensor decomposition and the motivation for the study. The technical sections are detailed and well-explained, with appropriate references to previous work.
The main contributions of the paper are:
1. A novel duality result between the overlapped and latent Schatten norms, which is interesting in its own right and has implications for structured sparsity.
2. A theoretical analysis of the performance of the latent approach, including consistency and denoising bounds.
3. Empirical confirmation of the theoretical predictions through numerical simulations.
The paper has several strengths:
* The authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the technical concepts, making the paper accessible to a broad audience.
* The theoretical analysis is rigorous and well-supported by empirical evidence.
* The paper provides a comprehensive comparison with previous work, including the overlapped approach.
However, there are some areas for improvement:
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the implications of the results for practical applications.
* Some of the technical sections are quite dense and may require multiple readings to fully understand.
* The empirical evaluation could be more extensive, including a wider range of scenarios and comparison with other state-of-the-art methods.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication. The authors have made a significant contribution to the field of tensor decomposition and structured sparsity, and the paper is well-written and easy to follow.
