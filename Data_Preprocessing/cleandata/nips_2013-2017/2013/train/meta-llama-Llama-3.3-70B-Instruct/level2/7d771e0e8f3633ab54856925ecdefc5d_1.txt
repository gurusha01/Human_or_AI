This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of symbolic planning under uncertainty, addressing the scalability of factored state and action spaces in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). The authors introduce two novel algorithms: Factored Action Modified Policy Iteration (FA-MPI) and Opportunistic Policy Iteration (OPI), which improve upon existing state-of-the-art algorithms.
The main claim of the paper is that OPI, which opportunistically enforces policy constraints during policy evaluation, achieves better scalability and convergence than FA-MPI and other existing algorithms. The authors support this claim through a series of experiments on various domains, including Inventory Control, SysAdmin, and Elevator Control, demonstrating the effectiveness of OPI in reducing computation time and memory usage.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the algorithms and their motivations. The experimental results are thorough and well-presented, providing a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed algorithms. The authors also discuss the limitations of their approach and provide suggestions for future work, including the exploration of approximate value backups and more compact representations.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The introduction of two novel algorithms, FA-MPI and OPI, which address the scalability of factored state and action spaces in MDPs.
* A thorough experimental evaluation of the proposed algorithms on various domains.
* A clear and concise explanation of the algorithms and their motivations.
* A discussion of the limitations of the approach and suggestions for future work.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes a significant amount of background knowledge in symbolic planning and MDPs, which may make it difficult for non-experts to follow.
* Some of the experimental results, such as the comparison of OPI with FA-MPI, could be more detailed and comprehensive.
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the theoretical properties of the proposed algorithms, including their convergence guarantees and computational complexity.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of symbolic planning under uncertainty and demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in improving scalability and convergence. The authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the algorithms and their motivations, and the experimental results are thorough and well-presented.
