This paper presents a distributed stochastic dual coordinate ascent (DisDCA) algorithm for solving regularized loss minimization problems in a distributed framework. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the tradeoff between computation and communication, and they propose a practical variant of the algorithm that leverages up-to-date information for updating dual variables.
The main claims of the paper are: (1) the DisDCA algorithm possesses strong theoretical guarantees and competitive performances compared to distributed stochastic gradient descent methods and distributed alternating direction methods of multipliers; (2) the practical variant of DisDCA enjoys substantial improvements over the basic variant and other variants; and (3) the algorithm is a strong competitor in optimizing support vector machines (SVMs) in a distributed framework.
The support for these claims comes from theoretical analysis and empirical experiments on real-world datasets. The authors provide convergence bounds for the DisDCA algorithm and analyze the tradeoff between computation and communication. They also present experimental results that demonstrate the effectiveness of the practical variant and compare it to other distributed algorithms.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the algorithm and its analysis. The experiments are well-designed, and the results are presented in a clear and easy-to-understand manner.
The usefulness of the ideas presented in the paper is high, as they provide a new approach to solving regularized loss minimization problems in a distributed framework. The paper has the potential to impact the field of machine learning, particularly in the area of distributed optimization.
The novelty of the paper is also high, as it presents a new algorithm and analysis that bridges the gap between stochastic dual coordinate ascent methods and distributed optimization. The authors provide a comprehensive review of related work and clearly explain how their approach differs from existing methods.
The quality of the paper is excellent, and it meets all the criteria for a good scientific paper. The authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the algorithm and its analysis, and they support their claims with theoretical and empirical evidence.
