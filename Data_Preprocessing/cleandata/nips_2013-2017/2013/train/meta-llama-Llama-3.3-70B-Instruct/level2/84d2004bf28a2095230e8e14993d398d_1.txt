This paper presents a novel approach to distributed submodular maximization, a fundamental problem in machine learning and data mining. The authors propose a simple, two-stage protocol called GREEDI, which can be easily implemented using MapReduce-style computations. The paper provides a thorough theoretical analysis of the approach, including bounds on its performance and conditions under which it achieves near-optimal solutions.
The main claims of the paper are: (1) GREEDI is a communication-efficient protocol for distributed submodular maximization, (2) it achieves near-optimal solutions under certain natural conditions, and (3) it can be applied to a wide range of machine learning problems, including exemplar-based clustering and active set selection.
The support for these claims is strong, with a combination of theoretical analysis and extensive experimental results. The theoretical analysis provides bounds on the performance of GREEDI, including a guarantee that it achieves a solution within a factor of (1 - 1/e)^2 of the optimal centralized solution. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of GREEDI on several large-scale datasets, including the Tiny Images dataset and the Yahoo! Front Page dataset.
The paper is well-written, with clear explanations of the approach and its theoretical analysis. The experiments are well-designed and provide strong evidence for the effectiveness of GREEDI. The authors also provide a thorough discussion of related work and the limitations of their approach.
The usefulness of the ideas presented in the paper is high, as they provide a scalable and efficient solution to a fundamental problem in machine learning and data mining. The approach has the potential to be applied to a wide range of applications, including clustering, feature selection, and recommender systems.
The paper reflects common knowledge in the field, with a clear understanding of the relevant literature and the limitations of existing approaches. The authors provide a thorough discussion of related work and demonstrate a deep understanding of the theoretical and practical aspects of submodular maximization.
The novelty of the approach is high, as it provides a new and efficient solution to a fundamental problem in machine learning and data mining. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the approach and demonstrate its effectiveness on several large-scale datasets.
