This paper presents a novel approach to approximate nearest neighbor retrieval in both metric and non-metric spaces using a VP-tree with a learned pruner. The authors propose two simple yet effective learning-to-prune methods: density estimation through sampling and "stretching" of the triangle inequality. The method is evaluated on several datasets with different distance functions, including Euclidean, KL-divergence, and Itakura-Saito distance.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem and the proposed method. The experimental evaluation is thorough, and the results show that the proposed method is competitive with state-of-the-art approaches, including the multi-probe LSH, permutation methods, and the bbtree. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the results, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed method.
The main claims of the paper are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors provide a proof of the applicability of the VP-tree to a class of non-metric distances, which includes the KL-divergence. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve better trade-offs between rank approximation quality and retrieval speed, especially for datasets with low or moderate intrinsic dimensionality.
The paper is original and significant, as it presents a new approach to approximate nearest neighbor retrieval in non-metric spaces. The authors provide a comprehensive review of related work and demonstrate that their method is competitive with state-of-the-art approaches. The paper is well-organized, and the writing is clear and concise.
However, there are some limitations to the paper. The authors acknowledge that the basic learning-to-prune methods employed in this work can be improved using more sophisticated techniques, such as a better pivot-selection strategy or a more accurate approximation for the decision function. Additionally, the authors note that the VP-tree may not be the best approach in terms of recall, as it often returns the second or third nearest neighbor instead of the true nearest neighbor.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, as it presents a novel and significant contribution to the field of approximate nearest neighbor retrieval. The paper is well-written, and the results are thorough and well-analyzed. The authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem and the proposed method, and the experimental evaluation is comprehensive.
