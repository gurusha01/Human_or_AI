This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of machine learning by establishing the linear convergence of the proximal gradient method (PGM) for solving a class of trace norm-regularized problems. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the problem, including a detailed introduction, preliminaries, and main results.
The main claim of the paper is that the PGM has a linear convergence rate for a large class of loss functions, without requiring strong convexity. This is a significant improvement over existing results, which typically require strong convexity to achieve linear convergence. The authors support their claim with a rigorous proof, which involves establishing a new Lipschitzian error bound for trace norm-regularized problems.
The paper is well-organized, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their results. The introduction provides a good overview of the problem and its significance, while the preliminaries section provides the necessary background and notation. The main results section presents the key contributions of the paper, including the error bound and the linear convergence result.
The authors also provide numerical experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach. The experiments show that the PGM achieves linear convergence in practice, which is consistent with the theoretical results.
