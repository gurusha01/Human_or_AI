This paper proposes a novel approach to learning dynamic models from non-sequence data using tensor decomposition methods. The authors demonstrate that under reasonable assumptions, their approach can provably recover the parameters of first-order Markov models and hidden Markov models. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their methodology and theoretical guarantees.
The main claims of the paper are: (1) the proposed tensor decomposition method can learn first-order Markov models and hidden Markov models from non-sequence data, and (2) the approach provides a formal guarantee on learning dynamic models in a non-sequential setting. The authors support these claims with theoretical analysis and simulation results.
The paper's strengths include: (1) the proposal of a novel approach to learning dynamic models from non-sequence data, (2) the provision of theoretical guarantees for the approach, and (3) the demonstration of the approach's effectiveness through simulation results. The paper's weaknesses include: (1) the assumption of a specific generative process for the non-sequence data, which may not always hold in practice, and (2) the lack of comparison with existing methods for learning dynamic models from non-sequence data.
The paper's contributions are significant, as it provides a new approach to learning dynamic models from non-sequence data and demonstrates its effectiveness. The paper's impact is likely to be high, as it has the potential to be applied to a wide range of fields, including biology, medicine, and social sciences.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel approach to learning dynamic models from non-sequence data.
* The authors provide theoretical guarantees for the approach.
* The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The assumption of a specific generative process for the non-sequence data may not always hold in practice.
* The paper lacks comparison with existing methods for learning dynamic models from non-sequence data.
Overall, I recommend accepting the paper, as its contributions and impact outweigh its weaknesses. However, I suggest that the authors address the weaknesses by providing more discussion on the assumption of the generative process and comparing their approach with existing methods.
