This paper proposes a novel approach to the adaptive anonymity problem, where each individual shares their data along with an integer value to indicate their personal level of desired privacy. The authors introduce a relaxation of k-anonymity, called b-matching, which achieves better utility and accommodates variable levels of anonymity for each individual. The paper provides theoretical analysis and empirical results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
The main claims of the paper are: (1) the b-matching approach provides similar privacy protection to k-anonymity while offering greater utility, and (2) the approach can handle heterogeneous anonymity levels for each user. The authors support these claims through theoretical analysis, including proofs of privacy guarantees, and empirical results on benchmark and social data-sets.
The paper is well-organized, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the adaptive anonymity problem and the limitations of k-anonymity. The proposed b-matching approach is thoroughly described, and the theoretical analysis is rigorous. The empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in achieving better utility while maintaining similar privacy protection.
The paper has several strengths, including: (1) a clear and concise problem statement, (2) a thorough theoretical analysis, and (3) empirical results that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The paper also has some limitations, including: (1) the assumption that the data is discrete, and (2) the use of a simple model for the adversary.
In terms of novelty, the paper presents a significant improvement over existing approaches to k-anonymity, particularly in handling heterogeneous anonymity levels. The b-matching approach is a relaxation of k-anonymity that achieves better utility while maintaining similar privacy protection.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the proposed approach. The paper is suitable for publication in a top-tier conference, and the results have the potential to impact the field of data privacy.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel approach to the adaptive anonymity problem that achieves better utility while maintaining similar privacy protection.
* The theoretical analysis is rigorous, and the empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
* The paper has the potential to impact the field of data privacy, particularly in handling heterogeneous anonymity levels.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The paper assumes that the data is discrete, which may not be the case in many real-world applications.
* The paper uses a simple model for the adversary, which may not be realistic in many scenarios.
Overall, I recommend accepting the paper, as it presents a significant improvement over existing approaches to k-anonymity and has the potential to impact the field of data privacy. However, the authors should consider addressing the limitations of the paper, including the assumption of discrete data and the use of a simple model for the adversary.
