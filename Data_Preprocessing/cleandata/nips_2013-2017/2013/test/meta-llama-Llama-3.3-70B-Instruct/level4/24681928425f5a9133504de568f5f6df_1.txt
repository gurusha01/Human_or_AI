This manuscript proposes a methodology for determining the structure of stochastic And-Or grammars, positioning it as an extension of prior research on structure learning. However, it essentially tackles a specialized scenario that renders the problem manageable. This approach is justified in its own right, and the manuscript offers a valuable contribution, thus it is not necessary to overstate its generality in relation to the structure learning challenges encountered in natural language processing. The fundamental algorithm is logical and demonstrates effectiveness when benchmarked against alternative grammar induction techniques.
To enhance the experimental assessment, incorporating additional comparisons with other methodologies would be beneficial. Notably, the approach outlined by Stolcke and Omohondro (reference 14) appears to be applicable to both tasks and would provide a meaningful point of comparison. Overall, this is a robust paper that presents a viable method for learning the structure of a specific category of grammars.
