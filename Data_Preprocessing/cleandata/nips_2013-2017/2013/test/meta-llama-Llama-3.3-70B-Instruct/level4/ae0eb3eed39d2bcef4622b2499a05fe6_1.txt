The author has presented a proposal for parallelizing a clustering method, specifically an extension of DP-means referred to as OFL, alongside a feature selection method. This proposal is integrated into an optimistic concurrency control framework, originating from the parallel database community.
Upon examination, it appears that the proposed algorithm can be seamlessly adapted to the MapReduce framework, where parallel operations are encapsulated within the map stage and serial operations within the reduce stage.
The theoretical analysis provided contributes minimally to the overall value of the paper, as the concepts presented are largely straightforward and lack depth. Furthermore, the experimental results are underwhelming, achieving a speedup of only 4x when utilizing 8 processors, which raises concerns about the scalability and efficiency of the proposed algorithms.

A critical issue with the paper is its reliance on overly specialized algorithms for demonstration purposes and a deficient performance evaluation. A more effective approach might involve positioning the paper as a parallel implementation of the DP-means algorithm, with an extended discussion on optimistic concurrency control. The algorithms presented seem overly tailored and lack robust performance, which undermines the paper's overall impact.
