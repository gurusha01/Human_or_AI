This manuscript introduces novel distributed algorithms for center-based clustering techniques, demonstrating a reduction in communication overhead. With equivalent communication costs, the proposed methods yield improved clustering outcomes for both synthetic and real-world UCI datasets.
To enhance the paper's clarity, additional elaboration on the derivation process and theorem values would be beneficial, as the content is presently quite dense. 
Some concerns arise regarding the coreset's approximation quality, particularly in high-dimensional scenarios, given that the current experimental datasets are predominantly low-dimensional.
The title appears overly broad and does not accurately reflect the specific focus on center-based clustering methods utilizing coresets. The inclusion of the term "graphs" is also somewhat ambiguous, failing to highlight the distinctive contributions of the work. Essentially, the paper presents enhanced methods for distributed clustering based on centers, and while it is technically rigorous, it could benefit from clearer explanations to improve accessibility.
