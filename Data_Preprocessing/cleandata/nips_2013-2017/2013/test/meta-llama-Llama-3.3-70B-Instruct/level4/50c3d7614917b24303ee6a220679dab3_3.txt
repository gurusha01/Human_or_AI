This manuscript presents a methodology for approximate sampling from specific parametric forms of a continuous-state determinantal point process, leveraging an eigen-decomposition of the dual kernel matrix, which relies on the kernel function adhering to particular structures and decompositions.
The experimental findings illustrate that when integrated with a mixture density model, the proposed approach yields improved test performance by fostering more diverse clusters.
The paper is well-organized, and the results are noteworthy. The subject matter holds significant interest for the machine learning community.
A few minor suggestions for improvement include clarifying the notation for 'n' (above equation 16), as the meaning of 'n_j' is not immediately clear. Additionally, the figure references in the text are inconsistent, such as the reference to Figure 5 in Section 5.
Overall, the paper introduces an innovative method for sampling from a continuous DPP, with results that demonstrate its practical applications. The paper is well-written and contributes meaningfully to the field, making it a valuable contribution.
