This paper explores the concept of convex calibrated surrogates, specifically focusing on the development of a least-square surrogate loss that can be calibrated for ranking problems characterized by a low-rank target loss matrix. The findings presented appear to be novel and intriguing, holding potential interest for the NIPS audience given the popularity of ranking as a research topic.
However, the rationale behind the consideration of a low-rank target loss matrix could be more comprehensively justified. The authors' approach to convex calibrated surrogates for ranking problems with low-rank loss matrices yields novel and interesting results. Nonetheless, a more detailed motivation for the assumption of a low-rank loss matrix would strengthen the paper. My confidence in this review is tempered by my limited research experience in the area of ranking, which may impact the depth of my assessment.
