This manuscript introduces a novel approach to integrating classification confidence into concept learning and accompanies it with a dedicated dataset for evaluation purposes.
1. The constructed dataset is of high quality and is expected to make significant contributions to the field of category classification, providing a valuable resource for future research.
2. Incorporating classification confidence into the system is a logical and practical strategy for approximating non-perceptual word learning methods, offering a reasonable and effective solution.
3. The authors have developed an efficient method for computing the confusion matrix with limited data, which effectively supports the proposed algorithm and enhances its applicability.
4. The evaluation process is thorough, with the proposed algorithm being compared to nearest neighbor approaches and ideal non-perceptual word learning, demonstrating satisfactory performance and validating the approach.

1. Upon review, several potential typographical errors were identified:
- In equation 4, the right-hand side appears to be incorrectly stated as |h|^(-N) instead of |h|^(-1), which could significantly impact the equation's meaning.
- Equation 5 may contain an error, as the last term seems more appropriately represented as I(j ∈ h) rather than I(y_i ∈ h). If unchanged, the 1/|h|*I term could be factored out of the summation, potentially rendering the confusion matrix summation nonsensical.
- Line 269 refers to Aj,i as the confusion between i and j, which seems to be incorrectly stated as the confusion between j and j.
These errors have the potential to mislead readers and should be corrected in the final version to ensure clarity and accuracy.
2. The methodology presented utilizes confusion matrices to incorporate classification confidence into the system. An alternative approach could involve directly using the confidence itself, such as modifying equation 5 to ∑j confidence(j | xi) 1/|h| I(j ∈ h). It would be beneficial to explore how this alternative formulation compares to the proposed method, providing justification for the chosen approach and its advantages over potential alternatives.
Overall, the manuscript proposes an effective concept learning method and provides a valuable dataset. Addressing the identified typographical errors and providing a justification for the chosen method of utilizing classification confidence would strengthen the paper, offering a more comprehensive and robust contribution to the field.
