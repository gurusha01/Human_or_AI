The paper presents a novel approach to translingual representation learning, which involves utilizing matrix completion to generate multilingual vectors for each row, followed by the application of CL-LSI on these vectors.
Quality: Although the proposed method appears promising, the robustness of the results is questionable. It is possible that the positive outcomes are merely a consequence of LSI's scaling being more suitable for a linear SVM compared to OPCA or CCA. To validate the findings, I recommend that the authors employ a machine learning system that is resilient to individual feature rescalings, such as boosted decision trees, which are available in Weka. If the two-step system, combined with boosted decision trees, outperforms other techniques, it would strengthen the credibility of the results.
Significance: If the results are indeed robust, they would be noteworthy, as matrix completion is a well-controlled non-linear inference technique. The potential impact of this method could be substantial, making it an interesting contribution to the field.
Novelty: The idea presented in the paper seems to be innovative and original. The use of matrix completion and CL-LSI for translingual representation learning is a unique approach that has not been extensively explored before.
Clarity: There were some issues with clarity in the paper, particularly in the description of the unified document-term matrix construction. For instance, it is unclear whether the authors used a single term for every surface form or labeled each surface form from each language separately. Additionally, the experimental setup description is fragmented across Table 1, which made it challenging to understand. It would be beneficial to provide a clearer explanation of these aspects. The idea itself is intriguing, but I would like to see the authors explore other classifiers beyond linear SVM to confirm the robustness of the results and rule out any potential scaling artifacts.
