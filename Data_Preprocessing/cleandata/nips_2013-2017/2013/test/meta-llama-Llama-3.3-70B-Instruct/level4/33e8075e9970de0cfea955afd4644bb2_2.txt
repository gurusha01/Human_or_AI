This study seeks to establish a connection between wavelet signal processing theory and deep neural networks, and although the current contribution is limited, it represents a promising initial step in achieving this objective. The exploration of relationships between wavelet construction and deep auto-encoders is particularly noteworthy. However, the presentation of details is cumbersome and challenging to comprehend, suggesting a need for significant improvement to enhance overall readability. Overall, the work is an intriguing attempt to integrate wavelet signal processing theory with deep learning, but its potential is hindered by the complexity of the details and the necessity for a more refined and accessible presentation.
