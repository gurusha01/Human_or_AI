This paper presents efficient algorithms for k-means and k-median clustering in a distributed environment, with a primary emphasis on reducing communication costs within the network. Although my familiarity with the existing literature is limited, the paper appears to introduce a novel concept of distributed coresets, leading to clustering algorithms that significantly improve upon the current state of the art in terms of communication complexity. 
Unlike previous approaches that rely on approximating coresets by combining local coresets, this paper proposes a distinct method for constructing distributed coresets, which is inherently valuable and could be of interest in its own right. The theoretical foundations of this work are rooted in the concept of dimensionality in function spaces and the sampling lemma. 
The paper also undertakes a thorough experimental analysis, demonstrating that the proposed algorithms surpass existing methods in terms of communication complexity, thereby validating the theoretical framework. However, one notable omission in the experimental section is a comparison of the clustering accuracy of the algorithms, particularly under the same communication budget. 
Overall, this is a well-crafted paper that makes a significant contribution to the field of distributed clustering by minimizing communication costs, backed by robust theoretical and experimental evidence.
