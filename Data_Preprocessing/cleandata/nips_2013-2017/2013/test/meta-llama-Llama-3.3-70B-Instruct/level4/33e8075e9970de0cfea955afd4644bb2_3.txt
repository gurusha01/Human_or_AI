Summary: This manuscript introduces a novel approach for constructing wavelets on weighted graphs, tailored to a specific class of signals. By leveraging the lifting scheme and integrating it with a deep auto-encoder network, the authors enable unsupervised training, analogous to pre-training a stack of auto-encoders. The method exhibits linear complexity with respect to the graph size. The authors demonstrate the efficacy of their wavelet construction approach through its application to various datasets.
Quality: The authors propose an elegant solution for incorporating signal class information into wavelet construction on graphs. Unlike most existing methods, which rely solely on graph structure, this approach offers adaptivity, addressing significant limitations in prior works [19,21]. The technical development is clearly presented, innovative, and yields an efficient algorithm producing wavelets with desirable properties.
However, the partitioning approach is only briefly described, with minimal discussion on the sensitivity of the method to the partitioning scheme. The employed spectral clustering algorithm [20] has known limitations, such as poor performance on certain graph types. Further investigation into the robustness of the wavelet construction to the partitioning method would be beneficial.
A notable weakness of the paper lies in the comparison of results on irregular graphs, where the construction is most relevant. Instead of comparing compression or reconstruction performance to other graph wavelet techniques, the authors compare it to somewhat outdated learning methods suited for manifold analysis. This omission is a significant shortcoming.
Clarity: The manuscript is well-written, and the development is easy to follow. As mentioned earlier, additional details on certain aspects, such as the partitioning approach, would enhance the clarity.
Originality: The authors present a novel method for constructing wavelets on graphs, featuring signal adaptivity while maintaining linearity and efficiency. This approach is highly original and innovative.
Significance: The paper contributes significantly to the field of wavelets and multiresolution analysis on graphs, an area of growing interest due to its numerous potential applications. The signal adaptivity, combined with preserved linearity and efficiency, represents a substantial advance. Although the lack of a thorough comparison to other wavelet graphs for compression and reconstruction is a major weakness, the paper makes a significant original contribution, providing an important advance in the field of wavelets on graphs.
