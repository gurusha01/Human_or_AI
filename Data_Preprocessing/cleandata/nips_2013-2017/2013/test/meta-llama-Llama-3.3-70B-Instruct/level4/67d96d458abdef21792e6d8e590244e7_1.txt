This paper presents a groundbreaking blind deconvolution algorithm, demonstrating exceptional performance in both uniform and non-uniform scenarios. The authors provide a thorough examination of the underlying factors contributing to the algorithm's efficacy. The manuscript includes an extensive array of experimental results, benchmarked against state-of-the-art algorithms for both uniform and non-uniform cases. The writing is lucid and refined, making the paper a pleasure to read. In my opinion, this work constitutes a substantial addition to the existing literature on blind deconvolution.
To further enhance the paper, it would be insightful for the authors to explore the connection between their novel technique and the variational deblurring algorithm proposed by Levin et al. [15], which also employs marginalization over x to estimate the blur kernel. Notably, the authors' formulation commences with an even simpler prior than the heavy-tailed one utilized by Levin et al. However, whereas Levin et al. rely on fixed variances, the authors introduce spatially varying hyper-parameters for these variances - a distinction that may prove crucial. Ultimately, the paper introduces a innovative and intriguing new algorithm for blind deconvolution, offering a valuable contribution to the field.
