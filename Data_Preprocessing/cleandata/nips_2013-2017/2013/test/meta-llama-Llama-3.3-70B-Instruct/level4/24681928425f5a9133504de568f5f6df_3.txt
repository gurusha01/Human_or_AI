This manuscript presents a novel approach to unsupervised learning of AND-OR grammar structures, distinct from prior methods that separately identify AND and OR operations. Instead, it induces unified AND-OR fragments, with the value of proposed new fragments computable using sufficient statistics. The approach is applied to parsing events and visual objects, demonstrating its potential.
Overall, the paper addresses an important problem with a well-motivated and technically sound approach. However, some aspects require clarification, such as whether the "surrogate measure" of likelihood gain is exact or approximate, and the scalability of the method to learning fragments with arity greater than 2 or its limitation to Chomsky normal form grammars.
The experimental section raises significant concerns due to a lack of clarity regarding the methodology, representation of examples, and the learned outcomes. The presentation seems tailored to readers intimately familiar with recent work from S. C. Zhu's group, potentially limiting its accessibility to a broader audience. To enhance understanding, especially for outsiders, the inclusion of supplementary materials with detailed explanations and concrete illustrations of the experiments is recommended.
Notably, the absence of examples showcasing interesting structures discovered in the learned grammars is a missed opportunity. While the quantitative results are satisfactory, they lack the excitement and insight that qualitative examples of learned structures could provide, especially in comparison to competing approaches. The paper's potential could be further realized by demonstrating the learning of meaningful structures, thereby making the results more compelling and illuminating. In summary, this is an interesting contribution to unsupervised learning of AND-OR grammars, though improvements in the clarity and presentation of experiments, along with the inclusion of supplementary materials, would significantly enhance its impact.
