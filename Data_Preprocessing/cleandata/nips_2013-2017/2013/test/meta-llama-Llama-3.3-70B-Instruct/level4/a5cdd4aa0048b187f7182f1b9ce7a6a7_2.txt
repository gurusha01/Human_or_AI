This paper presents a methodology for designing a convex least squares-style surrogate loss for high-arity multiclass losses with a low-rank structure, providing a clear and well-structured approach. The introduction of the loss matrix \mathbf{L} is a notable aspect, although it would be beneficial to express the condition in Theorem 3 in matrix form for added clarity. Overall, the paper is exceptionally well-written and effectively demonstrates how to create convex surrogates for multiclass losses in a manner that enhances tractability, leveraging the low-rank structure of the target loss. The authors successfully illustrate the applicability of this approach to various popular losses that exhibit such a structure, and provide a constructive method for building an efficient surrogate.
