This manuscript presents a novel approach to face verification, which involves determining whether two images represent the same individual. The proposed method utilizes an auxiliary training set comprising 15 images of 450 distinct persons. The face images are preprocessed using low-level features, specifically Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), followed by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and z-score normalization, resulting in one template per training image. During the testing phase, each image to be compared is encoded through a series of steps: (i) computing the normalized dot product between the test image template and each template of the k-th person, (ii) calculating the mean value of these dot products to obtain the k-th component of the test image representation, and (iii) repeating the process for all training persons, yielding a 450-dimensional representation. This process is applied independently to both images to be compared, and the final score is determined by the normalized dot product between their computed representations. The experimental validation is conducted on four datasets: PubFig83, a newly introduced dataset, PubFig, and LFW, with the results showing promise but lacking comparisons with recent related work, and ultimately falling short of the performance achieved by competing approaches.
The paper has several positive aspects, including:
- being well-written, with a clear presentation of a new face recognition approach and an attempt to link it with the theory of [1] and discuss its biological plausibility,
- clarity in its exposition,
- and the design of interesting and reasonable experiments.
However, there are also several negative points:
- the concept of utilizing auxiliary datasets and representing images by their similarities to prototypes has a long history in computer vision and has seen increased attention in recent years, with examples such as [a] using separate linear SVM classifiers for each exemplar in the training set, and [b-i] focusing on transferring knowledge about faces from auxiliary datasets. Notably, [i] observed that faces of the same person often share top neighbors in the auxiliary set, leading to a ranking order list for face comparison. The proposed approach, although distinct, fails to cite or discuss these related works, raising concerns,
- the experimental validation lacks comparisons with previous works, despite several competing approaches using auxiliary training sets for face recognition being directly comparable. Furthermore, the results reported on the LFW results page for the 'Outside training data in recognition system' category exceed those obtained by the paper,
- the experimental validation does not adequately demonstrate whether the improvement is due to the method itself or the quality of the auxiliary dataset. A simple experiment representing test images as normalized dot products with the whole set of test images could help clarify this. If the results are comparable to the proposed approach, it would support the theory of [a] over [1]. There is a noticeable gap between the theoretical sections (1, 2, and 3) discussing orbits, geometric transforms, groups, and CFD signatures, and the practical sections (4 and 5) which simplify to an exemplar-based recognition approach using dot products, making it unclear if the proposed framework is truly an application of [1] or an exemplar-based system akin to [a].

In conclusion, while the paper presents an interesting approach to face recognition, its impact is diminished by the lack of discussion and comparison with recent related works, as well as insufficient experimental validation to fully support its claims.
