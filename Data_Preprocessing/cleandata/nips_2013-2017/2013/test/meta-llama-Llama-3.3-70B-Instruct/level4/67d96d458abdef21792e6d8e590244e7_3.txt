This paper tackles the issue of single image blind deconvolution with non-uniform blur resulting from camera shake, proposing a two-step approach: estimating motion blur and then recovering the latent image via non-blind deconvolution. The key contribution lies in the development of a Bayesian inference strategy for motion blur estimation. Through various experiments, the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method and compare it to state-of-the-art techniques. The mathematical underpinnings appear robust, and the proposed scheme is said to possess several favorable properties, although these are discussed without empirical evidence in the latter part of Section 4. 
Notably, the authors omit references to recent works that share similar reasoning, specifically [15] and the notable omission of "Bayesian Blind Deconvolution with General Sparse Image Priors" by S.D.Babacan et al. from ECCV 2012. Furthermore, they miss the opportunity to benchmark their approach against other leading single image blind deblurring methods for both uniform and non-uniform blur by not referencing "Recording and playback of camera shake: Benchmarking blind deconvolution with a real-world database" by R.Kohler et al. from ECCV 2012. Several questions remain unanswered, detracting from the paper's overall quality.
The paper is well-structured and clearly written, but Section 4 could be improved by division into smaller subsections due to its length. Important details, such as the algorithm used for final non-blind deconvolution, are lacking, which hampers the paper's clarity. The theoretical basis, building on [19,26], is novel in its application to single image blind deconvolution.
Despite delivering comparable results to state-of-the-art algorithms, the insights provided are limited. It is unclear when the proposed method outperforms others and why, lacking connection to recent relevant work and failing to contextualize its contribution. 
Additional queries and suggestions include:
- The method employed for final non-blind deconvolution is not specified.
- The claim of being "parameter-free" needs clarification, especially regarding kernel size.
- A plot showing the evolution of $\lambda$ during motion blur estimation would be insightful.
- The basis chosen for non-uniform blur experiments and the evaluation method for $w^\bar_i$ are unclear.
- Clarification on the employment of a coarse-to-fine scheme is needed.
- Typical run-times for the proposed method and its performance scaling with kernel size are not provided.
- The comparison with Whyte's result could be more accurate by using the version from the project webpage.
- The correct reference for the efficient filter flow framework is M.Hirsch et al.'s "Efficient filter flow for space-variant multiframe blind deconvolution" from CVPR 2010.
- The limitations of the proposed approach are not discussed.
In summary, the paper presents an intriguing Bayesian approach to motion blur estimation but falls short by not connecting with relevant prior work and lacking a quantitative evaluation for non-uniform blur, significantly reducing its impact and value.
