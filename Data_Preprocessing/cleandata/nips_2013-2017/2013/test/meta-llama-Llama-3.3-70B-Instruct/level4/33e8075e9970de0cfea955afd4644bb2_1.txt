This paper presents a novel method for developing a linear wavelet transform on weighted graphs utilizing the lifting scheme, possessing several desirable characteristics: 1) it scales linearly with the graph size in terms of both memory and time, 2) it is adaptable to a specific class of signals, 3) it allows for exact analysis and synthesis, thereby enabling perfect signal reconstruction, and 4) it facilitates efficient training by drawing parallels with deep auto-encoder networks.
The presentation of the paper is commendable, boasting a clear structure and lucid writing style. Following a concise overview and introduction, the authors delve into a detailed derivation of their methodology and demonstrate its validity and versatility through a series of experiments.
The proposed approach and wavelet construction expand upon existing research, making a significant contribution to the field of graph-based signal processing by introducing a general-purpose wavelet transform with numerous favourable properties.
The authors establish an intriguing link between wavelet construction on graphs and auto-encoder networks, which is likely to stimulate further research in this area. Moreover, this work is poised to serve as a versatile tool for analyzing signals on graphs.
Additional comments include:
* It would be beneficial if the authors could provide a more precise definition of "sufficient" in Section 4.5. In the context of a general problem, what criteria would be used to determine the requisite number of eigenvectors to consider?
* The meaning of the colorbars in Figures 4 and 5 is unclear and warrants clarification.
* In Section 4.7, a minor correction is suggested: "It is also possible o" should be revised to "It is also possible to".
The paper develops a non-trivial, general-purpose wavelet transform for signals on weighted graphs, exhibiting several favourable properties. Its connection to auto-encoder networks is noteworthy, and it is likely to inspire further research along these lines.
