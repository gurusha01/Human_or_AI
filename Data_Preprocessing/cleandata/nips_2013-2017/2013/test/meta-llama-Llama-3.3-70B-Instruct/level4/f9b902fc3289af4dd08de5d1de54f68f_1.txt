This manuscript addresses the challenge of identifying mid-level features through the application of discriminative mean-shift. The authors' proposed methodology modifies the conventional mean-shift algorithm to operate within a discriminative framework, enabling its application to the discovery of mid-level patches. Furthermore, they introduce a more systematic approach to evaluating mid-level patch discovery outcomes using purity-coverage curves, demonstrating the superiority of their algorithm over existing methods in terms of these metrics. Notably, their algorithm achieves significant performance gains compared to existing methods on the MIT 67-scene dataset, both when used independently of Fisher vectors and when combined with them. Although the overall improvement in performance relative to BoP+IFV [8] is a modest 2.7%, the use of mid-level patches alone yields a substantial enhancement, from 46% to 64%, compared to BoP [8] alone.
In general, I find the application of the discriminative mean-shift algorithm presented in this paper to be innovative, particularly in the context of detection-like settings, with highly promising results. The manuscript is well-structured, and the analysis of the results is thorough. Therefore, I strongly recommend that this paper be accepted for presentation at NIPS.
Several minor concerns and suggestions are worth considering:
- It would be beneficial to provide the execution time of the proposed algorithm and compare it to that of existing methods.
- The authors should consider releasing the source code upon publication to facilitate further research and replication.
- Citing the work by Wang and Yagi [2007] would be appropriate, as it shares a similar name, and a brief discussion on the distinctions between the two approaches could be included.
- Applying this methodology to the SUN dataset, where object segmentation data is available, could yield valuable insights into the object categories most frequently selected by mid-level patches, potentially revealing underlying semantic structures. The paper's concept of utilizing discriminative mean-shift for mid-level visual element discovery is well-presented, with promising results and a clear, well-analyzed narrative.
