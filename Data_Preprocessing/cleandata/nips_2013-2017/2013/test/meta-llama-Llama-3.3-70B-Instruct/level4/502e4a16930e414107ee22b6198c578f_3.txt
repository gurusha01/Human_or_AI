This manuscript presents a theoretical examination of two policy iteration variants, yielding improved worst-case iteration complexity bounds of O(log(n)) in one instance and a constant factor of 2 in the other. Furthermore, the authors extend their analysis to one variant applied to deterministic MDPs, resulting in an iteration complexity improvement of O(n).
However, in its current form, I cannot endorse the acceptance of this paper. The presentation is overly concise, and the enhanced bounds, in isolation, are not particularly noteworthy. While the authors assert that their proof techniques offer scientific value, it is challenging to discern this from the manuscript due to its rushed exposition.
The techniques employed to improve the initial two bounds closely follow preceding work. In contrast, the proofs in the deterministic MDP setting appear more innovative, yet they are hindered by (a) the lack of definitions for crucial terms such as "transient" and "recurrent," and (b) the authors' acknowledgment that the assumptions underlying their proofs are excessively stringent, thereby rendering their correctness and applicability uncertain.
To strengthen their manuscript, the authors should provide a clearer motivation for their work and more effectively highlight their contributions. 
Several minor issues require attention:
- A thorough spell check is necessary.
- On line 85, the variable \pi' is not utilized within the max function.
- At line 115, "convergen" should be corrected.
- Line 125 contains a typo, "observtation," which should be amended.
- The word "mentionned" is misspelled at line 134.
- Footnote 6 would be better placed in an appendix.
- Line 177 references "Sherman-Morrisson," which appears to be a typo.
- The statement at line 180 is not immediately clear, although it seems plausible.
- An explanation for the conjectures at line 182 would be beneficial.
- Definitions for "transient" and "recurrent" are needed at line 233.
- "Appdx" at line 277 should be expanded.
- Lines 292 contain the misspelling "mentionned" and could be further developed.
Upon reviewing the author feedback and discussions with fellow reviewers, it becomes apparent that my initial assessment may have been overly critical. To enhance the manuscript, the authors should emphasize the contributions embedded within the proofs to assist less discerning readers. Ultimately, I recommend rejecting this paper as it fails to provide substantially improved bounds or evidently insightful proof techniques.
