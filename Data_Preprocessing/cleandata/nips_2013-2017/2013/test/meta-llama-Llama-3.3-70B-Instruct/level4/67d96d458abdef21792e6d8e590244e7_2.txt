This manuscript presents a methodology for non-uniform, space-varying blind deconvolution, building heavily on the foundation established in reference [26]. The authors propose solving equation 9, which bears a strong resemblance to equations 26 and 27 in reference [26], utilizing the novel upper bound derived in equation 7. The analysis of the prior's effects is conducted on the original cost function, revealing that the proposed prior dynamically adjusts the concavity and convexity of the image-blur prior based on the magnitude of local image gradients and the L2 norm of the blur. The theory suggests that when the blur is known at any pixel, a high L2 norm can only be achieved with a Dirac delta, implying the image is initially sharp, and thus a highly concave prior that induces gradient sparsity is beneficial. Conversely, where the blur approximates an averaging kernel, the prior becomes less concave, allowing for reduced sensitivity to fine details and increased sensitivity to coarse details.
Quality:

The algorithm and underlying theory are intriguing and persuasive. However, despite the thorough explanation of the proposed prior's effects, several aspects remain unexplored. Key points of concern include:
1. The analysis focuses on the original cost (equation 9), but the implications of the novel bound (equation 7) are not discussed.
2. An examination of how the analysis changes under uniform conditions would complement the experiments in Figure 2 and provide additional insight.
3. In light of the findings in reference [16], a discussion on how this prior addresses the limitations of classic priors, specifically whether the blurry image and no-blur solution is no longer a global or local minimum, would be valuable.
Clarity:
--
The authors generally provide a clear explanation of their approach. Nevertheless, there is a noticeable disconnect between paragraphs in Section 3. For instance, the connection between equation 7 (the approximation) and cost 9 is not clearly established, and equation 7 is not referenced later in the text, appearing only in the supplementary material. A revision of this section is recommended. The notation using "w" for weights and "\hat w" for blur kernels is confusing due to their distinct meanings, despite the relation outlined in equation 8. Consider revising the notation, such as using "hi" for "\hat wi", to improve clarity. Equation 6 should be reviewed for potential typos, including the exponent of T and the possibility of a missing product over "i" under the integral.
Originality:
--
The originality of this work is somewhat limited by the extensive research in reference [26]. A discussion highlighting the differences between this work and reference [26] would be beneficial. The novel contributions appear to be the bound (equation 7) and the explanation of the prior's operation via Theorem 1, although the complexity of the prior makes the explanation somewhat approximate.
Significance:
--
The development of novel priors for blind deconvolution is a significant area of research, and this paper contributes to the direction initiated by reference [26]. Given the algorithm's experimental performance, this approach warrants attention. The study and development of such priors are crucial, and this manuscript further advances this field.
Overall, this paper introduces several novel elements, including a practical bound for a cost function that simplifies implementation and an analysis that explains the general behavior of the adaptive prior. The performance of the algorithm is commendable, making it a valuable contribution to the field of blind deconvolution.
