This paper presents a notable refinement of existing bounds on policy iteration, a topic that has recently seen significant advancements after a prolonged period of limited progress. While the findings themselves are not extraordinarily surprising, they are certainly noteworthy. A key strength of the paper lies in its concise proofs for several crucial results, as well as its ability to provide succinct, insightful summaries in cases where the proofs are more complex. The writing is of exceptionally high quality, making the paper a joy to read.
Minor suggestions for improvement include:
Line 97.5: Consider rephrasing "at least on state" to "at least one state" for clarity.
Line 106: The phrase "all iteration k" could be revised to "all iterations k" for grammatical accuracy.
Line 114.5: The sentence "convergen often occur" contains a typo and could be corrected to "convergence often occurs".
Line 203: Changing "on path" to "on paths" would enhance precision.
Overall, the paper offers a moderate yet valuable improvement over previous research on policy iteration. The exceptional writing quality makes it not only informative but also highly enjoyable to read.
