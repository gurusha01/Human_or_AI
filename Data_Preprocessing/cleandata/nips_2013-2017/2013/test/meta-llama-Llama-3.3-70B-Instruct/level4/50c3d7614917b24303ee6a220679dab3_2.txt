This paper aims to achieve sampling from a continuous determinantal point process, a feat that has not been accomplished for general continuous kernels until now. The authors propose a versatile 'meta'-algorithm that can be applied to various kernels, although the ease of derivation may differ depending on the specific kernel. 
Previous research focused on translation-invariant kernels within compact domains. The introduced random Fourier features method expands the applicability of these features to general Euclidean spaces with translation-invariant kernels. Furthermore, the proposed Nystrom method extends this to general kernels, relying on effective landmark selection and performing better in low-dimensional problems.
Although the RFF and Nystrom methods have been utilized in the discrete version of the DPP, the primary innovation of this work lies in determining how to perform parts of the approximation analytically in certain special cases. Notably, explicit sampling algorithms are developed for Gaussian, Cauchy, and Laplace kernel settings.
Overall, I found the paper to be well-motivated and accessible, making it an enjoyable read. However, it exceeds the NIPS margins, resulting in an overly lengthy paper. Nonetheless, it constitutes a valuable contribution to the DPP thread in machine learning, and I recommend its acceptance.
Some minor comments and suggestions include:
- Providing more detailed derivations of the Gibbs sampling step for the repulsive mixture would be beneficial. Explicitly writing out the prior and likelihood for the sampling step would enhance clarity.
- In Algorithm 1 in the appendix, the distinction between Y and script-Y is not immediately clear and may cause confusion upon initial reading.
- Deriving the Nystrom method for a non-translation-invariant kernel would be interesting, as it would demonstrate the method's capabilities beyond those of Fourier-based features.
This paper presents a significant extension to the intriguing line of work on determinantal point processes in machine learning, and I appreciated reading it. I hope it will be accepted for publication.
