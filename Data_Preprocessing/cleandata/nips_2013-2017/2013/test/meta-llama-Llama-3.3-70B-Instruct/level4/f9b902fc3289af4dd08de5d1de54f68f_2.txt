This manuscript presents a novel discriminative clustering algorithm, drawing inspiration from the mean shift approach and the concept of maximizing the density ratio of positive to negative points. The authors' motivation, as stated in the introduction, is to identify clusters of image patches that are both representative and visually discriminative, addressing the limitations of current algorithms that often rely on ad-hoc procedures. The idea of formulating discriminative clustering in terms of maximizing the density ratio is compelling and well-founded, particularly in the context of recent works such as [4,8,16] that focus on discovering distinctive mid-level parts or patches for recognition tasks.
The initial derivation of the clustering objective is promising, starting on pages 2-3. However, by page 4, the explanation takes several confusing turns, deviating significantly from the original formulation. Specifically, the discussion around equation (5) introduces the concept of "sharing coefficients" to prevent double-counting of patches, with the aim of ensuring competition between clusters. Nonetheless, it is unclear whether this approach accurately estimates the local density of patches, as the presence of similar patches close to a given location in the feature space should ideally increase the density. The subsequent introduction of heuristic criteria for setting these coefficients, as well as additional heuristics for handling overlapping patches, further complicates the derivation. By the time the final objective, equation (7), is presented, the original objective, equation (1), seems to have been significantly altered or abandoned, introducing a level of heuristics similar to those the authors initially criticized in other approaches.
The strengths of this paper include the novelty and appeal of deriving a discriminative clustering algorithm through maximizing the density ratio. The experimental results, as shown in Table 1, demonstrate a notable performance improvement over recent methods, including [8], on the MIT Indoor Scene dataset, although further clarification on the factors contributing to this improvement would be beneficial.
However, several weaknesses are identified. The derivation of the clustering objective lacks clear motivation for its various steps and fails to adequately explain its relationship to related methods. The connection between the proposed method and mean shift, despite the paper's title "Discriminative Mean Shift," is not clearly established, particularly in how it transitions from a local optimization to a global one with the introduction of a competition criterion. Furthermore, the final objective bears a resemblance to margin-based clustering approaches, which warrants discussion and comparison. The absence of citations to other discriminative clustering formulations, such as maximum margin clustering by Linli Xu et al., is also notable. Additionally, the proposed optimization algorithm lacks theoretical guarantees, and the experimental results, while strong, do not provide clear insights into the factors contributing to the method's outperformance of recent well-engineered systems.
In conclusion, while this paper presents a compelling idea and strong experimental results, which place it above the acceptance threshold, the derivation of the clustering method is marred by poorly motivated heuristic steps and a lack of clarity in its presentation. Addressing these issues, particularly through a more transparent and theoretically grounded derivation, would significantly strengthen the manuscript.
