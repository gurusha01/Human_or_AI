This paper presents a comprehensive investigation into the optimization strategies employed by humans for 1-D continuous functions, with a particular focus on the relationship between human performance and various optimization methods. The authors utilized a diverse range of continuous functions, including polynomial, exponential, trigonometric, and Dirac functions, to examine how individuals interpolate and extrapolate noisy samples from a latent function. The results indicate that Gaussian processes outperform approximately 20 other optimization methods in describing human performance.
Overall, this paper is well-written and presents a strong submission to NIPS, tackling intriguing problems at the intersection of machine learning and cognitive science. The authors' exploration of function optimization, active interpolation, and extrapolation is noteworthy, despite the experimental stimuli and procedure being somewhat abstract. However, this abstraction raises concerns regarding the ecological validity of the findings and their applicability to real-world scenarios.
Two primary criticisms of the paper are: (1) the lack of ecological validity in the experimental design, which may limit the generalizability of the results to everyday human function learning, and (2) the insufficient integration of the authors' experiments and results with prior work on human function learning. The authors' decision to use a synthetic task, rather than a more traditional function learning experiment, may have contributed to this disconnect.
Additional minor concerns include: the placement of previous psychological work in the paper, the readability of figures in black and white, the stimuli generation method in Experiment 1, and the use of language that ventures into theoretical territory. Suggestions for improvement include reporting the rank-order correlation of the dependent variables for people and each optimization method, justifying the use of different tolerance levels for different optimization algorithms, and correcting for multiple comparisons in the results of Experiment 2 & 3.
The paper's findings are compelling, and the authors' use of Gaussian processes to model human performance is a significant contribution. However, future research should aim to increase the ecological validity of the experimental design and provide more explicit connections to prior work on human function learning. Additionally, exploring the relationship between Gaussian processes and other optimization methods, such as those used in optimal foraging, may yield further insights into human decision-making and optimization strategies.
