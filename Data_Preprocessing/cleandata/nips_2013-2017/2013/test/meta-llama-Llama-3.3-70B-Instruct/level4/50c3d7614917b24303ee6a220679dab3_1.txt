This manuscript presents an extension of determinantal point process (DPP) sampling methods to continuous spaces, leveraging low-rank kernels to achieve this goal. The approach involves approximating standard kernels using either the Nystroem method or random Fourier features. The authors demonstrate the efficacy of their method through applications in repulsive mixture models and separated sampling, showcasing the potential of this technique.
The development of an efficient "dual sampler", as outlined in Algorithm 1, is a key contribution of this work. By utilizing a low-rank kernel, the authors derive conditions under which the necessary computations for the random Fourier features (RFF) and Nystroem approximations can be efficiently carried out, as summarized in Supplementary Table 1. This represents a significant technical achievement.
In Section 5, the continuous DPP is employed as a prior distribution for the means in a mixture model. Notably, the approximation developed earlier is not actually utilized in this context, as the authors observe that a closed-form solution is available when sampling a single item from the DPP. The results illustrate the expected repulsive effect of DPPs, as evidenced by the mixture weight entropies. However, it is worth noting that a more nuanced definition of repulsiveness might consider the relative closeness of the means to their variances, rather than absolute closeness.
Section 6 explores the application of DPPs to sample a diverse set of poses from a given density. While the resulting poses exhibit credible diversity, it is possible that comparable visual results could be obtained using alternative methods, such as hard core processes or farthest point clustering.
From a technical standpoint, the material presented appears to be correct. The manuscript is generally well-organized and clear, although some figures, such as Figure 1, could benefit from additional detail. For instance, a more explicit definition of equation (15) would be helpful, including clarification on how the sum is defined and evaluated.
The originality of this work lies in its extension of earlier research on low-rank approximations in discrete spaces to the continuous domain. While the repulsive prior construction has been used previously, as acknowledged by the authors, the current work offers a novel contribution to the field.
Regarding significance, the applicability of the main result is not entirely clear. Section 5 does not actually utilize the developed approximation, and Section 6 is primarily a visualization exercise that does not require a precise sampler. Nevertheless, it is conceivable that the result could be exploited in other interesting ways, potentially leading to significant impacts in related fields.
Additional comments and suggestions include:
* The citation in line 102 implies that reference [11] is the first to demonstrate that a matrix of the form B^T B (D << N) has a fast eigendecomposition. However, this result has been previously established, for example, in the work of L. Sirovich and M. Kirby (1987).
* In equation 2, it would be beneficial to explicitly define the notation \bar{\phi_n}, presumably as the complex conjugate.
* In lines 241-242, using sigma^2 I instead of diag(sigma^2, ..., sigma^2) would simplify the notation, and similarly for rho^2.
* In line 304, using only 100 test observations may introduce unnecessary variance; considering a larger number of observations could help reduce this variance and strengthen the results.
