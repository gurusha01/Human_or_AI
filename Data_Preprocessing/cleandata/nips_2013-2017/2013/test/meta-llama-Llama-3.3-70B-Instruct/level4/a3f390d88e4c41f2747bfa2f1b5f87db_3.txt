This paper presents a comparative analysis of human behavior and established active search algorithms on various tasks, revealing that Bayesian optimization algorithms combined with Gaussian Process (GP) priors are more effective in capturing human search patterns.
Quality:
The paper demonstrates technical soundness, but a significant concern lies in the oversimplification of the algorithmic forms, which may not adequately address the complexity of the tasks presented to human participants. For instance, the algorithms fail to account for the step cost associated with querying a location, a factor that humans inherently consider. Unlike humans, who solve a composite sampling and stopping problem, the algorithms separate these processes and employ stopping rules that seem arbitrary and insensitive to the objective of maximizing hits while minimizing function calls. Although this may not impact the paper's primary conclusion regarding the efficacy of Bayesian optimization algorithms with GP priors in modeling human search, it is essential to address this discrepancy to ensure a fair comparison. Figure 4e suggests that the algorithms could achieve comparable performance to humans if they employed a more integrated policy for search and stopping. While the authors partially acknowledge this issue in their discussion, further elaboration is necessary. Additionally, the differing methods used by Bayesian and non-Bayesian algorithms to determine the next query location raise questions about the distinct contributions of GP and sampling policies. For example, the strong performance of GP-UCB may be attributed to either the GP learning or the UCB sampling policy, and disentangling these factors is crucial.
Clarity:
The text is generally well-written, but the figures lack detailed descriptions, prompting several specific questions.
Originality:
The paper is original and presents a unique perspective.
Significance:
Despite methodological concerns, the paper poses an intriguing and important question, offering valuable experimental data and a comprehensive examination of well-known search algorithms. This work has the potential to open up new avenues for research.
Minor comments:
- Page 3, first paragraph: The correct numbers should be 25 functions and 23 subjects.
- Figure 3: The claim that MPI intersects the box is not supported by the visual representation.
- Page 4: The description of the second-order measure capturing the order of the query sequence is unclear, particularly regarding the calculation of "mean shortest distance."
- The histograms in several plots in Figure 6 are not explicitly explained.
Overall, this is a good paper that addresses an important and interesting question, albeit with some methodological limitations that require attention.
