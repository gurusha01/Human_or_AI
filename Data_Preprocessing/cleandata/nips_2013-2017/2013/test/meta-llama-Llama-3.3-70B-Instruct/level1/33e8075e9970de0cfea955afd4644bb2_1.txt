This paper introduces a machine learning framework for constructing graph wavelets that can sparsely represent a given class of signals. The authors propose a novel approach that uses the lifting scheme and deep auto-encoder networks to learn update and predict operators that minimize a sparsity surrogate of the detail coefficients. The resulting wavelets are adaptive to a class of signals and provide a linear transform that can be applied to any graph signal in time and memory linear in the size of the graph.
The paper is well-written and clearly organized, with a good balance between theoretical background, methodology, and experimental results. The authors provide a thorough review of existing graph wavelet constructions and highlight the limitations of these approaches. They also provide a detailed description of their proposed framework, including the lifting scheme, auto-encoder setup, and optimization procedure.
The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in constructing wavelets that provide sparse representations of graph signals. The authors show that their approach outperforms existing graph wavelet constructions, including Haar wavelets, in terms of sparsity and reconstruction error. They also demonstrate the applicability of their approach to various domains, including image processing and semi-supervised learning.
The strengths of the paper include:
* A novel and well-motivated approach to constructing graph wavelets that takes into account the structural properties of both graph signals and their underlying graphs.
* A thorough review of existing graph wavelet constructions and their limitations.
* A clear and detailed description of the proposed framework, including the lifting scheme, auto-encoder setup, and optimization procedure.
* Experimental results that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in constructing wavelets that provide sparse representations of graph signals.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes that the graph partitioning is provided, which may not always be the case in practice. The authors could have discussed possible ways to obtain a good partitioning or provided more guidance on how to choose a suitable partitioning.
* The paper focuses primarily on the construction of wavelets and does not provide a detailed analysis of the theoretical properties of the resulting wavelets, such as their stability or robustness to noise.
* The experimental results are mostly qualitative, and the authors could have provided more quantitative evaluations of the performance of their approach.
Overall, the paper is well-written and provides a significant contribution to the field of graph signal processing. The proposed approach has the potential to be widely applicable and could lead to new insights and applications in various domains.
