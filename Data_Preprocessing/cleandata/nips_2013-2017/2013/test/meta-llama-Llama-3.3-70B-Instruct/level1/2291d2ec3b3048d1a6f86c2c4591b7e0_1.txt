This paper proposes a novel approach to automatically discover latent domains in image or video datasets, which is essential for domain adaptation in visual recognition problems. The authors introduce two key properties that latent domains should possess: maximum distinctiveness and maximum learnability. They devise a nonparametric formulation and efficient optimization procedure to discover domains that satisfy these properties. The approach is extensively evaluated on object recognition and human activity recognition tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving adaptation performance.
The paper relates to previous work on domain adaptation, which has largely focused on adapting between datasets that do not necessarily correspond to well-defined domains. The authors argue that their approach overcomes the limitations of previous methods by discovering latent domains that are more characteristic of the data. The paper also draws on ideas from clustering and unsupervised learning, but with a focus on domain discovery rather than traditional clustering.
The strengths of the paper include its clear motivation, well-organized structure, and thorough evaluation. The authors provide a detailed explanation of their approach, including the optimization procedure and the domain-wise cross-validation method for determining the number of domains. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in improving adaptation performance, and the authors provide a thoughtful analysis of the identified domains and the factors that influence them.
The weaknesses of the paper include the complexity of the optimization procedure, which may be challenging to implement in practice. Additionally, the authors assume that the number of domains is unknown, which may not always be the case in real-world applications. The paper could also benefit from a more detailed comparison with other domain adaptation methods, particularly those that use multiple source domains.
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel and well-motivated approach to domain discovery, which is essential for domain adaptation in visual recognition problems.
* The authors provide a thorough evaluation of their approach, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving adaptation performance.
* The paper is well-organized and clearly written, making it easy to follow and understand.
Arguments con acceptance:
* The optimization procedure may be complex and challenging to implement in practice.
* The authors assume that the number of domains is unknown, which may not always be the case in real-world applications.
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with other domain adaptation methods.
Overall, I believe that the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of domain adaptation and visual recognition, and I recommend acceptance. However, I suggest that the authors address the weaknesses mentioned above, particularly the complexity of the optimization procedure and the assumption about the number of domains.
