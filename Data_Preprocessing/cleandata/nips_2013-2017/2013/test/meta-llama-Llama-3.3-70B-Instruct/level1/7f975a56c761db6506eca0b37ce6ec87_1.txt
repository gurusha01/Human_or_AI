This paper presents new algorithms for distributed clustering for k-median and k-means objectives with provable guarantees and improved communication complexity over existing approaches. The authors reduce the problem of finding a clustering with low cost to the problem of finding a coreset of small size and provide a distributed method for constructing a global coreset that improves over previous methods by reducing the communication complexity. The algorithm works over general communication topologies and experimental results on large-scale data sets show that this approach outperforms other coreset-based distributed clustering algorithms.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem of distributed clustering and the concept of coresets. The technical sections are also well-organized, and the authors provide a detailed analysis of the algorithm's performance and communication complexity. The experimental results are convincing, and the authors provide a thorough comparison with other algorithms.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The authors provide a novel approach to distributed clustering that improves over existing methods in terms of communication complexity.
* The algorithm is well-motivated, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the intuition behind the approach.
* The experimental results are convincing, and the authors provide a thorough comparison with other algorithms.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes that the data is distributed across nodes whose communication is restricted to the edges of an arbitrary graph, which may not be the case in all real-world scenarios.
* The algorithm requires a central coordinator to collect the local portions of the coreset, which may not be feasible in all scenarios.
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the algorithm's performance in terms of computational complexity and memory usage.

Overall, I would recommend accepting the paper, as it presents a novel approach to distributed clustering that improves over existing methods in terms of communication complexity, and the experimental results are convincing. However, the authors should address the weaknesses of the paper, such as providing a more detailed analysis of the algorithm's performance in terms of computational complexity and memory usage, and considering more realistic scenarios where the data is distributed across nodes with restricted communication.
