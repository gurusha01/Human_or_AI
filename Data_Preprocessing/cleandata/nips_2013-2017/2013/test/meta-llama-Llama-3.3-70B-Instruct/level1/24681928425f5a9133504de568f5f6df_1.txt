This paper presents a unified formalization of stochastic And-Or grammars and an unsupervised approach to learning their structures and parameters. The authors propose a novel algorithm that iteratively induces compositions and reconfigurations in a unified manner, optimizing the posterior probability of the grammar. The approach is evaluated on event grammars and image grammars, achieving comparable or better performance than previous approaches.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to stochastic And-Or grammars, their applications, and the challenges of learning them. The proposed algorithm is thoroughly explained, and the experiments are well-designed and executed. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in learning event grammars and image grammars.
The strengths of the paper include:
* A novel and unified formalization of stochastic And-Or grammars that can be applied to different types of data
* An efficient and robust algorithm for learning the structures and parameters of stochastic And-Or grammars
* Thorough experimental evaluation on event grammars and image grammars, demonstrating the approach's effectiveness
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The algorithm's complexity and scalability may be a concern for large datasets or complex grammars
* The choice of hyperparameters, such as the sparsity prior, may require careful tuning for optimal performance
* The approach assumes a context-free grammar, which may not be suitable for all applications
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The paper presents a novel and significant contribution to the field of stochastic And-Or grammars
* The approach is thoroughly evaluated and demonstrates promising results
* The paper is well-written and easy to follow
Arguments con acceptance:
* The algorithm's complexity and scalability may be a concern
* The approach may not be suitable for all applications, particularly those requiring more complex grammars
* The choice of hyperparameters may require careful tuning, which can be time-consuming and challenging
Overall, I recommend accepting this paper, as it presents a significant contribution to the field of stochastic And-Or grammars and demonstrates promising results. However, the authors should be encouraged to address the potential concerns regarding the algorithm's complexity and scalability, as well as the choice of hyperparameters.
