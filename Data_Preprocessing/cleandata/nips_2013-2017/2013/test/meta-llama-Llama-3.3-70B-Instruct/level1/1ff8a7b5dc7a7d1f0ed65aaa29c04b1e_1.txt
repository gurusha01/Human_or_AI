This paper proposes a novel architecture called Deep Recurrent Neural Networks (DRNNs) for processing time series data. The main idea is to stack multiple recurrent neural networks (RNNs) on top of each other, where each layer receives the hidden state of the previous layer as input. This allows the model to capture hierarchical structures in the data and process information at multiple time scales. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of DRNNs on a character-level language modeling task, achieving state-of-the-art performance for recurrent networks on a Wikipedia text corpus.
The paper is well-written and clearly explains the motivation behind the proposed architecture. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the model's performance and behavior, including experiments on the effect of removing individual layers and the ability of the model to capture long-term dependencies. The results show that DRNNs are able to learn a hierarchy of time scales and outperform traditional RNNs on the language modeling task.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel and well-motivated architecture for processing time series data
* A thorough analysis of the model's performance and behavior
* State-of-the-art results on a challenging language modeling task
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The training method used for the DRNN-1O model is complex and may be difficult to replicate
* The comparison to other models is limited, and it would be interesting to see how DRNNs perform compared to other deep learning architectures
* The paper could benefit from more discussion on the potential applications and limitations of the proposed architecture
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel and well-motivated architecture that achieves state-of-the-art results on a challenging task
* The analysis of the model's performance and behavior is thorough and provides valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the architecture
* The paper is well-written and easy to follow, making it accessible to a wide range of readers
Arguments against acceptance:
* The training method used for the DRNN-1O model is complex and may be difficult to replicate
* The comparison to other models is limited, and it would be interesting to see how DRNNs perform compared to other deep learning architectures

Overall, I believe that the paper is well-written and makes a significant contribution to the field of deep learning. The proposed architecture is novel and well-motivated, and the results demonstrate its effectiveness on a challenging task. With some minor revisions to address the weaknesses mentioned above, I believe that the paper would be a strong candidate for acceptance.
