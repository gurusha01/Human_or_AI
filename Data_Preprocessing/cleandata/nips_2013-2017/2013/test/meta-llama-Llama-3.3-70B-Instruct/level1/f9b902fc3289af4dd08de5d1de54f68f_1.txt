This paper proposes a novel approach to discovering mid-level visual elements in images, which are representative and discriminative. The authors draw connections to the well-known mean-shift algorithm and propose a discriminative variant for finding visual elements. The method is evaluated on the Paris Street View dataset and the MIT Scene-67 dataset, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in scene classification.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise overview of the previous work in the field. The proposed approach is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of their work.
The paper is well-organized, and the authors provide enough information for the expert reader to reproduce the results. The writing is clear, and the authors use proper citations to related work.
The originality of the paper lies in the proposal of a discriminative variant of mean-shift for finding visual elements. The authors provide a novel formulation of the problem and propose a principled way of experimentally analyzing and evaluating different visual discovery approaches. The paper is significantly different from previous contributions, and the authors provide a clear explanation of how their work differs from previous research.
The significance of the paper lies in its potential to advance the state of the art in visual element discovery and scene classification. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach can outperform other methods based on discriminative patches, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the implications of their work.
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel and technically sound approach to discovering mid-level visual elements.
* The authors provide a clear and concise overview of the previous work in the field.
* The proposed approach is evaluated on two datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in scene classification.
* The paper is well-written, and the authors provide enough information for the expert reader to reproduce the results.
Arguments con acceptance:
* The paper may be limited to binary labels, and the authors do not provide a clear explanation of how to extend the approach to continuous labels.
* The elements are detected based only on individual patches, and the authors do not provide a clear explanation of how to incorporate global structures beyond patches.
* The paper may require significant computational resources, and the authors do not provide a clear explanation of how to optimize the approach for large-scale datasets.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise overview of the proposed approach. The technical soundness and originality of the paper make it a strong candidate for acceptance. However, the authors should address the limitations of the approach and provide a clear explanation of how to extend the approach to continuous labels and incorporate global structures beyond patches.
