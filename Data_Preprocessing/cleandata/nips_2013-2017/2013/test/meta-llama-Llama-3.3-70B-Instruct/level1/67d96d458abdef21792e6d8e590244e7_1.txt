This paper proposes a novel approach to non-uniform blind deblurring, which is a fundamental problem in image processing. The authors derive a simple, closed-form cost function that automatically discounts regions of the image with little information about the blur operator, without introducing additional salient structure selection steps. The algorithm is based on Bayesian inference and convex analysis, and it can be implemented using an optimization strategy that is virtually tuning-parameter free.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem of non-uniform blind deblurring. They also provide a thorough review of existing work in this area, highlighting the limitations of current methods. The proposed algorithm is well-motivated, and the authors provide a detailed theoretical analysis of its properties.
The experimental results are impressive, and the proposed method consistently performs comparably or better than state-of-the-art algorithms on real-world images. The authors also provide a detailed comparison with other methods, including Harmeling et al. [8], Hirsch et al. [9], Whyte et al. [25], Gupta et al. [7], and Joshi et al. [13].
