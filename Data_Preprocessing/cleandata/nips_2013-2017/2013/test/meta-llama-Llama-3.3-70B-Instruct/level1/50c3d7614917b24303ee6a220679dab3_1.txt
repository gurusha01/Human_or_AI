This paper proposes two efficient sampling schemes for determinantal point processes (DPPs) in continuous spaces, which is a significant contribution to the field of machine learning and spatial statistics. The authors address the challenge of sampling from DPPs in continuous spaces, where the existing algorithms are computationally infeasible. The proposed methods, based on low-rank approximations via Nystr√∂m and random Fourier feature techniques, and Gibbs sampling, enable efficient sampling from DPPs for a wide range of kernel functions.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to DPPs and their applications. The technical sections are detailed and well-organized, making it easy to follow the derivations and algorithms. The empirical analysis and experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, and the applications to repulsive mixture modeling and human pose synthesis are interesting and relevant.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of two efficient sampling schemes for DPPs in continuous spaces, which addresses a significant challenge in the field.
* The use of low-rank approximations and Gibbs sampling, which are well-established techniques in machine learning and spatial statistics.
* The empirical analysis and experiments, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods and provide insights into their performance.
* The applications to repulsive mixture modeling and human pose synthesis, which are interesting and relevant to the field.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes a significant amount of background knowledge in machine learning and spatial statistics, which may make it difficult for non-experts to follow.
* The proposed methods are approximate, and the authors do not provide a detailed analysis of the approximation errors.
* The empirical analysis and experiments are limited to a few specific examples, and it is unclear how the proposed methods will perform in more general settings.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the proposed methods are significant contributions to the field. The strengths of the paper outweigh the weaknesses, and I would recommend accepting the paper for publication.
