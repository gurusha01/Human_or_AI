This paper proposes a two-step representation learning method for cross-language text classification, which bridges the feature spaces of different languages by exploiting a set of parallel bilingual documents. The method first formulates a matrix completion problem to produce a complete parallel document-term matrix for all documents in two languages and then induces a low-dimensional cross-lingual document representation by applying latent semantic indexing on the obtained matrix. The proposed method is evaluated on cross-language sentiment classification tasks on Amazon product reviews and demonstrates significant improvements over other cross-language representation learning methods, especially when the number of parallel bilingual documents is small.
The paper is well-written and clearly explains the proposed method, related work, and experimental results. The authors provide a thorough review of previous work on cross-language text classification and highlight the differences between their approach and existing methods. The experimental results are comprehensive and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
