This paper presents a comprehensive study on human search behavior in 1D function optimization, comparing it to various optimization algorithms. The authors designed a series of experiments to understand how humans choose the next point to query when attempting to locate the maximum of an unknown 1D function. The results show that humans outperform 24 well-known optimization algorithms, and Bayesian Optimization (BO) based on Gaussian Processes (GP) predicts human performance and searched locations better.
The paper's strengths include its thorough experimental design, large dataset, and rigorous analysis. The authors provide a detailed comparison of human search behavior with various optimization algorithms, including BO methods, and demonstrate that GP provides a reasonable unifying theoretical account of human function learning and active search. The paper also explores the idea that humans might be following a GP, at least in the continuous domain, and change some of its properties to cope with different tasks.
The weaknesses of the paper include the limited scope of the study, which focuses on 1D function optimization, and the lack of exploration of how the findings scale up to higher dimensions and benchmark optimization problems. Additionally, the paper could benefit from a more in-depth discussion of the implications of the results for the development of more efficient optimization algorithms.
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The paper presents a comprehensive and well-designed study on human search behavior in 1D function optimization.
* The results provide new insights into human decision-making and optimization strategies.
* The paper demonstrates the potential of GP as a unifying theoretical account of human function learning and active search.

Arguments con acceptance:
* The scope of the study is limited to 1D function optimization, and it is unclear how the findings generalize to higher dimensions and more complex optimization problems.
* The paper could benefit from a more in-depth discussion of the implications of the results for the development of more efficient optimization algorithms.
* Some of the experiments and analyses could be more thoroughly explained and justified.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the results are interesting and relevant to the field of optimization and human decision-making. With some revisions to address the limitations and weaknesses, the paper could be even stronger.
