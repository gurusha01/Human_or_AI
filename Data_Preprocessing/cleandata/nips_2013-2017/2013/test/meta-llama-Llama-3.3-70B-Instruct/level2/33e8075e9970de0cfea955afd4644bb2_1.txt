This paper introduces a machine learning framework for constructing graph wavelets that can sparsely represent a given class of signals. The authors propose a novel approach that uses the lifting scheme and deep auto-encoder networks to learn update and predict operators that minimize a sparsity surrogate of the detail coefficients. The resulting wavelets are adaptive to a class of signals and provide a linear transform that can be applied to any graph signal in time and memory linear in the size of the graph.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear overview of the existing approaches for constructing wavelets on graphs and their limitations. The proposed approach is thoroughly explained, and the authors provide a detailed description of the construction details, including the auto-encoder setup, optimization, and training functions.
The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in learning wavelets that provide a sparse representation of smooth signals. The authors show that their approach generalizes well to unseen signals and outperforms the Haar wavelets in terms of reconstruction error. The application of the proposed wavelets to semi-supervised learning of temperature distribution and image processing tasks demonstrates their potential in real-world problems.
The strengths of the paper include:
* A novel approach to constructing graph wavelets that takes into consideration the structural properties of both graph signals and their underlying graphs.
* A thorough explanation of the construction details and optimization procedure.
* Experimental results that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in learning wavelets that provide a sparse representation of smooth signals.
* Applications of the proposed wavelets to real-world problems, such as semi-supervised learning of temperature distribution and image processing.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes that the graph partitioning is provided, which may not always be the case in practice. The authors mention that the quality of the graph partitioning affects the quality of the Haar wavelets, but they do not provide a clear solution to this problem.
* The optimization procedure is not thoroughly explained, and the authors rely on an off-the-shelf optimization package. A more detailed explanation of the optimization procedure and its convergence properties would be beneficial.
* The paper could benefit from a more thorough comparison with existing approaches for constructing wavelets on graphs.
Overall, the paper presents a novel and effective approach to constructing graph wavelets that can sparsely represent a given class of signals. The authors provide a thorough explanation of the construction details and demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through experimental results. However, there are some areas that could be improved, such as providing a clear solution to the graph partitioning problem and a more thorough explanation of the optimization procedure.
