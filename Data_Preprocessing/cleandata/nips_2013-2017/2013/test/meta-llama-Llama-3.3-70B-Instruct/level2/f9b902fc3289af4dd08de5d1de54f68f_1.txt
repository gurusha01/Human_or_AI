This paper proposes a novel approach to discovering mid-level visual elements in images, which are representative and discriminative. The authors formulate the problem as discriminative mode seeking, drawing connections to the mean-shift algorithm. They introduce a discriminative variant of mean-shift that maximizes the density ratio of positive to negative samples, and propose a method for adaptive bandwidth selection using inter-element communication.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise overview of the problem, related work, and their approach. The technical contributions are significant, and the experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on several datasets, including the Paris Street View and MIT Scene-67 datasets.
The strengths of the paper include:
* A clear and well-motivated problem statement
* A novel and technically sound approach to discovering mid-level visual elements
* Strong experimental results on several datasets
* A thorough analysis of the proposed method, including a discussion of its limitations and potential extensions
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The method is limited to binary labels, and it is not clear how to extend it to continuous or multi-class labels
* The elements are detected based only on individual patches, and do not capture global structures in images
* The computational complexity of the method is not thoroughly analyzed, and it is not clear how scalable it is to large datasets
Overall, I believe that this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of computer vision, and the proposed method has the potential to be widely adopted. However, there are some limitations and potential extensions that the authors could explore in future work.
