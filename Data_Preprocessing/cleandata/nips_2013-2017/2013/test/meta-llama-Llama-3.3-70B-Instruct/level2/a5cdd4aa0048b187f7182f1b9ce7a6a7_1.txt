This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of machine learning, specifically in the area of surrogate losses for subset ranking problems. The authors provide an explicit construction of a convex, calibrated surrogate loss for any multiclass learning problem with a low-rank loss matrix. This result is then applied to various subset ranking problems, including Precision@q, Expected Rank Utility, Mean Average Precision, and Pairwise Disagreement.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the main concepts and results. The technical proofs are also well-presented and easy to follow. The authors demonstrate a good understanding of the relevant literature and provide a thorough discussion of the related work.
The main strengths of the paper are:
* The authors provide a novel and efficient method for constructing calibrated surrogates for low-rank loss matrices.
* The results are applied to various subset ranking problems, demonstrating the versatility and practicality of the approach.
* The authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the main concepts and results, making the paper accessible to a wide range of readers.
However, there are some limitations and potential areas for improvement:
* The paper assumes that the loss matrix has a low-rank structure, which may not always be the case in practice. It would be interesting to explore the applicability of the approach to more general loss matrices.
* The authors provide some experimental results, but a more comprehensive evaluation of the approach on real-world datasets would be beneficial.
* Some of the proofs and technical details are relegated to the appendix, which may make it difficult for readers to fully appreciate the technical contributions of the paper.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication. The results are significant, and the paper is well-written and easy to follow. The authors demonstrate a good understanding of the relevant literature and provide a thorough discussion of the related work.
