This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of determinantal point processes (DPPs) by introducing efficient sampling algorithms for continuous DPPs. The authors propose two approaches: a low-rank approximation method using Nyström and random Fourier feature techniques, and a Gibbs sampling scheme for k-DPPs. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and thorough explanation of the background, methodology, and applications of their work.
The main claims of the paper are well-supported by theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their methods in repulsive mixture modeling and synthesizing human poses, showcasing the potential of continuous DPPs in various applications. The use of low-rank approximations and Gibbs sampling enables efficient sampling from continuous DPPs, which was previously a challenging task.
The paper reflects a good understanding of the field, citing relevant literature and highlighting the connections between DPPs and other repulsive point processes. The authors also acknowledge the limitations of their approach, discussing the trade-offs between the Nyström and random Fourier feature methods and the potential challenges in high-dimensional spaces.
The significance of this work lies in its ability to extend the applicability of DPPs to continuous spaces, enabling the modeling of diverse and repulsive phenomena in various domains. The authors demonstrate the usefulness of their approach in mixture modeling and human pose synthesis, and their methods have the potential to be applied to other areas, such as inverse reinforcement learning and optimal control.
The paper is well-organized, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their methodology and results. The empirical evaluations are thorough, and the authors provide a detailed analysis of the performance of their methods.
In terms of novelty, the paper presents a significant improvement over existing methods for sampling from continuous DPPs. The use of low-rank approximations and Gibbs sampling enables efficient sampling, and the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach in various applications.
The paper is complete, providing sufficient details for reproducibility. The authors also discuss the limitations of their approach and provide suggestions for future work.
