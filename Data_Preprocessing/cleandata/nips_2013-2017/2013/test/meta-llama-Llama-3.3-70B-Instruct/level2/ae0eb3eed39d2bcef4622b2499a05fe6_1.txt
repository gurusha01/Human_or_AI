This paper presents a novel approach to distributed machine learning using optimistic concurrency control (OCC), which offers a balance between the mutual exclusion and coordination-free approaches. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of OCC in three problem areas: clustering, feature learning, and online facility location. The paper is well-written, and the ideas are clearly presented.
The main claims of the paper are: (1) OCC can be used to distribute unsupervised learning algorithms, (2) OCC provides a reinterpretation of online nonparametric clustering in the form of facility location with approximation guarantees, (3) OCC analysis for unsupervised learning is presented, and (4) OCC is applied to feature modeling and clustering. The authors support these claims with theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations.
The paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the OCC pattern and its application to machine learning algorithms. The theoretical analysis establishes the serializability of the distributed algorithms and provides approximation guarantees for the online facility location algorithm.
The paper is well-organized, and the writing is clear and concise. The authors provide sufficient details for reproducibility, and the experimental evaluation is thorough. The related work section is comprehensive, and the authors clearly position their work in the context of existing research.
The significance of the paper lies in its ability to provide a novel approach to distributed machine learning that balances the trade-off between parallelism and correctness. The OCC approach has the potential to be applied to a wide range of machine learning algorithms, and the authors demonstrate its effectiveness in several problem areas.
