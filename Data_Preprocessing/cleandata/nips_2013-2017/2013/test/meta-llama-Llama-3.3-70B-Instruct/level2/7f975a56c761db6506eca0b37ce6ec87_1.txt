This paper presents a novel approach to distributed clustering for k-median and k-means objectives, providing algorithms with provable guarantees and improved communication complexity over existing methods. The main claim of the paper is that by constructing a global coreset in a distributed manner, they can achieve a significant reduction in communication cost while maintaining theoretical guarantees for clustering quality.
The support for this claim comes from a combination of theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors provide a detailed proof of their distributed coreset construction algorithm, showing that it achieves an -coreset with high probability, and that the size of the coreset is bounded by Õ(kd + nk) for k-median and Õ(kd + nk log nk) for k-means. They also demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through experiments on large-scale datasets, comparing their algorithm to other distributed coreset algorithms and showing that it outperforms them in terms of communication cost and clustering quality.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their approach and its theoretical foundations. The experimental results are also well-presented, and the comparison to other algorithms is thorough and convincing.
In terms of usefulness, the ideas presented in this paper are practically useful, as they provide a novel approach to distributed clustering that can be applied to a wide range of applications, such as distributed databases, sensor networks, and surveillance systems. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the communication cost of their algorithm, which is an important consideration in distributed systems.
The paper reflects common knowledge in the field, and the authors provide a thorough review of related work, including previous approaches to distributed clustering and coreset construction. The novelty of the paper lies in its distributed coreset construction algorithm, which improves over existing approaches by reducing the communication cost and maintaining theoretical guarantees for clustering quality.
The completeness of the paper is good, with a clear and concise explanation of the approach and its theoretical foundations. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the communication cost of their algorithm and a thorough comparison to other algorithms.
One potential limitation of the paper is that the authors assume a connected graph topology, which may not always be the case in practice. However, the authors do provide a discussion of how their approach can be applied to more general graph topologies, and they provide experimental results on a range of network topologies.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, as it presents a novel and practically useful approach to distributed clustering, with a clear and concise explanation of the approach and its theoretical foundations, and a thorough comparison to other algorithms.
