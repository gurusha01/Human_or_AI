This paper presents a novel approach to efficient exploration in reinforcement learning, called posterior sampling for reinforcement learning (PSRL). The authors provide a thorough analysis of the algorithm, including a bound on the expected regret of Õ(τS √ AT log(SAT)), which is close to the state of the art for any reinforcement learning algorithm. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the algorithm and its analysis.
The main claim of the paper is that PSRL is a provably efficient learning algorithm that can achieve good performance without the need for optimism. The authors support this claim by providing a theoretical analysis of the algorithm, including a bound on the expected regret. They also provide simulation results that demonstrate the effectiveness of PSRL in practice.
The paper has several strengths. First, the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the algorithm and its analysis. Second, the paper includes a thorough analysis of the algorithm, including a bound on the expected regret. Third, the authors provide simulation results that demonstrate the effectiveness of PSRL in practice.
However, the paper also has some weaknesses. First, the analysis is based on a number of assumptions, including the assumption that the prior distribution is correct. Second, the paper does not provide a clear comparison with other algorithms, such as UCRL2 and REGAL. Third, the simulation results are limited to a few examples, and it is not clear how well PSRL will perform in more complex environments.
Overall, I believe that this paper is a significant contribution to the field of reinforcement learning. The authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the algorithm and its analysis, and the simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of PSRL in practice. However, I also believe that the paper could be improved by providing a more detailed comparison with other algorithms and by including more extensive simulation results.
