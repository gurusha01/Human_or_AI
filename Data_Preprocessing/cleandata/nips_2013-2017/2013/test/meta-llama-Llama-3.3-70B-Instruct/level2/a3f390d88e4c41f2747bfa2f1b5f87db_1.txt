This paper presents a comprehensive study on human search behavior in 1D function optimization, comparing it to various optimization algorithms. The authors designed a series of experiments to understand how humans choose the next point to query when attempting to locate the maximum of an unknown 1D function. The results show that humans outperform 24 well-known optimization algorithms, and Bayesian Optimization (BO) based on Gaussian Processes (GP) predicts human performance and searched locations better.
The paper's main claims are: (1) humans are capable of efficient 1D function optimization, and (2) GP provides a reasonable unifying theoretical account of human function learning, active learning, and search. The support for these claims comes from a thorough analysis of human data and comparisons with various optimization algorithms. The authors also conducted additional experiments to further explore GP as a unified computational principle guiding human function learning and active search.
The paper's strengths include its rigorous experimental design, comprehensive analysis, and clear presentation of results. The authors provide a detailed discussion of their findings, relating them to previous work and highlighting the implications for our understanding of human learning and cognition. The use of GP as a theoretical framework to explain human search behavior is a significant contribution, as it provides a principled and elegant approach to modeling human function learning and active search.
However, there are some limitations to the study. The authors acknowledge that their findings may not generalize to higher dimensions and benchmark optimization problems. Additionally, the paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the satisficing mechanisms humans used to decide when to end a trial.
Overall, this paper presents a significant contribution to our understanding of human search behavior and function learning. The authors' use of GP as a theoretical framework provides a promising direction for future research, and their findings have important implications for the development of more efficient optimization algorithms and a better understanding of human cognition.
