This paper proposes a two-step representation learning method for cross-language text classification, which exploits a set of parallel bilingual documents to bridge the feature spaces of different languages. The main claim of the paper is that the proposed method outperforms other cross-language representation learning methods, especially when the number of parallel bilingual documents is small.
The paper is well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors formulate a matrix completion problem to produce a complete parallel document-term matrix and then induce a low-dimensional cross-lingual document representation by applying latent semantic indexing. The proposed method is evaluated on cross-language sentiment classification tasks on Amazon product reviews, and the results demonstrate that it significantly outperforms other methods.
The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with clear explanations of the proposed method and related work. The authors provide a thorough review of existing cross-language text classification methods and highlight the advantages of their approach. The experimental results are comprehensive and well-analyzed, providing insights into the performance of the proposed method under different settings.
The strengths of the paper include:
* A novel two-step representation learning method for cross-language text classification
* Theoretical analysis and convergence guarantees for the proposed method
* Comprehensive experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method
* A thorough review of related work and clear explanations of the proposed method
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The proposed method requires a set of parallel bilingual documents, which may not always be available
* The method may not perform well when the number of parallel documents is very small
* The paper could benefit from more analysis of the robustness of the proposed method to different types of noise and outliers
Overall, the paper is well-written and presents a significant contribution to the field of cross-language text classification. The proposed method has the potential to be useful in a variety of applications, and the experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness.
