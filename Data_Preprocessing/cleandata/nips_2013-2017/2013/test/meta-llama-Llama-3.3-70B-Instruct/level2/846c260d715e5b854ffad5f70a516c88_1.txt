This paper presents a novel approach to Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) using Bayesian mixture modeling and inference based Thompson sampling, named Dirichlet-NormalGamma MCTS (DNG-MCTS). The main claim of the paper is that DNG-MCTS advances the state-of-the-art UCT approach with better values on several benchmark problems.
The paper is well-written and clearly organized, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments. The introduction provides a good background on MDPs, MABs, and MCTS, and motivates the need for a new approach to address the exploration-exploitation dilemma. The authors provide a detailed explanation of their algorithm, including the assumptions, modeling, and inference methods.
The experimental results are impressive, showing that DNG-MCTS outperforms UCT in several benchmark problems, including the Canadian traveler problem, racetrack, and sailing. The results demonstrate that DNG-MCTS converges faster than UCT in terms of sample complexity, which is a significant advantage in many real-world applications.
The paper also provides a good discussion on the limitations of the approach, including the computational complexity of the algorithm. The authors acknowledge that DNG-MCTS requires more computation than simple UCT methods, but argue that the improved performance justifies the increased computational cost.
Here are some arguments for and against acceptance:
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper presents a novel and well-motivated approach to MCTS, which addresses a significant challenge in the field.
* The experimental results are impressive, demonstrating the effectiveness of DNG-MCTS in several benchmark problems.
* The paper is well-written and clearly organized, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The paper assumes that the distribution of the accumulated reward for each state-action pair can be modeled as a mixture of Normal distributions, which may not always be the case in practice.
* The algorithm requires more computation than simple UCT methods, which may be a limitation in some applications.
* The paper could benefit from more discussion on the potential applications of DNG-MCTS in real-world problems, and how it can be extended to more complex domains.
Overall, I believe that the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of MCTS and online planning, and demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach in several benchmark problems. With some minor revisions to address the limitations and potential applications of the approach, I would recommend accepting the paper.
