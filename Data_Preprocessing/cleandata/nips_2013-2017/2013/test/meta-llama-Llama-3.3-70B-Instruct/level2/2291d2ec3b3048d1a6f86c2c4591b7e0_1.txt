This paper proposes a novel approach to automatically discover latent domains in image or video datasets, which is essential for domain adaptation in visual recognition problems. The authors introduce two key properties that latent domains should possess: maximum distinctiveness and maximum learnability. They devise a nonparametric formulation and efficient optimization procedure to discover domains that satisfy these properties.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their approach. The proposed method is extensively evaluated on object recognition and human activity recognition tasks, and the results show that the identified domains outperform the original datasets and the domains discovered by a competing method.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel approach to discover latent domains, which is a crucial problem in domain adaptation.
* The introduction of two key properties that latent domains should possess, which provides a clear understanding of what constitutes a good domain.
* The use of a nonparametric formulation and efficient optimization procedure, which makes the approach flexible and scalable.
* The extensive evaluation of the proposed method on various tasks, which demonstrates its effectiveness.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The optimization problem is NP-hard, and the authors relax it into a continuous optimization problem, which may not always yield the optimal solution.
* The choice of the kernel bandwidth is crucial, and the authors set it to be twice the median distances of all pairwise data points, which may not be the optimal choice.
* The authors do not provide a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed method, which is essential for large-scale applications.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the proposed approach is novel and effective. The authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their method, and the results demonstrate its effectiveness on various tasks. However, there are some limitations and potential areas for improvement, such as the optimization problem and the choice of kernel bandwidth.
