This paper proposes a novel approach to automatically discover latent domains in image and video datasets, which is essential for domain adaptation in visual recognition problems. The authors introduce two desirable properties for latent domains: maximum distinctiveness and maximum learnability. The proposed method uses a nonparametric formulation and efficient optimization procedure to identify domains that satisfy these properties.
The paper's strengths include its ability to identify latent domains that are more distinctive and learnable than the original datasets, leading to improved adaptation performance. The experimental results on object recognition and human activity recognition tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach. The use of domain-wise cross-validation to determine the number of latent domains is a notable contribution.
However, the paper has some weaknesses. The lack of clear definitions and distinctions between concepts like dataset, domain, and latent domain can lead to confusion, particularly in the experiments section. The selection of source and target datasets is unclear, and alternative evaluation methods like leave one dataset out adaptation may be more reasonable. Additionally, the problem of learning latent domains is misleadingly stated as an unsupervised learning problem, as it uses semantic class labels.
The paper's quality is good, with well-supported claims and a complete piece of work. The clarity of the paper is generally good, but some sections, such as the experiments, could be improved with more detailed explanations. The originality of the paper is high, as it proposes a new approach to latent domain discovery. The significance of the paper is also high, as it addresses a difficult problem in domain adaptation and provides a unique solution.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel and effective approach to latent domain discovery.
* The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach on several tasks.
* The use of domain-wise cross-validation is a notable contribution.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The lack of clear definitions and distinctions between concepts can lead to confusion.
* The selection of source and target datasets is unclear.
* The problem of learning latent domains is misleadingly stated as an unsupervised learning problem.
Overall, I recommend accepting this paper, as its strengths outweigh its weaknesses, and it provides a significant contribution to the field of domain adaptation. However, the authors should address the weaknesses and clarify the concepts and experimental setup to improve the paper's quality and clarity.
