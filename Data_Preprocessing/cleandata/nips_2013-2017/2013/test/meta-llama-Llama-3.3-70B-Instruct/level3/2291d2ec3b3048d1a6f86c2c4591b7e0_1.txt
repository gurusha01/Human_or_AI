This paper proposes a novel approach to automatically discover latent domains in a training set for improved classification performance on a test set through domain adaptation. The approach formulates the problem as an integer programming problem with two constraints, which is then relaxed to a continuous optimization problem with a quadratic cost and linear constraints. The paper evaluates the approach on two datasets, showing improved performance over an existing domain adaptation approach.
The paper's main strength lies in its ability to identify latent domains in a dataset, which can lead to improved classification performance. The approach is also non-parametric, making it more flexible and applicable to a wide range of datasets. The use of domain-wise cross-validation to determine the number of domains is a nice touch, as it provides a principled way to select the optimal number of domains.
However, there are some concerns about the motivation and formulation of the model. The paper claims that clustering images by appearance is prone to reshaping datasets into per-category domains, but it is not entirely clear why this is the case. The introduction of the "label prior constraint" is also not well-motivated, and it is not clear why this constraint is necessary. The paper could benefit from more discussion on the intuition behind this constraint and its relationship to the overall objective of the approach.
Additionally, the paper could benefit from more comparison to other baseline methods, such as K-means or random partitioning. While the paper shows that the proposed approach outperforms the original datasets and the domains discovered by [20], it is not clear how it compares to other methods. The use of the geodesic flow kernel is also not well-explained, and more details on its implementation and parameters would be helpful.
The experimental results are impressive, but it would be helpful to see more analysis on the identified domains and the factors that contribute to their formation. The paper provides some examples of images from the identified domains, but more detailed analysis on the characteristics of these domains would be useful.
Overall, the paper presents a novel and interesting approach to domain adaptation, but could benefit from more discussion on the motivation and formulation of the model, as well as more comparison to other baseline methods. With some revisions to address these concerns, the paper has the potential to be a strong contribution to the field.
