This paper presents a novel approach to distributed clustering for k-means and k-median objectives, with a focus on reducing communication complexity. The authors propose a distributed coreset construction algorithm that allows each node to construct a local portion of a global coreset, which can then be used for clustering. The algorithm has provable guarantees and improves communication complexity over existing approaches.
The paper is well-written and clearly presented, making it easy to follow and understand. The authors provide a thorough introduction to the problem of distributed clustering, including the challenges and limitations of existing approaches. They also provide a detailed explanation of their proposed algorithm, including the theoretical foundations and proof sketches.
The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, showing that it outperforms other coreset-based distributed clustering algorithms in terms of communication cost and clustering quality. The results are presented in a clear and concise manner, with figures and tables that help to illustrate the key findings.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to balance theoretical rigor with practical applications. The authors provide a thorough theoretical analysis of their algorithm, including proofs and bounds on the communication complexity. At the same time, they demonstrate the practical effectiveness of their approach through experiments on large-scale datasets.
In terms of the conference guidelines, this paper meets all of the criteria for a good scientific paper. It is technically sound, with a clear and well-motivated approach to the problem. The claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The paper is also well-written and easy to follow, making it accessible to a broad audience.
The paper makes a significant contribution to the field of machine learning, particularly in the area of distributed clustering. The proposed algorithm has the potential to be widely adopted in practice, particularly in applications where communication complexity is a major concern.
Here are some arguments for and against acceptance:
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper presents a novel and effective approach to distributed clustering, with provable guarantees and improved communication complexity.
* The experimental results demonstrate the practical effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, showing that it outperforms other coreset-based distributed clustering algorithms.
* The paper is well-written and clearly presented, making it easy to follow and understand.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The paper assumes that the communication graph is connected, which may not always be the case in practice.
* The algorithm requires each node to compute a constant approximation solution for its local data, which may be computationally expensive for large datasets.
* The paper could benefit from more extensive experimental evaluation, including comparisons to other distributed clustering algorithms and evaluation on a wider range of datasets.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication. The paper presents a significant contribution to the field of machine learning, and the experimental results demonstrate the practical effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. While there are some limitations and potential areas for improvement, the paper is well-written and clearly presented, making it a valuable addition to the conference program.
