This paper presents a novel approach to distributed machine learning using optimistic concurrency control (OCC), which offers a balance between the mutual exclusion and coordination-free approaches. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of OCC in distributed unsupervised learning algorithms, including DP-Means, Online Facility Location (OFL), and BP-Means. The paper provides a clear and well-organized presentation of the OCC pattern, its application to various machine learning algorithms, and a thorough analysis of its correctness and scalability.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The introduction of a new concurrency control approach that preserves the theoretical properties of serial algorithms while achieving high parallelism.
* The provision of a simple and efficient pattern for designing distributed machine learning algorithms.
* The demonstration of the effectiveness of OCC in various machine learning tasks, including clustering and feature learning.
* The thorough analysis of the correctness and scalability of the OCC algorithms.
However, there are some weaknesses and concerns:
* The scalability analysis is limited to specific assumptions, and it is unclear how the algorithm will perform in more general settings.
* The paper lacks experiments on natural language sentences, which is a significant application of stochastic AND-OR grammars.
* The communication overhead of the OCC algorithm is not thoroughly analyzed, and it is unclear how it will affect the performance of the algorithm in practice.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of distributed machine learning, and the OCC approach has the potential to be widely applicable. However, further research is needed to fully understand the limitations and potential of this approach.
