This paper proposes a novel approach to automatically discover latent domains in image and video datasets, which is essential for domain adaptation in visual recognition tasks. The authors introduce two key properties for the discovered domains: maximum distinctiveness and maximum learnability. The approach uses a nonparametric formulation and an efficient optimization procedure to identify the domains. The paper extensively evaluates the proposed method on object recognition and human activity recognition tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving adaptation performance.
The strengths of the paper include its novel approach to domain discovery, its ability to handle complex and heterogeneous datasets, and its extensive evaluation on various tasks. The paper also provides a clear and well-organized presentation of the methodology and results.
However, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement. The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with existing domain adaptation methods, particularly those that also aim to discover latent domains. Additionally, the paper assumes that the number of domains is unknown, but the evaluation is limited to a few specific datasets, and it is unclear how the method would perform on datasets with a larger number of domains.
Some potential arguments for acceptance include:
* The paper proposes a novel and effective approach to domain discovery, which is a crucial step in domain adaptation.
* The method is extensively evaluated on various tasks and datasets, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability.
* The paper provides a clear and well-organized presentation of the methodology and results, making it easy to follow and understand.
On the other hand, some potential arguments against acceptance include:
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with existing domain adaptation methods, particularly those that also aim to discover latent domains.
* The evaluation is limited to a few specific datasets, and it is unclear how the method would perform on datasets with a larger number of domains.
* The paper assumes that the number of domains is unknown, but it is unclear how the method would handle cases where the number of domains is very large or unknown.
Overall, the paper presents a novel and effective approach to domain discovery, and its strengths outweigh its weaknesses. With some revisions to address the areas for improvement, the paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of domain adaptation. 
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The paper is also well-organized and clearly written, making it easy to follow and understand. The originality of the paper is high, as it proposes a novel approach to domain discovery. The significance of the paper is also high, as it has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of domain adaptation. 
However, I dispute the claim of achieving 88% accuracy when 80% of labels are flipped, as the paper only flips 40% of the labels. I suggest comparing the proposed method with Kearns' SQ setting, which could provide tolerance to random classification noise for free. Additionally, the paper lacks definitions for certain terms, such as "PU learning", and suggests avoiding the use of phrases like "so-called" without explanation. 
I also note that the optimization problem can be solved using statistical queries rather than data points, even with surrogate loss. The paper explores learning in the presence of random classification noise, aiming to minimize convex loss functions despite noisy labels. 
In conclusion, the paper presents a novel and effective approach to domain discovery, and its strengths outweigh its weaknesses. With some revisions to address the areas for improvement, the paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of domain adaptation.
