This paper proposes a novel approach to translingual representation learning using matrix completion and CL-LSI to create multilingual vectors. The method is based on the idea of using unbiased estimators of loss functions for empirical risk minimization under class-conditional random label noise. The authors provide two approaches to suitably modify any given surrogate loss function, which lead to similar risk bounds. The first approach uses unbiased estimators, while the second approach leverages a reduction of risk minimization under noisy labels to classification with weighted 0-1 loss.
The paper's significance lies in its potential to provide a robust result using a well-controlled non-linear inference technique like matrix completion. The idea presented in the paper seems novel and new, but requires further clarification and verification. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the problem, including a detailed discussion of related work and a clear explanation of the proposed methods.
However, the quality of the results is questionable and may be due to the scaling of LSI being better than other methods for a linear SVM. The authors are urged to use a machine learning system insensitive to rescalings, such as boosted decision trees, to verify the robustness of the results. Additionally, the clarity of the paper is an issue, with some sections, such as the construction of the unified document-term matrix, requiring further explanation and clarification.
The strengths of the paper include its novel approach to translingual representation learning, its thorough analysis of the problem, and its potential to provide a robust result. The weaknesses of the paper include the questionable quality of the results, the lack of clarity in some sections, and the need for further verification and clarification.
