This paper presents a novel approach to learning stochastic And-Or grammars from unannotated data. The authors propose a unified formalization of stochastic And-Or grammars that can be applied to various types of data, including images and events. The learning approach optimizes the posterior probability of the grammar by iteratively inducing compositions and reconfigurations in a unified manner.
The paper is well-structured, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the background, motivation, and technical details of their approach. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in learning event grammars and image grammars, outperforming previous approaches in some cases.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to handle different types of data and learn grammars that are grounded in atomic patterns. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the results and discuss the advantages and limitations of their approach.
However, there are some areas that could be improved. The motivation behind considering low-rank target loss matrices is not well-explained, and the authors could provide more context and clarity on this aspect. Additionally, the paper assumes that the reader is familiar with stochastic And-Or grammars and their applications, which may not be the case for all readers.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets most of the criteria. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear summary of the main ideas and their relation to previous work. The paper also discusses the strengths and weaknesses of the approach and provides a detailed analysis of the results.
