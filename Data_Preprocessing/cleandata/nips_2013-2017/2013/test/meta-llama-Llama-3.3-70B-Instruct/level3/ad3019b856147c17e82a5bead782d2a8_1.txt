This paper proposes a novel approach to distributed clustering for k-means and k-median objectives, with a focus on reducing communication complexity. The authors introduce a distributed coreset construction algorithm that allows each node to construct a local portion of a global coreset, which can then be used for clustering. The algorithm has provable guarantees and improves communication complexity over existing approaches.
The paper is well-written and clearly presents the ideas and experiments. The authors provide a thorough review of related work and highlight the advantages of their approach. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm in practice, showing that it outperforms other coreset-based distributed clustering algorithms.
One of the key strengths of the paper is its ability to handle general communication topologies, which is a significant improvement over previous approaches that assume a central coordinator or a specific network structure. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the communication cost, which is an important consideration in distributed clustering.
However, there are some areas where the paper could be improved. For example, the authors could provide more discussion on the choice of parameters, such as the size of the coreset and the number of iterations. Additionally, the paper could benefit from more comparisons with other distributed clustering algorithms, such as those that use different coreset construction methods or optimization techniques.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, and originality. The paper is technically sound, with a clear and well-organized presentation of the ideas and experiments. The authors provide a thorough review of related work and highlight the advantages of their approach. The paper also makes a significant contribution to the field of distributed clustering, with a novel approach that improves communication complexity and handles general communication topologies.
