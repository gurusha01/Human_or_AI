This paper proposes a novel approach to learning stochastic And-Or grammars in an unsupervised manner. The authors introduce a unified formalization of stochastic And-Or grammars that can be applied to various types of data, including images and events. The approach optimizes the posterior probability of the grammar by iteratively inserting new fragments into the grammar, which induces compositions and reconfigurations in a unified manner.
The paper is well-written and well-organized, making it easy to follow and understand. The authors provide a clear explanation of the background and motivation, as well as a detailed description of the proposed approach. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in learning event grammars and image grammars, outperforming previous methods in some cases.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to handle different types of data and learn grammars that are compact and generalizable. The use of And-Or fragments, which unify the search for new compositions and reconfigurations, is a key innovation of the approach. The authors also provide a thorough analysis of the results, discussing the advantages and limitations of the approach.
However, there are some minor concerns that need to be addressed. For example, the paper could benefit from more information on the computational complexity and running time of the algorithm. Additionally, the authors could provide more details on the source code release and potential citation of related work.
In terms of significance, the paper makes a valuable contribution to the field of stochastic grammar learning, which has applications in various areas such as computer vision, natural language processing, and robotics. The approach has the potential to be used in a wide range of domains, including image and video analysis, event recognition, and human-computer interaction.
Overall, I recommend accepting this paper to NIPS, as it presents a novel and effective approach to learning stochastic And-Or grammars. The paper is well-written, well-organized, and provides a thorough analysis of the results. With some minor revisions to address the concerns mentioned above, the paper has the potential to make a significant impact in the field.
