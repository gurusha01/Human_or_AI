This paper proposes a novel approach to risk minimization in the presence of class-conditional random label noise. The authors introduce two methods: the method of unbiased estimators and the method of label-dependent costs. The first method constructs an unbiased estimator of the loss function using the noise rates, while the second method uses a weighted loss function to correct for the threshold under the noisy distribution. The paper provides theoretical guarantees for both methods, showing that they can achieve provable risk bounds under certain conditions.
The paper is well-written and clearly organized, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments. The introduction provides a good overview of the problem and the related work, while the methodology sections provide a detailed explanation of the proposed methods. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in tolerating moderate to high amounts of label noise.
The strengths of the paper include its originality, technical soundness, and clarity. The authors provide a novel combination of modeling and action-selection strategy, which may be of interest to related areas of research. The paper is also well-organized and easy to follow, making it accessible to a wide range of readers.
However, there are some weaknesses in the paper. The experimental results are limited, with only a few baseline methods compared and a need for more detailed experiments on computational costs and sample complexity with advanced methods. Additionally, there are some technical errors, such as a potential mistake in the notation of the normal distribution and a diverging sum, that need to be corrected.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, and originality.
