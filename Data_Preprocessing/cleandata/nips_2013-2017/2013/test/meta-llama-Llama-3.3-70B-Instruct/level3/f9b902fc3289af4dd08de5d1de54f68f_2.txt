This paper proposes a novel approach to learning stochastic And-Or grammars from unannotated data. The authors present a unified formalization of stochastic And-Or grammars that can be applied to various types of data, including images and events. The approach optimizes the posterior probability of the grammar by iteratively introducing new intermediate nonterminal nodes and updating the grammar rules. The use of And-Or fragments, which combine And-rules and Or-rules, allows for a more efficient and robust learning process.
The paper's strengths include its novel and compelling idea, strong experimental results that outperform recent approaches on the MIT Indoor Scene dataset, and a well-structured presentation. The authors provide a clear and concise introduction to stochastic And-Or grammars, and their approach is well-motivated and easy to follow.
However, the paper also has some weaknesses. The derivation of the clustering objective is confusing, with several poorly explained leaps, and the introduction of "sharing coefficients" and heuristic criteria for setting them. Additionally, the paper lacks a clear connection to mean shift and other related methods, and there are no theoretical guarantees for the proposed optimization algorithm. The experimental results, although strong, lack insight into why the proposed method outperforms other approaches, and some claims made in the experimental section are not supported by evidence.
Overall, the paper is above the acceptance threshold due to its strong experimental results, but the derivation of the clustering method needs clarification and improvement. The authors should provide more details on the optimization algorithm and its convergence properties, as well as a more thorough comparison with related methods. With some revisions to address these issues, the paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of stochastic And-Or grammars.
