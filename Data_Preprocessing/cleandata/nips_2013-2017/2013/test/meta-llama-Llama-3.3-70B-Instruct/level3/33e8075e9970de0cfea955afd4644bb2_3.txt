This paper presents a novel approach to constructing wavelets on weighted graphs that can adapt to a class of signals using the lifting scheme and a deep auto-encoder network. The authors propose a method that is linear in the size of the graph, making it efficient for large-scale graphs. The technical development is clearly described, and the approach leads to an efficient algorithm that produces wavelets with desirable properties.
The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with a highly original method for constructing wavelets on graphs that adapts to the class of functions. The authors demonstrate the performance of their approach through applications to several datasets, showcasing its elegance and efficiency.
However, there are some weaknesses in the paper. One significant weakness is the lack of discussion on the sensitivity to the partitioning method, which is a crucial aspect of the proposed approach. Additionally, the paper does not compare the results on irregular graphs to compression or reconstruction using other types of graph wavelets, which would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the approach's strengths and limitations.
Despite these weaknesses, the paper represents a significant contribution to the field of wavelets and multiresolution analysis on graphs, with signal adaptivity being a major advance. The approach has the potential to be widely applicable and could lead to important breakthroughs in various fields.
