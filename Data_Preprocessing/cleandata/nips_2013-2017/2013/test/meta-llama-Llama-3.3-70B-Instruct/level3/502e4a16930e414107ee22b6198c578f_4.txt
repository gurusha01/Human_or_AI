This paper presents a novel approach to distributed machine learning, leveraging optimistic concurrency control (OCC) to balance parallelism and correctness. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of OCC in three problem areas: clustering, feature learning, and online facility location. The paper's main contribution is the introduction of OCC as a concurrency control approach for distributing unsupervised learning algorithms, which improves upon existing methods by ensuring serializable execution while minimizing coordination overhead.
The paper is well-organized, and the writing is clear. The authors provide a thorough introduction to the problem of distributed machine learning and the limitations of existing approaches. The presentation of the OCC pattern and its application to various algorithms is detailed and easy to follow. The theoretical analysis of the OCC algorithms is sound, and the experimental results demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of the approach.
