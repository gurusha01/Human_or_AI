This paper presents a novel approach to distributed machine learning using optimistic concurrency control (OCC), which offers a balance between the mutual exclusion and coordination-free approaches. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of OCC in distributing unsupervised learning algorithms, including DP-Means, Online Facility Location (OFL), and BP-Means. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the OCC pattern and its application to machine learning algorithms.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The authors provide a thorough analysis of the OCC approach, including its correctness and scalability.
* The paper presents a simple and efficient pattern for designing and implementing distributed machine learning systems using OCC.
* The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of OCC in practice through experiments on a distributed computing platform.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes that the cost of validating concurrent transactions is small and conflicts occur infrequently, which may not always be the case in practice.
* The authors do not provide a detailed comparison with other distributed machine learning algorithms, which would be helpful in understanding the advantages and disadvantages of the OCC approach.
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of distributed machine learning, and the OCC approach has the potential to be applied to a wide range of machine learning algorithms. The paper is well-organized, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the technical details.
