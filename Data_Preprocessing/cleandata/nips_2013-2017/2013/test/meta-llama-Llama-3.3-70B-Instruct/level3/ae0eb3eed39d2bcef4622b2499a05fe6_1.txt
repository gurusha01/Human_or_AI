This paper proposes a novel approach to distributed machine learning using optimistic concurrency control (OCC), which offers a middle ground between strict concurrency constraints and coordination-free parallelism. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of OCC in parallelizing clustering and feature selection methods, including DP-means, BP-means, and online facility location. The paper provides a thorough analysis of the OCC pattern, including its application to machine learning algorithms, and establishes the serializability of the distributed algorithms.
The strengths of the paper include its clear and well-organized presentation, as well as its ability to provide a unique perspective on distributed machine learning. The authors do a good job of positioning their work in the context of previous research, and their experimental evaluation demonstrates the scalability of their approach.
However, there are some weaknesses to the paper. The theoretical analysis, while thorough, provides little added value due to its straightforward nature. The experimental evaluation, while demonstrating some speedup, is unimpressive, with only a 4x speedup on 8 processors. Additionally, the paper's algorithms are somewhat ad-hoc, and the performance evaluation could be improved.
To improve the paper, the authors could consider positioning their work as a parallelized DP-means algorithm with extended discussion on optimistic concurrency control. This would help to clarify the contributions of the paper and provide a more focused evaluation of the OCC approach.
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The paper provides a unique perspective on distributed machine learning using OCC.
* The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of OCC in parallelizing clustering and feature selection methods.
