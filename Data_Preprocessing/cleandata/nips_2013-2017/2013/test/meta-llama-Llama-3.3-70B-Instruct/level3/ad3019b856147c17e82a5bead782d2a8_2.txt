This paper presents a novel approach to distributed clustering for k-means and k-median objectives, with a focus on reducing communication complexity. The authors propose a distributed coreset construction algorithm that constructs a global coreset of small size, which can be used to approximate the clustering cost of the entire data set. The algorithm is based on local approximate solutions and message-passing, and it improves over previous coreset-based distributed clustering algorithms.
The paper is well-written and provides a clear explanation of the proposed algorithm and its theoretical guarantees. The authors also provide experimental results on large-scale data sets, which demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach. The results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms other coreset-based distributed clustering algorithms, especially in cases where the local sites have significantly different costs.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposed algorithm has a low communication cost, which makes it suitable for distributed clustering applications where communication is limited.
* The algorithm is based on a principled approach, using local approximate solutions and message-passing to construct a global coreset.
* The authors provide theoretical guarantees for the algorithm, including bounds on the size of the coreset and the communication cost.
* The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm in practice.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The algorithm assumes that the data is distributed across nodes in a connected graph, which may not always be the case in practice.
* The algorithm requires a central coordinator to collect the local portions of the coreset, which may not be feasible in some distributed clustering applications.
* The experimental results are limited to a few data sets and may not be representative of all possible scenarios.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of distributed clustering, and the proposed algorithm has the potential to be useful in a variety of applications. However, further research is needed to address the limitations of the algorithm and to explore its applicability in different scenarios.
