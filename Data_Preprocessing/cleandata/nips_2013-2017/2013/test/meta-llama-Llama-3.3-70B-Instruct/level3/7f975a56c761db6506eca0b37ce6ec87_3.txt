This paper proposes a novel distributed algorithm for k-means and k-median clustering using a global coreset constructed in a distributed fashion. The algorithm has provable guarantees and improves communication complexity over existing approaches. The main technical contribution of the paper is the development of a distributed coreset construction algorithm that reduces the communication cost by constructing a global coreset of the same size as the centralized construction.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the algorithm and its theoretical guarantees. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm in practice, outperforming other coreset-based distributed clustering algorithms.
However, there are some limitations to the paper. The main technical contribution of the paper is not entirely new, as the coreset idea has been previously explored in the centralized setting. Additionally, the distributed coreset construction algorithm has loose upper bounds on coreset size and communication cost, making it impractical for large datasets. The experiments also have limitations, including a small number of distributed sites and low-dimensional datasets, which raises questions about the approach's effectiveness for larger and high-dimensional datasets.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The paper is also well-organized, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the algorithm and its theoretical guarantees.
The originality of the paper is somewhat limited, as the coreset idea has been previously explored in the centralized setting. However, the authors do provide a novel distributed algorithm for k-means and k-median clustering using a global coreset constructed in a distributed fashion.
The significance of the paper is moderate, as it provides a new approach to distributed clustering that improves communication complexity over existing approaches. However, the limitations of the paper, including the loose upper bounds on coreset size and communication cost, and the limited experimental results, reduce the significance of the paper.
Overall, I would give this paper a score of 7 out of 10. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the algorithm and its theoretical guarantees. However, the limitations of the paper, including the loose upper bounds on coreset size and communication cost, and the limited experimental results, reduce the significance of the paper.
