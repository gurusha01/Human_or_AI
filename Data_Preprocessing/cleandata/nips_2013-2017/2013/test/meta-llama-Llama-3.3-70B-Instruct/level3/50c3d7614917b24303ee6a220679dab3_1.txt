This paper presents a novel approach to distributed clustering for k-means and k-median objectives, providing algorithms with provable guarantees and improved communication complexity over existing methods. The key idea is to construct a global coreset, a small set of weighted points that approximates the cost of the original data, in a distributed manner. The authors achieve this by estimating the weight of the entire data set with the sum of local approximations, allowing nodes to communicate only the total costs of their local solutions.
The paper is technically sound, with a clear and well-organized presentation. The authors provide a thorough analysis of their algorithm, including a proof sketch of the main theorem, and demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments on large-scale datasets. The results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms other coreset-based distributed clustering algorithms, achieving better approximation ratios with smaller coreset sizes.
The paper's originality lies in its distributed coreset construction algorithm, which improves upon previous methods by reducing the communication complexity. The authors also provide a detailed comparison with existing algorithms, highlighting the advantages of their approach. The significance of the paper is evident, as it addresses a crucial problem in distributed clustering and provides a practical solution with theoretical guarantees.
However, there are some minor issues and suggestions for improvement. The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the experimental methodology, including the choice of datasets and partition methods. Additionally, the authors could provide more insight into the trade-offs between communication cost and approximation ratio. Some notation and definitions, such as the pseudo-dimension of a function space, could be clarified for readers unfamiliar with the topic.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the authors demonstrate a clear understanding of the problem and its significance. The proposed algorithm is a significant contribution to the field of distributed clustering, and the paper provides a thorough analysis of its properties and performance.
