This paper presents new distributed algorithms for clustering methods, specifically k-median and k-means, that reduce communication overhead and improve clustering objectives. The authors propose a distributed coreset construction algorithm that constructs a global coreset with low communication overhead, which is then used for distributed clustering. The algorithm has provable guarantees and improves over existing approaches.
The paper is technically sound, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of the algorithm's performance. The experimental results on large-scale datasets show that the algorithm outperforms other coreset-based distributed clustering algorithms. However, the paper is very technical, and more explanation is needed for the derivation and theorems to make it accessible to a broader audience.
One of the main strengths of the paper is its ability to reduce communication complexity while preserving theoretical guarantees for approximating clustering cost. The authors also provide a detailed comparison with other coreset algorithms, highlighting the advantages of their approach.
However, the reviewer is skeptical about the approximation quality of the coreset when the dimensionality increases. The experiments are conducted on low-dimensional datasets, and it is unclear how the algorithm would perform on high-dimensional data. Additionally, the title of the paper is too broad and vague, failing to highlight the specific focus on center-based distributed clustering methods.
In terms of quality, the paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem and the proposed solution. The paper is also well-organized, making it easy to follow. However, the lack of explanation for the technical details may make it difficult for non-experts to understand the paper.
The originality of the paper lies in its ability to construct a global coreset with low communication overhead, which is a significant improvement over existing approaches. The paper also provides a novel analysis of the algorithm's performance, which is a valuable contribution to the field.
The significance of the paper lies in its ability to improve the state of the art in distributed clustering. The algorithm has the potential to be used in a variety of applications, including distributed databases, sensor networks, and surveillance. The paper also provides a foundation for future research in distributed clustering, and its results can be used to improve the performance of other clustering algorithms.
