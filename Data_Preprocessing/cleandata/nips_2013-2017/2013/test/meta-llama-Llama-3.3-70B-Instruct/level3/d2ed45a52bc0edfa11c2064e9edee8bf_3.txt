This paper presents a novel approach to distributed clustering for k-means and k-median objectives, providing algorithms with provable guarantees and improved communication complexity. The proposed dataset is well-constructed and will contribute to category classification, offering a valuable resource for evaluating concept learning methods. Incorporating classification confidence into the system is a reasonable and practical approach to approximate non-perceptual word learning, presenting a promising direction for concept learning.
The paper effectively computes the confusion matrix with limited data, facilitating the proposed algorithm and enabling efficient evaluation. The evaluation is well-conducted, demonstrating the proposed algorithm's good performance compared to nearest neighbor approaches and ideal non-perceptual word learning methods.
However, the paper contains typos that need correction, including errors in equations 4 and 5, and line 269, which can mislead readers and should be addressed in the final version. Additionally, the reviewer suggests exploring alternative formulations, such as using confidence itself instead of the confusion matrix, and justifying why the proposed method is the best approach to utilize classification confidence.
The paper's strengths include its ability to reduce communication complexity while preserving theoretical guarantees for approximating clustering cost. The algorithm's performance is impressive, outperforming other coreset-based distributed clustering algorithms. The paper's weaknesses include the need for correction of typos and the potential for improvement in the formulation of the proposed method.
Arguments for acceptance include the paper's novel approach, well-conducted evaluation, and impressive performance. Arguments against acceptance include the need for correction of typos and the potential for improvement in the formulation of the proposed method. Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of distributed clustering and concept learning, and with revisions to address the mentioned weaknesses, it has the potential to be a strong addition to the conference program.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, with claims well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The paper is a complete piece of work, rather than a position paper, and the authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of the work. The paper's clarity is good, with clear explanations of the proposed algorithm and evaluation methodology. The paper's originality is high, presenting a novel approach to distributed clustering and concept learning. The paper's significance is also high, with potential impact on the field of machine learning and data analysis.
