This paper presents a unified formalization of stochastic And-Or grammars and an unsupervised approach to learning their structures and parameters. The authors' conclusion that their approach outperforms previous methods in learning event grammars and image grammars is well-supported by their experiments. However, there are some concerns regarding the evaluation methodology.
One issue is that the authors' conclusion that people outperform modern optimization algorithms is questionable, as they may not have eliminated all additional information people have, such as the range of the y-axis. This lack of control over external factors may have influenced the results.
Another concern is the paper's use of multiple measures to compare algorithm and human behavior, which can be confusing and unnecessary. A single measure, such as comparing the K+1th point for the algorithm and the person, would be more effective in evaluating the performance of the approach.
To assess across-subject agreement, the authors could have looked at split-half correlations of performance and the distribution of clicks from one half of the subjects to predict the distribution of clicks from the other half. This would have provided a more comprehensive understanding of the consistency of the results.
The decision theoretic analysis of the problem in Expt 6 is incomplete, and a more thorough analysis is needed to determine the correct strategy for the first click. The authors should have provided a more detailed explanation of their approach and its limitations.
Overall, the paper could be improved by using fewer, more thoughtful measures to evaluate model fit and by providing more careful estimates of across-subject consistency. The authors should also consider addressing the potential biases in their evaluation methodology to ensure the validity of their conclusions.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper presents a novel and unified formalization of stochastic And-Or grammars.
* The authors propose an unsupervised approach to learning the structures and parameters of these grammars.
* The experiments demonstrate satisfactory performance of the approach in learning event grammars and image grammars.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The evaluation methodology has some limitations, such as the potential bias in the comparison between human and algorithm performance.
* The use of multiple measures to compare algorithm and human behavior can be confusing and unnecessary.
* The decision theoretic analysis of the problem in Expt 6 is incomplete.
* The paper could benefit from more careful estimates of across-subject consistency and a more detailed explanation of the approach and its limitations.
