This paper presents a novel approach to distributed clustering for k-means and k-median objectives, focusing on minimizing communication cost in a distributed setting. The authors introduce the concept of distributed coresets, which significantly improves the state-of-the-art communication complexity. The theoretical framework is based on the notion of dimension of the function space and the sampling lemma, providing a solid foundation for the proposed algorithms.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their approach. The experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, outperforming existing methods in terms of communication complexity. The results show that the algorithm performs well in practice, achieving a good trade-off between communication cost and clustering quality.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The introduction of a novel concept of distributed coresets, which improves the communication complexity significantly.
* A solid theoretical framework, providing a foundation for the proposed algorithms.
* A rigorous experimental evaluation, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
However, there are some weaknesses and limitations:
* The paper does not compare the accuracy of the clustering algorithms for the same communication budget in the experimental evaluation.
* The algorithm assumes that the data is distributed across nodes whose communication is restricted to the edges of an arbitrary graph, which might not be the case in all real-world scenarios.
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion on the applicability of the proposed approach to other clustering objectives and real-world scenarios.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of distributed clustering, and the proposed approach has the potential to be applied in various real-world scenarios. The authors have demonstrated the effectiveness of their approach through rigorous theoretical analysis and experimental evaluation.
