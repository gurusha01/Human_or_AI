This paper presents a novel approach to distributed machine learning using optimistic concurrency control (OCC), which offers a middle ground between traditional mutual exclusion and coordination-free parallelism. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of OCC in distributing unsupervised learning algorithms, including DP-Means, Online Facility Location (OFL), and BP-Means, and provide theoretical guarantees for their distributed algorithms.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the OCC pattern and its application to machine learning algorithms. The theoretical analysis is sound, and the authors provide proofs for the serializability and scalability of their distributed algorithms. The experimental results demonstrate the scalability and efficiency of the OCC approach, with near-perfect scaling achieved in many cases.
The paper makes significant contributions to the field of distributed machine learning, providing a new approach that balances correctness and parallelism. The OCC pattern is flexible and can be applied to a wide range of machine learning algorithms, making it a valuable tool for practitioners and researchers.
One potential weakness of the paper is the comparison to existing work, which could be more comprehensive. The authors mention related work in the area, but a more detailed comparison to existing approaches, such as [14] and [15], would strengthen the paper. Additionally, the authors could provide more insight into the choice of OCC as the comparison algorithm and consider other relevant works, such as [16] and [17].
Overall, the paper is well-structured, and the authors provide a clear and concise presentation of their work. The paper demonstrates a good understanding of the research area and provides a significant contribution to the field of distributed machine learning.
