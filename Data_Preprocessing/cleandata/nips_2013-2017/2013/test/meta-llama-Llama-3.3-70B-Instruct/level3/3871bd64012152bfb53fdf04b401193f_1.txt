This paper proposes two approaches to address binary classification with random, class-conditional noise in training data. The authors modify a surrogate loss function and derive performance bounds, providing guarantees for risk minimization of convex surrogates under random label noise without assumptions on the true distribution. The paper presents experiments on synthetic and benchmark datasets, demonstrating the robustness of the proposed algorithms to increasing rates of label noise.
The strengths of the paper include its theoretical contributions, such as the derivation of performance bounds and the introduction of two approaches to modify surrogate loss functions. The experiments on synthetic and benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in handling label noise. The paper also provides a thorough review of related work, highlighting the significance of the proposed approaches.
However, there are some weaknesses to consider. The assumption of constant class noise in the training data may not be realistic in all scenarios, and the paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the limitations of this assumption. Additionally, the theoretical results, while non-trivial, may not be extremely profound compared to existing work on related settings.
Here is a list of arguments pro and con acceptance:
