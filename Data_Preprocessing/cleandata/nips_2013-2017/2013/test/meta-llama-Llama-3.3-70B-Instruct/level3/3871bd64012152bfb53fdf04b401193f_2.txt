This paper proposes a novel approach to automatically discover latent domains in image or video datasets, which is essential for domain adaptation in visual recognition problems. The authors introduce two key properties that latent domains should possess: maximum distinctiveness and maximum learnability. They devise a nonparametric formulation and efficient optimization procedure to identify domains that satisfy these properties.
The paper makes a strong contribution with original theoretical results, such as the formulation of maximum distinctiveness and maximum learnability, and compelling empirical results on object recognition and human activity recognition tasks. The authors demonstrate that their approach outperforms the original datasets and the domains discovered by a competing method.
The paper is well-written, providing significant results on learning binary classifiers from noisy labels using convex surrogates, with important technical results and compelling experiments. The authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of their approach, including the optimization procedure and the evaluation strategy.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The introduction of two novel properties for latent domains, which provides a new perspective on domain adaptation.
* The development of a nonparametric formulation and efficient optimization procedure to identify domains that satisfy these properties.
* The comprehensive evaluation of the approach on object recognition and human activity recognition tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The assumption that the number of domains is unknown, which may not always be the case in practice.
* The reliance on a specific kernel-based method to measure distribution differences, which may not be suitable for all types of data.
Future directions for research include:
* Exploring the application of this approach to other types of data, such as text or audio.
* Investigating the use of other methods to measure distribution differences, such as deep learning-based approaches.
* Examining the relationship between the identified domains and the factors that affect visual recognition, such as lighting, pose, and background.
Overall, this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of domain adaptation and visual recognition, and its approach has the potential to be applied to a wide range of problems. The authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of their approach, and the empirical results demonstrate its effectiveness.
