This paper proposes a novel approach to distributed clustering for k-means and k-median objectives, with a focus on reducing communication complexity. The authors introduce a distributed coreset construction algorithm that constructs a global coreset of small size, which can be used to approximate the clustering cost of the entire data set. The algorithm is based on local approximate solutions and requires only a single value to be communicated from each node, resulting in a significant reduction in communication cost.
The paper is well-written, clear, and easy to follow. The authors provide a thorough introduction to the problem of distributed clustering, including the challenges and limitations of existing approaches. They also provide a detailed explanation of their proposed algorithm, including the theoretical guarantees and experimental results.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposed algorithm is simple, yet effective, and has a low communication cost.
* The authors provide a thorough analysis of the algorithm, including theoretical guarantees and experimental results.
* The paper is well-organized and easy to follow, making it accessible to a wide range of readers.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The algorithm assumes that the data is distributed across nodes in a connected graph, which may not always be the case in practice.
* The authors do not provide a detailed comparison with other state-of-the-art algorithms for distributed clustering.
