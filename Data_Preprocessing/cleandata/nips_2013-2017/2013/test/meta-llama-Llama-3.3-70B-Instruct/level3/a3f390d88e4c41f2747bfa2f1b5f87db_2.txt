This paper presents a unified formalization of stochastic And-Or grammars and an unsupervised approach to learning their structures and parameters. The authors propose a novel algorithm that iteratively induces compositions and reconfigurations in a unified manner, optimizing the posterior probability of the grammar. The approach is evaluated on event grammars and image grammars, achieving comparable or better performance than previous approaches.
The paper tackles interesting problems for machine learning-oriented cognitive scientists, including optimizing a function and active interpolation and extrapolation. However, the experimental stimuli and procedure lack ecological validity, making it difficult to interpret the results in the context of real-world human function learning. The authors fail to integrate their experiments and results with previous human function learning work, which would have made the paper stronger and the results more interpretable.
The paper has several minor concerns, including poor figure readability, unclear stimuli generation, and inconsistent language framing. The authors should report the rank-order correlation of the dependent variables for people and each optimization method and consider correcting for multiple comparisons in their statistical tests. The paper could be improved with more ecologically valid stimuli and cover story, as well as additional control methods, such as estimating the parameters of a polynomial of degree up to m.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of the work. The paper is clearly written, well-organized, and adequately informs the reader. The approach is novel, and the problems tackled are new and interesting. The paper provides unique conclusions on existing data and a unique theoretical or pragmatic approach.
However, the paper may be too abstract for many cognitive psychologists, and the lack of integration with previous human function learning work is a significant limitation. The results are important, and other people are likely to use these ideas or build on them. The paper advances the state of the art in a demonstrable way and provides unique data, conclusions, or a unique theoretical or pragmatic approach.
