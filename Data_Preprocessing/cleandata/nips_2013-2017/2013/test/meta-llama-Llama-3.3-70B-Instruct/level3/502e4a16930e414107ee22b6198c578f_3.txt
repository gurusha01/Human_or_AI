This paper presents a novel approach to distributed machine learning using optimistic concurrency control (OCC), which offers a balance between the mutual exclusion and coordination-free approaches. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of OCC in distributing unsupervised learning algorithms, including DP-Means, Online Facility Location (OFL), and BP-Means. The paper provides a clear and well-organized exposition of the OCC pattern and its application to these algorithms.
The strengths of the paper include its ability to preserve the theoretical properties of the serial algorithms, such as serializability and approximation guarantees, while achieving high parallelism and scalability. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the correctness and scalability of the OCC algorithms, including theoretical bounds on the rejection rate and empirical evaluations on synthetic data. The paper also highlights the potential of OCC to integrate with other ideas in the literature, such as hierarchical divide-and-conquer schemes.
However, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement. The paper could benefit from a clearer motivation for the work, as the introduction and related work sections seem somewhat disconnected from the rest of the paper. Additionally, some of the proofs and theoretical analyses are relegated to the appendices, which may make it difficult for readers to fully appreciate the technical contributions of the paper. Furthermore, the paper could benefit from more detailed comparisons with existing approaches, such as the coordination-free and mutual exclusion approaches, to better highlight the advantages and trade-offs of OCC.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper scores well on clarity, with clear and concise explanations of the OCC pattern and its application to the various algorithms. The paper also scores well on originality, as the application of OCC to distributed machine learning is a novel contribution. However, the paper could benefit from more detailed discussions of the significance and impact of the work, as well as more thorough comparisons with existing approaches.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, as it presents a significant and original contribution to the field of distributed machine learning. However, the authors should address the areas for improvement mentioned above to strengthen the paper and provide a more comprehensive and convincing presentation of their work.
