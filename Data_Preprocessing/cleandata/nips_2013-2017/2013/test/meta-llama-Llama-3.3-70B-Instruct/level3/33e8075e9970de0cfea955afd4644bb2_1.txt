This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of machine learning, specifically in the area of learning from noisy labels. The authors propose two approaches to modify any given surrogate loss function to make it robust to random classification noise. The first approach uses unbiased estimators of the loss function, while the second approach leverages a reduction of risk minimization under noisy labels to classification with weighted 0-1 loss.
The paper is well-structured and clearly written, with a detailed derivation of the construction and experiments showcasing its validity and versatility. The authors establish an interesting connection between wavelet construction on graphs and auto-encoder networks, which is likely to trigger further development in this research area.
The strengths of the paper include its technical soundness, clarity, and originality. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the problem, and their approaches are well-motivated and supported by theoretical guarantees. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in handling noisy labels, and the results are competitive with state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets.
However, there are some areas for improvement. For instance, the authors could provide more information on the colorbars in figures 4 and 5, and clarify the meaning of "sufficient" in section 4.5. Additionally, the paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion on the implications of the methods for the positive-unlabeled learning problem.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, originality, and significance. The authors demonstrate a good understanding of the problem and its relevance to the field, and their contributions are significant and well-supported. The paper is well-written, and the experiments are thorough and well-designed.
