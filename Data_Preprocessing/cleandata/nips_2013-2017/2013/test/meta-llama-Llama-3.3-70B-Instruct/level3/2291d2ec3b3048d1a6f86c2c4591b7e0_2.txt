This paper proposes a novel approach to domain adaptation in computer vision datasets by automatically partitioning images into domains based on underlying aspects such as viewpoint and illumination. The technique is driven by two principles: making separate domains in feature space and making them trainable for a good discriminative classifier. The paper's originality and significance lie in its proposal of automatically discovering useful domains to support training better classifiers, with little prior work in this area.
The paper is well-organized and clearly written, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments and methodology. The authors provide a thorough review of related work in domain adaptation, highlighting the limitations of existing approaches and the need for a more robust and flexible method. The proposed approach is extensively evaluated on object recognition and human activity recognition tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving classification accuracy.
However, there are some limitations to the paper. The optimization method proposed is not fully convincing, and the two driving criteria are not well integrated. The paper lacks figures to illustrate the concepts presented, which affects its quality and clarity. Additionally, the experiments show a significant advantage in using the proposed method over existing approaches, but the image descriptor used is simple and outdated. The use of a simple bag-of-words representation with sparse SURF features is a major weakness, and the authors are recommended to use more modern representations such as spatial pyramids or Fisher Vectors.
The paper's strengths include its novel approach to domain adaptation, its thorough evaluation on multiple tasks, and its potential to shed light on dataset construction in the future. The authors' use of nonparametric methods to discover latent domains is a significant contribution, and their proposal of maximum distinctiveness and maximum learnability as desirable properties of domains is well-motivated.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of the work. The paper is clearly written, well-organized, and adequately informs the reader.
The originality of the paper lies in its proposal of automatically discovering useful domains to support training better classifiers. The approach is novel, and the authors demonstrate its effectiveness in improving classification accuracy. The paper is significant, as it addresses a difficult problem in domain adaptation and provides a unique solution.
Overall, I recommend accepting this paper, as it makes a significant contribution to the field of domain adaptation in computer vision. However, I suggest that the authors address the limitations mentioned above, particularly the use of outdated image descriptors and the lack of figures to illustrate the concepts presented.
