The paper addresses the challenge of cross-language text classification by proposing a novel two-step representation learning method. The approach leverages a small set of unlabeled parallel bilingual documents to bridge disjoint feature spaces between languages. The first step involves matrix completion to recover missing entries in a concatenated document-term matrix, using a projected gradient descent algorithm with convergence guarantees. The second step applies latent semantic indexing (LSI) on the completed matrix to induce low-dimensional cross-lingual document representations. The method is evaluated on cross-language sentiment classification tasks using multilingual Amazon product reviews, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods, particularly in scenarios with limited parallel data.
Strengths:
1. Technical Soundness: The paper is technically rigorous, with a well-defined optimization problem for matrix completion and a detailed convergence analysis of the proposed algorithm. The use of LSI on the completed matrix is a logical extension to reduce dimensionality and noise.
2. Empirical Validation: Extensive experiments on 18 cross-lingual sentiment classification tasks provide strong evidence of the method's efficacy. The results consistently outperform baseline methods (e.g., CL-LSI, CL-KCCA, and CL-OPCA), particularly when parallel data is scarce.
3. Practical Relevance: The method addresses a significant real-world problem in NLPâ€”reducing the reliance on labeled data in low-resource languages by leveraging cross-lingual representations.
4. Clarity and Organization: The paper is well-structured, with clear explanations of the methodology, optimization algorithm, and experimental setup. The inclusion of parameter sensitivity analysis and performance trends with varying amounts of parallel data further strengthens the work.
Weaknesses:
1. Comparison with Recent Advances: While the paper references prior work (e.g., CL-LSI, CL-KCCA), it does not compare against more recent advances in cross-lingual embeddings, such as multilingual transformers (e.g., mBERT, XLM-R). This omission limits the contextualization of the proposed method within the current state of the art.
2. Scalability: The proposed matrix completion approach may face scalability challenges for very large datasets or vocabularies, as the document-term matrix grows quadratically with vocabulary size. While the method is efficient for the tested dataset, its applicability to larger corpora remains unclear.
3. Limited Scope of Evaluation: The experiments focus solely on sentiment classification tasks. Evaluating the method on other cross-lingual tasks, such as topic classification or question answering, would provide a more comprehensive assessment of its generalizability.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper introduces a novel and technically sound approach to cross-lingual representation learning.
- It demonstrates significant performance improvements over existing methods, particularly in low-resource settings.
- The method is well-motivated and addresses a critical challenge in NLP.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The lack of comparison with recent multilingual embedding models limits the paper's relevance to the current state of the art.
- Scalability concerns for larger datasets are not adequately addressed.
Recommendation:
Overall, the paper makes a meaningful contribution to cross-lingual text classification and is well-suited for the conference. However, the authors should address the scalability concerns and include comparisons with recent multilingual models in the final version. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions.
