This paper presents novel distributed algorithms for clustering with k-median and k-means objectives, focusing on reducing communication complexity while maintaining provable guarantees on clustering quality. The authors leverage the concept of coresets—compact, weighted summaries of data—to design a distributed coreset construction algorithm that works efficiently over general communication topologies. The proposed method improves over prior work by significantly reducing communication costs, especially in sparse networks with large diameters. Experimental results on large-scale datasets demonstrate that the algorithm outperforms existing coreset-based distributed clustering methods in terms of clustering quality for a fixed communication budget.
Strengths:
1. Technical Soundness and Theoretical Guarantees: The paper is technically rigorous, providing detailed proofs and theoretical guarantees for the proposed algorithms. The construction of distributed coresets is well-justified, and the authors demonstrate how their approach improves over prior methods, such as [23], in terms of communication complexity.
2. Novelty: The work introduces a distributed coreset construction method that avoids combining local coresets, a key limitation of prior approaches. This innovation leads to significant improvements in communication efficiency, particularly in networks with high diameter.
3. Experimental Validation: The experimental results are comprehensive, covering multiple network topologies and data partitioning methods. The authors demonstrate that their algorithm consistently outperforms baselines, such as COMBINE and Zhang et al. [23], in both communication efficiency and clustering quality.
4. Clarity of Contributions: The paper clearly delineates its contributions, including theoretical improvements, practical algorithms, and empirical validation. The discussion of related work is thorough, situating the contributions within the broader literature on distributed clustering and coresets.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity and Accessibility: While the technical content is solid, the paper is dense and may be challenging for readers unfamiliar with coresets or distributed clustering. The proofs, though detailed, could benefit from additional intuition or visual aids to make the key ideas more accessible.
2. Limited Scope of Experiments: Although the experiments are well-executed, they are primarily focused on k-means clustering. Extending the empirical evaluation to other clustering objectives or real-world distributed systems would strengthen the paper's practical relevance.
3. Assumptions on Communication and Network Topology: The paper assumes no latency in communication and focuses on message-passing approaches. While this is a reasonable simplification, it may limit the applicability of the results to real-world distributed systems with more complex communication constraints.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper addresses an important problem in distributed clustering and makes a clear theoretical and practical contribution.
- The proposed algorithms are novel, technically sound, and demonstrate significant improvements over prior work.
- The experimental results validate the practical utility of the approach, particularly in challenging network settings.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The paper's dense presentation may limit its accessibility to a broader audience.
- The experimental scope could be expanded to demonstrate the generality of the approach across diverse clustering objectives and real-world systems.
Recommendation:
Overall, this paper makes a strong contribution to the field of distributed clustering and is well-suited for presentation at NIPS. While there are areas for improvement in clarity and experimental breadth, the strengths of the paper outweigh its weaknesses. I recommend acceptance.
