Review of the Paper: "Efficient Sampling from Continuous Determinantal Point Processes"
This paper addresses the computational challenges of sampling from determinantal point processes (DPPs) in continuous spaces, a problem that has hindered the broader adoption of DPPs for modeling repulsion in high-dimensional settings. The authors propose two novel sampling schemes: one leveraging low-rank approximations via Nyström and random Fourier features (RFF), and another based on Gibbs sampling for k-DPPs. These methods are evaluated empirically and applied to two tasks: repulsive mixture modeling and synthesizing diverse human poses. The paper makes a significant contribution by extending the utility of DPPs to continuous domains, where prior work has been limited by computational intractability.
The proposed methods build on foundational work in discrete DPPs (e.g., Hough et al., 2006) and extend recent efforts to approximate continuous DPPs (e.g., Affandi et al., 2014). The authors' use of low-rank kernel approximations is well-motivated, and the dual representation of the DPP kernel is a clever adaptation of techniques previously applied in discrete settings (Kulesza and Taskar, 2012). The paper also provides a thorough empirical evaluation, demonstrating the trade-offs between the Nyström and RFF approximations in terms of dimensionality and repulsion strength. These results are consistent with prior findings on kernel approximation methods (e.g., Rahimi and Recht, 2007; Drineas and Mahoney, 2005).
Strengths:
1. Technical Contribution: The paper introduces efficient and scalable algorithms for sampling from continuous DPPs, a longstanding challenge in the field. The use of low-rank approximations and Gibbs sampling is well-justified and novel in this context.
2. Empirical Rigor: The authors provide a detailed empirical analysis, including evaluations of total variation distance, clustering performance, and coverage metrics. The comparison of Nyström and RFF methods is particularly insightful.
3. Applications: The paper demonstrates the practical utility of continuous DPPs in two compelling applications: repulsive mixture modeling and human pose synthesis. These examples highlight the versatility and potential impact of the proposed methods.
4. Clarity: The paper is well-organized, with clear explanations of the algorithms and their theoretical underpinnings. The inclusion of supplementary material further strengthens the presentation.
Weaknesses:
1. Limited Theoretical Guarantees: While the authors provide empirical evidence of the effectiveness of their methods, the theoretical analysis of approximation errors (e.g., bounds on total variation distance) is limited. Extending results from discrete DPPs to continuous settings would strengthen the paper.
2. Scalability Concerns: Although the proposed methods scale linearly with dimensionality, the computational cost of kernel approximations (e.g., Nyström integrals) may still be prohibitive for very high-dimensional spaces or large datasets. A discussion of practical runtime and memory requirements would be helpful.
3. Restricted Kernel Choices: The methods rely on specific kernel properties (e.g., translation invariance for RFF). While this is a reasonable limitation, the paper could explore broader classes of kernels or provide guidance on kernel selection for practitioners.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper addresses an important and challenging problem, making a significant contribution to the field of probabilistic modeling and machine learning.
- The proposed methods are novel, technically sound, and empirically validated.
- The applications demonstrate the practical relevance of the work, with potential for impact in diverse areas such as generative modeling and spatial statistics.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The lack of theoretical guarantees for the approximation methods may limit the generalizability of the results.
- The scalability of the methods for extremely high-dimensional or large-scale datasets is not fully explored.
Recommendation:
I recommend acceptance of this paper. While there are some limitations, the contributions are substantial, and the work is likely to inspire further research on continuous DPPs and their applications. The paper is a strong candidate for presentation at the conference.
