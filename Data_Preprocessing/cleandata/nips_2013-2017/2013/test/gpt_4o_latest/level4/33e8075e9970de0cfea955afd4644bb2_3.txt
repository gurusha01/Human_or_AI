Review - Paraphrased Version
Summary:  
The authors propose a method for constructing wavelets on weighted graphs that are tailored to a specific class of signals. Their approach leverages the lifting scheme and establishes a connection between this scheme and a deep auto-encoder network. This connection enables unsupervised training akin to the pre-training process used in stacked auto-encoders. The proposed method operates with linear complexity relative to the graph size. The authors demonstrate the utility of their wavelet construction method by applying it to multiple datasets.
Quality:  
The authors introduce an elegant framework for incorporating signal characteristics into the process of wavelet construction on graphs. While most existing methods rely solely on the graph's structure, the few approaches that do account for signal adaptivity [19,21] suffer from notable limitations.  
The technical contributions are clearly articulated, innovative, and result in an efficient algorithm that generates wavelets with desirable properties.  
However, the partitioning strategy is only briefly mentioned, and there is minimal discussion regarding the sensitivity of the method to the choice of partitioning technique. The spectral clustering algorithm from [20], which the authors employ, has known limitations (e.g., suboptimal performance on certain graph types). It would be beneficial to provide further insights into how the wavelet construction is impacted by the choice of partitioning method.  
For the results on irregular graphs—arguably the most compelling application of the proposed method—the authors do not compare their approach to other graph wavelet techniques for tasks like compression or reconstruction. Instead, the comparisons are made against older learning methods designed for manifold analysis, which is a notable shortcoming of the paper.  
Clarity:  
The paper is exceptionally well-written, and the technical exposition is clear and easy to follow. However, as noted earlier, additional details on certain aspects, such as the partitioning method, would enhance the clarity and completeness of the work.  
Originality:  
The authors present a novel method for constructing graph wavelets that can adapt to the specific class of functions they are intended to represent. The approach is highly original and represents a meaningful advancement in the field.  
Significance:  
This work makes a valuable contribution to the growing field of wavelets and multiresolution analysis on graphs, which has numerous practical applications. The ability to achieve signal adaptivity while maintaining linear complexity and construction efficiency is a significant step forward.  
Overall, the paper offers a substantial and original contribution to the domain of graph wavelets. However, the lack of a comprehensive comparison to other graph wavelet methods for compression and reconstruction remains its primary limitation.
