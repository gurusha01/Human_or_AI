The authors propose in this paper an algorithm for visual concept learning. Given a small set of images representing a concept (where concepts may vary across different levels of abstraction), the algorithm is designed to recognize additional images belonging to the same concept. The approach integrates object classification techniques from machine vision with Bayesian generalization principles from cognitive science. The authors evaluate the generalization performance of their algorithm against several baseline methods and demonstrate a significant improvement when combining visual classifiers with the Bayesian cognitive model, as their method does. 
Additionally, the authors introduce a large-scale dataset for visual concept learning, constructed using ImageNet images and annotations provided by human annotators.
I find the problem of visual concept learning both compelling and highly relevant to the NIPS community. The paper is of high quality: it is well-written and engaging to read.
However, there are a few points that I believe the authors should address:
- In Section 3.2, the authors assert that their criteria (Equation 1) for selecting levels of nested concepts to generate their dataset result in sub-category, basic, super-basic, and super-category levels within the taxonomy. I would like to see this claim substantiated. Furthermore, the authors should cite Rosch et al. (1976) when discussing basic-level categories, as connecting Rosch's foundational work to this study would provide valuable context.
- There seems to be potential confusion in the equations presented in Section 4.1. Should Equation 3 be P(h|X) rather than the written P(X|h)? Additionally, I am unclear why Equation 4 includes |h|^-N instead of |h|^-1 (perhaps it should be P(X|h) instead of P(xi|h)). Moreover, the term p(xnew|h) on line 226 appears inconsistent with Equation 4, which is somewhat confusing. I suspect it should be p(x_new âˆˆ C|h).
- The explanation of the extension of [5] (HB) could be clarified. Specifically, shouldn't the subtree preserve accuracy over the five example images rather than the query images, as mentioned on line 345?
Overall, this is a well-written paper on an interesting and important topic (concept learning), which is tackled using a combination of tools from machine vision and cognitive science. I believe it merits acceptance.
