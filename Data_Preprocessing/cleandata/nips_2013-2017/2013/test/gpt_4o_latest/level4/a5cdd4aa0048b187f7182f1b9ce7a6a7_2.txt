Demonstrates the design of a convex least-squares-style surrogate loss for high-arity multiclass losses with low-rank structure. The paper is exceptionally well-written.
The only suggestion: considering the introduction of the loss matrix \mathbf{L}, why not express the condition in Theorem 3 directly in matrix form? Overall, this is an excellently written paper that provides a clear methodology for designing convex surrogates for multiclass losses in a way that enhances tractability. The approach is particularly effective when the target loss exhibits a low-rank structure. As detailed in the paper, several widely-used losses possess this property, and the authors present a method to construct an efficient surrogate accordingly.
