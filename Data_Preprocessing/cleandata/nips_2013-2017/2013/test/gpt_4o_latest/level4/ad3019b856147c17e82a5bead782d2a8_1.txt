This paper introduces a novel method for face verification, aiming to determine whether two images represent the same individual. The proposed approach leverages an auxiliary training dataset comprising multiple images (15 per person, totaling 450 individuals). The methodology assumes that face images are preprocessed using low-level features (HOG), followed by PCA and z-score normalization, resulting in a template for each training image. During testing, the two images to be compared undergo the following steps independently: (i) the normalized dot product is computed between the test image's template and each template of a specific person in the auxiliary set, (ii) the mean of these dot products forms the k-th component of the test image's representation, and (iii) this process is repeated for all 450 individuals in the training set, yielding a 450-dimensional representation. The final score is obtained by computing the normalized dot product between the representations of the two test images. Experimental validation is performed on four datasets (PubFig83, a new dataset introduced in the paper, PubFig, and LFW), showing promising results. However, comparisons with recent state-of-the-art methods are absent, and the results fall significantly short of those achieved by competing approaches.
Positive Aspects
1. The paper is well-written and not only presents a novel approach for face recognition but also attempts to connect the proposed method with the theoretical framework of [1] and discusses its biological plausibility.
2. The presentation is clear and easy to follow.
3. The experiments are interesting and reasonably designed.
Negative Aspects
1. The concept of using auxiliary datasets and representing images based on similarities to prototypes has a well-established history in computer vision and has gained increasing attention in recent years. For instance, [a] employs a separate linear SVM classifier for each exemplar in the training set, representing images using the outputs of these classifiers. Similarly, several recent works (e.g., [b-i]) have explored the use of auxiliary face datasets to transfer knowledge. For example, [i] demonstrates that faces of the same individual often share top neighbors in the auxiliary set, using ranking orders to compute distances. [e] introduces the "associate-predict" model, which leverages a generic identity dataset with diverse intra-personal variations to associate input faces with similar identities and predict their appearance under different conditions. While the proposed method differs sufficiently from these approaches, the lack of citations and discussions about these related works raises significant concerns.
2. Another major concern is the experimental validation, particularly the absence of comparisons with prior works. Several competing methods have utilized auxiliary training sets for face recognition, with some directly comparable to the proposed approach. The paper should have included such comparisons. Moreover, the LFW results page for the "Outside training data in recognition system" category reports state-of-the-art results of up to 95%, far exceeding the 87.1% achieved by the proposed method.
3. The experimental validation does not clarify whether the improvement stems from the proposed method itself (as an application of the theory in [1]) or simply from the use of a high-quality auxiliary dataset. A straightforward experiment representing test images as normalized dot products with the entire test set (resulting in a 12,500-dimensional vector, potentially reduced by PCA) without pooling could provide valuable insights. If this baseline performs comparably to the proposed method, it would support the theory of [a] rather than [1]. Ultimately, it remains unclear whether the proposed framework is genuinely an application of [1] or merely an exemplar-based recognition system akin to [a], with the SVMs in [a] replaced by simple dot products. This disconnect is evident in the transition from sections 1, 2, and 3—focused on orbits, geometric transforms, groups, and CFD signatures—to sections 4 and 5, which rely solely on a straightforward exemplar-based approach using dot products.

In summary, this is an interesting and well-written paper on face recognition. However, its impact is diminished by the lack of comparisons and discussions with recent related works, as well as by insufficient experimental validation.
