This paper introduces a novel technique for domain adaptation in computer vision datasets, which often encompass multiple factors such as viewpoint, illumination, clutter, compression, etc. Instead of treating domains as equivalent to datasets—an approach that conflates these factors—the proposed method automatically partitions the entire set of images across datasets into distinct domains. The partitioning process is guided by two key principles: ensuring separability in feature space and enabling the training of effective discriminative classifiers for the original classes (not for domain separation) within each domain. This approach is more likely to partition data based on underlying factors rather than dataset boundaries.
Originality and Significance:  
There has been limited prior work on the automatic definition of domains, and this paper makes a valuable contribution by proposing a promising method for discovering meaningful domains that can facilitate the training of better classifiers for the original task.  
However, I have some reservations about the proposed optimization method (Section 2), as it is unclear how effectively it addresses the original problem (2)+(3). Additionally, the two driving criteria are not fully integrated: the maximal learnability criterion is applied as a post-hoc validation score to determine the optimal number of domains, while the partitioning itself is based solely on the separability criterion. A more cohesive approach would involve directly optimizing a unified objective function that incorporates both criteria.  
Despite these limitations, which may stem from the exploratory nature of this research area, I believe the paper represents meaningful progress for the field and merits acceptance.  
Quality and Clarity:  
The paper is well-written but would benefit from the inclusion of figures to better illustrate the concepts discussed.  
Experiments:  
On the positive side, the experiments demonstrate that the proposed method produces domains that significantly outperform using datasets as domains and also surpass the performance of a recent domain discovery technique [19] (Section 4.2).  
The idea of incorporating the test set into the "reshaping" process is intriguing but not clearly explained (Section 4.3). This approach corresponds to an imputation setting, where all test data is available simultaneously, but this is not explicitly stated.  
On the negative side, the image descriptor used is overly simplistic and outdated: a single bag-of-words representation of sparse SURF features with only 800 codebook entries. This is inadequate by modern standards. I recommend that the authors adopt a spatial pyramid of bag-of-words computed on dense SURF features. Furthermore, the similarity measure used for comparing image descriptors is not specified—hopefully, it is X² or an intersection kernel, as Euclidean distance is unsuitable for histogram comparisons. As a next step, the authors could consider using a Fisher Vector representation to bring the image representation in line with contemporary methods. Relevant references include Zhang IJCV 2006, Jurie CVPR 2005, Lazebnik CVPR 2006, and Perronin ECCV 2010.  
Overall, the paper presents innovative ideas on an important problem and achieves promising results. However, there is room for improvement, particularly in the choice of image representation.
