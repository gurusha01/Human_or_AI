This paper generalizes determinantal point process (DPP) sampling methods from discrete to continuous domains by leveraging low-rank kernel approximations. Standard kernels are approximated using either the Nystroem method or random Fourier features. The approach is applied to repulsive mixture models and separated sampling, showcasing its utility.
The authors utilize a low-rank kernel to develop an efficient "dual sampler," as outlined in Algorithm 1. They identify specific cases of quality functions and similarity kernels where the required computations for the Nystroem and RFF approximations are feasible (see Supplementary Table 1). This represents a significant and non-trivial contribution.
In Section 5, the continuous DPP is employed as a prior on the means in a mixture model. However, the proposed approximation is not directly used in this context. As the authors note, "since we are sampling just one item from the DPP, there is a closed form, and we do not rely on approximations." The results confirm the expected repulsive effect of DPPs, as evidenced by the mixture weight entropies.
Aside: To truly qualify as a repulsive mixture, the proximity of the means should arguably be assessed relative to their variances. However, as noted in Supplementary Material (p. 4), the variances are independent of the means, which seems inconsistent with this notion.
In Section 6, the DPP is applied to sample a diverse set of poses from a given density. While the resulting poses appear credibly diverse, it is worth noting that similar results might have been achievable using alternative methods, such as hard-core processes (see p. 1) or farthest-point clustering (e.g., Gonzales, 1985).
Quality: The technical correctness of the material appears sound, as far as I can assess.
Clarity: The paper is generally clear. However, Figure 1 would benefit from additional details regarding the definition of Equation (15). Specifically, for a given set \( X \), how is the sum defined and evaluated?
Originality: As the authors acknowledge, this work builds upon prior research on low-rank approximations in discrete spaces. Additionally, the construction of the repulsive prior has been explored in earlier works [20, 32].
Significance: The practical applicability of the main result remains somewhat unclear. Section 5 does not directly utilize the proposed approximation, and Section 6 serves primarily as a visualization that does not necessitate a precise sampler. Nonetheless, the result has the potential to be leveraged in other interesting applications.
Other Comments:
- Line 102: The citation [11] is not the first to demonstrate that a matrix of the form \( B^T B \) (\( D \ll N \)) admits a fast eigendecomposition, though the citation implies otherwise. For instance, this result was utilized in L. Sirovich and M. Kirby (1987), "Low-dimensional procedure for the characterization of human faces," Journal of the Optical Society of America A, 4(3): 519–524. It is also a standard result in advanced linear algebra texts, such as Wilkinson.
- Equation 2: Define the notation \( \bar{\phi}_n \), presumably as the complex conjugate.
- Lines 241–242: Why not use \( \sigma^2 I \) instead of \( \text{diag}(\sigma^2, \ldots, \sigma^2) \), and similarly for \( \rho^2 \)?
- Line 304: Why were only 100 test observations used? Increasing the number of test observations could reduce variance and improve reliability.
In summary, this paper extends DPP sampling schemes from discrete to continuous spaces using low-rank kernel approximations. While technically sound and non-trivial, the practical applicability of the main result is not fully demonstrated, and certain aspects could benefit from further clarification and refinement.
