In this work, the authors propose a novel blind deconvolution algorithm that achieves impressive performance for both uniform and non-uniform blind deconvolution tasks. They present a thorough and convincing analysis of the factors contributing to the effectiveness of their approach. The paper includes extensive experimental comparisons with state-of-the-art algorithms for both uniform and non-uniform scenarios. The writing is clear, concise, and well-structured. I consider this to be a meaningful and valuable contribution to the field of blind deconvolution.
It would be valuable for the authors to discuss how their proposed method compares to the variational deblurring algorithm of Levin et al. [15], which also employs marginalization over x to estimate the blur kernel. Interestingly, the authors' formulation begins with an even simpler prior than the heavy-tailed prior used by Levin et al. However, unlike the fixed variances in Levin et al., the authors introduce spatially varying hyper-parameters for the variances. Could this be the key distinction driving the improved performance? Overall, this paper presents an innovative and noteworthy algorithm for blind deconvolution.
