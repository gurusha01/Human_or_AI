The paper investigates convex calibrated surrogates for consistency, specifically constructing a least-squares surrogate loss that can be calibrated for ranking problems involving a low-rank target loss matrix. The findings appear to be both novel and intriguing. Given that ranking is a widely studied topic, the results have the potential to be of interest to the NIPS audience.
That said, the motivation for focusing on a low-rank target loss matrix could be more clearly articulated. While the paper explores convex calibrated surrogates for ranking with a low-rank loss matrix and presents seemingly novel contributions, the rationale for emphasizing the low-rank assumption requires stronger justification. My confidence in this review is limited, as I lack direct research experience in the area of ranking.
