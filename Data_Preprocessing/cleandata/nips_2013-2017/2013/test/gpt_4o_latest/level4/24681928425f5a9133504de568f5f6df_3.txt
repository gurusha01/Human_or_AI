This paper introduces a novel method for unsupervised learning of the structure of AND-OR grammars. Unlike prior methods, which separately search for AND and OR operations, this approach identifies unified AND-OR fragments. The proposed method efficiently computes the value of a new AND-OR fragment using a set of sufficient statistics. The approach is evaluated across multiple tasks, including parsing events and visual objects.
Overall, this is a solid paper. The problem addressed is significant, and the proposed approach is both innovative and well-motivated. The algorithm appears to be technically sound, although I was unable to verify the supplemental derivations. There are, however, a few points that I found unclear, which may reflect my limited time for a detailed reading. I recommend the authors clarify these aspects: First, it is not evident whether the "surrogate measure" of likelihood gain is an approximate or exact metric. Second, it is unclear whether the method can extend to learning fragments with arity greater than 2 or if it is restricted to grammars in "Chomsky normal form."
My primary concerns lie with the experimental section. I found it difficult to understand several aspects, including the specific procedures, how examples were represented, and what was ultimately learned. The paper seems to target an audience deeply familiar with recent visual-grammar research, particularly from S. C. Zhu's group. For such readers, the experimental details and results may be more accessible and meaningful. However, for those less familiar with this prior work, the experimental section is harder to follow. While I acknowledge the constraints of the NIPS format, the authors could leverage supplementary materials to provide additional details and concrete illustrations of the experiments if the paper is accepted.
In particular, I would have appreciated examples of interesting structures discovered in the learned grammars. The paper sets up the importance of grammars and structure learning effectively, but it is somewhat disappointing that the results are presented solely in quantitative terms. While the quantitative results are satisfactory on their own, they are not especially compelling or insightful. The paper would be more engaging if the authors could demonstrate that their approach discovers meaningful structures and that these structures are more interesting compared to those learned by competing methods.
In summary, this is an intriguing paper on unsupervised learning of AND-OR grammars. While I found the work promising, I struggled to follow the experiments and interpret the results, as the paper heavily builds on prior work (primarily from Zhu's UCLA group) that I am less familiar with. If accepted, I strongly encourage the authors to include supplementary materials with detailed explanations and illustrative examples of the experiments and the structures learned.
