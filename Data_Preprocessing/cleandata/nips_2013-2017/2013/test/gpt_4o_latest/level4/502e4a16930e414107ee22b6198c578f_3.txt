This paper presents a theoretical analysis of two variants of policy iteration. The analysis enhances the known worst-case iteration complexity by O(log(n)) in one case and by a constant factor of 2 in the other. Additionally, the authors extend their analysis to one variant applied to deterministic MDPs, achieving an improvement in iteration complexity by O(n).
I cannot recommend this paper for acceptance in its current state. The exposition is overly rushed, and the improved bounds, while technically correct, are not particularly compelling. Although the authors claim that their proof techniques hold scientific value, this is difficult to discern clearly from the paper.
The proof techniques used to improve the first two bounds are closely aligned with prior work. While the proofs in the deterministic MDP setting appear more original, there are significant issues: (a) key terms such as transient and recurrent are not defined, and (b) the authors acknowledge that the assumptions underlying their proofs are overly restrictive. As a result, it is challenging to assess the correctness and practical applicability of their results.
The authors need to provide stronger motivation for this work and articulate their contributions more clearly and effectively.

- Line 85: \pi' is not used inside the max.  
- Line 115: "convergen" should be corrected.  
- Line 125: "observtation" should be corrected.  
- Line 134: "mentionned" should be corrected.  
- Footnote 6: This is not immediately clear; consider moving it to the appendix.  
- Line 177: "Sherman-Morrisson" should be corrected.  
- Line 180: This statement is not immediately obvious, though it seems plausible.  
- Line 182: Provide an explanation for the conjectures.  
- Line 233: Define transient and recurrent.  
- Line 277: Use "appendix" instead of "appdx."  
- Line 292: "mentionned" and "developped" should be corrected.  
After considering the authors' feedback and discussing with other reviewers, I recognize that my initial assessment may have been overly critical. In future revisions, I suggest the authors place greater emphasis on the contributions embedded within their proofs to assist readers who may struggle to extract these insights. However, I still recommend rejecting this paper, as it does not offer significantly improved bounds or clearly innovative proof techniques.
