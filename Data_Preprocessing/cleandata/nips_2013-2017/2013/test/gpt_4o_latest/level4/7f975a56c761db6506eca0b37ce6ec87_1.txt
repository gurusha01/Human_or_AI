The paper presents provably efficient algorithms for k-means and k-median clustering in a distributed setting.
The primary emphasis of the work is on reducing communication costs within distributed networks. While I am not deeply familiar with the existing literature, the paper appears to introduce a novel concept of distributed coresets, which enables clustering algorithms that significantly and provably improve the state-of-the-art communication complexity.
Current methods typically rely on approximating coresets by combining local coresets through union operations. The central contribution of this paper lies in its innovative construction of distributed coresets, which deviates from the union-based approach and could be of standalone interest. The theoretical framework is grounded in the concept of the dimension of the function space and the sampling lemma.
Additionally, the paper includes a thorough experimental evaluation, demonstrating that the proposed algorithms outperform existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of communication complexity, thereby corroborating the theoretical claims.
However, one limitation is that the experiments do not compare the clustering accuracy of the algorithms (e.g., under the same communication budget). Overall, this is a strong contribution to the field of distributed clustering, offering robust theoretical insights and experimental validation.
