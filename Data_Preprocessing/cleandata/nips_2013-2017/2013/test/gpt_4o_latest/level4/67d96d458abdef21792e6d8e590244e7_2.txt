This paper presents a method for non-uniform (space-varying) blind deconvolution. The approach is heavily influenced by ref [26]. Specifically, the authors propose solving eq. 9, which closely resembles eqs. 26 and 27 in ref [26], using the upper bound derived in eq. 7, which constitutes one of the novel contributions. However, the analysis of the prior's effects is conducted on the original cost function. The analysis concludes that the proposed prior adaptively adjusts the concavity/convexity of the image-blur prior based on the magnitude of local image gradients and the L2 norm of the blur. When the blur at a pixel has a high L2 norm (up to 1), it corresponds to a Dirac delta, indicating that the image is already sharp. In such cases, a highly concave prior that strongly enforces gradient sparsity is beneficial. Conversely, when the blur resembles an averaging kernel, the prior becomes less concave, favoring reduced sensitivity to fine details and increased sensitivity to coarse details.
Quality
The algorithm and its underlying theory are both intriguing and well-founded. While the paper dedicates significant effort to explaining the effects of the proposed prior, there are several aspects that remain unexplored:  
1. The analysis is based on the original cost function (eq. 9), but the impact of the bound in eq. 7, which represents the main novelty of the algorithm, is not addressed.  
2. An analysis of the uniform case would be valuable, as it would complement the experiments shown in Fig. 2.  
3. Considering the findings in ref [16], it would be beneficial to include a discussion on how this prior overcomes the limitations of classical priors. Specifically, it would be interesting to demonstrate whether the blurry image & no blur solution is no longer a global minimumâ€”or, ideally, no longer even a local minimum.
Clarity
Overall, the authors provide a clear explanation of their approach. However, there is a noticeable gap in the logical flow of Section 3. For instance, the connection between eq. 7 (the approximation) and cost function eq. 9 is not clearly established. In fact, eq. 7 is not directly used later in the paper and is only referenced in the supplementary material. This section would benefit from revision or rewriting.  
Additionally, the use of `w` for weights and `\hat{w}` for blur kernels is confusing. Despite the relationship described in eq. 8, their meanings differ significantly. Consider renaming one of these variables (e.g., using `hi` for `\hat{w}i` would be more intuitive).  
Finally, eq. 6 may contain errors: verify whether the exponent `T` should be `-1` and ensure that a product over `i` is not missing under the integral.
Originality
The originality of this work is constrained by the extensive contributions of ref [26]. A discussion of the differences between this work and ref [26] would have been valuable. In my view, the originality lies in the introduction of a bound (eq. 7) and an explanation of the adaptive prior's behavior (via Theorem 1). However, the explanation is somewhat imprecise due to the complexity of the prior.
Significance
The exploration and development of novel priors for blind deconvolution are crucial, and this paper builds upon the new direction introduced by ref [26]. Furthermore, given the strong experimental performance of the proposed algorithm, this approach warrants attention.
Overall
This paper introduces some novel contributions: a practical bound for a cost function that simplifies implementation and an analysis that elucidates the general behavior of the adaptive prior. The algorithm's performance is commendable.
