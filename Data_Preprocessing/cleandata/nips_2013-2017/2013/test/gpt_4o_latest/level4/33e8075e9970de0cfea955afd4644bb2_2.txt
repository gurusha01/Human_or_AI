This study seeks to establish a connection between the signal processing theory of wavelets and deep neural networks. While the work represents only a modest step toward this objective, it is valuable in showcasing the feasibility of the proposed approach.
The exploration of relationships between wavelet construction and deep auto-encoders is particularly intriguing.
However, the details are challenging to follow, and I strongly recommend significantly improving the presentation to enhance clarity and readability.
