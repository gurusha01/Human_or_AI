This paper introduces novel distributed algorithms for clustering methods that represent clusters using centers. The proposed algorithms demonstrate a reduction in communication overhead. Additionally, at the same communication cost, the methods achieve improved clustering objectives on both synthetic data and three UCI datasets.
The paper is highly technical. Providing more detailed explanations of the derivation process and the significance of the theorems would enhance clarity.
I have some reservations about the approximation quality of the coreset as dimensionality increases. The datasets used in the current experiments are predominantly low-dimensional.
The title is overly broad. The work specifically focuses on certain clustering methods that utilize centers and coresets. Furthermore, the term "graphs" is ambiguous and does not effectively highlight the key contributions or unique aspects of the work. Improved methods for center-based distributed clustering are proposed. The paper is highly technical.
