This paper makes a commendable contribution by refining previous bounds on policy iteration, a problem that has seen renewed progress after decades of limited advancements. While the results themselves are solid, they are not groundbreaking. However, the paper stands out by offering concise proofs for key findings and providing clear, insightful summaries in cases where the proofs are more elaborate. The writing quality is exceptional, making the paper a pleasure to read.
Minor comments:
Line 97.5: at least on state -> at least one state  
Line 106: all iteration k -> all iterations k  
Line 114.5: convergen often occur -> convergence often occurs  
Line 203: on path -> on paths  
Overall, this paper represents a modest improvement on prior policy iteration results and is exceptionally well-written.
