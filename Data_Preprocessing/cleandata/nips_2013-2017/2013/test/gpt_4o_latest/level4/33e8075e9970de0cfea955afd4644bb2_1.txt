The paper introduces a method for constructing a linear wavelet transform on weighted graphs using the lifting scheme, which possesses several advantageous properties: 1) linear complexity in both memory and time relative to the graph size, 2) adaptability to specific signal classes, 3) exact analysis and synthesis enabling perfect signal reconstruction, and 4) efficient training facilitated by its similarity to deep auto-encoder networks.
The manuscript is well-presented, with a clear structure and polished writing. Following a comprehensive overview and introduction, the authors provide a detailed derivation of their method and validate its effectiveness and versatility through a series of experiments.
While the proposed approach builds upon prior work, it makes a significant and non-trivial contribution to the domain of graph-based signal processing by introducing a general-purpose wavelet transform with multiple desirable properties.
The authors establish an intriguing link between wavelet construction on graphs and auto-encoder networks. This connection is likely to inspire further advancements in this research direction and may serve as a versatile tool for analyzing signals on graphs.
Additional comments:  
* It would be helpful if the authors could clarify what is meant by "sufficient" in Section 4.5. For a general problem, how can one determine the number of eigenvectors that should be considered?  
* What do the colorbars in Figures 4 and 5 represent?  
* In Section 4.7, revise "It is also possible o" to "It is also possible to."  
Overall, the paper presents a significant general-purpose wavelet transform for signals on weighted graphs, characterized by several advantageous properties. Its connection to auto-encoder networks is particularly noteworthy and is likely to stimulate further research in this area.
