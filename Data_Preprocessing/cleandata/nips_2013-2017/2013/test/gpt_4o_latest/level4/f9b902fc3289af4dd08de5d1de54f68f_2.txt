This paper introduces a novel discriminative clustering algorithm inspired by the mean shift method and the concept of identifying local maxima of the density ratio (i.e., the ratio of positive to negative point densities). The authors draw motivation from recent works [4,8,16] that aim to discover distinctive mid-level parts or patches for various recognition tasks. As stated in the Introduction, "The idea is to search for clusters of image patches that are both 1) representative... and 2) visually discriminative. Unfortunately, finding patches that fit these criteria remain rather ad-hoc and poorly understood. While most current algorithms use a discriminative clustering-like procedure, they generally don't optimize elements for these criteria, or do so in an indirect, procedural way that is difficult to analyze. Hence, our goal in this work is to quantify the terms 'representative' and 'discriminative', and show that that a generalization of the well-known, well-understood Mean-Shift algorithm can produce visual elements that are more representative and discriminative than those of previous approaches." I find this motivation compelling and appreciate the formulation of discriminative clustering as a density ratio maximization problem.
The derivation of the clustering objective begins promisingly on pages 2-3, but by page 4, it takes several confusing steps that seem to deviate significantly from the original formulation. For example, in lines 188-190, the authors comment on eq. (5), stating, "representing a patch multiple times is treated the same as representing different patches. Ideally, none of the patches should be double-counted." This leads to the introduction of "sharing coefficients" to enforce competition between clusters. However, isn't "double-counting" essential for accurately estimating the local density of patches? Specifically, the density should increase when more similar patches are located near a given point in the feature space. Alternatively, does "double-counting" refer to a different concept? This requires clarification. Furthermore, the discussion following eq. (6) introduces heuristic criteria for setting the sharing coefficients, and additional heuristics are introduced to handle overlapping patches (lines 199-211). Consequently, by the time the final objective (eq. 7) is presented, it appears to diverge significantly from the original formulation (eq. 1). While the authors criticize the heuristic nature of prior approaches such as [4,8,16], their own method ultimately relies on similarly heuristic steps.
Strengths  
+ The idea of deriving a discriminative clustering algorithm by maximizing the density ratio is both novel and compelling.  
+ The experimental results are a key strength of the paper. As shown in Table 1, the proposed method outperforms even recent results from [8] on the MIT Indoor Scene dataset (though see concerns below).  
Weaknesses  
- The derivation of the clustering objective involves several poorly explained steps (see above). The authors should provide stronger motivation for these steps and clarify their relationship to related methods. For instance, while the paper is titled "Discriminative Mean Shift," the connection between the proposed method and the traditional mean shift algorithm is unclear. The original mean shift algorithm is inherently local (each point in the feature space identifies its nearest local maximum), whereas the proposed method appears to globally optimize cluster centers by introducing a "competition" criterion. If this difference stems from maximizing the density ratio rather than local density, the authors should elaborate. Additionally, the final objective (eq. 7) has a margin-based structure, and the paper should discuss its similarity (or lack thereof) to other margin-based clustering approaches.  
- The paper lacks citations to related work on discriminative clustering, such as:  
  Linli Xu, James Neufeld, Bryce Larson, and Dale Schuurmans, Maximum margin clustering, NIPS 2005.  
- The proposed optimization algorithm does not include any theoretical guarantees (lines 257-259).  
- While the experimental results are strong, the reasons for the proposed method's superior performance over recent, well-engineered systems (e.g., [8]) are unclear. Is this improvement due to the clustering objective itself or to other implementation details described in lines 406-422? Given the many potential differences between the proposed approach and the baselines (e.g., feature extraction, pre- and post-processing, classification), the paper does not provide sufficient evidence to attribute the performance gains to the proposed method. Additionally, some claims in the experimental section lack quantitative or qualitative support, such as the assertion that "small objects within the scene are often more useful features than global scene statistics: for instance, shoe shops are similar to other stores in global layout, but they mostly contain shoes."  
Recommendation  
This paper is above the acceptance threshold primarily due to its strong experimental results. However, the derivation of the clustering method is not clearly presented and relies on several poorly motivated heuristic steps.
