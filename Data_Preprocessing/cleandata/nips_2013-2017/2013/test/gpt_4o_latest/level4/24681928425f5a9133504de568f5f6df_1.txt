This paper introduces a method for learning the structure of stochastic And-Or grammars. While the authors claim that this approach "generalizes" prior work on structure learning, it is, in fact, a specific case that simplifies the problem, making it more tractable. This is a valid and reasonable perspective, and the paper provides a meaningful contribution. However, I would not recommend framing the problem as more general than the structure learning challenges typically encountered in NLP. The core algorithm is well-designed and performs effectively when benchmarked against other grammar induction methods.
The experimental evaluation, however, could be strengthened by including additional comparisons with alternative approaches. Specifically, the method proposed by Stolcke and Omohondro (reference 14) appears applicable to both tasks and would serve as a valuable baseline for comparison. Overall, this is a strong paper that presents a method for learning the structure of a specific class of grammars.
