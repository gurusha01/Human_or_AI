Summary: This paper introduces a two-step approach for learning cross-lingual topic representations by leveraging matrix completion and latent semantic analysis techniques. The matrix completion problem is solved using a projected gradient descent algorithm. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses both monolingual and cross-lingual baselines in sentiment analysis tasks conducted on the parallel Amazon review dataset. Learning curves across varying amounts of unlabeled data reveal that the algorithm effectively learns accurate cross-lingual topic representations even with a relatively small quantity of parallel data.
Quality: The experiments are comprehensive and well-designed to substantiate the claims. The proposed two-step learning approach is systematically compared against two baselines (plain bag-of-words and cross-lingual LSA) as well as two state-of-the-art cross-lingual dimensionality reduction methods.
Clarity: The paper is well-structured and easy to follow. All parameters, along with their selection criteria, are clearly documented, making the results reproducible. A minor suggestion would be to elaborate on the motivation for employing matrix completion in the Introduction section, as it is currently detailed in Section 3.
Originality: While cross-lingual representation learning is a well-studied area, the application of matrix completion to this problem is novel. The proposed algorithm demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods in the literature, underscoring its originality.
Significance: The two-step approach consistently achieves higher performance than the baselines. This work highlights that matrix completion can serve as an effective preprocessing step for cross-lingual sentiment classification tasks and suggests that this formulation may be applicable to other tasks as well. The paper presents a novel two-step method for cross-lingual topic representation learning, combining matrix completion and latent semantic analysis. Experimental results confirm that the method outperforms monolingual and cross-lingual baselines, including a state-of-the-art approach, while maintaining robustness across different sizes of unlabeled parallel data.
