This paper proposes a method for approximate sampling from specific parametric forms of a continuous-state determinantal point process. The approach utilizes an eigen-decomposition (applied to the dual kernel matrix rather than the kernel function) and relies on the kernel function having particular structures and decompositions.
In the experimental evaluation, the authors show that integrating this method with a mixture density model leads to improved test performance by encouraging the formation of more diverse clusters.
The paper is well-written, and the results are compelling. The topic is relevant and of interest to the machine learning community.
A few minor points for consideration:
- The notation for \( n \) (above Equation 16) is unclear. While I believe I have understood the paper overall, the meaning of \( n_j \) is ambiguous.  
- The figure references in the text are inconsistent (e.g., in Section 5, Figure 5 is mentioned).  
Overall, the paper presents an intriguing approach for sampling from a continuous DPP. The results clearly demonstrate its practical utility. A strong contribution.
