The manuscript tackles the challenge of single image blind deconvolution in the presence of non-uniform blur induced by camera shake. The authors introduce a two-step framework: first, estimating the motion blur, followed by recovering the latent image via non-blind deconvolution. This two-step approach aligns with standard practices in blind deconvolution. The primary contribution of the paper lies in the development of a Bayesian inference strategy for motion blur estimation. Through a series of experiments, the authors validate their approach and benchmark its performance against other state-of-the-art methods. The mathematical derivations appear robust, and the proposed framework is claimed to exhibit several advantageous properties. However, while these properties are discussed in some depth in the latter part of Section 4, the absence of empirical evidence to substantiate these claims weakens the argument. Additionally, the authors fail to draw connections to other recent works that adopt similar methodologies, particularly [15] and the missing reference:  
S.D. Babacan, et al., "Bayesian Blind Deconvolution with General Sparse Image Priors," ECCV 2012  
Furthermore, another relevant reference is overlooked:  
R. Kohler, et al., "Recording and playback of camera shake: Benchmarking blind deconvolution with a real-world database," ECCV 2012  
Incorporating this reference would enable the authors to benchmark their method against other state-of-the-art single image blind deblurring techniques for both uniform and non-uniform blur. Moreover, several questions remain unanswered (outlined below), which detracts from the overall quality of the paper.  
The manuscript is well-structured and clearly written. However, Section 4 would benefit from being divided into smaller subsections, as it currently feels overly lengthy. Unfortunately, some critical details are omitted (e.g., the specific algorithm used for the final non-blind deconvolution, as noted in the comments below), which hampers the paper's overall clarity.  
The theoretical foundation of the proposed approach builds upon prior work [19,26], but its application to single image blind deconvolution appears to be novel.  
While the proposed algorithm seems to achieve results comparable to state-of-the-art methods, the insights provided are limited. It remains unclear under what conditions the proposed method outperforms others and why. The lack of connections to recent relevant work (as mentioned above) and the failure to contextualize the contribution diminish its overall significance.  
Further comments:  
* What specific method is used for the final non-blind deconvolution?  
* The authors claim the approach is "parameter-free." Does this also apply to the kernel size?  
* Section 4 mentions that initializing with a large $\lambda$ and its subsequent evolution stabilizes the deconvolution process. A plot illustrating the evolution of $\lambda$ during motion blur estimation would be valuable.  
* What basis (i.e., $B$ in Eq.(8)) is used for the experiments involving non-uniform blur? Is $w^\bar_i$ computed for every pixel? If not, how are the evaluation points selected?  
* The use of a coarse-to-fine scheme is not immediately evident from the main text. Clarifying this would improve the exposition.  
* What are the typical run-times for the proposed method?  
* Large blur poses challenges even for state-of-the-art methods. How does the performance of the proposed method scale with kernel size?  
* The ringing artifacts in Whyte's results in Fig. 4 primarily stem from the final non-blind deconvolution (as noted in his presentation slides). It would be more appropriate to use the results published on the accompanying project webpage (http://www.di.ens.fr/willow/research/deblurring/).  
* The correct citation for the efficient filter flow framework mentioned in Section 2 is:  
M. Hirsch, et al., "Efficient filter flow for space-variant multiframe blind deconvolution," CVPR 2010.  
* What are the limitations of the proposed method?  
The paper presents an intriguing Bayesian approach to motion blur estimation. However, its failure to connect to relevant prior work and the lack of quantitative evaluation for camera shake removal with non-uniform blur significantly diminish its impact and value to the community.
