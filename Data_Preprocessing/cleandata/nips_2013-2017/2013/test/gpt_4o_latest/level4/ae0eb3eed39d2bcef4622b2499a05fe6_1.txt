The author primarily aims to propose parallel algorithms for a clustering method (OFL, which extends DP-means) and a feature selection method. These algorithms are subsequently integrated into an optimistic concurrency control framework, originally introduced in the parallel database community.
The proposed algorithm appears to align well with the MapReduce paradigm, where the map stage corresponds to parallel operations and the reduce stage represents serial operations.
The theoretical contributions add limited value, as most of the analysis is relatively straightforward. Additionally, the experimental results are underwhelming, with a speedup of only 4x on 8 processors.
--- Update ---
The main issues with the paper are evident: the algorithms appear overly ad hoc for the presented demonstration, and the performance evaluation is weak. If the paper were reframed as a parallelized DP-means algorithm with a more detailed discussion on optimistic concurrency control, it would be significantly improved. However, the algorithms remain too ad hoc, and their performance is questionable.
