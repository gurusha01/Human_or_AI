This paper addresses the challenge of discovering mid-level features through the use of a discriminative mean-shift approach. The authors adapt the traditional mean-shift algorithm to a discriminative framework, enabling its application for identifying mid-level patches. Additionally, the paper introduces a more systematic method for evaluating mid-level patch discovery results using purity-coverage curves, demonstrating that their proposed algorithm outperforms existing methods based on these metrics. Furthermore, their approach achieves significant performance gains over existing methods on the widely-used MIT 67-scene dataset when applied without Fisher vectors, with slight improvements observed when combined with them. While the overall performance improvement compared to BoP+IFV [8] is a notable 2.7%, the performance using mid-level patches alone shows a substantial increase compared to BoP [8] alone, specifically 46% versus 64%.
In summary, the application of the discriminative mean-shift algorithm in this detection-like context is innovative, and the results are highly encouraging. The paper is well-written, with thorough analysis of the results. Therefore, I recommend accepting this paper for presentation at NIPS.
Minor concerns and suggestions:
- Could the authors provide details on the running time of their algorithm and compare it to existing methods?  
- Will the source code be made publicly available after publication?  
- It may be helpful to cite the following paper due to the shared terminology and to clarify the differences:  
  Wang, Junqiu, and Yasushi Yagi. "Discriminative mean shift tracking with auxiliary particles." Computer Visionâ€“ACCV 2007. Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2007. 576-585.  
- It would be interesting to evaluate this approach on the SUN dataset, where object segmentation is available, to identify object categories frequently selected by the mid-level patches. This could reveal potential semantic structure in the discovered elements.  
Overall, the paper presents a novel approach to mid-level visual element discovery using discriminative mean-shift, with promising results and a well-executed analysis.
