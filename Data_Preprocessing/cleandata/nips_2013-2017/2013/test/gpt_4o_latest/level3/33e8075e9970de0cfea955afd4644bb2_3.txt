The paper presents a novel method for constructing adaptive wavelets on weighted graphs using the lifting scheme and unsupervised training via a deep auto-encoder network. The authors address a significant limitation in existing graph wavelet methods, which rely solely on the graph structure and do not adapt to the specific class of signals being processed. By leveraging the lifting scheme and tying it to the structure of auto-encoders, the proposed method enables the creation of wavelets that are both adaptive to the signal class and computationally efficient, with linear complexity in graph size. Experimental results demonstrate improved sparsity and generalization on both synthetic and real-world datasets, showcasing the method's potential for applications such as signal reconstruction and semi-supervised learning.
Strengths
The paper makes a substantial contribution to the field of graph signal processing by introducing a highly original approach to adaptive wavelet construction. The use of the lifting scheme, combined with auto-encoder training, is a novel and elegant solution that bridges the gap between traditional wavelet theory and modern machine learning techniques. The method is technically sound, with a clear theoretical foundation and well-designed experiments that validate its effectiveness. The authors demonstrate the method's versatility across diverse datasets, including graph-based temperature data, road networks, and even image processing tasks. The linear complexity of the algorithm is a significant practical advantage, making it scalable to large graphs. Additionally, the paper is well-written and accessible, with detailed explanations of the lifting scheme, optimization process, and experimental setup.
Weaknesses
Despite its strengths, the paper has some limitations. The sensitivity of the method to the hierarchical partitioning of the graph is underexplored. While the authors use spectral clustering for partitioning, the impact of alternative methods or suboptimal partitions on wavelet quality is not thoroughly analyzed. This is particularly important since the quality of the partitioning directly affects the Haar wavelets and, consequently, the adaptive wavelets. Another notable weakness is the lack of direct comparisons with other state-of-the-art graph wavelet methods for tasks like signal compression or reconstruction on irregular graphs. Such comparisons would provide a clearer picture of the proposed method's relative performance and practical utility. Finally, while the paper is generally clear, additional discussion on the limitations of spectral clustering and its scalability would enhance the manuscript.
Recommendation
This paper represents a significant advancement in the construction of adaptive wavelets for graph signals and is likely to inspire further research at the intersection of wavelet theory and deep learning. However, addressing the noted weaknesses—particularly the lack of comparative evaluations and sensitivity analysis—would strengthen the paper's impact. I recommend acceptance, provided the authors address these concerns in a revised version.
