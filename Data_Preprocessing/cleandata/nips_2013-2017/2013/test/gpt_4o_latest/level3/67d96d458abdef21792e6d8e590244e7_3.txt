The paper presents a novel approach to single-image blind deconvolution for non-uniform blur caused by camera shake, employing a two-step procedure: motion blur estimation and non-blind deconvolution. The primary contribution is a theoretically grounded Bayesian inference strategy for motion blur estimation, which introduces a spatially-adaptive image penalty that discounts regions with large blur or weak edges. While the proposed method is innovative and shows promise, the paper has several critical shortcomings that limit its impact and clarity.
Strengths:  
The paper is well-structured and clearly written, making it accessible to readers. The proposed method is novel in its parameter-free design and its ability to adaptively regularize based on local blur characteristics without relying on heuristics or trade-off parameters. The theoretical analysis of the cost function and its properties is rigorous and provides valuable insights into the algorithm's robustness. Empirical results suggest that the method performs comparably or better than state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in avoiding ringing artifacts and preserving fine details.
Weaknesses:  
Despite its theoretical rigor, the paper lacks sufficient empirical evidence to substantiate its claims. Quantitative evaluations for non-uniform blur and camera shake removal are missing, making it difficult to assess the method's performance objectively. The absence of run-time analysis and scalability discussions, especially for large blur kernels, further weakens the paper's practical relevance. Additionally, the claim of being "parameter-free" is unclear, particularly regarding kernel size, and the evolution of the noise variance parameter ($\lambda$) is not adequately explained. 
The paper fails to connect its contributions to prior work effectively. Key references, such as those from ECCV 2012, are omitted, and the correct citation for the efficient filter flow framework (M. Hirsch et al., CVPR 2010) is missing. This lack of contextualization undermines the novelty and benchmarking of the proposed approach. Furthermore, Section 4, while theoretically rich, is overly lengthy and lacks clarity on implementation details, such as the specific algorithm used for non-blind deconvolution.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:  
Pro:  
- Novel Bayesian inference strategy with spatially-adaptive regularization.  
- Theoretically sound and transparent cost function.  
- Promising empirical results on real-world images.  
Con:  
- Insufficient quantitative evaluation and empirical validation.  
- Missing connections to prior work and key references.  
- Lack of clarity on implementation details and practical limitations.  
- No discussion of the method's limitations or failure cases.  
Recommendation:  
While the paper introduces an interesting and potentially impactful approach, the lack of empirical rigor, missing connections to prior work, and unclear implementation details significantly detract from its contribution. I recommend a weak rejection, encouraging the authors to address these issues in a revised submission. Specifically, they should include quantitative evaluations, clarify the "parameter-free" claim, provide run-time and scalability analyses, and situate their work more effectively within the existing literature.
