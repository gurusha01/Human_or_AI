This paper presents a novel approach to designing convex, calibrated surrogate losses for ranking problems with low-rank target loss matrices. The authors explicitly construct a least-squares type surrogate loss that operates on a surrogate target space with dimensionality at most the rank of the target loss matrix. They demonstrate the utility of this result by applying it to various subset ranking problems, including Precision@q, Expected Rank Utility (ERU), Mean Average Precision (MAP), and Pairwise Disagreement (PD), yielding new theoretical insights and practical surrogates for these widely used ranking metrics.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Relevance: The explicit construction of low-dimensional convex calibrated surrogates is a significant contribution to the field of machine learning, particularly in ranking problems. The results are novel and address gaps in prior work, such as the lack of explicit constructions in Ramaswamy and Agarwal (2016). The paper is highly relevant to the NeurIPS audience, given the popularity of ranking problems in information retrieval and recommendation systems.
2. Technical Rigor: The theoretical results are well-supported by rigorous proofs, and the authors provide clear connections to existing literature. The use of low-rank structure to reduce surrogate dimensionality is both elegant and practical.
3. Applications to Ranking Metrics: The paper successfully applies its general result to a variety of ranking metrics, providing new calibrated surrogates for Precision@q, ERU, MAP, and PD losses. These contributions are particularly impactful, as they address open problems and computational challenges in the design of surrogates for these metrics.
4. Clarity of Presentation: The paper is well-organized, with a logical progression from the general theoretical result to specific applications. The inclusion of algorithmic details (e.g., Algorithm 1 for PD loss) enhances the practical utility of the work.
Weaknesses:
1. Motivation for Low-Rank Focus: While the paper emphasizes the utility of low-rank loss matrices, the motivation for this focus could be better justified. Are low-rank structures common in real-world ranking problems, or is this primarily a theoretical convenience? Additional discussion or empirical evidence would strengthen the paper.
2. Computational Challenges: For some metrics, such as MAP and PD, the mappings required to transform surrogate predictions back to the original space involve computationally hard problems (e.g., quadratic assignment or minimum weighted feedback arc set). While the authors propose alternative mappings under specific conditions, the practical feasibility of these surrogates in large-scale settings remains unclear.
3. Limited Experimental Validation: The paper focuses on theoretical contributions but does not include empirical results to validate the practical performance of the proposed surrogates. Experimental evaluation on real-world ranking datasets would provide valuable insights into their utility.
Recommendation:
This paper makes a strong theoretical contribution to the design of convex calibrated surrogates for ranking problems, addressing important gaps in prior work. However, the lack of empirical validation and limited discussion of practical implications slightly detract from its overall impact. I recommend acceptance, provided the authors address the motivation for low-rank matrices and discuss the computational feasibility of their methods in more depth.
Confidence:
My confidence in this review is moderate. While I am familiar with the general topic of surrogate losses, I lack deep expertise in ranking problems, which may limit my ability to fully assess the technical nuances of the paper.
