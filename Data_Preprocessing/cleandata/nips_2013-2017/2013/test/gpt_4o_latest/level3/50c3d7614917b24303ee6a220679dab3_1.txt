This paper extends determinantal point process (DPP) sampling from discrete to continuous spaces by leveraging low-rank kernel approximations, specifically Nystr√∂m and random Fourier features (RFF). The authors propose an efficient "dual sampler" for continuous DPPs, which relies on these approximations, and also develop a Gibbs sampling scheme for k-DPPs. The paper explores applications of continuous DPPs in repulsive mixture modeling and diverse pose synthesis, demonstrating the utility of the proposed methods.
Strengths:
1. Technical Soundness: The paper is technically correct and builds on established methods in low-rank kernel approximations and DPPs. The derivation of the dual sampler and the Gibbs sampling scheme is rigorous, and the authors provide sufficient theoretical grounding for their algorithms.
2. Clarity: The paper is generally well-written and organized, with clear explanations of the challenges in extending DPPs to continuous spaces and how the proposed methods address these issues. The inclusion of detailed equations and algorithms enhances reproducibility.
3. Originality: The extension of DPP sampling to continuous spaces using low-rank approximations is novel and addresses a significant gap in the literature. The use of DPPs as priors in mixture models and for pose synthesis is innovative and demonstrates practical utility.
4. Applications: The empirical results in Section 5 confirm the repulsive properties of DPPs, while the applications in Sections 6 and 7 showcase the potential of continuous DPPs in diverse domains, such as clustering and motion synthesis.
Weaknesses:
1. Significance of Main Result: The significance of the dual sampler is unclear, as it is not directly utilized in the mixture model application (Section 5). Instead, the Gibbs sampler is used, which somewhat undermines the central contribution of the paper.
2. Alternative Methods: In Section 6, the use of DPPs for pose diversity is compelling, but the authors do not adequately compare their approach to alternative diversity-promoting methods, such as hardcore processes or farthest point clustering. This limits the broader impact of the work.
3. Empirical Limitations: The empirical evaluation is somewhat limited. For instance, the mixture model experiments rely on small datasets, and the results could benefit from additional baselines and larger-scale evaluations.
4. Minor Issues: Some definitions, such as Equation (2), are unclear and could benefit from further elaboration. There are also citation inaccuracies (e.g., [11]) and limited test observations (e.g., line 304), which detract from the overall polish of the paper.
Recommendation:
While the paper is technically sound and demonstrates clear innovation, the lack of direct utilization of the main result in key applications and limited empirical evaluation reduce its overall impact. The authors should clarify the significance of the dual sampler, provide stronger comparisons to alternative methods, and expand their experimental analysis. If these issues are addressed, the paper has the potential to make a meaningful contribution to the field.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Novel extension of DPP sampling to continuous spaces.
- Rigorous theoretical development and technically correct methods.
- Promising applications in mixture modeling and pose synthesis.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Limited significance of the main result in practical applications.
- Insufficient comparison to alternative methods.
- Empirical evaluation could be more comprehensive.
Overall, this paper is a valuable contribution but requires additional work to fully realize its potential.
