This paper presents a significant contribution to distributed clustering by introducing efficient algorithms for k-means and k-median clustering that focus on minimizing communication costs in distributed networks. The key innovation lies in the concept of distributed coresets, which improves upon existing methods by constructing global coresets in a distributed manner rather than relying on union-based approximations. This approach leads to substantial reductions in communication complexity, particularly in sparse networks with large diameters, where previous methods struggled due to high communication costs.
The theoretical foundation of the proposed method is robust, relying on the dimension of the function space and a sampling lemma to ensure that the constructed coresets provide strong approximation guarantees. The authors also provide a detailed comparison with prior work, highlighting the advantages of their approach in terms of both communication efficiency and scalability. Experimental results on large-scale datasets further validate the method, demonstrating superior communication efficiency compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, particularly under varying network topologies and data distributions.
Strengths:
1. Technical Soundness: The paper is technically rigorous, with well-supported theoretical guarantees and a clear explanation of the distributed coreset construction process.
2. Novelty: The introduction of distributed coresets is a novel and impactful idea that differentiates this work from prior methods.
3. Experimental Validation: The experimental results are comprehensive, covering multiple datasets, network topologies, and partitioning methods. The results consistently show the superiority of the proposed method in terms of communication efficiency.
4. Clarity: The paper is well-organized and clearly written, making it accessible to readers familiar with distributed clustering and coreset construction.
Weaknesses:
1. Accuracy vs. Communication Trade-off: While the paper focuses on communication efficiency, it does not provide a direct comparison of clustering accuracy under the same communication budget across different methods. This omission leaves a gap in understanding the practical trade-offs between communication cost and clustering quality.
2. Limited Discussion of Practical Constraints: The paper assumes no latency in communication and does not address potential real-world constraints, such as network failures or dynamic topologies, which could affect the applicability of the proposed algorithms.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper addresses a critical challenge in distributed clustering and provides a novel, theoretically grounded solution.
- The experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods, making the contribution both practical and impactful.
- The clarity and organization of the paper make it a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the field.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The lack of a direct comparison of clustering accuracy under the same communication budget limits the evaluation of the method's overall effectiveness.
- The assumptions about ideal communication conditions may reduce the practical applicability of the results in real-world distributed systems.
Recommendation: Accept with minor revisions. The authors should address the concern about accuracy comparisons under fixed communication budgets and discuss potential extensions to handle practical constraints in distributed networks. Overall, this paper is a strong contribution to the field of distributed clustering and advances the state of the art in communication-efficient algorithms.
