The paper presents a novel approach to domain adaptation in computer vision by automatically discovering latent domains within datasets, addressing the limitations of equating datasets with domains. The proposed method introduces two key properties—maximum distinctiveness and maximum learnability—to guide the discovery of domains. The authors employ a nonparametric optimization framework to maximize these properties and demonstrate the utility of their approach on object recognition and human activity recognition tasks. This work builds on prior research in domain adaptation and latent domain discovery, such as Hoffman et al. (2012), but distinguishes itself by adopting a nonparametric approach and addressing the test set's heterogeneity.
Strengths:
1. Originality: The paper addresses an underexplored problem of automatically defining domains, which is crucial for improving classifier training in real-world scenarios. The introduction of maximum distinctiveness and maximum learnability as guiding principles is innovative and well-motivated.
2. Experimental Results: The proposed method outperforms both the traditional dataset-as-domain approach and a recent latent domain discovery technique. The results are validated across diverse tasks, including object and action recognition, showcasing the method's generalizability.
3. Clarity of Problem Statement: The paper clearly articulates the limitations of existing practices and the need for automated domain discovery, grounding its contributions in a well-defined problem space.
4. Exploratory Value: Despite some limitations, the work represents a valuable step forward for the research community, offering insights into dataset construction and domain adaptation.
Weaknesses:
1. Optimization Clarity: The integration of the two driving criteria—separability and learnability—lacks clarity. While the optimization framework is described in detail, the interplay between these criteria and their relative importance remains ambiguous.
2. Image Representation: The use of outdated image descriptors (e.g., bag-of-visual-words with SURF features) limits the method's applicability to modern datasets. Adopting more robust representations, such as Fisher Vectors or deep features, could significantly enhance performance.
3. Similarity Measure: The choice of Euclidean distance for comparing histograms is suboptimal. Alternatives like χ² or intersection kernels would be more appropriate and should be considered.
4. Test Set Inclusion: The inclusion of the test set in the reshaping process is intriguing but insufficiently explained. The imputation setting and its implications for real-world applications need further elaboration.
5. Clarity: While the paper is generally well-written, the inclusion of illustrative figures (e.g., visualizations of discovered domains) would greatly enhance comprehension.
Assessment:
The paper presents a novel and impactful contribution to domain adaptation, with strong experimental results and a well-motivated problem statement. However, certain aspects, such as optimization clarity and image representation, require improvement. The work is exploratory in nature but offers significant potential for advancing the state of the art in domain discovery and adaptation.
Recommendation:
Accept with Minor Revisions. The paper's contributions are substantial, but addressing the concerns regarding optimization clarity, image representation, and similarity measures would strengthen its impact. Including illustrative figures and refining the explanation of test set inclusion would further enhance the paper's clarity and accessibility.
