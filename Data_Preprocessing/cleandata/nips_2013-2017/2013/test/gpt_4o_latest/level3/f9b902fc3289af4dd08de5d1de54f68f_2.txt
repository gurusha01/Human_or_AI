Review
This paper introduces a novel discriminative clustering algorithm inspired by mean-shift and density ratio maximization, aimed at discovering mid-level visual elements that are both representative and discriminative. The proposed approach addresses a key challenge in visual element discovery by leveraging weakly labeled datasets and optimizing a density ratio objective to identify visual elements that are maximally discriminative. The authors also propose a new evaluation metric, the Purity-Coverage plot, to analyze and compare visual discovery methods. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on the MIT Scene-67 dataset for scene classification, as well as competitive results on the Paris Street View dataset.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Motivation: The paper proposes a novel extension of the mean-shift algorithm to density ratio estimation, which is a creative and well-motivated approach to discriminative clustering. The focus on weakly supervised learning and mid-level visual elements addresses a timely and important problem in computer vision.
2. Experimental Results: The method achieves strong empirical results, outperforming recent approaches on the MIT Scene-67 dataset. This demonstrates the practical utility of the proposed algorithm in scene classification tasks.
3. Evaluation Framework: The introduction of the Purity-Coverage plot provides a principled way to evaluate visual element discovery methods, which could be a valuable contribution to the field.
4. Scalability: The paper emphasizes the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, which requires only a single pass through the data, making it suitable for large-scale datasets.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity of Derivation: The derivation of the clustering objective is unclear, with several heuristic components that deviate from the original mean-shift formulation. The steps leading to the final objective lack sufficient explanation, making it difficult for readers to fully understand the theoretical underpinnings.
2. Connection to Mean-Shift: While the method is inspired by mean-shift, the connection to the original algorithm is not well-articulated. A clearer explanation of how the proposed method extends or differs from mean-shift would strengthen the paper.
3. Relation to Existing Work: The paper does not adequately discuss related discriminative clustering methods, such as maximum margin clustering. This omission makes it harder to contextualize the contribution within the broader literature.
4. Optimization Guarantees: The optimization algorithm lacks theoretical guarantees, which raises concerns about its robustness and convergence properties.
5. Implementation Details: The paper does not provide sufficient evidence to support claims about the effectiveness of the method or clarify the impact of implementation details on performance. For example, the choice of hyperparameters and their sensitivity are not well-documented.
Recommendation:
While the paper has several weaknesses in terms of clarity, theoretical rigor, and contextualization, its strong experimental results and novel contributions make it a valuable addition to the field. The proposed algorithm demonstrates clear practical benefits and introduces a useful evaluation framework. However, the authors should address the issues with derivation clarity, theoretical guarantees, and related work in a future revision.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Strong experimental results on challenging datasets.
- Novel and well-motivated approach to discriminative clustering.
- Introduction of the Purity-Coverage plot as a new evaluation metric.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Lack of clarity in the derivation of the objective function.
- Insufficient discussion of related work and theoretical guarantees.
- Limited explanation of implementation details and their impact.
Final Decision: Accept with Minor Revisions. The paper is above the acceptance threshold due to its strong empirical performance and novel contributions, but revisions are needed to improve clarity and contextualization.
