This paper presents a novel framework that bridges the classical theory of wavelets with modern deep learning techniques, specifically focusing on graph signal processing. The authors propose a machine learning-based approach to construct graph wavelets that adapt to a given class of signals, leveraging the lifting scheme and drawing parallels to deep auto-encoder networks. The work is motivated by the limitations of existing graph wavelet constructions, which are typically guided solely by graph structure and fail to adapt to specific signal classes. The paper provides theoretical insights into the connection between wavelet construction and auto-encoders, and demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed method through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets.
Strengths:
1. Originality: The paper introduces a novel perspective by connecting wavelet theory with deep learning, specifically through the use of auto-encoders. This is a creative and promising direction that could inspire further research at the intersection of signal processing and machine learning.
2. Significance: The proposed framework addresses a critical gap in graph signal processing by enabling adaptive wavelet constructions. The ability to sparsely represent signals on graphs has broad implications for applications in image processing, semi-supervised learning, and other domains.
3. Technical Soundness: The use of the lifting scheme as the backbone for wavelet construction is well-justified, and the authors carefully address key properties such as vanishing moments and locality. The experimental results demonstrate the practical utility of the approach, with improvements in sparsity and reconstruction quality over Haar wavelets.
4. Connections to Prior Work: The paper situates its contributions within the broader context of wavelet theory and deep learning, referencing relevant work such as Mallat's wavelet interpretation of deep networks. This highlights the relevance of the research to both communities.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity: The paper is dense and difficult to follow, particularly for readers unfamiliar with wavelet theory or the lifting scheme. Key concepts, such as the connection between auto-encoders and wavelets, are not explained intuitively. The mathematical notation is also heavy, which may hinder accessibility.
2. Presentation: The organization of the paper could be improved. For instance, the experimental section is detailed but lacks a clear narrative connecting the results to the broader goals of the paper. Figures and diagrams are not always well-integrated into the text, which reduces their explanatory power.
3. Evaluation: While the experiments demonstrate the feasibility of the approach, the evaluation could be more comprehensive. For example, comparisons to other adaptive wavelet methods or alternative graph signal processing techniques would strengthen the claims of superiority.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper addresses a timely and important problem, proposing a novel and technically sound solution.
- The connection between wavelets and deep learning is an exciting contribution that could open new research directions.
- The experimental results, while limited in scope, demonstrate the potential of the proposed method.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The paper's clarity and presentation need significant improvement to make the work accessible to a broader audience.
- The evaluation lacks depth, particularly in terms of comparisons to alternative methods.
Recommendation:
I recommend conditional acceptance. The paper makes a strong theoretical and practical contribution, but the authors should address the clarity and presentation issues before publication. Specifically, they should provide more intuitive explanations, streamline the organization, and expand the evaluation to include comparisons with other methods.
