This paper proposes a novel convex framework for automatically discovering latent domains within datasets, addressing a critical challenge in domain adaptation for visual recognition tasks. The framework introduces two key principles: maximum distinctiveness (ensuring identified domains are statistically distinct) and maximum learnability (ensuring strong discriminative models can be trained within each domain). The authors employ a kernel-based approach to measure pairwise domain differences in RKHS and optimize domain assignments through a relaxed convex optimization procedure. Additionally, the number of latent domains (K) is determined via a domain-wise cross-validation (DWCV) process, which maximizes classification accuracy within each domain.
Strengths:
1. Novelty: The idea of controlling class label distributions for latent domain discovery within a convex framework is innovative. The combination of maximum distinctiveness and learnability is a meaningful contribution to domain adaptation research.
2. Technical Contributions: The use of nonparametric methods and the relaxed convex optimization approach are technically sound and address limitations of prior parametric approaches, such as Gaussian mixtures.
3. Practical Utility: The framework is validated on diverse tasks, including object recognition and human activity recognition, demonstrating its applicability across domains. The experimental results show reasonable improvements over baselines and outperform competing methods like [20].
4. Qualitative Insights: The visualization of identified domains provides valuable insights into the factors influencing domain formation, such as pose, background, and object appearance.
5. Significance: The work advances the state of the art in domain adaptation by addressing the critical issue of latent domain discovery, which is often overlooked in existing approaches.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity: The paper lacks clear definitions and examples for key concepts like "dataset," "domain," and "latent domain," particularly in Section 4.2. This ambiguity may confuse readers unfamiliar with the topic.
2. Experimental Justification: The choice of source and target datasets is not well-justified, and the experimental settings (e.g., the meaning of maxk r(Uk, B) in Eq. 7) require further clarification.
3. Limitation of Label Prior Constraint (LPC): Forcing similar class distributions within each latent domain may be restrictive for tasks where domain distinctions are based on non-class-related factors (e.g., pose in animal classification).
4. Misleading Framing: While the problem is framed as unsupervised learning, the use of semantic class labels contradicts this claim, which could mislead readers.
5. Generalization: The paper does not adequately discuss the generalizability of the approach to other types of data or tasks beyond visual recognition.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper introduces a novel and technically sound framework with significant potential to impact domain adaptation research.
- The experimental results demonstrate clear improvements over baselines and prior methods.
- The qualitative results and insights into domain factors are valuable contributions.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The paper's clarity and presentation need improvement, particularly in defining key concepts and explaining experimental settings.
- Some methodological choices, such as the LPC and dataset selection, may limit the approach's applicability to broader tasks.
Recommendation:
Overall, this paper makes a meaningful contribution to domain adaptation research and addresses a challenging problem with a novel approach. However, the authors should address the clarity issues and provide more justification for their experimental choices. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions.
