This paper proposes distributed algorithms for k-means and k-median clustering based on coreset construction, offering theoretical guarantees on approximation quality and communication cost. The authors claim improvements over prior work by reducing communication complexity by a factor of √n and ensuring independence from network topology. The paper also includes experimental results on distributed clustering for low-dimensional datasets.
Strengths:
1. Theoretical Contributions: The paper provides a rigorous theoretical analysis of the coreset size and communication cost, demonstrating that the proposed algorithm improves upon prior methods, particularly in sparse or high-diameter network topologies. The independence from network topology is a notable advantage, as it broadens the applicability of the algorithm.
2. Communication Efficiency: By reducing communication complexity by √n compared to prior work, the paper addresses a critical bottleneck in distributed clustering, especially for large-scale networks.
3. Clarity and Organization: The paper is well-written and logically structured, making it accessible to readers familiar with distributed clustering and coreset methods. The inclusion of detailed proofs and algorithmic descriptions adds to its technical rigor.
4. Experimental Validation: The experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs well in practice, achieving competitive results with reduced communication costs compared to baseline methods.
Weaknesses:
1. Lack of Originality: While the paper builds on prior work, the main technical contribution is incremental. Coreset-based clustering and distributed coreset methods are well-studied, and the novelty lies primarily in optimizing communication cost. The paper does not introduce fundamentally new techniques or paradigms.
2. Loose Theoretical Bounds: The theoretical bounds on coreset size and communication cost are overly conservative, leading to impractically large coresets in some cases. This limits the practical utility of the theoretical guarantees.
3. Limited Experimental Scope: The experiments are restricted to a small number of distributed sites and low-dimensional datasets. This raises concerns about the scalability of the algorithm to larger networks and high-dimensional or sparse data, which are common in real-world applications.
4. Comparison with Prior Work: While the paper compares its method to a few baselines, it does not provide a comprehensive evaluation against state-of-the-art distributed clustering algorithms beyond coreset-based approaches.
Recommendation:
The paper makes a solid contribution to the field of distributed clustering by improving communication efficiency and providing theoretical guarantees. However, its incremental novelty, limited experimental scope, and impractical theoretical bounds reduce its overall impact. For acceptance, the authors should address scalability concerns by including experiments on larger networks and high-dimensional datasets. Additionally, a more thorough comparison with state-of-the-art methods would strengthen the paper's significance.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Improved communication efficiency is a meaningful contribution to distributed clustering.
- Theoretical guarantees and independence from network topology are valuable for certain applications.
- The paper is well-written and technically sound.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The main contribution is incremental, with limited novelty.
- The theoretical bounds are too loose for practical use.
- The experimental evaluation is insufficient to demonstrate scalability and robustness.
Overall, the paper is a competent but incremental contribution to distributed clustering, and its acceptance should depend on the conference's emphasis on novelty versus incremental improvements.
