The paper introduces a novel two-step method for cross-lingual topic representation learning, combining matrix completion and latent semantic analysis (LSI). The authors address the challenge of disjoint feature spaces in cross-lingual text classification by first completing a sparse bilingual document-term matrix using a projected gradient descent algorithm, followed by LSI to generate low-dimensional representations. The method is evaluated on cross-lingual sentiment classification tasks using the Amazon review dataset, demonstrating superior performance compared to monolingual and cross-lingual baselines, particularly with minimal parallel data. The approach is innovative in its application of matrix completion to cross-lingual representation learning and highlights its potential as a preprocessing step for such tasks.
Strengths:  
The paper makes a significant contribution to cross-lingual text classification by introducing a novel combination of matrix completion and LSI, which is both original and effective. The experimental results are comprehensive, comparing the proposed method against two baselines and two state-of-the-art cross-lingual dimensionality reduction techniques (CL-LSI and CL-KCCA). The method consistently outperforms these alternatives, achieving high accuracy even with limited parallel data, which is a critical advantage in low-resource settings. The inclusion of learning curves with varying amounts of unlabeled data further strengthens the empirical evaluation. The paper is well-organized, with clear parameter descriptions and reproducibility guidelines, which enhance its clarity and utility for the research community.
Weaknesses:  
While the paper is technically sound, the motivation for using matrix completion as the first step could be better articulated in the Introduction. Although the authors briefly justify its use by citing the sparsity and low-rank nature of document-term matrices, a more detailed discussion of why this approach is particularly suitable for cross-lingual tasks would improve the paper. Additionally, while the convergence guarantees for the optimization algorithm are theoretically grounded, the practical computational efficiency of the method on larger datasets could be explored further. Finally, the related work section could benefit from a deeper discussion of how the proposed method compares conceptually to other approaches, beyond empirical results.
Pro Acceptance Arguments:  
- Novel and effective combination of matrix completion and LSI for cross-lingual representation learning.  
- Strong empirical performance across a variety of tasks, with robustness to limited parallel data.  
- Clear and reproducible methodology, with comprehensive experiments and parameter settings.
Con Acceptance Arguments:  
- Limited discussion of the computational scalability of the proposed method.  
- Insufficient elaboration on the motivation for matrix completion in the Introduction.  
- Related work section could better contextualize the novelty of the approach.
Conclusion:  
This paper represents a strong contribution to the field of cross-lingual text classification, advancing the state of the art both conceptually and empirically. While minor improvements could enhance its clarity and scope, the paper is well-suited for acceptance at the conference.
