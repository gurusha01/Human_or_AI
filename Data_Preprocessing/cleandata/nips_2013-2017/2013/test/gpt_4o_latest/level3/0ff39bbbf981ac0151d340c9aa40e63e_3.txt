The paper proposes a novel two-step method for translingual representation learning, combining matrix completion with cross-lingual latent semantic indexing (CL-LSI). This approach addresses the challenge of disjoint feature spaces in cross-language text classification by leveraging a small set of parallel bilingual documents. The authors formulate a matrix completion problem to fill missing entries in a unified document-term matrix, followed by applying CL-LSI to derive low-dimensional cross-lingual representations. The method is evaluated on cross-language sentiment classification tasks using Amazon product reviews, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods, especially with limited parallel data.
Strengths:  
The methodology is innovative, introducing a unique combination of matrix completion and CL-LSI. The use of matrix completion to infer missing entries in a sparse bilingual document-term matrix is particularly notable, as it captures low-rank and sparse structures effectively. The experimental results are promising, showing consistent outperformance of baseline methods such as CL-LSI, CL-OPCA, and CL-KCCA across multiple tasks. The method's robustness with small amounts of parallel data is significant, as it reduces reliance on extensive bilingual resources. Additionally, the convergence guarantees of the proposed optimization algorithm add theoretical rigor to the work.
Weaknesses:  
The robustness of the results raises concerns, as the performance advantage may be influenced by the scaling properties of LSI, which are known to favor linear SVMs. The authors should validate their findings using machine learning models that are less sensitive to feature rescaling, such as boosted decision trees, to ensure the method's generalizability. Clarity is another issue; the presentation of the unified document-term matrix and the experimental setup is overly dense and could benefit from more intuitive explanations or visual aids. Furthermore, while the novelty of the approach is evident, the discussion of related work could better highlight how this method fundamentally differs from prior approaches like CL-LSI or CL-KCCA.
Recommendation:  
The paper presents a promising and novel approach to cross-language text classification. However, to strengthen its contribution, the authors should (1) validate the robustness of their method with additional classifiers, (2) improve the clarity of the matrix construction and experimental setup, and (3) provide a more explicit comparison with related work. If these issues are addressed, the method could make a significant impact due to its controlled non-linear inference properties and reduced dependency on large parallel corpora.
Pro/Con Arguments for Acceptance:  
- Pro: Innovative methodology combining matrix completion and CL-LSI; strong empirical results; robustness with limited parallel data.  
- Con: Concerns about robustness due to reliance on LSI; clarity issues in key sections; limited evaluation with non-linear classifiers.  
Overall Impression:  
The paper is a valuable contribution to translingual representation learning, but further validation and improved clarity are necessary to fully realize its potential.
