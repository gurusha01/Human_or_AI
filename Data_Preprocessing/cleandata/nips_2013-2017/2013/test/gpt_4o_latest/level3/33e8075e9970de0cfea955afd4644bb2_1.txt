The paper proposes a novel framework for constructing a linear wavelet transform on weighted graphs using the lifting scheme, with key properties such as linear complexity, adaptability, perfect reconstruction, and efficient training. The authors leverage the connection between the lifting scheme and auto-encoder networks, introducing a machine learning-based approach to adapt wavelets to specific classes of graph signals. This method addresses limitations of existing graph wavelet constructions, which are typically guided solely by graph structure and lack adaptability to signal classes. The proposed framework is validated through detailed theoretical derivations and experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating improved sparsity and multiscale behavior.
Strengths:
1. Technical Quality: The paper is technically sound, with rigorous derivations and a well-defined optimization framework. The use of tied auto-encoders for training ensures linearity and avoids trivial solutions, while constraints on update and predict operators preserve key wavelet properties like vanishing moments and locality.
2. Clarity: The manuscript is well-structured and clearly written, providing sufficient detail for reproducibility. The experimental section effectively illustrates the advantages of the proposed method across diverse applications, including graph-based temperature modeling and image processing.
3. Originality: The connection between wavelet construction on graphs and deep auto-encoder networks is novel and thought-provoking. This intersection of wavelets and neural networks opens new avenues for research and bridges two important fields.
4. Significance: The proposed method advances the state of the art in graph-based signal processing by introducing a general-purpose, adaptive wavelet transform. Its flexibility and efficiency make it a valuable tool for analyzing signals on graphs, with potential applications in manifold learning, semi-supervised learning, and image processing.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity of Presentation: Some aspects of the paper could benefit from additional clarification. For instance, the term "sufficient" in Section 4.5 is vague and should be explicitly defined. Additionally, the colorbars in Figures 4 and 5 are not explained, which may hinder interpretation of the results.
2. Minor Errors: There is a typo in Section 4.7 that should be corrected for improved readability.
3. Limited Discussion on Limitations: While the paper highlights the strengths of the proposed method, a more explicit discussion of its limitations (e.g., computational overhead during training or sensitivity to graph partitioning quality) would strengthen the evaluation.
Recommendation:
I recommend acceptance of this paper, as it makes a significant contribution to graph-based signal processing and introduces a novel perspective by linking wavelet construction to auto-encoder networks. The strengths of the paper outweigh its minor weaknesses, which can be addressed in a revision.
Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Clarify the term "sufficient" in Section 4.5 and provide more detailed explanations for the colorbars in Figures 4 and 5.
2. Correct the typo in Section 4.7.
3. Include a brief discussion of potential limitations and future directions, such as computational trade-offs or the impact of graph partitioning quality.
In conclusion, this work represents a high-quality contribution to the field and is likely to inspire further research at the intersection of wavelets and deep learning.
