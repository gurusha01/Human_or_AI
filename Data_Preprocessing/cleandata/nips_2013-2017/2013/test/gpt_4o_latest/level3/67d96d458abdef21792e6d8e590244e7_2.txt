The paper presents a novel approach to non-uniform blind deconvolution, leveraging a spatially-adaptive image penalty and a newly derived upper bound (Eq. 7) to simplify the optimization of a cost function (Eq. 9). The method aims to address limitations in existing algorithms by automatically adjusting the penalty's concavity/convexity based on local image gradients and blur magnitude, thereby favoring sharpness or coarseness as needed. The authors claim that this approach eliminates the need for trade-off parameters and structure-selection heuristics, offering a parameter-free and theoretically grounded alternative to state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results demonstrate competitive or superior performance on real-world images compared to existing algorithms.
Strengths:
1. Theoretical Contributions: The introduction of a novel upper bound (Eq. 7) and its connection to adaptive priors is a significant theoretical contribution. The penalty's ability to adapt spatially to local blur and image structure is well-motivated and provides a principled solution to avoid degenerate solutions.
2. Practical Relevance: The method's parameter-free nature and its avoidance of heuristic-based structure selection make it appealing for real-world applications. The experimental results, particularly the comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, highlight its practical utility.
3. Clarity of Objectives: The paper clearly identifies the limitations of existing methods (e.g., reliance on heuristics, susceptibility to local minima) and positions its contributions as addressing these gaps.
4. Significance: The study of adaptive priors for non-uniform blind deconvolution is an important direction, and the proposed method's performance on challenging real-world images underscores its potential impact.
Weaknesses:
1. Limited Novelty: While the proposed upper bound (Eq. 7) and penalty adaptation are novel, the approach heavily relies on prior work (e.g., [26]), and the originality of the overall framework is somewhat limited.
2. Clarity Issues: The connection between Eq. 7 and the cost function (Eq. 9) is not sufficiently clear, and the notation (e.g., weights and blur kernels) is confusing in places. This could hinder reproducibility and understanding for readers.
3. Uniform Case Analysis: The paper does not analyze the uniform blur case, which would provide a useful baseline and complement the experimental results.
4. Classic Prior Limitations: The paper does not adequately address how the proposed prior explicitly overcomes the limitations of classic priors, such as avoiding local or global minima in blurry image solutions.
5. Impact of the Bound: While the upper bound (Eq. 7) is central to the method, its specific impact on the algorithm's performance is not thoroughly analyzed or ablated.
Recommendation:
The paper makes a meaningful contribution to the field of non-uniform blind deconvolution, particularly through its adaptive prior and parameter-free optimization framework. However, the limited originality, lack of clarity in key derivations, and insufficient analysis of the uniform case and classic prior limitations detract from its overall impact. If the authors address these issues, particularly by clarifying the connection between Eq. 7 and Eq. 9 and providing a deeper analysis of the proposed bound's effects, the paper could be a strong candidate for acceptance. As it stands, I recommend acceptance with major revisions. 
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Important problem and practical significance.
- Strong theoretical foundation and competitive experimental results.
- Parameter-free and heuristic-free nature is a valuable contribution.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Limited originality due to reliance on prior work.
- Lack of clarity in key derivations and notation.
- Insufficient analysis of uniform blur and classic prior limitations.
