Review
This paper proposes a novel approach to discovering discriminative mid-level visual elements in weakly labeled image datasets by extending the mean-shift algorithm to density ratio estimation. The authors introduce a modified gradient ascent method to identify visual elements that are both representative and discriminative, and they propose an inter-element communication mechanism to improve adaptive bandwidth estimation. The method is evaluated on the Paris Street View dataset and the MIT Scene-67 dataset, where it achieves state-of-the-art results in scene classification. A new evaluation metric, the Purity-Coverage plot, is also introduced to analyze the quality of discovered visual elements.
Strengths
The paper addresses an important and challenging problem in computer vision: mining mid-level visual elements that are both representative and discriminative. The proposed method achieves impressive empirical results, particularly on the MIT Scene-67 dataset, where it outperforms prior approaches. The introduction of the Purity-Coverage plot is a valuable contribution that provides a principled way to evaluate visual element discovery methods. The authors also provide detailed comparisons with several baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of their approach. The method's ability to handle large-scale datasets with a single pass is a practical advantage, and the paper offers interesting insights into the connection between mean-shift and density ratio estimation.
Weaknesses
Despite its empirical success, the proposed method has several technical shortcomings. First, the approach diverges significantly from the original mean-shift algorithm, and the reliance on heuristics (e.g., inter-element communication and adaptive bandwidth estimation) raises concerns about generalizability. The lack of formal guarantees for correctness or convergence is a notable limitation, especially given the complexity of the optimization process. Additionally, some aspects of the method, such as patch associations and tuning, appear ad hoc and dataset-specific, which may limit its applicability to other datasets. The paper also suffers from unclear notations (e.g., `arglocalmax` is undefined) and minor errors in derivations, which hinder reproducibility. The authors' rebuttal did not adequately address these formal and heuristic concerns.
Recommendation
While the paper has notable technical limitations, its strong experimental results and practical contributions make it a valuable addition to the field. The proposed method advances the state of the art in scene classification and introduces useful tools for evaluating visual element discovery. However, the program committee should carefully consider the lack of formal guarantees and the heuristic nature of the method before making a final decision. If accepted, the authors should be encouraged to clarify notations, address derivation errors, and provide more rigorous theoretical analysis in future work.
Arguments for Acceptance
- Strong empirical results, particularly on MIT Scene-67.
- Novel contributions, including the Purity-Coverage plot.
- Practical relevance for large-scale visual data mining.
Arguments Against Acceptance
- Heavy reliance on heuristics and dataset-specific tuning.
- Lack of formal guarantees for correctness or convergence.
- Unclear notations and minor derivation errors.
Overall, I recommend acceptance, but with reservations regarding the formal aspects of the method.
