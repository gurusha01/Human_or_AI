This paper presents a novel approach to mid-level visual element discovery by framing the problem as discriminative mode seeking, inspired by the mean-shift algorithm. The authors propose a discriminative variant of mean-shift that operates on density ratios, enabling the discovery of visually-coherent patch clusters that are both representative and discriminative. The method is evaluated on the Paris Street View dataset and the MIT Scene-67 dataset, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in scene classification. Additionally, the authors introduce the Purity-Coverage plot as a principled evaluation metric for comparing visual discovery approaches.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Technical Contribution: The paper introduces a discriminative extension to the classical mean-shift algorithm, which is an innovative approach to visual element discovery. The use of density ratios to identify discriminative clusters is well-motivated and addresses the limitations of prior ad hoc methods.
2. Evaluation and Results: The proposed method achieves impressive results on the MIT Scene-67 dataset, outperforming existing methods, including Improved Fisher Vectors and other discriminative patch-based approaches. The use of the Purity-Coverage plot provides a clear and interpretable way to evaluate the trade-off between representativeness and discriminativeness.
3. Practical Efficiency: The algorithm is designed to be efficient, requiring only a single pass through the data, which is crucial for large-scale visual datasets. The online implementation and gradient ascent optimization are well-suited for high-dimensional feature spaces.
4. Comprehensive Baselines: The paper compares its method against a range of baselines, including Exemplar LDA and iterative retraining approaches, providing a thorough analysis of the contributions of different components.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity and Accessibility: While the technical content is strong, the paper is dense and difficult to follow in places, particularly for readers unfamiliar with mean-shift or density ratio estimation. Simplifying the exposition or providing more intuitive explanations would enhance accessibility.
2. Limited Scope of Labels: The method is restricted to binary labels, which limits its applicability to datasets with continuous or multi-class labels. This limitation is acknowledged but not addressed in the current work.
3. Global Context: The algorithm focuses on individual patches and does not account for global image structures, which could further improve performance in tasks like scene classification.
4. Heuristic Components: Some aspects of the method, such as the inter-element communication mechanism for adaptive bandwidth, rely on heuristics that are not rigorously analyzed. This raises questions about their generalizability to other datasets or tasks.
Recommendation:
This paper makes a significant contribution to the field of mid-level visual representations and is well-suited for presentation at NIPS. The proposed method is both novel and effective, and the results demonstrate its practical utility. However, the authors should consider revising the manuscript to improve clarity and address the limitations related to label types and global structures. Additionally, a more thorough analysis of the heuristic components would strengthen the paper.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Novel and technically sound approach to visual element discovery.
- Strong experimental results and comprehensive evaluation.
- Practical efficiency for large-scale datasets.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Dense and occasionally unclear presentation.
- Limited applicability to non-binary labels.
- Reliance on heuristics without rigorous justification.
Final Decision: Accept with minor revisions.
