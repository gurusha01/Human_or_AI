The paper presents a significant contribution to the field of machine learning by addressing the computational challenges of sampling from determinantal point processes (DPPs) in continuous spaces. The authors propose two efficient sampling schemes—one based on low-rank kernel approximations using Nyström and random Fourier features (RFF) and another leveraging Gibbs sampling for k-DPPs. These methods are demonstrated to be scalable and applicable to a wide range of kernel functions, with practical applications in repulsive mixture modeling and human pose synthesis.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Significance: The paper tackles a long-standing challenge in extending DPPs to continuous spaces, which has limited their adoption in real-world applications. By proposing efficient and scalable sampling methods, the work advances the state of the art and opens up new possibilities for using DPPs in high-dimensional and continuous domains.
2. Technical Soundness: The proposed methods are well-supported by theoretical derivations and empirical evaluations. The authors provide detailed explanations of their algorithms, including the dual representation for low-rank approximations and the Schur complement for Gibbs sampling.
3. Empirical Validation: The paper includes comprehensive experiments to validate the proposed methods. For instance, the comparison of Nyström and RFF approximations highlights their respective strengths and weaknesses, offering practical guidance for different settings. The applications to mixture modeling and human pose synthesis demonstrate the utility of the methods in real-world scenarios.
4. Clarity and Organization: The paper is well-written and logically organized. The authors provide sufficient background on DPPs, clearly delineate the challenges in the continuous setting, and systematically present their solutions.
Weaknesses:
1. Limited Discussion of Limitations: While the paper acknowledges the trade-offs between Nyström and RFF methods, it does not extensively discuss the limitations of the proposed approaches. For example, the Gibbs sampler's potential inefficiency in high-repulsion settings could be explored further.
2. Reproducibility: Although the theoretical details are thorough, the paper lacks explicit implementation details or pseudo-code for some of the algorithms, particularly the Gibbs sampler for k-DPPs. This could hinder reproducibility for practitioners.
3. Evaluation Scope: The empirical analysis focuses primarily on Gaussian kernels and specific applications. It would be valuable to explore the performance of the methods on a broader range of kernel functions and application domains to generalize the findings.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper addresses a significant and relevant problem in the field, providing novel and technically sound solutions.
- The methods are demonstrated to be both efficient and practical, with clear applications in machine learning tasks such as mixture modeling and trajectory synthesis.
- The work is likely to inspire further research and applications of DPPs in continuous spaces.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The lack of detailed discussion on limitations and broader evaluations slightly detracts from the completeness of the work.
- The reproducibility of the methods could be improved with more implementation details.
Recommendation:
Overall, this paper makes a strong contribution to the field and is well-suited for acceptance at NIPS. The novelty, technical rigor, and practical relevance of the proposed methods outweigh the minor weaknesses. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the reproducibility and limitations discussion.
