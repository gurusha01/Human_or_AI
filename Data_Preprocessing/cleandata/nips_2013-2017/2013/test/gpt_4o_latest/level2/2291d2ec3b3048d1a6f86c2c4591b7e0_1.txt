This paper addresses the critical challenge of domain adaptation in visual recognition by proposing a novel method for automatically discovering latent domains in image and video datasets. The authors introduce two key properties—maximum distinctiveness and maximum learnability—to guide the discovery of domains, and they develop a nonparametric optimization framework to achieve this. The proposed approach is extensively evaluated on object recognition and human activity recognition tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving classification performance by reshaping datasets into latent domains.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Significance: The paper tackles an important problem in domain adaptation by moving beyond the common assumption that datasets equate to domains. The introduction of maximum distinctiveness and maximum learnability as guiding principles is innovative and well-motivated.
2. Technical Soundness: The proposed nonparametric approach is rigorous, with clear mathematical formulations and a well-defined optimization procedure. The relaxation of the optimization problem into a continuous form is a practical and thoughtful solution to the inherent computational challenges.
3. Comprehensive Evaluation: The authors validate their approach on diverse datasets for both object and activity recognition. The results consistently show that the discovered latent domains outperform not only the original datasets but also competing methods, such as Hoffman et al. [20].
4. Practical Utility: The method's ability to reshape both training and test datasets into meaningful domains has practical implications for improving domain adaptation performance in real-world applications.
5. Clarity and Organization: The paper is well-written and logically structured, with detailed explanations of the methodology, experimental setup, and results. The inclusion of qualitative analyses (e.g., exemplar images) adds depth to the evaluation.
Weaknesses:
1. Assumptions and Limitations: While the authors acknowledge the NP-hard nature of the optimization problem, the computational feasibility of the relaxed formulation could be further discussed, especially for large-scale datasets. Additionally, the assumption of label prior consistency (LPC) may not hold in all scenarios, particularly in highly imbalanced datasets.
2. Comparison with Related Work: Although the authors compare their method to Hoffman et al. [20], the discussion of other related works, such as generalized clustering approaches [27], could be more detailed to better contextualize the contributions.
3. Scalability: The paper does not explicitly address the scalability of the proposed method to very large datasets, which is a critical consideration for practical deployment.
4. Interpretability of Domains: While the identified domains are shown to improve performance, the interpretability of these domains in terms of real-world factors (e.g., lighting, pose) could be explored further to provide more insights into their practical relevance.
Recommendation:
I recommend acceptance of this paper for its significant contributions to the field of domain adaptation and its potential to inspire future research on latent domain discovery. The proposed approach is novel, technically sound, and well-supported by experimental results. However, the authors are encouraged to address the scalability and interpretability aspects in future work.
Arguments Pro Acceptance:
- Novel and impactful contribution to domain adaptation.
- Rigorous methodology and comprehensive evaluation.
- Practical utility in reshaping datasets for improved performance.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Limited discussion of scalability and computational feasibility.
- Need for deeper exploration of interpretability and real-world relevance of identified domains.
Overall, the strengths of the paper outweigh its weaknesses, making it a valuable addition to the conference.
