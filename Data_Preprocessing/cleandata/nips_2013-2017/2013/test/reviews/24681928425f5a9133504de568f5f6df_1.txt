This paper presents a method for learning the structure of stochastic And-Or grammars. The paper suggests that this "generalizes" previous work on structure learning, but it's actually a special case, which makes the problem tractable. This is a reasonable point on its own, and the paper makes a nice contribution, so I wouldn't try to argue that the problem is more general than the structure learning problem faced in NLP. The basic algorithm is sensible and successful when compared against other methods for inducing grammars. 
The experimental evaluation could be improved by adding more comparisons to other methods. In particular, the method of Stolcke and Omohondro (reference 14) seems like it could be applied to both tasks and would be a valuable comparison point. This is a solid paper presenting a method for learning the structure of a particular class of grammars.
