Summary: 
The paper considers the complexity of policy iteration (PI) for finite MDPs 
with n states and m actions per state in a number of settings. 
The following results are derived: 
For Howard's PI, a previous bound is improved by removing a log(n) factor. 
For Simplex PI, a previous bound is improved by halving its multiplicative constant. 
When the MDP is deterministic, a previous bound for Simplex PI 
is improved by decreasing the power of 
dependence on n by one. 
This result is generalized to stochastic MDPs under additional restrictions on the MDP. 
Originality and significance: 
The complexity of PI is of major interest to the RL community. Even though the finite 
setting is not practical, it is important to have a good understanding of this 
simple case before moving to more complicated settings. This paper essentially picks 
up the previous line of research that started with a paper by Yinyu Ye in 2011 and 
continued by Post and Ye, as well as by Hansen, Miltersen and Zwick. 
Some of the improvements are marginal and the core ideas of the proofs go back to the 
2011 work of Ye. However, the proofs are much more streamlined and are way more 
accessible to RL researchers than those of Ye (who prefers to use the language 
of linear programming). The extension of strong polynomial results to stochastic MDPs 
under structural assumptions are the most important novel parts of the paper. 
Clarity: 
The paper is relatively well-written, though the authors should check it carefully 
as it contains a few typos (lines 285, 292). Also, at times fluency could be improved 
(e.g., "However, on the other hand" on line 303 is awkward). 
Soundness: 
I believe that the results are sound (I did not have time to check all the details). 
Minor issues: 
- line 367: specify the lemma used 
 The mildly improves previous results on the time complexity of PI,while making the proofs more accessible to RL researchers.Perhaps more importantly, the paper shows that the class of MDPsthat simplex PI is stronglypolynomial for is much larger than what was known beforehand.
