This paper proposes a new approach to unsupervised learning of the 
structure of AND-OR grammars. In contrast to previous approaches, the 
present one induces unified AND-OR fragments, rather than searching 
separately for AND and OR operations. The value of a proposed new 
AND-OR fragment can be computed efficiently using a set of sufficient 
statistics. The approach is evaluated on several tasks, parsing 
events and visual objects. 
This is a generally good paper. The problem is important. The 
approach is novel and well-motivated. The algorithm appears 
technically sound, but I was not able to check the supplemental 
derivations. A few things weren't clear to me, which could just 
reflect my own limited time for reading, but I would urge the authors 
to mark these points more clearly: First, it wasn't clear whether the 
"surrogate measure" of the likelihood gain was an approximate or an 
exact notion. Second, it wasn't clear whether the approach could 
extend to learning fragments with -arity more than 2, or whether it 
could only tractably learn grammars in "Chomsky normal form". 
My main concerns with the paper focus on the experiments. I had 
trouble understanding most aspects of them: exactly what was done, how 
the examples were represented, and what was learned. I got the 
impression that the paper's ideal audience is a reader who has 
followed, studied intimately and preferrably re-implemented all of the 
recent visual-grammar papers coming out of S. C. Zhu's group. To such 
a reader, the experimental section would probably have been more 
understandable and the results more useful. But for outsiders, it was 
less clear. I understand that the short NIPS format has its 
limitations. But fortunately NIPS permits supplementary materials, 
and if the paper is accepted, I would urge the authors to include in 
their supplement many more details and concrete illustrations of their 
experiments. 
I would especially like to have seen (or to see) examples of any 
interesting structure discovered in the learned grammars. The paper 
has a great set up about the importance of grammars and structure 
learning, but then it is a bit of a letdown for these expectations to 
see that the results are presented purely quantitatively. I agree 
with the authors that those quantitative results are satisfactory on 
their own terms. But they are not very exciting or illuminating. I 
would have found the paper more compelling if the authors could show 
that interesting structure is learned, and that more interesting 
structure is learned by this approach relative to competing 
approaches. This is an interesting paper on unsupervised learning of AND-OR grammars. While I liked it, I had trouble following the experiments and interpreting the results, not being familiar with a lot of prior work (mostly from Zhu's UCLA group) that it seemed to build on heavily. If accepted, the authors should include supplementary material with more details and illustrations of how the experiments worked and what interesting structure was learned.
