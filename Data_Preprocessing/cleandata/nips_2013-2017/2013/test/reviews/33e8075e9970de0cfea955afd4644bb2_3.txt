Summary: The authors present a method for constructing wavelets on weighted graphs that can adapt to a class of signals. The approach uses the lifting scheme and by connecting this scheme to a deep auto-encoder network, the authors are able to perform unsupervised training similar to the pre-training of a stack of auto-encoders. The approach is linear in the size of the graph. The authors explore the performance of the wavelet construction approach through application to several data sets. 
Quality: The authors provide an elegant approach for taking into account the class of signals when forming wavelets on a graph. Most constructions are based solely on the graph structure, and those few methods that do allow adaptivity based on the signals [19,21] have significant limitations. 
The technical development is clearly described, novel, and leads to an efficient algorithm that produces wavelets with desirable properties. 
The partitioning approach is described very briefly and there is almost no discussion of how sensitive the approach is to the partitioning method. The spectral clustering algorithm of [20] has some limitations (performance being poor for some kinds of graphs) and it would be nice to see more information about how sensitive the overall wavelet construct is to the partitioning scheme. 
For their results on irregular graphs, where I think the construction is of most interest, the authors do not make a comparison to compression or reconstruction using any other type of graph wavelet. Instead, the comparison is to (somewhat dated) learning techniques that are suited to manifold analysis. This constitutes one significant weakness of the paper. 
Clarity: The paper is very well written and the development is easy to follow. As discussed above, more detail on some of the 
Originality: The authors provide a new method for constructing wavelets on graphs that has the important ability to adapt to the class of functions that the wavelets will be used to represent. The method is highly original. 
Significance: The paper represents a useful contribution in the field of wavelets and multiresolution analysis on graphs, a field of growing interest due to the numerous potential applications. I consider that the signal adaptivity, while preserving linearity and efficiency of construction, represents a significant advance. 
 The paper makes a significant original contribution, providing an important advance in the field of wavelets on graphs. The lack of a thorough comparison to other wavelet graphs for compression and reconstruction is the major weakness of the paper.
