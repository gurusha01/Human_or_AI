In this paper, the authors develop a novel blind deconvolution algorithm that provides very good results for both uniform and non-uniform blind deconvolution problems. They provide a compelling analysis of the reasons why their method works well. A number of experimental results are provided against the state-of-the art algorithms for both uniform and non-uniform cases. The paper is clear and elegantly written. I believe this is a significant contribution to the literature on blind deconvolution. 
It would be interesting if the authors discussed how their new technique relates to the variational deblurring algorithm of Levin et. al. [15], which also uses marginalization over x to determine the blur kernel. In fact, the authors' new formulation starts with an even more simplified prior than the heavy tailed one used by Levin et. al. However, instead of fixed variances as used in Levin et. al., the authors make these variances spatially varying hyper-parameters...is this the crucial difference? A novel and interesting new algorithm for blind deconvolution is presented.
