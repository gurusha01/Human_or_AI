This paper presents a method to embed classification confidence into concept learning, and provides a dataset to evaluate it. 
1. The proposed dataset is well constructed, and will make concrete contributions to category classification. 
2. The idea of adding classification confidence into the system makes perfect sense, and provides a reasonable and practical way to approximate non-perceptual word learning method. 
3. The paper devises a effective way to compute confusion matrix with limited data, facilitating the proposed algorithm. 
4. The evaluation is well conducted, where the proposed algorithm is compared to nearest neighbor approaches and ideal non-perceptual word learning, showing a good performance.

1. There might be a few typos in the paper: 
In equation 4, the right hand side should be |h|^(-1) instead of |h|^(-N). 
In equation 5, should the last term be I(j \in h) instead of I(y_i \in h)? Because otherwise the 1/|h|*I term can be move outside summation, and then the summation of confusion matrix does not make sense. 
In line 269, Aj,i should be the confusion of i and j, not j and j. 
These typos can be quite misleading to readers, so the paper should be check again for the final version. 
2. The way classification confidence is added to the system is through confusion matrix in this paper. What if just use the confidence itself? For example, can the equation 5 be change to \sumj confidence(j | xi) 1/|h| I(j \in h)? How would this formulation work compared to the proposed method? 
 Overall, this paper proposes a effective way of concept learning, and a dataset to test on. It would be great if the typos are fixed and justification are given on why the proposed method is the best way to utilize classification confidence.
