The paper considers convex calibrated surrogates for consisitency. In particular, it constructs a least-square surrogate loss which can be calibrated for ranking problems associated with low-rank target loss matrix. The results seem novel and interesting. The results potentially are interesting to the NIPS audience since ranking is a popular topic. 
However, the motivation on why you consider low-rank target loss matrix could be better motivated.  The paper addresses convex calibrated surrogates for ranking with low-rank loss matrix and the results seem novel and interesting. However, the motivation for considering low-rank loss matrix could be better motivated.My review confidence is not certain since I have no research experience on ranking.
