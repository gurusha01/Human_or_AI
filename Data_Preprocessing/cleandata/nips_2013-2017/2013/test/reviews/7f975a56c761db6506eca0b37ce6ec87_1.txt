The paper provides provably efficient algorithms for performing k-means and k-median clustering in the distributed setting. 
The main focus of the paper is minimizing communication cost in the distributed network. Although, i am not very much aware of the literature, the paper seems to provide a very novel idea of distributed coresets that leads to clustering algorithms which provably improves the state of the art communication complexity significantly. 
Existing approaches only use the idea of approximating coresets by taking the union of local coresets. The key idea in this papers is a construction of distributed coresets which is different from taking the union and this can be of independent interest in itself. The theoretical ideas in are based on the notion of dimension of the function space and the sampling lemma. 
The paper also provides a rigorous experimental evaluation and shows that the proposed algorithms outperforms existing state of art methods in terms of communication complexity supporting the theory. 
One concern is that in experiments the accuracy of the clustering algorithms is not compared (say for the same communication budget).  A good paper about minimizing communication cost of distributed clustering, with solid theoretical & experimental support.
