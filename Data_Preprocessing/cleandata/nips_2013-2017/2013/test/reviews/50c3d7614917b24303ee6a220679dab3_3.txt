This paper describes a method for approximately sampling from certain 
parameteric forms of a continuous-state determinantal point process. It 
employs an eigen-decomposition (of the dual kernel matrix instead of the 
kernel function) and depends on the kernel function having particular forms 
and decompositions. 
In the experimental results, the authors demonstrate that when coupled with 
a mixture density model, the resulting models give better test performance 
by promoting more diverse clusters. 
The paper is presented well and the results are nice. The topic is of 
interest to the ML community. 
A few minor comments: 
The notation for n (above equation 16) is unclear. Although I think I 
understand the paper well, I am uncertain what n_j means. 
The figure labels in the text do not align (for instance in Section 5, 
Figure 5 is referred to). 
 The paper shows an interesting way of sampling from a continuous DPP. The results demonstrate clear utility. A good paper.
