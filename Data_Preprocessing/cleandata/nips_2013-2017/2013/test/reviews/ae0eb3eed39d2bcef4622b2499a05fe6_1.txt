The author essentially tried to propose parallel algorithms for a clustering method (OFL as an extension of DP-means) and a feature selection method. These algorithm is then unified into optimistic concurrency control that was introduced in parallel database community. 
It seems that the algorithm that the author proposed can be perfectly fitted into the mapreduce framework. The map stage is the parallel operation, and the reduce stage is the serial operation. 
The theoretical analysis provides little added value, as they are mostly straight-forward. The experiment is not impressive because with speedup is only 4x on 8 processors.

The problem of the paper is obvious: too ad-hoc algorithms for the demonstration and poor performance evaluation. If the paper could position itself as a parallelized DP-means algorithm with extended discussion on OCC, it could be a better paper. Algorithm too ad-hoc and the performance of the algorithms is questionable.
