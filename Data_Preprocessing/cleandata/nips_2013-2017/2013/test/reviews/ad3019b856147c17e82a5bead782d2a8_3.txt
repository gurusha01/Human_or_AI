The paper proposes a very simple and surprisingly effective approach to generating the feature space for the task of face verification (deciding if two face images belong to the same person or not). A set of training templates is chosen ahead of time, and at test time the signature of the image is computed (essentially) by a clever projection onto the training set's principal components. Additionally, the authors collected a novel face verification dataset with 12,500 images depicting 450 individuals which do not appear in either LFW or PubFig datasets. 
POSITIVE: 
(1) The proposed method is simple, well-justified and thoroughly analyzed. 
(2) The experimental results convincingly demonstrate improvements over state-of-the-art results, as well several baselines, on four datasets (LFW, PubFig and PubFig83, and the newly collected dataset). Notably, the template images were obtained from the new dataset but applied on all the other datasets. 
Of particular interest is Figures 3(b), where the accuracy on face verification is evaluated as a function of the number of frames discarded from each template's transformation sequence, and remains surprisingly even as up to 80% of the (non-consecutive) frames are discarded. Also, Figure 3(c) shows a very impressive invariance to background clutter compared to standard HOG figures. 
(3) The paper is exceptionally clear and easy to follow. 
COMMENTS: 
- Showing ROC curves from 4 different datasets on one set of axes (Figure 5c) is somewhat unconventional 
- I look forward to seeing future work on applying this technique to object recognition! 
 The paper proposes a new image representation which is invariant to non-affine transformations of the object, and clearly and successfully demonstrates its effectiveness on the task of face verification.
