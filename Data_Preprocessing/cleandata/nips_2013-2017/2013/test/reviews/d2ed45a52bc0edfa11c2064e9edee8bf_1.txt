The authors present in this paper an algorithm for visual concept learning - given a few images of a concept (different concepts can be from different levels of abstraction) the algorithm learns to recognize other images from this concept. The algorithm combines object classification tools from machine vision and Bayesian generalization from cognitive science. The authors compare the generalization performances to other baseline methods and show there is a significant improvement when combining visual classifiers with the Bayesian cognitive model (as their algorithm does). 
The authors also provide large-scale dataset for visual concept learning which is based on ImageNet images and human annotators. 
I find the problem of visual concept learning interesting and relevant to the NIPS community. 
The paper's quality is high: it is well written and very interesting to read. 
There are few points that I think the authors should address: 
- In section 3.2 the authors claim that their criteria (eq. 1) for choosing levels of nested concepts for generating their dataset result in sub-category, basic. super-basic and super-category levels in the taxonomy - I would like to see this claim validated. 
I also think that the authors should cite Rosch et al. 1976 when they talk about basic-level categories, it would be interesting to connect between ideas from Rosch work to this work. 
- Could there be some mix up in the equations of section 4.1? 
Should equation 3 be P(h|X) or as it written P(X|h)? 
I didn't understand why in equation 4 you have |h|^-N rather than |h|^-1 (maybe it should be P(X|h) and not P(xi|h)) and also, it seems p(xnew|h) from line 226 doesn't fit equation 4 which is a bit confusing (I guess it should be p(x_new\inC|h). 
- the description of the extension of [5] (HB) is unclear in my opinion. Shouldn't the subtree maintain the accuracy over the 5 example images rather than the query images (line 345)? Well written paper about and interesting subject (concept learning) that is addressed using both tools from machine vision and cognitive science. I think it should be accepted.
