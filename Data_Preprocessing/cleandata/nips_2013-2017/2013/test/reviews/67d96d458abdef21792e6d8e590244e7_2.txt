This paper describes a method for non-uniform (space-varying) blind deconvolution. 
The method is strongly based on ref [26]. Indeed the authors propose to solve 
eq. 9, which is essentially the same as in eq. 26 and 27 in ref [26], by using the 
upper bound derived in eq 7, which is one of the novel bits. 
The analysis of the effects of such prior, however, is carried out on the original cost. 
A summary of the analysis is that the proposed prior adaptively regulates 
the concavity/convexity of the image-blur prior depending on the 
magnitude of the local image gradients and the L2 norm of the blur. 
If the blur is given at any pixel, the theory is that a high L2 norm (up to 1) can only be achieved 
with a Dirac delta and hence the image is sharp to start with. Here a very concave prior which 
strongly induces gradient sparsity is welcome. Vice versa, where the blur tends to be an averaging 
kernel, the prior tends to be much less concave to allow for less sensitivity to fine details and more 
sensitivity to coarse details. 
Quality 
-- 
The algorithm and the underlining theory are interesting and compelling. 
Although a good portion of the paper is devoted to explaining the effect of the 
proposed prior, there are several points left unexamined. 
1 - The analysis is carried out on the original cost 9 but 
the effects of the bound 7, which is the novelty in the algorithm, are not discussed. 
2- It would be useful to see how the analysis changes under the uniform case (that would 
complement well with the experiments in Fig 2). 
3- In light of the results in ref [16] it would be useful to see 
a discussion of how this prior addresses the limitations of the classic 
priors; specifically, it would be interesting to see that the blurry image & no blur 
solution is no longer a global minimum, or, even better, no longer a local minimum. 
Clarity 
-- 
Overall the authors do a good job with explaining the approach. 
However, there is somehow a jump between the paragraphs in sec 3. 
For example, the connection between eq 7 (the approx) and cost 9 
is not made clear. Indeed eq. 7 is never used later on. One can 
then find it only in the supplementary material. 
I recommend to revise/rewrite this section. 
The use of w for the weights and \hat w for the blur kernels is 
quite confusing. Despite the relation in eq 8, their meaning is 
very different. Please consider changing one of the two (e.g. hi for \hat wi 
would be much more meaningful). 
Eq 6 might have some typos: check that T at the exponent is not -1 and that 
you are not missing a product over i under the integral. 
Originality 
-- 
The originality is limited by all the body of work by ref [26]. 
It probably would have been very useful to discuss the differences 
with respect to [26]. In my opinion the originality is limited to a bound (eq7) 
and an explanation of how this prior operates (via Theorem 1). 
The explanation however, is quite approximate due to the 
complexity of the prior. 
Significance 
-- 
The study and development of novel priors for blind deconvolution is quite important 
and this paper further develops the new direction introduced by ref [26]. 
Moreover, given the experimental performance of this algorithm, this approach 
deserves attention. 
 Overall this paper introduces some novel elements: a practical bound for a cost function that simplifies the implementation, andanalysis that explains the general behavior of the adaptive prior. The performance is quite good.
