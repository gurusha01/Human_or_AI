This paper tackles the problem of discovering mid-level features using discriminative mean-shift. The algorithm proposed by the authors involves the modification of the standard mean-shift algorithm to a discriminative setting such that it can be applied to discover mid-level patches. The authors also propose a more principled way of evaluating the results of mid-level patch discovery using purity-coverage curves, and show that their algorithm outperforms existing methods in these metrics. In addition, their algorithm significantly outperforms existing methods on the commonly used MIT 67-scene dataset when used without fisher vectors, and is improved slightly when combined. While the overall performance improvement as compared to BoP+IFV [8] is "only" 2.7% (still significant), the performance when using mid-level patches alone improves significantly as compared to BoP [8] alone i.e. 46% vs 64%. 
Overall, I feel that the use of the discriminative mean-shift algorithm presented is novel, especially in this detection like setting, and the results are very promising. The paper is well written and the results are well analyzed. Thus, I would recommend that this paper be accepted to NIPS. 
Some minor concerns/suggestions: 
- What is the running time of your algorithm, and how does it compare to existing methods? 
- Will you release the source code after publication? 
- It might be worthwhile citing this paper since it shares a common name and mentioning why it's different: 
Wang, Junqiu, and Yasushi Yagi. "Discriminative mean shift tracking with auxiliary particles." Computer Visionâ€“ACCV 2007. Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2007. 576-585. 
- It would be interesting to try this approach on SUN where object segmentation is available to identify object categories that are commonly selected by the mid-level patches. There is likely to be some semantic structure in the automatic discovery. The paper proposes the idea of discriminative mean-shift for the discovery of mid-level visual elements. The paper has very promising results and is well written/analyzed.
