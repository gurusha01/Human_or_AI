This paper provides a theoretical analysis of two variants of policy iteration. 
The analysis improves the known worst-case iteration complexity by O(log(n)) in 
one case, and by the constant factor 2 in the other. They generalize their 
analysis for one variant run on deterministic MDPs, improving its iteration 
complexity by O(n). 
I cannot recommend this paper be accepted in its current form. The exposition 
is extremely rushed, and the improved bounds in themselves are not impressive. 
It is possible that the proof techniques provide some scientific value (as the 
authors claim), but this is incredibly difficult to distill from the paper. 
The proof techniques that improve the first two bounds follow prior work 
closely. The proofs in the deterministic MDP setting appear more novel, but 
(a) key terms, like transient and recurrent, are not defined and (b) the 
authors state that the assumptions required for their proofs are overly strong. 
That is, their correctness and applicability cannot be evaluated. 
The authors need to better motivate this work and more clearly 
describe/highlight their contributions.

After viewing author feedback and discussions with other reviewers, it is apparent the initial quality score was overly harsh. I suggest drawing more attention to contribution contained in the proofs themselves in the next revision to aid less astute readers like myself. I recommend this paper be rejected due as it does not appear to provide significantly better bounds, or any obviously insightful proof techniques.
