This paper extends determinantal point process (DPP) sampling schemes 
from discrete to continuous spaces by exploiting low-rank kernels. 
Standard kernels are approximated using the Nystroem or 
random Fourier features methods. The method is demonstrated on 
repulsive mixture models and separated sampling. 
The paper exploits a low rank kernel in order to derive an efficient 
"dual sampler", as described in Alg 1. The authors show in which cases 
of quality function and similarity kernel the necessary computations 
can be carried out for the RFF and Nystroem approximations (Supp tab 
1). This is a non-trivial piece of work. 
In sec 5 the continuous DPP is used as a prior on the means 
in a mixture model. However, note that the approximation 
derived before is not actually used; as the authors say 
"since we are sampling just one item from the DPP there is a closed 
form and we do not rely on approximations." The results show that 
DPPs do (as expected) have a repulsive effect, as evinced by 
the mixture weight entropies. 
Aside: surely to qualify as a repulsive mixture, the closeness of the 
means should really be relative to their variances, but in supp mat p 
4 the variances are independent of the means ... 
In sec 6 a DPP is used to sample a diverse set of poses from a given 
density. While the resulting poses are credibly diverse, I suspect 
that visually similar results could have been obtained e.g. using hard 
core processes (see p 1), or some scheme like farthest point 
clustering (Gonzales, 1985). 
Quality: As far as I can judge the material is technically correct. 
Clarity: Generally clear. 
As to Fig 1, I wanted more detail as to the defn of (15) -- for a 
given set X we can evaluate this, but how is the sum defined and 
evaluated? 
Originality: as the authors make clear, this work extends earlier work 
on low-rank approximations in discrete spaces. And as they mention the 
repulsive prior construction has been used before [20,32]. 
Significance: it is not very clear about the applicability of the main 
result. Sec 5 does not actually use it, and sec 6 is just a 
visualization which does not require a precise sampler. Of course it 
is possible that the result could be exploited in other interesting 
ways. 
Other: 
* l 102. [11] are not the first to show that a matrix with the form B^T B 
(D << N) has a fast eigendecomposition, while the form of the citation 
implies it is. For example this result was used in 
L. Sirovich and M. Kirby (1987). "Low-dimensional procedure for the 
characterization of human faces". Journal of the Optical Society of 
America A 4 (3): 519â€“524, but is surely 
in any good advanced linear algebra text, e.g. Wilkinson? 
* in eq 2 define the \bar{ \phi_n} notation (presumably as complex 
conjugate). 
* l 241-242 why not sigma^2 I instead of diag(sigma^2, \ldots, sigma^2), 
and the same with rho^2? 
* l 304 -- why use only 100 test observations? Reduce variance 
by using many more!
