The paper addresses the problem of single image blind deconvolution with non-uniform blur caused by camera shake. The authors propose a two step procedure: first to estimate the motion blur and second the recovery of the sought-after latent image through non-blind deconvolution. This procedure is common practice in blind deconvolution. The main contribution made here is the derivation of a Bayesian inference strategy for motion blur estimation. In a number of experiments the authors demonstrate the validity of their approach and compare its performance against other state-of-the-art methods. The mathematical derivation appears sound and the proposed scheme is claimed to exhibit a number of favourable properties. Although these details are discussed in some detail in the second half of Section 4, no empirical evidence is given, which would strengthen the argumentation and verify the claims made. The authors also miss to make connections to other recent approaches that advocate a similar line of reasoning, in particular [15] and the missing reference: 
S.D.Babacan, et al., "Bayesian Blind Deconvolution with General Sparse Image Priors", ECCV 2012 
In addition, the authors miss another relevant reference, namely 
R.Kohler, et al., "Recording and playback of camera shake: Benchmarking blind deconvolution with a real-world database." ECCV 2012. 
that would allow them to benchmark their approach against other state-of-the-art single image blind deblurring methods for both uniform and non-uniform blur. Besides, a number of questions remain unanswered (see below) in the presented exposition, that lower the overall quality of the paper. 
The paper is clearly structured and well written. Section 4 would benefit from a division in smaller subsections as it feels a bit lengthy for my tasting. Unfortunately, some important details are missing (e.g. which algorithm is used for the final non-blind deconvolution, see also comments below), which impair the overall clarity of the paper. 
The theoretical foundation of the proposed approach build on previous work [19,26], however its application to the problem of single image blind deconvolution seems novel. 
Although the presented algorithm seems to deliver comparable results to state-of-the-art algorithms, the provided insights are very limited. It remains unclear in which situations/cases the proposed method works better and why. It also fails to make connections to other recent relevant work (see above) and place its contribution into context, which lowers its significance considerably. 
Further comments: 
* What method is employed for the final non-blind deconvolution? 
* It is stated, that the approach is "parameter-free". Is this also true for the kernel size? 
* It is mentioned in Section 4, that initialization with a large $\lambda$ and its subsequent evolution render the deconvolution process more stable. It would be interesting to see a plot that shows the evolution of $\lambda$ in the course of the motion blur estimation process. 
* What basis (i.e. $B$ in Eq.(8)) is chosen for the experiments with non-uniform blur? Is $w^\bar_i$ evaluated for every pixel? If not, how are the evaluation locations chosen? 
* From the main paper it is not clear that a coarse-to-fine scheme is employed. Great if this could be made clearer. 
* What are typical run-times for the proposed method? 
* Large blur is challenging even for state-of-the-art methods. How does performance scale with kernels size? 
* The ringing artifacts in Whyte's result in Fig.4 are stemming primarily from the final non-blind deconvolution (see his talk slides). It would be more fair to use the one published on the accompanying project webpage (http://www.di.ens.fr/willow/research/deblurring/). 
* The correct reference for the efficient filter flow framework mentioned in Section 2 is 
M.Hirsch, et al., "Efficient filter flow for space-variant multiframe blind deconvolution." CVPR 2010. 
* What are the limitations of the proposed approach? 
 The paper presents an interesting Bayesian approach to motion blur estimation. Unfortunately, it fails to make connections to relevant previous work and lacks a quantitative evaluation for the case of camera shake removal with non-uniform blur, which lower its significance and value to the community considerably.
