This paper proposes a convex framework for splitting the dataset(s) into K subsets such that each subset has similar semantic class distributions and as distinct from each other as possible. Distinction, named as maximum distinctiveness, is achieved by maximizing the pairwise mean differences of subsets in the RKHS induced by a selected kernel. Each of these subsets are named as latent domains. Identification of K (number of latent domains) is achieved by maximizing average learnability (how well a classifier can be learned) within each latent domain. 
Even though forcing the distribution of the classes within each domain to be as similar as possible prevents the clusters to be dominated by a single class each, it may also be a limiting assumption for latent domain discovery for certain tasks. For instance if we consider the poses as the latent domains for an animal classification task(e.g. horses and cows), then latent domains distribution within each class might not be similar. For instance, we observe both horses and cows in left-right standing pose, however horses are not pictured in a sitting pose often whereas the cows are. 
Although the discovery of latent domains is not new, the idea of controlling class label distributions for better identification of latent domains within a (relaxed) convex framework is new. Identifying the number of latent domains through checking the quality of classification within each latent domain is also a notable practice which makes sure that the latent domain has enough number of samples for each class in order to better generalize and learn discrimination between classes. 
In several places the concepts of dataset, domain and latent domain is not clear and can easily be confused. These concepts should be clearly defined, and preferably with some supporting examples. Particularly the experiments section 4.2. needs clarification. As far as I understand, the words dataset and domain is used interchangeably since Si is both named as datasets and source domains. Nevertheless the experimental setting and the concept definition should be clarified in section 4.2. Additionally, maxk r(U_k,B) is not defined but used in eq.7. 
The experimental validation appears to be adequate. The results have a reasonable improvement above the baselines. However, why the current selection of source and target datasets to report on is preferred is not clear. For instance leave one dataset out adaptation might be a more reasonable evaluation. The qualitative results are helpful to see what the algorithm visually achieves. 
on line 074, the problem(learning latent domains) being stated as an unsupervised learning problem might be misleading since the methods use semantic class labels. The discovery of latent domains via encouraging similar class distribution in each latent domain formulated in a (relaxed) convex framework is a notable technical contribution. However the some concepts in the paper and the experimental validation need to be clarified.
