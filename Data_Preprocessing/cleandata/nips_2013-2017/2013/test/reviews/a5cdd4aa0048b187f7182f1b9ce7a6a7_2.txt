Shows how to design a convex least squares style surrogate loss for high arity multiclass losses that have a low rank structure. Paper is very well written. 
Only comment: given your introduction of the loss matrix \mathbf{L} why not state the condition in theorem 3 in matrix form? This is a very nicely written paper that shows how to design convex surrogates for multiclass losses in manner that makes the surrogate more tractable. This works when the target loss has a low rank structure. As is explained in the paper a number of popular losses have this structure and the authors show how to construct the efficient surrogate.
