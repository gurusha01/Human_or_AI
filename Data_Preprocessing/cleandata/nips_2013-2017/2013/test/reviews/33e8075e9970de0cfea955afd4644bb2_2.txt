This work is aimed to provide interface between the signal processing theory of wavelets and the deep neural network. What is presented is only a small step toward this goal, but is interesting in demonstrating the feasibility of the approach. 
It is interesting to see the various connections among wavelet construction and deep auto-encoder. 
The detail is difficult to follow, and I hope the presentation can be drastically improved to enhance the readability. 
 interesting work to bridge signal processing theory of wavelets and deep learning. But details are difficult to follow, and the presentation should be drastically improved to enhance the readability.
