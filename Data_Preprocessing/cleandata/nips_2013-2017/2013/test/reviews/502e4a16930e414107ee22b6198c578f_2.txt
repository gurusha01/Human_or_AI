This is a nice paper that tightens previous bounds on policy iteration, a problem on which recent progress has been made after decades of stagnation. The results are nice, though not shockingly impressive in themselves. Importantly, however, the paper provides short proofs of some key results and good, short summaries with real insight in cases where the proofs aren't short. The paper is extremely well written. 
Minor comments: 
Line 97.5: at least on state -> at least one state 
line 106: all iteration k -> all iterations k 
line 114.5: convergen often occur -> convergence often occurs 
line 203: on path -> on paths 
 Modest improvement on previous policy iteration results. Very nicely written paper, a pleasure to read.
