This paper presents new distributed algoritms for clustering methods that use centers as cluster representation. The new algorithms are shown to reduce the communication overhead. At the same communication cost, the new methods improve clustering objectives for both synthetic and three UCI datasets. 
The paper is very hard-core. More explanation about the derivation clue and the values of the theorems would be helpful. 
I am a little bit skeptical on the approximation quality of coreset when the dimensionality increases. Datasets in the current experiments are most low-dimensional. 
The title is too large. The work is actually on some particular clustering methods that uses centers and coresets. The word "graphs" is also vague, which does not reveal any highlights or distinguishable points. Improved methods for center-based distributed clustering are presented. The paper is very hard-core.
