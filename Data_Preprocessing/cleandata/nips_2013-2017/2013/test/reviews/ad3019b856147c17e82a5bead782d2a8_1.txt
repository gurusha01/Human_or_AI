This paper proposes a new approach for face verification (i.e. for predicting if 2 images represent the same person or not). The approach relies on an auxiliary training set containing several (15 in practice: 15) images of many different persons (in practice: 450). In the following, is it assumed that face images are preprocessed with low level features (HOG) followed by PCA and z-score normalization, giving one template per training image. At test time, the two images to be compared are encoded separately by the following steps: (i) first, the normalized dot product between the template of the test image and each one of the templates of the k-th person is computed (ii) second, the mean value of these dot products gives the k-th component of the representation of the test image (iii) the two previous steps are repeated for each different training persons, resulting in a 450-d representation (as the training set contains 450 persons). The same process is applied independently to the two images to be compared, and the final score is the normalized dot product between their so-computed representations. The experimental validation is done on 4 datasets (PubFig83, a new dataset introduced in the paper, PubFig and LFW). Good results are obtained but no comparisons with recent related work are given. In practice, the results far below from recent competing approaches. 
Positive points 
=============== 
- the paper is well written in the sense that, in addition to presenting a new approach for face recognition, it tries to make links with the theory of [1] and to discuss the biological plausibility of the proposed solution 
- the paper is clear 
- the experiments are interesting and reasonable 
Negative points 
=============== 
- the use of auxiliary datasets and more precisely the idea of representing images by the similarities with some sort of prototypes has a long history in computer vision and has received an increasing attention in recent years. E.g. [a] is based on training a separate linear SVM classifier for every exemplar in the training set and representing images by the outputs of these classifiers. More specifically, the use of auxiliary face datasets for transferring some knowledge about face is the central point of several recent papers (e.g. [b-i]). For example, [i] noticed that faces of the same person usually share their top neighbors (in the the auxiliary set). The approach is then to generate a ranking order list by sorting all other faces in the dataset by absolute distance and compute distance of two faces by using their ranking orders. [e] proposed the "associate-predict" model which builds on an extra generic identity 
data set, in which each identity contains multiple images 
with large intra-personal variation. To compare two faces with different pose/illumination, it first associate one input face with alike identities from the generic identity date set. The associated faces are used to predict the appearance of one input face under the setting of another input face. The proposed approach, even if it also relies on the use of an auxiliary training set, is sufficiently different from the above mentioned approaches, but the fact they are not cited nor discussed raises strong concerns over the paper. 
- my second concern is the experimental validation and more precisely the lack of comparisons with previous works. As said before, several competing approaches have been proposed to use auxiliary training sets for face recognition. Some of them learn distance function and are therefore not strictly comparable, but several use the training set to model test images, as the proposed approach does, and are therefore directly comparable. Such comparisons should be given. Moreover, the LFW's results page for the category 'Outside training data in recognition system' (category to which the paper belongs) reports results up to 95% which is much better than the 87.1% obtained by the paper. 
- Finally, the experimental validation does not demonstrate if the improvement is due to the method itself (as being an application of the theory of [1]) or is simply due to use of a good auxiliary dataset. A simple set of experiments consisting in representing test images as the normalized dot products with the whole set of test images (images will be represented by a 12,500-dimensional vector, possibly reduced by PCA), without doing any pooling could be useful. If the results are as good as the proposed approach, it would support more the theory of [a] than the theory of [1]. A the end, I have not been able to determine if the proposed face recognition framework is actually an application of [1] or more an exemplar based recognition system [a] (the SVM of [a] being replaced by a simple dot product). Another way to say is to say that there is a big gap between sections 1,2 and 3 where the notion of orbit, geometric transforms, groups, CFD signatures, etc. are at the basis of the recognition process and sections 4 and 5 where there is no more transforms, CDF signatures or whatever but a simple exemplar based recognition approach made by simple dot products.
