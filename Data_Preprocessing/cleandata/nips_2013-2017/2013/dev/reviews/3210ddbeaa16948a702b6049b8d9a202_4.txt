This paper shows that the collision probability after alpha-stable random projections can be approximated by functions of Chi-Sqaure similarity. In particular, when alpha = 1, the approximation has a close form. This result enables approximating Chi-Sqaure related kernels via linear kernels after sign Cauchy random projection. 
However, the bounds can be loose, and the application part seems rush and incomplete at the moment. 
The paper can be (easily) improved by turning into a more theoretical paper with only hints for applications. After all, the main contribution is the theoretical part. Despite the looseness of the bounds and the issue of the current application part, the paper is interesting, and may still have values in practice or at least motivate new techniques. 
After reading the reviews, author response, and discussion, my score (7) remains unchanged. I prefer a novel though unpolished paper to a polished incremental paper. I hope the writing will be improved in the final version if accepted. 
 The result is original. The new bounds are useful addition to the literature and the community.
