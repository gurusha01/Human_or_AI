This paper gives a new perspective on the Bayesian posterior updates (BPU) as
a system of iterated random functions (IRF) [4].
By proving a general convergence theorem of IRF with semigroup property,
the convergence of algorithms for change point detection problems [17] are analyzed.
The major contributions are
- to establish a general convergence theory for IRF with semigroup property (Theorem 1),
- to cast existing (exact) algorithms for the classical change point problem (CCPP) 
and the multiple change point problem (MCPP) in the IRF framework, and prove their 
convergence, based on Theorem 1.
- to propose a fast approximate algorithm for MCPP and prove its convergence,
based on Theorem 1.
I think this is a nice paper with a significant impact.
BPU is clearly a Markov chain, and so it might be natural that 
it is analyzed in the IRF framework.
However, the previous convergence results on IRF are not directly applicable to BPU,
because the Lipschitz condition is not satisfied in BPU.
Instead, the authors use semigroup property of BPU,
and establish another type of convergence theory.
I expect that the established theory would have wide range of applications.
Pros:
- A new perspective on BPU as a special case of IRF with semigroup property (3) is given.
- A general convergence theory (Theorem 1) for IRF with semigroup property 
is established, which might have wide range of potential applications.
- A fast algorithm (Section 4.1) for MCPP is proposed with its convergence 
guarantees (Theorem 2).
Cons:
- The relation between the theory (Theorem 2) and the experiment (Figure 1) is not 
clear (see the first one in 'Other comments' below).
- No practical application of the multiple change point detection is introduced 
(see the second one in 'Other comments' below).
Quality:
The paper is technically sound, and the claims are supported by theory.
Clarity:
The paper is clearly written, and well-organized.
Originality:
The perspective on BPU as IRF with semigroup property, 
and the obtained convergence theorem (Theorem 1) are novel.
Significance:
The found relation between BPU and IRF with semigroup property, 
and the established convergence theory could be used by other theoreticians 
to analyze algorithms for other problems.
Other comments:
- It would be nice if Eqs.(19) and (20) are somehow expressed in the posterior path
graphs in Figure 1. This would make it clear that the simulation supports Theorem 2.
In Section 4.3, it is said that 'in some cases, they might deviate for a while, 
but quickly snap back together once the change points have occurred.'
Readers cannot see this because the change points are not indicated.
- It would be nice if any practical example of MCCP is introduced
(I could not find any also in [17]).
Especially, I wonder in what applications the rule
lambdae = min(lambdas1, lambda_s2) is appropriate.
To me, it seems more natural to assume that the distribution of X_e
changes both at lambdas1 and at lambdas2.
Moreover, if I understand correctly, Theorem 2 guarantees the convergence 
after all the sensors are broken.
I suppose people are more interested in the convergence after any of the sensors 
is broken, or the sensor on which a user focuses is broken.
- Perhaps, some thetas in and around Eq.(4) should not be bold-faced.
- In Line 225, 'probabilities 10 by message-passing' looks corrupted.
Is 10 a citation?
- In the last line in Section 5, parentheses for Eq.(29) are missing.
