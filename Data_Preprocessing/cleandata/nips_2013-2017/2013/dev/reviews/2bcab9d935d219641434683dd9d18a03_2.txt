This paper considers two competing hypotheses of how the olfactory system could infer the presence and concentration of odors given the firing rates of olfactory receptor neurons responding to a complex, mixed scene. A simple probabilistic model is defined and two inference algorithms are proposed: one based on variational inference and another based on sampling. Dynamical update rules are derived in order to formulate these algorithms in a neurally plausible manner. The biological feasibility of these two algorithms is then assessed using simulated data. The authors conclude that either algorithm could hypothetically work within natural time constraints, and that the methods would be distinguishable based on observed firing patterns. 
This paper focuses on a popular theme at NIPS and within the broader computational neuroscience community, namely whether and how probabilistic reasoning and computation could be performed in neural systems. The authors extend a probabilistic model for olfaction introduced at NIPS 2012 (Beck et. al. [1]) by introducing a spike-and-slab prior over odor concentrations, and introduce two novel inference algorithms. Bayesian inference in these models is nontrivial, so developing neurally-plausible implementations of such algorithms is a challenge. The authors use a variety of interesting approaches to the problem of olfactory inference and develop novel and insightful proposals. 
The primary conclusion of this paper is that variational inference and sampling could both hypothetically work, but the authors provide little corroborating biological evidence to suggest that either is actually employed in real systems, or that the implementation-level requirements imposed by these algorithms are reasonable expectations for biological systems. A further assessment of the computational and anatomical constraints imposed by these algorithms is left open for future work. 
The inference algorithms proposed here are substantially different from other sampling-based approaches and contribute interesting ideas to the growing literature on probabilistic inference in neural circuits. However, it remains to be seen whether biological or experimental evidence can be found for probabilistic inference in olfactory systems. This paper builds on existing work by introducing a more reasonable probabilistic model and two novel inference algorithms for olfaction. Though technically sound and theoretically interesting, the biological constraints required to realize these algorithms in neural systems are substantial.
