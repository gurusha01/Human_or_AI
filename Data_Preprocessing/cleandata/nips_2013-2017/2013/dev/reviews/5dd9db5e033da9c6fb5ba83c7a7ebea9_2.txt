* Summary 
The paper presents an algorithm for exact submodular minimization based on solving a related strongly convex function via Douglas-Rachford splitting. A key insight in the paper is to construct a dual problem whose structure allows Douglas-Rachford splitting to be applied. 
* Details 
(Quality) The paper is technically strong but lacking in two main respects. First, the experimental evaluation while demonstrating fast convergence of the proposed method over competing approaches does not include sufficient detail for reproducibility. Moreover, the MRF problem can be solved by graphs cuts (for which online code is available). It would be interesting to compare running time of the proposed method against graph cuts for this problem (even with all the standard caveats---Matlab vs C, more general method vs specialized one, etc). I also do not understand why the parallel methods take more iterations to converge than the standard implementations in Figure 2. Can the authors please comment. 
Second, while the paper demonstrates that the proposed method is empirically faster than competing approaches it does not provide any theoretical guarantees. Competing algorithms are shown to be O(1/t) or O(1/sqrt{t}). What is the running time of the Douglas-Rachford approach? 
(Clarity) Over all the paper is clear written and (relative to the subject matter) easy to follow. Two suggestions that could improve the readability are: 
1. On line 072 the authors discuss a solution method via level sets. However, details of this are missing here and the method only becomes apparent in section 2 (L150). Some clarification around line 072 would help. 
2. Define y(A) = \sum{a \in A} ya around line 134. 
(Originality) The approach makes use of known techniques but their combination is original. 
(Significance) Given the pervasiveness of submodular functions in machine learning a fast and general minimization algorithm is likely to have an impact. The only drawback of the current method is that specialized methods are needed for projecting onto B(F_i) for each subproblem. 
 The paper presents a principled approach to minimizing decomposeable submodular functions. The approach is generally well described but some additional details could help improve the paper.
