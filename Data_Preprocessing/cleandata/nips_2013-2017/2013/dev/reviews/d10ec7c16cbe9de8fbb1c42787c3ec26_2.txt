The paper presents an interesting interpretation of Bayesian inference 
as as a system of iterated random functions, with a particular focus on 
Bayesian changepoint detection. This interpretation allows for 
convergence analysis of message passing algorithms which is of wide 
interest. The general approach for convergence analysis is presented 
with focus on providing details of the proof technique. 
I found the interpretation of Bayesian inference as iterated random 
functions interesting and think others will as well. It was interesting 
to see that we can derive algorithms that we can show to have geometric 
convergence. Overall I think the paper would be improved if there was 
more of a discussion and focus on the implications of this theory and 
the insights it gives us into obtaining efficient algorithms. Here there 
was a specific focus on changepoint detection: was this special for some 
reason. What other model classes can we extend this to and for which it is reasonable 
to assume the conditions will hold. The simulation section can be improved 
to be more clear on the setup, indicating where the changepoints are 
and connecting the observed with theoretical convergence over n. 
 An interesting interpretation of the paper showing convergence analysis for message passing algorithms. Can be improved by looking into accessibility for many not familiar with the tools used here and the settings in which such tools should be used.
