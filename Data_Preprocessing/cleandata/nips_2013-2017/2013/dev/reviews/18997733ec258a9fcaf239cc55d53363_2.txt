-------Original Comments------------- 
This paper provides a UCB-based contextual bandit algorithm that can exploit information given in the form of a graph structure. In particular the authors consider a contextual bandit model with linear payoffs and unknown coefficient vectors that depend on the user. A graph structure on the users is given, and an assumption on the relationship between the graph structure and the user coefficient vectors ensures that the graph provides meaningful information about the coefficient vectors. The algorithm then exploits this information, using the Laplacian matrix of the graph to propagate information gained about one user to other users with similar coefficient vectors. The authors provide both a regret bound and numerical experiments to support their proposed approach. 
This is a natural extension of the techniques currently available, and part of an important general direction to integrate bandit ideas in more practical scenarios. Overall the paper is quite well written. However there are some sentences where the English is not quite correct (see below for some of these typos), and I did not find the intuition given in Section 4 to be easy to understand. 
--------After Rebuttal-------------- 
Having discussed this submission in detail with the other reviewers, I have decided to lower my quality score. Initially I thought that my lack of familiarity with graph based methods hindered my understanding of the intuition and choices made in the paper. However, now I am convinced that the intuition is not well given. Also, it is strange to see the implementation of CB, but the analysis of TCB. There is no discussion of whether CB can be analysed or not. While it is true that there is a discrepency between LinUCB and SupLinUCB, the former was studied in detail empirically, and the latter in theory in a separate paper. There is nothing wrong (technically) with the elements of the contribution, I no longer find it to be a strong candidate for acceptance.

However the work is not surprising, and there are several parts of the work, such as the intuition, which are not well executed.
