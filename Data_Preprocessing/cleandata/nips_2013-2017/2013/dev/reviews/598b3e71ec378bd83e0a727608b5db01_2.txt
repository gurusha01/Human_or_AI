Paper summary: 
-------------- 
The paper presents algorithms and their analysis for several settings of distributed best-arm identification in multiarmed bandits (MAB) problem. The authors consider best-arm and epsilon-best arm identification by k "workers" with one and with R communication rounds. For one round of communication the authors demonstrate \sqrt{k} speed-up and for R rounds of communication the authors demonstrate \epsilon^{2/R} k speed-up. In particular, for R = O(log(1/\epsilon)) the algorithm achieves the best-possible speed-up factor of k. The result for one communication round is accompanied by a matching lower bound. 
Quality, clarity, originality, and significance: 
------------------------------------------------ 
The paper is of good quality, clearly written, significant, and original. (I did not check the supplementary material, except for the proof of the lower bound, but other results sound plausible). I think this is a good paper that would be interesting to the NIPS community. My comments are all minor and can be easily corrected by the authors.
