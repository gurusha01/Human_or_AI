Response to author feedback: 
Thank you for clarifying the novelty of the robust PCA approached; it is a good idea to also describe the novelty saliently in the paper. I suggest also explicitly mentioning the possibility of the generalization to the case with more than one PCA component, even if the full proof would not fit in this paper. Simply saying in the Introduction that you consider here the special case of one component, since it is already an interesting case backed up with positive empirical experiments, would already help a lot. 
Summary: 
The paper generalizes principal component regression (PCR) by providing a robust 
variant of the technique based on multivariate Kendall's tau in place of the covariance 
matrix. The authors then provide a simple algorithm for learning the model 
and, more importantly, analyze its theoretical properties, providing the rate 
of convergence. Finally, the model is demonstrated on simulated and equity data. 
Quality: 
The method presented in the paper is fairly straightforward, 
consisting merely of estimating the population Kendall's tau, 
computing its first eigenvector, and then performing linear 
regression to the observations. The method is very intuitive; 
it is easy to understand why this should be preferred to 
classical PCR when working with data that has outliers. 
The use of Kendall's tau in place of the covariance matrix in 
PCA is a nice idea and also well justified based on Oja's 
theorem. However, it remains unclear whether this should be 
considered as a novel contribution of the paper; no citations 
for earlier works are given, but the authors do not seem to 
describe it as a key contribution of the paper either. I 
believe it has potential for wider impact than the particular 
example considered in this paper, and one could imagine 
already a paper studying such a robust PCA estimator as a 
valuable contribution. To my knowledge, the closest work here 
would be the very recent paper by Han and Liu in ICML'13. Can 
the authors clarify the relationship with that paper? 
The analysis of the theoretical properties of PCR is 
valuable. However, the whole discussion is limited to the 
special case of simple PCR where the outcome is assumed to be 
related only to the first principal component. Do any of the 
results generalize to the more general case where the outcome 
is related to the first K components? At least the authors 
should explicitly mention that they limit the theoretical 
analysis to this special case; now the paper never even 
mentions the PCR setup I would consider as the standard one. 
The experiments seem to be conducted properly and they clearly 
illustrate the advantage of the robust variant; such a set is 
sufficient for a theoretical paper. I like the fact that the 
authors show how the equity data is not normally distributed, 
motivating the example. 
Clarity: 
The paper is reasonably well written, to the degree that a 
theory-heavy paper can be. However, the exact scope and 
contributions are a bit vague; it is unclear whether the use 
of Kendall's tau for robust PCA is novel, the authors do not 
mention they limit the analysis to a special case of PCR, and 
some of the earlier results are listed as "well known" without 
citations. 
One problem is that the proofs for the perhaps main 
contributions of the paper, Theorems 3.2 and 3.3, are left for 
Supplementary material, without even mentioning it in the 
paper itself. It is understandable that writing out the full 
proofs would take too much space here, but some sort of an 
outline would be useful. 
Originality: 
The paper has two novelties: it presents a novel robust PCR 
technique and it provides new theoretical analysis of PCR in 
general. The significance of the first relies fully on whether 
the use of Kendall's tau in PCA should be considered as a 
novel contribution; if not, the algorithm for robust PCR is 
trivial. 
The theoretical analysis provides new useful results and is 
based on very recent works by Oja, Vu and Lei, and Ravikumar 
et al. 
Significance: 
The robust method is clearly useful for anyone applying PCR, 
especially in light of the theoretical analysis for the 
convergence rate. However, the significance may be limited due 
to the fact that both the theoretical analysis and the 
simulation experiment rely on the simple model where the 
output only depends on the first principal component. The 
application to the equity data suggests the method works well 
in practice, but is merely one example. 
Detailed comments: 
- The 2nd sentence of Abstract is very complex and tries to lay out all the dimensions 
of the paper at once. You should consider splitting it into at least two sentences. 
- Page 3: "As a well-known result..." would need a citation. In general, "well known" 
is not good use of scientific language; you use it twice in the same paragraph for 
results that are not obvious for most readers. 
- Section 3.1: It is good to remind the readers about the elliptical distribution, 
but listing all the equivalent formulations is not be necessary when the rest 
of the analysis only uses one of them. 
 The paper presents a new method for robust principal componentregression and proves interesting theoretical results for PCR in general.The main shortcoming is limiting the analysis to the simplest case of PCRwith only one principal component.
