The article was motivated by the difficult problem of inferring neurons and their assemblies from Calcium imaging recordings. It proposes a "bilevel sparse heterarchical matrix factorization", whereby neurons (i.e. their pixel-correlates), and the assemblies they belong to (potentially >1 per neuron), are inferred jointly. More generally, it offers a decomposition of an observation matrix into a product of a number of sparse matrices, with the rank decreasing from lower to higher levels. It allows for imposing (structured) sparsity constraints at every level, and is not limited to hierarchical structures, as in the previous work (Jenatton and all, 2012; Kim and Xing, 2012). In addition, their method does not require an a priori assumption on the exact number of assemblies (although the authors mention that the number of inferred assemblies depends on the optimisation parameters, that need to be defined by user). 
The method is shown to work well on synthetic data: 
(i) it recovered assembly assignments of neurons with sensitivity surpassing that of MNMMF (Cichocki and Zdunek, 2006), or KSVDS (Rubinstein and all, 2010), all methods, including the proposed one, were initialised with Adina cell sorting (Diego and all, 2013). 
(ii) it detected calcium transients of single neurons with sensitivity higher than MNMMF, Adina or cell sorting. 
An example from analysing real experimental data (calcium imaging in rat hippocampus) is also given, although the reviewer was not sure what to conclude from these images (other than neurons seem to be less spatially sparse than in the initial state derived from Adina algorithm). 
The parallel inference of structures at every level, including the most basic one (the dictionary), as well as the time courses of at each level, is emphasised throughout the article, it is said to be the reason for the more robust identification of neuronal time courses. However, the inferred dictionary (images of single neurons) is never discussed. Images of such reconstructions (such as supplementary Fig. 6), next to the ground truth and reconstructions from other methods, would be far more interesting to the reviewer than the images of calcium recordings, where the ground truth is unknown (Fig. 6). 
Quality 
This paper is technically sound. It provides an in-depth description of the proposed cost function, with details of the optimisation made available in the Supplemental Material. There might be some details missing, such as how to optimise the trade-off parameters (or, how they chose and what values their used in their simulations), how were the adjacency matrices binarized (to yield true and false positives for their evaluation, l. 308), or how sensitive was the method to levels of noise they tested (l.300), but overall, I find the article a complete piece of work. 
Clarity 
The paper is clearly written. 
Originality 
To the best of my knowledge, the proposed approach is a new one. Relevant literature is adequately referenced. 
Significance 
The results are potentially important for any lab performing calcium imaging on cell assemblies. As the authors have shown, the parallel optimisation of assembly assignments and time courses at every level of interest improves robustness of the inference. For any experiment that can assume a fairly coherent activation of neurons within an assembly - this method should be of great value. 
One more advantage is the flexibility in imposing prior knowledge on any level of detail. (It is a pity that the method apparently didn't work well without initialising dictionary by one obtained from Adina. In principle, it should be possible to incorporate the same knowledge that Adina uses at the 0-th level of inference..) 
 An interesting, technically sound article, of potential value to anyone working with structured data (i.e., calcium imaging of neural assemblies).
