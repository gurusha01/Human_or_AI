Winner-take-all modules are incorporated into an otherwise 
feed-forward architecture, and trained via backpropagation. The 
implementation is very straightforward, and the measured performance 
is impressive. 
We should not let the simplicity, and lack of associated mathematics 
or analysis, preclude acceptance. This may be an important discovery, 
and there are a variety of obvious avenues for analysis. For example, 
the activations in a network of this sort would be extremely sparse, 
so mathematics from the study of sparseness might be brought to bear. 
Other practical extensions also come immediately to mind.
