This paper provides a very interesting nonparametric approach to test for three-variable interactions (and independence) using embedding properties of ISPD kernels. The paper is overall well-written, clear and exhaustive in its coverage of the underlying algebraic proofs. With the need for efficient statistical testing tools to detect complex interaction effects in bioinformatics, this work seems promising in its applications. 
Given the stated illustrative purpose of identifying gene interactions, it could have been nice to see experiments on non-synthetic data and/or comparison of performances to other genomics methods (such as based on partial correlation). Also, the possibility raised in the concluding paragraph that the test could be extended to more than 3 variables seems to be somewhat contradicted by the point raised in section 4.3. Finally, it would be of great interest to see how the method behaves in large-dimensional spaces. 
Minor issue: There is no reference to Figure 3 in the main text A solid and novel statistical approach, with promising applications. Would benefit from more exhaustive performance comparison to other state-of-the-art methods for interaction testing
