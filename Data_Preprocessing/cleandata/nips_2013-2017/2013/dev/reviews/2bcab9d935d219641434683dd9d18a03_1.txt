This study investigates two algorithms for fast inference in generative models of olfaction. Their goal is to compute the most likely, linear mixture of odors comprising an olfactory stimulus. One of the algorithms employs variational inference, while the other is based on a sampling scheme. Simulations demonstrate that both algorithms perform suitably well, and the authors claim that inference is performed rapidly within the first 100 ms, while eliminating false positives (detection of odors not present in a particular stimulus) takes much longer and is difficult when more than two odors are present. As the inference schemes are fundamentally different, it is concluded that in an experiment, it would be possible to decide which of these alternatives is used by the brain. 
The manuscript is nicely written and touches an interesting topic. The mathematical section is dense, but technically sound, and it makes realistic assumptions about the problem that the olfactory system has to solve. 
The most problematic issue is the claim that inference can be performed within equally short time intervals as in the brain. It is based on the time constants introduced in equation 3.10 which are choosen to match neural time constants. However, on the right hand side of these DEQs there are many nonlinearities (log and exp) - and it is not clear whether a neural system would be able to perform these operations with the required precision in the time given by these time constants. Similar remarks also apply to the second, sampling-based algorithm. The authors state in the discussion that a realistic neural implementation would probably decrease performance, but I think that the problems with timing would be even more severe. 
A second issue which is partly unclear concerns the evaluation of the two models against experimental data, in particular if both models will be implemented as spike-based networks. Here, the discussion is a bit vague - what exactly has to be measured in order to distinguish between the sampling and variational inference hypothesis? 
In summary, I think the manuscript is technically very interesting, but whether it provides a suitable approach to explain olfaction in the brain remains doubtful. 
Minor comments: 
Figure 1: the curves are barely distinguishable from the axes - try to use a logarithmic vertical axis, don't stretch the figure over the whole page.

 An analysis of two algorithms for fast inference in generative models of olfaction is presented. While sound and interesting some doubts remain about its explanatory potential.
