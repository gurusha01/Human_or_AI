This paper casts the problem of minimizing decomposable submodular functions as an orthogonal projection problem to obtain easily parallelizable algorithms. Furthermore, by focusing on a special subclass of decomposable functions, they can prove the proximal problem can be solved in fewer iterations than currently possible. 
The authors consider several existing methods for minimizing the Lovasz extension over [0,1]^n, experimentally verify their claims. 
Unfortunately there is no empirical verification of the speedups in the case of implementation as a parallel algorithm, which is advertised as a selling point of the paper. 
The paper is well-written and clear. This paper casts the problem of minimizing decomposable submodular functions as an orthogonal projection problem to obtain easily parallelizable algorithms. Furthermore, by focusing on a special subclass of decomposable functions, they can prove the proximal problem can be solved in fewer iterations than currently possible.
