This paper presents iterated random functions and discusses the theory of its convergence. This theory is then used to analyze the convergence of message passing algorithms for Bayesian inference. 
Quality: Excellent. 
Clarity: Good. 
This paper is original and makes significant contributions. 
I should admit that I haven't gone through the proofs in complete details, but at the first pass it looks ok to me. I will surely be spending next few days checking things more carefully. 
Some questions: 
1) What are typical value of -I+epsilon? Is it always negative? If not, under what condition will it be. 
2) Can these results be used to explain the convergence for other graphical models where convergence is known, for example, BP on a tree? To my knowledge, there is very little work done on the analysis of message-passing algorithm, and hence any such attempts are very useful. This paper uses iterated random functions to analyze the convergence of message passing, which is very interesting. I hope that the presented approach can be generalized to other graphical models, to better understand the convergence of message passing algorithms.
