This paper addresses a problem of building hypothesis tests based on kernel methods for identifying three variable interactions. This work extends HSIC (Hilbert Schmidt Independence Criterion), which is designed to detect two variable interactions based on kernel methods. There exists several types of three variable interactions, but the one authors try to detect one called Lancaster interaction, which is a singed measure defined as ¥delta L = Pxyx -PxyPz - PxzPy - PyzPx - 2 PxPyPz. In the proposed procedure, the above marginal and joint probabilities are all embedded into kernel Hilbert space, and guaranteed to work as long as they satisfy ISPD (Integrally Strictly Positive Definite) condition. In simulation experiments, permutation test is employed with ¥delta L as a test statistic to show the ability of the proposed method in identifying three way interactions. 
In the middle of the page 8, "Figure 2 plots the Type II error" should be "Figure 3". The paper is clearly written with appropriate references and proofs. As is written in the manuscript, extension of this method to detecting higher degrees of interactions, and to detecting structured interactions is useful.
