The paper extends the existing machine of kernel dependence tests to three way interactions. This is an interesting and well executed piece of work that attacks an important problem for which there are very limited tools at present. The paper is generally well written. 
Some minor comments. 
Explain V-structure more explicitly on its first use. 
Give a pointer to V-statistics (I had heard of U-Statistics, but not V-statistics) 
Equation (1) does not make sense as written. You need to define P^* more clearly. The "where" after (1) does not make it clear. 
In the experiments, explain sample size.  Nice extension of kernel dependence tests to three-way interactions.
