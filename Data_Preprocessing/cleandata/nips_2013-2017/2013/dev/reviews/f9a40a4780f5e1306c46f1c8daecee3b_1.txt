As far as I can see, the method favors descriptions which are mainly based on the spike count. I think, it would be interesting to see, how the method performs in situations, in which there are other higher-order dependencies apart from spike count. Specifically, including a comparison between other methods such as BUB in situations, in which spike-trains are, for example, generated according to a GLM, would be a more convincing argument of the accuracy. 
minor points: 
line 163: reference missing 
line 221: \alpha=0 implies uniform distribution? 
line 296: for -->form The manuscript is well written and the feasibility of the approach is sufficiently demonstrated by the presented experiments.
