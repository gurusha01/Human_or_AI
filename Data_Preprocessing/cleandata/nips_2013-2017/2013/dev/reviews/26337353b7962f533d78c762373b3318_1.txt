This paper proposes a method of decomposing a matrix into a product of more than 
two sparse matrices in a hierarchical manner, where the rank decreases from 
the lower to higher levels. This method is called multi-level sparse matrix 
factorization. One benefit of such a decomposition is that different 
levels of regularization may be performed at different levels. 
Overall, the general idea of multi-level sparse factorization is original and 
has been clearly described. 
1) Tuning 
Some methods for data-driven tuning may be derived as opposed to a user-specified 
values. 
2) Optimization 
Can something be said about convergence properties of the proposed learning 
aglorithm, such as convergenec speed or computational complexity?  An interesting and novel method.
