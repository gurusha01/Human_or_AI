The RDC is a non-linear dependency estimator that satisfies Renyi's criteria and exploits the very recent FastFood speedup trick (ICML13). This is a straightforward recipe: 1) copularize the data, effectively preserving the dependency structure while ignoring the marginals, 2) sample k non-linear features of each datum (inspired from Bochner's theorem) and 3) solve the regular CCA eigenvalue problem on the resulting paired datasets. Ultimately, RDC feels like a copularised variation of kCCA (misleading as this may sound). Its efficiency is illustrated successfully on a set of classical non-linear bivariate dependency scenarios and 12 real datasets via a forward feature selection procedure. 
I found the paper very clear and easy to understand. Even though the idea simply puts together the right pieces, it remains a significant contribution to the literature. 
Some notes: 
- I do not like that k was simply 'set to 10'. It seems to play a more important role than the paper implies. 
- line 74: what do you mean by "same structure as HGR"? 
- eq.(5): m -> n 
- line 217: which is independent -> by independence RDC is a straightforward and computationally efficient estimator of the HGR coefficient but the choice of k deserves more discussion.I've read the author's rebuttal.
