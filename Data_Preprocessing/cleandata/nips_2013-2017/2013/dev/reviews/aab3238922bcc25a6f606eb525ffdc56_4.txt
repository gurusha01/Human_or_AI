This paper gives a new approach to nonlinear correlation. The approach consists of three steps: (1) copula transform, (2) random nonlinear projection, and (3) CCA. In each step, the authors give a theoretical guarantee to make the approach convincing. The authors demonstrate the usefulness of the approach using synthetic and real data set. 
This is a well-written paper having high novelty. As the authors describe, the RDC score is easy to compute. Their experiments, Fig.4 in particular, clearly demonstrate the utility of the approach. I enjoyed reading the paper very much. Although calculating nonlinear correlation itself has not been the central topic in the machine learning community, I found it an interesting building block for more realistic tasks such as regression as one of the experiments already suggests. I recommend accepting the paper. 
 New and interesting approach to the metric of nonlinear correlation. The novelty is high.
