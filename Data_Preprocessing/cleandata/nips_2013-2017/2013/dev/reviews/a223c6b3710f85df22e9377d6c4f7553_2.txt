This is a theory paper on model selection in the large p small n scenario. The authors developed a generalized irrepresentability condition and applied it for studying the so-called GAUSS-LASSO selector. This paper is on the theoretical studies of the LASSO type selector, and some experimental results were provided in the appendix. 
The main contribution of this paper is the proposed generalized irrepresentability condition which provides a weaker condition than the widely used irrepresentability condition. It is motivated by studying the KKT conditions of LASSO in the noiseless case. The authors applied this proposed generalized irrepresentability condition to study the GAUSS-LASSO selector. The GAUSS-LASSO selector performs a LASSO selection, then a least squares estimation on the LASSO selected variables, and sets the selected variables as the leading ones of the least squares fit. More specifically, the authors showed that there exists a threshold for the regularization parameter below which the support of the Lasso estimator remains the same and contains the support for the ground truth, and the authors established the theoretical results for LASSO in both deterministic and random designs. 
Theorem 2 showed that the support of the signed support of the Lasso estimator is the same as that in the zero-noise problem with high probability. However, it is worthwhile to note that the conditions in Eq. (13-14) might not always hold. For example, when the noisy level is high, one may not find a suitable lambda or c_1 > 1 that satisfies Eq. (13). 
Minor comments: 
1. Lemma 2.1, Eq. (16) => Eq. (5) 
2. v0, T0 is not easy to understand from the discussion in Section 1.3, although it should denote the restriction of v0 to the indices in T0. 
After reading other reviewers' comments and the author response, the reviewer would like to keep the original recommendation. This an interesting theory paper on model selection in the large p small n scenario.
