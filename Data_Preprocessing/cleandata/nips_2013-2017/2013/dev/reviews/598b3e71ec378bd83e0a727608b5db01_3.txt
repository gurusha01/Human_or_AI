The paper considers the problem of minimizing the simple regret in multi-armed bandit problems, that is, it is concerned with the sample complexity of identifying the arm with highest payoff. The authors aim to find out whether it is possible to speed up previously known algorithms by parallel processing on k processors. They propose an algorithm that attains a sqrt(k) speedup by letting the nodes communicate only once, and they show that no greater speedup can be achieved when restricting communication to a single round. Furthermore, it is shown that it is possible to attain the optimal speedup of k by allowing O(log 1/epsilon) communication rounds, where epsilon is the desired precision. 
I have greatly enjoyed reading the paper; it is very well-written. Even though it seemed to me that every interesting problem has already been solved concerning the problem of best-arm selection, the authors manage to come up with a novel, practically relevant framework, and prove elegant results concerning the complexity of the resulting learning problem. The results are quite original, even though proving them did not need any spectacular new techniques. Nevertheless, the technical content seems sound. Overall, I have only very minor complaints/additional questions concerning the paper. 
Detailed comments 
------------------------- 
182 The results concerning using Alg 3 for selecting the best arm are not communicated appropriately. You only state your results for epsilon > 0, these should be also stated in terms of Delta_* for completeness. 
194 In the last row, r -> R to stay consistent with Corollary 4.2 
211 Wouldn't it be more straightforward to require that an algorithm successfully returns the best arm with probability at least 1-delta? Kalyanakrishnan et al. (2012) and Gabillon et al. (2012) provide such algorithms for the more general problem of selecting the m best arms. Any comment on how your results generalize to that setting? 
263 The wording of Lemma 3.3 is somewhat confusing: as can be deducted from the proof of Lemma 3.4, it should say that the probability that a fixed player identifies the best arm with such and such probability. Currently, the statement can be misunderstood as if it was saying that all players identify the correct arm with said probability. 
307 Even though I understand that you did not try to optimize the constants, can you give any insights as to how much these factors can be possibly improved? These factors of 400 and 50 seem to come out of nowhere, is it possible to significantly reduce them?

 The paper provides an elegant solution to a well-motivated new learning problem. The writing style and the technical quality is excellent.
