The authors present a new method for robust principal component regression for 
non-Gaussian data. First, they show that principal component regression 
outperforms classical linear regression when the dimensionality and the sample 
size are allowed to increase by being insensitive to collinearity and 
exploiting low rank structure. They demonstrate their theoretical calculations 
by sweeping parameters and show that mean square error follows theory. Then the 
authors develop a new method for doing principal component regression by 
assuming the random vector and noise are elliptically distributed, a more 
general assumption than the standard Gaussian assumption. They demonstrate 
that this more general method outperforms traditional principal component 
regression on different elliptical distributions (multivariate-t, EC1, EC2), 
and show that it achieves similar performance for Gaussian distributions. 
Finally, they compare performance on real finance data and demonstrate that 
their new method outperforms the standard principal component regression and 
the standard lasso (linear regression) technique. 
This paper is very high quality. The introduction presents a clear explanation 
of related work and goes on to explain the significant contributions made by 
this work. The sections are logically organized, and the math is explained 
well. The figures support the arguments put forth by the authors. The authors 
new principal component method outperforms standard principal component method 
on both generated data and real world data. 
The authors could clarify how they implemented lasso regression when performing 
the simulation study and when analyzing equity data. How was the number of 
selected features chosen from the lasso method? Was the threshold varied up and 
down to change the sparsity pattern or was the lasso trade-off parameter 
varied? After the features were chosen was the solution polished? That is, the 
sparsity pattern can be determined from using lasso regression, but then the 
regression can be re-run (polished) with the fixed sparsity pattern without the 
additional $l_1$ cost function. 
Finally, when looking at equity data. The authors chose a subset of all stock 
data. Were other categories tested or was there a particular reason why the 
authors focused on this category? Their results would be even stronger if they 
demonstrated improved performance in multiple sectors. The authors present a high quality, thorough paper on a new method for robustprincipal component regression. The authors could clarify a few minor points,but the paper is overall solid work.
