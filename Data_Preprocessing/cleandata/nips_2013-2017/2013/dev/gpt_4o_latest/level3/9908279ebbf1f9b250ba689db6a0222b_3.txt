The paper introduces a robust sparse principal component regression (RPCR) method leveraging multivariate Kendall's tau for high-dimensional, non-Gaussian data. It claims two main contributions: (1) a theoretical characterization of the advantages of classical principal component regression (PCR) over least squares regression in low-dimensional Gaussian settings, and (2) the development of a robust sparse PCR method for high-dimensional data under elliptical distributions, with theoretical guarantees and empirical validation. While the paper addresses an important problem, several aspects require clarification and improvement.
Strengths:  
The paper tackles a relevant and challenging problem, particularly for applications in finance and biomedical imaging where data often exhibit heavy tails and non-Gaussian behavior. The use of elliptical distributions generalizes Gaussian assumptions, making the method more broadly applicable. The incorporation of multivariate Kendall's tau for robust covariance estimation is a promising idea for handling outliers. The theoretical convergence guarantees under both "easiest" and "hardest" conditions are valuable, and the experiments convincingly demonstrate the method's advantages over classical PCR and lasso, especially for non-Gaussian data. The real-world application to equity data further highlights the practical utility of the proposed approach.
Weaknesses:  
1. Novelty Clarification: The novelty of using Kendall's tau for PCA is not explicitly justified. While the method is intuitive, it is unclear if this approach is original or merely a straightforward application of existing techniques. The authors should explicitly discuss how their method differs from prior work, particularly Han and Liu (2013a), which also uses Kendall's tau for robust PCA.  
2. Theoretical Analysis Limitation: The theoretical results are restricted to the simplest case of PCR with one principal component. The authors should acknowledge this limitation and discuss potential extensions to multiple components.  
3. Clarity Issues: The paper is dense and occasionally vague. For instance, the abstract's second sentence is overly complex and should be split for clarity. Additionally, claims of "well-known" results lack citations, and proofs relegated to the supplementary material are not adequately referenced in the main text. Section 3.1 could also be streamlined by focusing on the specific elliptical formulation used in the analysis.  
4. Originality Concerns: If the use of Kendall's tau for PCA is not novel, the contribution may reduce to a straightforward application of robust covariance estimation to PCR, which could limit its originality.  
5. Significance of Results: The reliance on a single-component model in both theory and experiments limits the broader applicability of the method. Extending the analysis to multiple components would significantly enhance the paper's impact.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:  
Pros:  
- Addresses a critical problem in robust regression for high-dimensional, non-Gaussian data.  
- Theoretical guarantees and empirical results are well-aligned and demonstrate the method's utility.  
- Practical relevance is supported by a real-world application to equity data.  
Cons:  
- Novelty of the approach is unclear, particularly the use of Kendall's tau for PCA.  
- Theoretical analysis is limited to single-component PCR, restricting generalizability.  
- Writing and organization issues hinder clarity and accessibility.
Suggestions for Improvement:  
- Clearly articulate the novelty of the proposed method and its distinction from prior work.  
- Extend theoretical analysis to multiple components or explicitly acknowledge the limitation.  
- Improve clarity by revising the abstract, providing citations for "well-known" results, and referencing supplementary proofs in the main text.  
- Simplify Section 3.1 by focusing on the specific elliptical formulation used.  
In summary, while the paper provides a useful contribution to robust regression, its novelty and scope need clarification and expansion. With revisions, it could be a strong addition to the conference.
