This paper presents a novel interpretation of Bayesian inference as a system of iterated random functions (IRFs) with a semigroup property, focusing on Bayesian changepoint detection. The authors develop a general convergence theory for IRFs and apply it to analyze both exact and approximate message-passing algorithms in the context of sequential changepoint problems. The work is technically sound, with rigorous theoretical analysis and proofs, and it contributes to the sparse literature on convergence analysis for message-passing algorithms, particularly in graphical models.
Strengths:  
1. Originality: The interpretation of Bayesian inference as IRFs with a semigroup property is innovative and provides a new lens for understanding convergence in Bayesian updates. This perspective appears to be novel and potentially impactful for broader applications in Bayesian inference.  
2. Technical Contributions: The paper provides a general framework for analyzing convergence, extending beyond traditional contraction-based methods. The derivation of conditions for geometric convergence is a significant contribution, particularly for approximate algorithms.  
3. Relevance: The results are applicable to distributed changepoint detection problems, which are important in areas such as sensor networks and time-series analysis. The proposed approximate message-passing algorithm is computationally efficient, addressing scalability issues in large networks.  
4. Rigor: The theoretical results are well-supported by detailed proofs, and the authors provide clear conditions under which convergence is guaranteed.
Weaknesses:  
1. Scope of Applicability: While the focus on changepoint detection is compelling, the paper does not sufficiently address how the IRF framework might generalize to other Bayesian model classes. This limits the perceived breadth of the contribution.  
2. Discussion of Implications: The discussion on the practical implications of the theory, particularly its insights into efficient algorithm design, is underdeveloped. Expanding this section would enhance the paper's impact.  
3. Simulation Clarity: The simulation section lacks sufficient detail on the experimental setup, such as the placement of changepoints and the connection between observed and theoretical convergence rates. This makes it difficult to fully assess the empirical validation of the theory.  
4. Accessibility: The paper assumes a high level of familiarity with advanced mathematical tools, such as sub-Gaussian distributions and graphical models. This may limit accessibility for a broader audience, even within the NIPS community.
Pro vs. Con Arguments for Acceptance:  
- Pro: The paper introduces a novel theoretical framework with rigorous analysis and demonstrates its utility in a relevant application domain. The convergence results and efficient algorithm design are significant contributions.  
- Con: The applicability beyond changepoint detection is unclear, and the discussion of practical implications is limited. The simulations could be more transparent, and the paper's accessibility could be improved.
Recommendation:  
I recommend acceptance, contingent on the authors addressing the weaknesses. Specifically, expanding the discussion on generalizability, improving the clarity of the simulation section, and providing more accessible explanations of the mathematical tools would significantly strengthen the paper. This work represents a meaningful contribution to the field of Bayesian inference and message-passing algorithms.
