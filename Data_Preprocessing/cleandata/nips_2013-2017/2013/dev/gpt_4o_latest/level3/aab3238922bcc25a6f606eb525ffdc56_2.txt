The paper introduces the Randomized Dependence Coefficient (RDC), a novel non-linear dependency estimator grounded in the Hirschfeld-Gebelein-Rényi (HGR) Maximum Correlation Coefficient and leveraging the FastFood speedup trick. RDC is designed to measure statistical dependence between random variables of arbitrary dimensions while addressing computational inefficiencies and implementation complexities found in existing methods like Kernel Canonical Correlation Analysis (KCCA) and Maximal Information Coefficient (MIC). The method involves three steps: copula transformation of data, random non-linear feature generation, and solving a canonical correlation analysis (CCA) eigenvalue problem. The authors demonstrate RDC's efficiency and effectiveness through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets.
Strengths
The paper is well-written, clear, and accessible, making it easy to follow even for readers unfamiliar with the underlying mathematical concepts. By combining existing ideas—such as copula transformations and random feature generation—into a cohesive framework, RDC represents a significant contribution to the field. The method is computationally efficient, with a complexity of \(O(n \log n)\), and is simple to implement, as evidenced by the concise R code provided in the appendix. Empirical results show that RDC performs competitively or better than state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and runtime, particularly in feature selection tasks on real-world datasets. The authors also provide a theoretical foundation for RDC, linking it to HGR and demonstrating its regularization properties, which are crucial for finite-sample scenarios.
Weaknesses
While the paper is strong overall, there are areas that warrant further discussion or improvement. The choice of the number of random features (\(k\)), set to 10 in the experiments, is underexplored. The authors acknowledge this limitation but do not provide sufficient analysis or guidelines for selecting \(k\) in practice. Additionally, the phrasing "same structure as HGR" is unclear and could benefit from rewording for precision. There is also a minor typo in Equation (5), where "m" should be replaced with "n." These issues, while minor, detract slightly from the overall clarity and polish of the paper.
Evaluation
- Quality: The paper is technically sound, with claims supported by both theoretical analysis and experimental results. However, more justification for parameter choices (e.g., \(k\)) would strengthen the work.
- Clarity: The manuscript is well-organized and provides sufficient detail for reproducibility, though minor phrasing issues and a typo should be addressed.
- Originality: RDC is a novel combination of existing techniques, and its relationship to HGR and other dependency measures is well-articulated.
- Significance: The results are impactful, offering a scalable and practical solution to a fundamental problem in statistics and machine learning.
Recommendation
I recommend acceptance of this paper, with minor revisions to address the unclear phrasing, typo, and further exploration of parameter selection. The combination of theoretical rigor, practical utility, and empirical validation makes RDC a valuable contribution to the field.
