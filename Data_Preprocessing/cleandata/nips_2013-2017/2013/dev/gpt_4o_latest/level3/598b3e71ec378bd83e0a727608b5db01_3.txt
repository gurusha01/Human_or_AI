The paper addresses the problem of minimizing simple regret in distributed multi-armed bandit (MAB) settings, focusing on the tradeoff between sample complexity and communication among players. The authors propose two key algorithms: one achieving a √k speedup with a single communication round and another achieving the optimal k speedup with O(log(1/ε)) communication rounds, where ε is the desired precision. These results are complemented by theoretical lower bounds, demonstrating the optimality of their approaches under the given constraints.
Strengths:
1. Novel Framework: The paper introduces a new and practically relevant framework for distributed best-arm identification in MAB problems. The focus on collaborative learning, rather than competitive scenarios, is a refreshing perspective.
2. Theoretical Contributions: The authors provide rigorous proofs for their claims, including tight upper and lower bounds for the single-round communication setting. The √k speedup is shown to be optimal, which is a significant theoretical result.
3. Practical Relevance: The algorithms are designed with distributed systems in mind, such as MapReduce, making the work applicable to real-world large-scale applications.
4. Elegant Results: While the techniques used are not groundbreaking, the results are elegant and well-structured, offering clear insights into the tradeoff between communication and learning performance.
5. Comprehensive Analysis: The paper explores both single-round and multi-round communication settings, providing a holistic view of the problem.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity Issues: Some parts of the paper, particularly the results for ε > 0 and Lemma 3.3, are not clearly communicated. The notation is inconsistent in places, which could confuse readers.
2. Limited Scope: The paper focuses on identifying a single best arm but does not discuss generalizations to selecting the top m arms, which could broaden its applicability.
3. Minor Presentation Issues: Certain citations are incomplete or improperly formatted, and the wording in some sections could be improved for better readability.
4. Practical Validation: While the theoretical results are strong, the paper lacks experimental validation to demonstrate the practical performance of the proposed algorithms in real-world distributed systems.
Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Clarify the results for ε > 0 and ensure consistent notation throughout the paper.
2. Discuss potential extensions to selecting the top m arms and how the algorithms might generalize to such settings.
3. Include experimental results to validate the theoretical findings and provide insights into practical performance.
4. Improve the formatting of citations and refine the wording in sections like Lemma 3.3 for better clarity.
Recommendation:
The paper is technically sound, well-motivated, and provides significant contributions to distributed MAB problems. Despite minor clarity and presentation issues, its theoretical results and practical relevance make it a valuable addition to the field. I recommend acceptance, provided the authors address the clarity issues and consider adding experimental validation in a future version. 
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Novel and relevant problem formulation.
- Rigorous theoretical analysis with optimality guarantees.
- Practical applicability to distributed systems.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Lack of experimental validation.
- Clarity and presentation issues in some sections.
Overall, the paper advances the state of the art in distributed learning and is likely to inspire further research in this area.
