This paper introduces a novel perspective on Bayesian posterior updates (BPU) by framing them as a system of iterated random functions (IRF) with the semigroup property. The authors establish a general convergence theory for such IRFs (Theorem 1), which has potential applications beyond Bayesian inference. They demonstrate the utility of this framework by analyzing classical and multiple change point problems (CCPP and MCPP), proving convergence for existing algorithms within this context. Additionally, the paper proposes a fast approximate algorithm for MCPP with convergence guarantees derived from Theorem 1. These contributions represent a significant theoretical advance and provide a foundation for further exploration of IRF-based algorithmic analysis.
Strengths:  
The paper is technically sound, with rigorous theoretical results and clear proofs. The IRF framework is a novel and elegant abstraction that unifies exact and approximate Bayesian inference methods. Theorem 1 is a key contribution, offering a general convergence guarantee for IRFs with the semigroup property, which could inspire further research in algorithmic convergence analysis. The application of this theory to sequential change point detection is well-motivated, and the proposed fast approximate algorithm for MCPP addresses a practical computational bottleneck in large-scale settings. The writing is generally clear and well-organized, making the technical content accessible to readers familiar with Bayesian inference and graphical models.
Weaknesses:  
The connection between the theoretical results (e.g., Theorem 2) and experimental evidence (e.g., Figure 1) is not sufficiently clear. While the simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, the authors do not explicitly relate these results to the theoretical bounds derived in the paper. Furthermore, the lack of practical applications or real-world datasets for MCPP limits the paper's immediate relevance to practitioners. Minor presentation issues, such as unclear equations, corrupted text, and missing parentheses, detract from the overall readability. These issues should be addressed in a revised version.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:  
Pro:  
1. The IRF framework and convergence theory are novel and technically robust.  
2. The proposed fast approximate algorithm for MCPP is computationally efficient and theoretically justified.  
3. The paper has the potential to inspire further research in Bayesian inference and algorithmic analysis.  
Con:  
1. The experimental validation lacks a clear connection to the theoretical results.  
2. The absence of real-world applications limits the paper's practical impact.  
3. Minor presentation issues reduce clarity and polish.  
Recommendation:  
I recommend acceptance with minor revisions. The theoretical contributions are significant and well-supported, but the authors should clarify the connection between theory and experiments and address the presentation issues. Including a discussion of potential real-world applications for MCPP would enhance the paper's impact.
