This paper presents a novel extension of kernel dependence tests to three-way interactions, addressing a critical gap in the field of nonparametric statistical testing. The authors introduce kernel-based tests for Lancaster three-variable interaction and total independence, leveraging reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) embeddings of signed measures. This work is a significant contribution, as existing tools for detecting higher-order interactions are limited, and the proposed methods are consistent against all alternatives for a broad class of kernels.
The paper is technically sound and well-executed. The theoretical development is rigorous, and the experimental results convincingly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed tests. The Lancaster interaction test, in particular, is shown to outperform competing methods in detecting V-structures in directed graphical models, especially in high-dimensional settings. This is a notable advancement, as it provides a robust tool for identifying complex dependencies where traditional pairwise tests fail.
However, there are areas where the paper could be improved. First, the concept of the V-structure, which is central to the paper, needs to be explained more explicitly when it is first introduced. A brief, intuitive explanation of its relevance to graphical models would enhance clarity for readers unfamiliar with the term. Additionally, a pointer to V-statistics in the context of kernel methods would provide helpful context for readers less familiar with this statistical framework.
Equation (1) is another area requiring refinement. The definition of \( P^* \) is unclear, and the phrasing after "where" is convoluted. A more precise and accessible explanation would improve the paper's readability. Furthermore, the sample sizes used in the experiments are not adequately justified. While the results are compelling, a discussion of how the sample sizes were chosen and their impact on the tests' performance would strengthen the experimental section.
Overall, the paper is a strong contribution to the field. Its originality lies in extending kernel dependence tests to higher-order interactions, a problem of significant importance. The results are likely to be impactful, with applications in graphical model learning and beyond. Despite minor issues with clarity and explanation, the paper is well-written and organized. I recommend acceptance, provided the authors address the noted weaknesses.
Pros:
1. Significant contribution to nonparametric testing for higher-order interactions.
2. Rigorous theoretical development and strong experimental results.
3. Demonstrates superiority over competing methods in detecting V-structures.
Cons:
1. V-structure needs clearer explanation on first mention.
2. Equation (1) and the definition of \( P^* \) require better clarity.
3. Experimental sample sizes lack justification.
Recommendation: Accept with minor revisions.
