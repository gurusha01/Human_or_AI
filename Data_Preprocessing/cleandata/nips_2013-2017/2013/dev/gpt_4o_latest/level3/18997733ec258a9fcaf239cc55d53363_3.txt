The paper explores a novel contextual linear bandit setting where bandits are connected through an underlying graph, leveraging the smoothness of weight vectors across the graph. The proposed algorithm, GOB.Lin, runs classical contextual linear bandits on each node and shares updates across nodes using the graph Laplacian. The authors also propose two scalable variants using clustering to address graph noise and computational challenges. The experimental results, conducted on synthetic and real-world datasets (Last.fm and Delicious), demonstrate the benefits of incorporating graph structure into contextual bandit algorithms, showing improved prediction performance over baselines that do not use relational information.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Practical Relevance: The paper introduces a new approach to contextual bandits by incorporating social graph information, which is a significant extension of prior work. This is particularly relevant for applications like recommendation systems.
2. Experimental Rigor: The experiments are well-executed, with detailed descriptions and reproducibility. The use of both synthetic and real-world datasets strengthens the empirical validation of the approach.
3. Scalability Considerations: The introduction of clustering-based variants (GOB.Lin.MACRO and GOB.Lin.BLOCK) is a practical contribution, addressing computational bottlenecks and graph noise.
4. Impactful Results: The experiments convincingly show that leveraging graph structure improves performance, with GOB.Lin and its variants outperforming baselines in most scenarios.
Weaknesses:
1. Flawed Regret Analysis: The regret analysis is a major weakness. It analyzes a different algorithm than the one proposed and evaluated, with no justification or discussion of the discrepancies. This undermines the theoretical contribution of the paper.
2. Lack of Clarity in Key Terms: Terms in the regret bound, such as ln|M_t| and 2L, are not adequately explained in terms of their behavior with T, n, and graph noise. This limits the reader's ability to interpret the theoretical results.
3. Exploration Parameter (\(\alpha\)) Ambiguity: The paper fails to provide guidance on setting the exploration parameter \(\alpha\) or clarify its impact on the regret bound, leaving a gap in practical applicability.
4. Inconsistent Use of Regularization: While clustering is used as a regularizer, directly regularizing the Laplacian might have been a more principled approach. Additionally, the regret bound uses L(u1,...,un) instead of the regularized Laplacian, creating inconsistency with the algorithm.
5. Vague Terminology: Phrases like "somehow informatively" and "similar updates" lack precision, making parts of the paper less rigorous.
Pro vs. Con Arguments for Acceptance:
- Pro: The paper makes a meaningful empirical contribution by extending contextual bandits to graph-based settings, with strong experimental results and practical scalability considerations.
- Con: The theoretical analysis is flawed and inconsistent with the proposed algorithm, which detracts from the paper's scientific rigor.
Recommendation: While the experimental contributions are strong, the theoretical shortcomings significantly weaken the paper. If accepted, the authors should address the theoretical inconsistencies and clarify key terms in a revised version.
