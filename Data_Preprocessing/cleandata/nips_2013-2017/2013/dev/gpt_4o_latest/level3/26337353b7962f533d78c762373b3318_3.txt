The paper introduces a novel algorithm, Sparse Heterarchical Matrix Factorization (SHMF), for multilevel sparse representations, specifically targeting calcium imaging data to identify neurons, neuronal assemblies, and their temporal dynamics. The proposed bilevel SHMF extends traditional matrix factorization by incorporating hierarchical and heterarchical relationships, optimizing all levels jointly rather than sequentially. This approach is a significant departure from existing methods, such as PCA, ICA, and NMF, which lack the ability to model multilevel structures or infer relationships between levels. The paper claims superior performance in identifying neuronal assemblies on both synthetic and real datasets, with a focus on robustness and interpretability.
Strengths:
1. Originality: The three-way decomposition approach is novel, particularly the inclusion of hierarchical and heterarchical relationships. The joint optimization strategy adds robustness compared to greedy level-by-level methods.
2. Significance: The method addresses a critical problem in neuroscienceâ€”interpreting calcium imaging data to uncover neuronal assemblies and their dynamics. This is a challenging and underexplored area, and the proposed algorithm has the potential to advance the state of the art.
3. Performance: The results on synthetic data demonstrate the algorithm's ability to recover assemblies with higher sensitivity compared to baseline methods. The application to real-world data shows plausible interpretations, suggesting practical utility.
4. Flexibility: The framework accommodates different regularizers at various levels, allowing users to tailor the method to specific datasets or applications.
Weaknesses:
1. Efficiency Concerns: The scalability of the algorithm for large datasets is not adequately addressed. Calcium imaging data can be massive, and the computational cost of the proposed method, particularly with increasing levels, needs further discussion.
2. Clarity: The paper is dense and assumes significant prior knowledge, making it inaccessible to non-experts. Key aspects, such as the choice of regularizers (\( \OmegaU, \OmegaA \)) and their weights, are insufficiently explained. Additionally, the description of spike deconvolution and real data experiments lacks detail.
3. Literature Context: The paper does not adequately situate itself within the broader literature on spike deconvolution, which is a critical component of calcium imaging analysis. This omission weakens the paper's positioning.
4. Practical Relevance: While the method identifies neuronal assemblies, the utility of this information is questioned. The temporal component of the spatiotemporal matrix may already capture similar insights, and this overlap is not convincingly addressed.
5. Presentation: Figures, particularly Fig. 6, and the inclusion of equations as a figure, are poorly explained. This hinders comprehension and detracts from the overall presentation quality.
Recommendation:
While the paper presents a novel and potentially impactful approach, its weaknesses in clarity, scalability, and literature positioning cannot be overlooked. For acceptance, the authors should address the computational efficiency concerns, provide clearer explanations of the methodology, and better contextualize their work within existing literature. Additionally, improving the presentation of figures and equations would enhance accessibility. Overall, the paper is a promising contribution but requires significant revisions to meet the standards of the conference.
