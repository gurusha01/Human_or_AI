The paper introduces the concept of Iterated Random Functions (IRF) with a semigroup property and develops a convergence theory for these functions. This framework is then applied to analyze the convergence of message-passing algorithms for Bayesian inference, particularly in the context of sequential change point detection using latent variable graphical models. The authors demonstrate the utility of their theory by providing convergence guarantees for both exact and approximate message-passing algorithms, supported by simulated examples.
The paper is original and makes significant contributions to the field of Bayesian inference and graphical models. The use of IRF to analyze message-passing convergence is novel and provides a fresh perspective on a challenging problem. While message-passing algorithms have been extensively studied, the convergence analysis, especially for approximate algorithms, remains underexplored. This work fills that gap by offering a general theoretical framework that can be applied to both exact and approximate algorithms. The authors also highlight the scalability of their approximate algorithm, which reduces computational complexity from \(O(nd)\) to \(O(d)\), making it more practical for real-world applications.
The paper is technically sound, and the theoretical claims are well-supported by rigorous analysis. However, the reviewer has not fully verified the proofs, particularly Theorem 1, which is central to the paper. The clarity of the paper is good, but certain aspects, such as the conditions for \(-I + \epsilon\) and its negativity, could be elaborated further. Additionally, while the authors focus on a specific application (sequential change point detection), it would be valuable to discuss the broader applicability of their results to other graphical models, such as belief propagation (BP) on trees.
Strengths of the paper include its originality, the depth of theoretical analysis, and the practical implications of the proposed approximate algorithm. The convergence guarantees for both exact and approximate algorithms are significant contributions that advance the state of the art. The simulation results effectively validate the theoretical findings and demonstrate the utility of the proposed methods.
Weaknesses include the lack of a detailed discussion on the typical values and conditions for \(-I + \epsilon\), as well as limited exploration of the applicability of the IRF framework to other graphical models. Additionally, while the clarity is generally good, some sections, particularly those involving technical derivations, could benefit from further simplification or additional explanations.
In conclusion, the paper is a strong contribution to the field and is recommended for acceptance, provided the authors address the raised questions and clarify the broader applicability of their framework. The novel use of IRF to analyze message-passing convergence is promising and has the potential to inspire future research in this area.
