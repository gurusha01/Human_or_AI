The paper addresses the problem of distributed exploration in Multi-Armed Bandits (MAB), focusing on the trade-off between communication and learning performance in a collaborative multi-player setting. The authors propose algorithms that achieve a √k speed-up with one round of communication, which is proven to be optimal under this constraint. They also explore the trade-off between speed-up and communication rounds, achieving a linear speed-up (factor k) with logarithmic communication rounds. The paper is motivated by real-world distributed computation scenarios, such as MapReduce, and provides theoretical guarantees for the proposed approaches.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Significance: The study tackles a non-trivial and practical problem inspired by distributed computation models, contributing to the growing interest in collaborative learning in MAB. The √k speed-up result for single-round communication is both novel and optimal, making it a significant theoretical contribution.
2. Clarity and Simplicity: The writing is mostly clear, and the proposed algorithms are simple yet clever. The authors effectively demonstrate how to adapt serial exploration strategies to distributed settings while addressing communication constraints.
3. Comprehensive Analysis: The paper provides a thorough analysis of the trade-offs between communication and learning performance, including lower bounds that validate the optimality of their results. The comparison with baseline methods (e.g., full-communication, no-communication, and majority vote) is well-executed and highlights the strengths of the proposed approach.
4. Broader Impact: The results are relevant to large-scale applications where distributed exploration is necessary, such as search engines and model selection tasks. The insights into communication-efficient algorithms could inspire further research in distributed learning.
Weaknesses:
1. Ambiguity in Definitions: The term "speed-up" is not formally defined, which could lead to confusion. A precise mathematical definition would strengthen the paper's clarity and rigor.
2. Limited Analysis of Baselines: While the majority vote (MV) method is claimed to achieve no speed-up, the analysis does not explore conditions under which MV might perform better. This omission weakens the comparative evaluation.
3. Technical Gaps: The proofs in Lemmas 3.3 and 3.4 require clarification, particularly regarding the probabilistic guarantees and constants. These gaps may hinder reproducibility and understanding of the results.
4. Scope of Experiments: The paper lacks empirical validation. While the theoretical results are compelling, experiments on synthetic or real-world datasets would strengthen the practical relevance of the work.
Recommendation:
This paper makes a strong theoretical contribution to distributed MAB exploration, particularly in the single-round communication setting. However, the lack of empirical validation and some ambiguities in definitions and proofs slightly detract from its overall impact. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions, focusing on clarifying the definition of "speed-up," addressing the technical gaps in proofs, and discussing the potential performance of baseline methods like MV under specific conditions.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper addresses a significant and practical problem with novel theoretical results.
- The √k speed-up result is optimal and contributes to the state of the art.
- The writing is clear, and the algorithms are simple yet effective.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Lack of empirical validation limits the practical impact.
- Ambiguities in definitions and proofs could hinder reproducibility.
- The analysis of baseline methods is incomplete.
Overall, this paper is a valuable contribution to the field of distributed learning and MAB, and with minor revisions, it will be a strong addition to the conference.
