The paper introduces the Randomized Dependence Coefficient (RDC), a novel measure of nonlinear dependence between random variables of arbitrary dimensions. RDC is inspired by the Hirschfeld-Gebelein-RÃ©nyi (HGR) Maximum Correlation Coefficient but addresses its computational intractability by leveraging random Fourier features (RFF) for nonlinear projections and canonical correlation analysis (CCA) after a copula transformation. The authors emphasize RDC's computational efficiency, scalability, and ease of implementation, claiming it can be implemented in just five lines of R code. The paper evaluates RDC against existing dependence measures and demonstrates its utility in feature selection for linear prediction problems.
Strengths:  
The paper is well-written, with clear exposition and a logical progression of ideas. The inclusion of visual aids, such as the schematic diagram in Figure 1, enhances comprehension. Empirical results demonstrate that RDC performs competitively against state-of-the-art dependence measures, particularly in feature selection tasks. The authors provide a thorough comparison of RDC's properties with other measures, highlighting its invariance to marginal transformations, computational efficiency, and ability to handle multivariate data. The experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets further validate RDC's practical utility. Additionally, the authors address implementation concerns by providing source code, making the method accessible to practitioners.
Weaknesses:  
While the empirical results are promising, the theoretical analysis of RDC is incomplete. The tradeoff between the number of random features (k) and generalization performance is not rigorously explored. The paper mentions that increasing k could improve performance but does not provide a systematic study of this effect. Furthermore, the theoretical bound on RDC's approximation to HGR relies on assumptions that are not fully justified in practical scenarios. The use of RFF is well-motivated, but the reviewer suggests exploring Nystrom features as an alternative for potentially better kernel estimates and broader applicability. Additionally, the paper contains a minor citation error, referring to "Recht" as "Brecht," which should be corrected. Finally, while the rebuttal satisfactorily addressed some concerns, the constraints in the CCA optimization problem remain unclear and should be explicitly stated.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:  
Pro:  
- Novel and computationally efficient approach to nonlinear dependence measurement.  
- Strong empirical results demonstrating practical utility.  
- Clear writing and accessible implementation.  
Con:  
- Incomplete theoretical analysis, particularly regarding the tradeoff involving k.  
- Limited exploration of alternative kernel approximation methods.  
- Minor citation and clarity issues.
Conclusion:  
The paper presents an interesting and empirically strong contribution to the field of nonlinear dependence measures. While the theoretical analysis could be more robust, the practical significance and scalability of RDC make it a valuable addition to the literature. I recommend acceptance, provided the authors address the noted concerns in the final version.
