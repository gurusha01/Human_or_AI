The paper presents a comprehensive study on the post-Lasso estimator, specifically the Gauss-Lasso selector, in high-dimensional sparse regression. It introduces the Generalized Irrepresentability Condition (GIC), a relaxation of the standard irrepresentability condition, and demonstrates that the Gauss-Lasso can achieve correct model selection under weaker assumptions. The authors provide theoretical guarantees for the Gauss-Lasso's performance, supported by simulated experiments. The paper also extends the analysis to random Gaussian designs, offering insights into the estimator's robustness in practical scenarios.
Strengths:
1. Theoretical Contribution: The introduction of GIC and its application to the Gauss-Lasso selector is a significant theoretical advancement. It broadens the applicability of post-Lasso methods by relaxing restrictive assumptions like irrepresentability.
2. Clarity and Structure: The paper is well-written and logically structured, making it accessible to both statisticians and practitioners. The proofs and derivations are detailed, and the examples effectively illustrate the theoretical results.
3. Practical Relevance: The study addresses a critical problem in high-dimensional regression, and the proposed method has potential applications in fields like genomics and signal processing.
4. Experimental Validation: The simulated experiments provide empirical support for the theoretical claims, enhancing the credibility of the results.
Weaknesses:
1. Missing References: The paper fails to cite foundational works on post-Lasso and its variations, such as Belloni et al. (2011, 2012) and Lederer (2013). These omissions weaken the contextualization of the study within existing literature.
2. Practical Challenges: Recent critiques of post-Lasso methods in specific simulated scenarios are not addressed. The authors should comment on these challenges to clarify the practical limitations of their approach.
3. Uniqueness Assumption: The paper assumes the uniqueness of minimizers without proving it. Prior works (e.g., Fuchs, 2004; Tibshirani, 2013) could be leveraged to address this gap.
4. Redundancy: Section 3.1 repeats results from Section 2.1 and could be removed to make room for more critical discussions, such as missing references or practical challenges.
5. Technical Issues: The parameter \( t_0 \) is defined but unused in one section, creating confusion. Additionally, the dependency of the lambda parameter on the unknown quantity \( \eta \) requires clarification.
6. Typographical Errors: Candes' name is misspelled in multiple places, and there is a potential sign issue in line 553.
Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Include citations to key theoretical works on post-Lasso to situate the study within the broader literature.
2. Address practical critiques of post-Lasso methods and clarify the limitations of the proposed approach.
3. Prove the uniqueness of minimizers or explicitly state the conditions under which it holds.
4. Remove redundant sections and use the space to discuss missing references or practical implications.
5. Clarify the role of \( t_0 \), the lambda parameter, and assumptions about the Gram matrix invertibility.
6. Correct typographical errors and address the potential sign issue.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper makes a novel theoretical contribution by introducing GIC and demonstrating its utility in high-dimensional regression.
- The results are of high interest to statisticians and practitioners, with potential applications in various domains.
- The clarity and rigor of the paper make it a valuable addition to the literature.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The omission of key references and practical challenges undermines the contextualization and robustness of the study.
- Certain assumptions (e.g., uniqueness of minimizers) are not adequately justified.
- Redundant sections and technical oversights detract from the overall quality of the paper.
Recommendation:
The paper is a strong candidate for acceptance, provided the authors address the missing references, practical challenges, and technical issues highlighted above.
