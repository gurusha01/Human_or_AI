The paper proposes a novel method using signed Cauchy random projections to approximate the chi-square (χ²) kernel, which is widely used in machine learning tasks involving histogram-based features, such as text and image classification. The authors demonstrate that the collision probability of these projections can be approximated as a function of the χ² similarity, providing a low-error mechanism for high-dimensional and streaming data. This work generalizes the concept of SimHash and its relation to collision probabilities, offering a new perspective on kernel approximation.
Strengths:  
The proposed method is innovative, establishing a previously unexplored connection between χ² similarity and random Cauchy projections. This is particularly relevant for high-dimensional sparse data, where computational efficiency and storage are critical. The paper provides theoretical guarantees, such as the low-error bound in Lemma 5 for binary data, and introduces two novel approximations for collision probability based on χ² similarity. The applicability of the method to streaming data is a significant contribution, as it aligns well with modern data processing needs. Experimental results on real-world datasets validate the method's practicality, and the potential for applications in linear classifiers and near-neighbor search is promising. The paper also highlights the advantages of using 1-bit projections, such as reduced storage and computational overhead.
Weaknesses:  
The paper suffers from poor writing and organization, which significantly hinders comprehension. The goals, logic, and flow are unclear, and the inclusion of irrelevant or disconnected theorems detracts from the main contributions. While the theoretical results are interesting, the computational efficiency of the proposed χ² approximation is limited due to the reliance on cosine transformations. Additionally, the theoretical and empirical significance of the acos(χ²) metric remains underexplored, leaving questions about its broader impact unanswered. The experimental validation, though promising, is limited in scope and does not thoroughly compare the method against state-of-the-art alternatives like exp-χ² or other linear approximations.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:  
Pros:  
1. Novel connection between χ² similarity and Cauchy random projections.  
2. Strong theoretical guarantees, including low-error bounds.  
3. Practical relevance for high-dimensional and streaming data.  
4. Experimental validation on real-world datasets.  
Cons:  
1. Poorly written and organized, making the contributions difficult to follow.  
2. Limited computational efficiency due to cosine transformations.  
3. Insufficient exploration of the acos(χ²) metric's significance.  
4. Lack of comprehensive comparisons with existing methods.  
Recommendation:  
While the paper introduces a novel and potentially impactful method, the poor writing and lack of clarity significantly undermine its accessibility and impact. The theoretical contributions are strong, but the practical limitations and insufficient empirical analysis reduce the overall significance. However, the mention of streaming data applications adds merit to the work. I recommend a score of 6 (weak accept), contingent on substantial revisions to improve clarity, organization, and empirical comparisons.
