The paper introduces a novel approach to annealed importance sampling (AIS) by proposing the use of moment averaging (MA) paths instead of the widely used geometric averaging (GA) paths. The authors provide a thorough theoretical framework to analyze the performance of these paths and demonstrate their empirical effectiveness in estimating partition functions, particularly for restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs). The paper also derives an asymptotically optimal piecewise linear schedule for the proposed method, offering a significant contribution to the field of Monte Carlo sampling techniques.
Strengths
The paper is technically sound, with a robust theoretical foundation that includes variational interpretations and asymptotic analyses of both GA and MA paths. The authors convincingly argue that MA paths optimize a different variational objective, which encourages broader coverage of high-probability regions, a key advantage over GA paths. The empirical results are compelling, showing that MA paths often outperform GA paths in terms of accuracy and effective sample size (ESS), particularly in challenging scenarios such as RBMs with poor mixing properties. The paper is well-written and organized, with clear explanations of the methodology and results. The inclusion of both theoretical and empirical analyses strengthens the paper's contribution, and its originality is evident in the introduction of a non-obvious alternative to geometric paths, which has the potential to influence future research in AIS and related sampling methods.
Weaknesses
While the theoretical claims are well-supported, the empirical comparisons could be more comprehensive. Specifically, the authors do not test GA paths with alternative annealing schedules, which could provide a fairer baseline for comparison. Additionally, the supplementary material, while referenced, could benefit from more explicit calculations and derivations to aid reproducibility. The complexity of implementing MA paths, particularly for intractable models, may limit the immediate adoption of this method. The paper does not fully address the computational overhead introduced by moment matching, especially when approximations are required. Finally, the empirical results, while promising, are somewhat limited in scope, focusing primarily on RBMs. Broader experimentation with other models or applications would strengthen the paper's significance.
Recommendation
The paper is a strong contribution to the field, offering a novel and theoretically grounded approach to improving AIS. However, the empirical evaluation could be expanded, and the computational trade-offs of the proposed method should be more thoroughly discussed. I recommend acceptance, provided the authors address the following points in a revision:
1. Include experiments testing GA paths with alternative annealing schedules for a more balanced comparison.
2. Expand the supplementary material with explicit calculations and derivations.
3. Discuss the computational overhead of moment matching and its implications for scalability.
Arguments for Acceptance
- The paper is highly original and addresses a significant problem in AIS by proposing a technically challenging and novel alternative to geometric paths.
- The theoretical analysis is rigorous and provides valuable insights into the behavior of MA paths.
- Empirical results demonstrate the potential of the proposed method to outperform GA paths in challenging scenarios.
Arguments Against Acceptance
- Empirical comparisons are incomplete, as GA paths are not tested with alternative schedules.
- The computational complexity of the proposed method may hinder its practical applicability.
- The scope of the experiments is limited, focusing primarily on RBMs.
Overall, the paper is a valuable contribution to the field, and its strengths outweigh its weaknesses. With minor revisions, it could have a significant impact on the research community.
