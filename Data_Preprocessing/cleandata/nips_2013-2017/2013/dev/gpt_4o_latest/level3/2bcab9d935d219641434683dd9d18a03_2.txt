This paper presents an intriguing exploration of how the olfactory system might infer odors in complex scenes using biologically plausible neural algorithms. Building on a probabilistic model introduced at NIPS 2012, the authors propose two inference methods: a variational algorithm and a sampling-based approach, both employing a spike-and-slab prior that better reflects the sparse nature of odor mixtures. The paper maps these algorithms onto neural dynamics and evaluates their feasibility using simulated data, concluding that both could operate within natural time constraints (less than 100 ms). While the algorithms are technically sound and novel, the authors acknowledge the lack of direct biological evidence supporting their implementation in real neural systems.
Strengths:  
The paper makes several significant contributions. First, it advances the state of the art in probabilistic inference for sensory systems by introducing a more realistic prior for olfactory processing. The spike-and-slab prior is a meaningful improvement over previous smooth priors, as it captures the sparsity of odor mixtures. Second, the derivation of neurally plausible update rules for both algorithms is a commendable effort to bridge computational neuroscience and biological realism. The simulations are thorough, demonstrating that both algorithms converge rapidly and perform well under ecologically relevant conditions. Additionally, the authors provide clear predictions about how these algorithms could be experimentally distinguished, offering a pathway for future empirical validation.
Weaknesses:  
Despite its strengths, the paper has notable limitations. The primary concern is the lack of biological evidence supporting the proposed algorithms. While the authors argue that both methods are theoretically feasible, they do not address the significant anatomical and computational constraints that might hinder their implementation in real neural circuits. For instance, the reliance on complex nonlinearities (e.g., logarithmic and digamma functions) and precise reciprocal connectivity poses challenges for biological plausibility. Furthermore, the generative model assumes linearity and independence among odors, which oversimplifies the complexities of real-world olfactory processing. Finally, while the authors acknowledge these limitations, the discussion could benefit from a deeper exploration of how these challenges might be overcome in future work.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:  
Pro:  
1. The paper introduces novel and technically sound algorithms that advance probabilistic inference in neural systems.  
2. The use of a spike-and-slab prior and neurally plausible dynamics represents a meaningful step toward biological realism.  
3. The work generates testable predictions, offering a clear experimental roadmap for validation.  
Con:  
1. The biological feasibility of the algorithms is questionable due to significant computational and anatomical constraints.  
2. The generative model and assumptions (e.g., linearity, independence) are overly simplistic.  
3. The paper lacks direct empirical evidence or experimental validation of the proposed methods.  
Conclusion:  
This paper is a valuable contribution to computational neuroscience, offering novel insights into olfactory inference and probabilistic coding. However, its biological plausibility remains speculative, and the assumptions underlying the model require refinement. I recommend acceptance with the suggestion that the authors address these limitations in future work.
