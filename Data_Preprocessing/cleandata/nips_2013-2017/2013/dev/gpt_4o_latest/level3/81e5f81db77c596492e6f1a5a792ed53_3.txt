The paper introduces a novel convex formulation for sparse subspace estimation using the Fantope, a convex hull of rank-d projection matrices, and solves it efficiently via an ADMM algorithm. This approach generalizes sparse PCA to higher dimensions (d > 1) while addressing key limitations of existing methods, such as reliance on deflation schemes and restrictive spiked covariance models. The authors provide rigorous theoretical guarantees, including near-optimal rates for Frobenius norm error and support recovery, and extend their framework to non-standard input matrices like Kendall's tau correlation. Synthetic experiments demonstrate the method's superiority over deflation-based approaches in terms of both statistical and computational efficiency.
Strengths:  
The paper makes a significant contribution to sparse PCA by introducing a computationally tractable semidefinite programming (SDP) formulation that generalizes existing methods. The use of the Fantope constraint is both elegant and novel, providing a unified framework for sparse subspace estimation. The theoretical analysis is robust, offering near-optimal guarantees under general conditions and extending to non-linear settings. The ADMM algorithm is well-implemented, and its convergence properties are clearly discussed. The synthetic experiments convincingly demonstrate the method's advantages, particularly in scenarios with shared support or high noise levels. The paper is well-written and organized, making the technical content accessible to readers familiar with sparse PCA.
Weaknesses:  
While the synthetic experiments are promising, they lack sufficient detail to fully assess their implications. For example, the rationale behind the high number of selected variables (s = 25) for a rank-5 matrix Π is unclear and warrants further discussion. Additionally, the claim that the proposed FPS method produces "typically sparser" estimates is not adequately supported by the presented results. The use of Frobenius norm as the sole error metric is limiting; incorporating additional metrics, such as spectral norm or subspace angles, would provide a more comprehensive evaluation. Notational clarity is another minor issue—the non-standard symbol "\(\vee\)" should be explicitly defined, and the Frobenius norm notation in Figure 1 should be made consistent. Lastly, there is a small typo ("difficult to interepretation") that should be corrected.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:  
Pro:  
- Novel and elegant formulation for sparse subspace estimation.  
- Strong theoretical guarantees with broad applicability.  
- Efficient ADMM algorithm with practical utility.  
- Demonstrated superiority over existing methods in experiments.  
Con:  
- Insufficient discussion of experimental design and results.  
- Claims about sparsity not fully substantiated.  
- Limited evaluation metrics for error analysis.  
Recommendation:  
This paper is a strong candidate for acceptance due to its novel contributions, rigorous theoretical analysis, and practical relevance. However, the authors should address the identified weaknesses, particularly by providing more detailed discussions of the experiments and additional metrics for evaluation.
