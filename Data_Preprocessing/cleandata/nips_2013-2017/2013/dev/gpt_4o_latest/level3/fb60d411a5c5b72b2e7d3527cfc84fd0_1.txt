This paper presents a novel approach to defining intermediate distributions for Annealed Importance Sampling (AIS), a widely used method for estimating partition functions in generative models. The authors propose a "moment averaging" path for exponential family models, contrasting it with the commonly used geometric averaging path. The paper provides a detailed theoretical analysis of the asymptotic performance of both paths, introduces an optimal piecewise linear schedule, and demonstrates empirical improvements in variance and effective sample size (ESS) when using the proposed method. The work is particularly relevant for Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), a foundational component of many deep learning models.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Originality: The paper introduces a new path (moment averaging) for AIS, which is a significant departure from the geometric path that has been the default choice in the field. The variational interpretation of the two paths is insightful and adds depth to the theoretical contribution.
2. Theoretical Rigor: The analysis of the asymptotic behavior of the proposed path is mathematically sound, and the derivation of the optimal schedule is a valuable addition. The connection to the cost functional and the Riemannian path length is well-articulated.
3. Clarity and Presentation: The paper is well-written and organized, with clear explanations supported by illustrative examples (e.g., Gaussian paths in Figure 1 and intermediate RBMs in Figure 4). The supplementary material is referenced appropriately for additional proofs.
4. Empirical Validation: The experiments convincingly demonstrate the advantages of moment averaging, particularly in terms of variance reduction and ESS. The results on RBMs, both tractable and intractable, highlight the practical utility of the proposed method.
5. Broader Impact: The proposed method has potential applications beyond AIS, such as in path sampling, parallel tempering, and tempered transitions, as noted in the conclusion.
Weaknesses:
1. Sensitivity to Moment Matching: The paper raises concerns about the sensitivity of AIS outcomes to the accuracy of moment matching, but this issue is not thoroughly explored. For instance, the computational cost and potential inaccuracies of moment matching in large-scale models could limit the applicability of the method.
2. Experimental Design: While the experiments are comprehensive, it is unclear whether the observation that assigning more models at the low-temperature end reduces variance was explicitly considered in the experimental setup. Addressing this could strengthen the empirical claims.
3. Supplementary Proofs: The reviewer did not verify the supplementary proofs, which are critical for some of the theoretical claims. While the main text is convincing, the lack of independent verification of these proofs introduces a minor caveat.
4. Computational Cost: The computational overhead of moment averaging compared to geometric averaging is not thoroughly quantified. This is especially relevant for large-scale applications where computational efficiency is critical.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper makes a significant theoretical and practical contribution to AIS, a core technique in probabilistic modeling.
- The proposed method demonstrates clear empirical advantages, particularly for RBMs, which are widely used in deep learning.
- The work is well-written, original, and advances the state of the art in a meaningful way.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The sensitivity of the method to moment matching accuracy and its computational cost are not fully addressed.
- Some experimental design choices, such as the handling of low-temperature variance reduction, could be more explicitly discussed.
Recommendation:
Overall, this paper represents a high-quality contribution to the field of probabilistic modeling and Monte Carlo methods. While there are minor concerns about sensitivity and computational cost, these do not detract significantly from the paper's value. I recommend acceptance, with minor revisions to address the aforementioned concerns.
