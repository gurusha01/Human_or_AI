This paper presents a novel approach to integrating social network information into contextual multi-armed bandit algorithms, addressing the exploration-exploitation trade-off in recommendation systems. The authors propose GOB.Lin, a linear bandit algorithm that leverages graph structures to exploit user similarities, and provide theoretical regret bounds alongside empirical validation on synthetic and real-world datasets. The work is timely and relevant, contributing to the growing interest in graph-based learning models for recommendation systems.
Strengths:  
1. Novelty: The paper extends linear bandit algorithms by incorporating graph-based user relationships, which is a significant and original contribution to the field. This approach is particularly relevant given the increasing availability of social network data.  
2. Theoretical Rigor: The regret analysis is well-grounded, with clear assumptions and derivations. The use of the Laplacian matrix to model user similarities is appropriate and aligns with prior work in multitask learning.  
3. Experimental Validation: The experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets (Last.fm and Delicious) demonstrate the practical utility of GOB.Lin and its variants. The results consistently show performance improvements over baseline methods that do not use graph information.  
4. Scalability: The introduction of clustering-based variants (GOB.Lin.MACRO and GOB.Lin.BLOCK) addresses scalability concerns, making the approach more practical for larger graphs.
Weaknesses:  
1. Clarity of Presentation: The presentation of Algorithm 2 in Figure 2 is misleading, as it uses the notation CB instead of TCB, which could confuse readers. The authors should replace CB with TCB to align with their theoretical analysis and avoid ambiguity.  
2. Assumptions on \(L(u1, ..., un)\): The necessity of knowing \(L(u1, ..., un)\) or an upper bound is not adequately justified. This assumption implies prior knowledge about the graph's quality, which may not always be realistic in practical scenarios. Clarifying this would strengthen the paper.  
3. Intuition for the Algorithm: While the algorithm is technically sound, its intuition could be better conveyed. Reframing GOB.Lin as \(n\) bandits with updates influenced by graph-based proximity measures might make it more accessible to readers unfamiliar with the technical details.  
4. Typos and Writing: Minor typos, such as "distribuited" (p2, l89) and "similarly" (p3, l129), detract from the paper's polish. Additionally, the overall clarity and organization could be improved, particularly in the explanation of the algorithm and its variants.
Recommendation:  
Despite the noted weaknesses, this paper makes a compelling contribution to a hot topic in machine learning. The integration of social graph information into contextual bandit algorithms is both novel and impactful, with promising theoretical and empirical results. Addressing the clarity issues, particularly the misleading notation in Figure 2, and providing more intuition for the algorithm would significantly enhance the paper's accessibility and impact. I recommend acceptance, contingent on these revisions.  
Pro/Con Summary:  
- Pro: Novel extension of linear bandits, strong theoretical and empirical results, practical scalability solutions.  
- Con: Misleading notation, unclear assumptions, and minor clarity issues.  
Overall, this paper is a valuable contribution to the field and merits inclusion in the conference.
