This paper investigates two approximate inference algorithms—variational inference and sampling-based methods—for decoding odors from neural activity in the olfactory system. The authors propose biologically plausible neural implementations of these algorithms and evaluate their performance in terms of speed and accuracy. By employing a more realistic "spike and slab" prior for odor concentrations, the study addresses a critical gap in prior work. Both algorithms are shown to infer odors within 100 ms, making them consistent with behavioral timescales. However, they differ in their assumptions about neural connectivity and coding strategies, offering testable predictions for experimental neuroscience. The authors argue that distinguishing between these algorithms experimentally could provide insights into how the brain represents probabilities.
Strengths:
1. Technical Rigor: The paper is mathematically sound and builds on prior work (e.g., Beck et al., 2012) while introducing novel elements such as the spike-and-slab prior. The derivations are thorough and well-supported.
2. Biological Relevance: The study makes realistic assumptions about olfactory processing and provides biologically plausible network dynamics for both algorithms. The focus on ecologically relevant timescales is commendable.
3. Clarity: The manuscript is well-written and logically organized, making it accessible to readers familiar with computational neuroscience.
4. Significance: The work addresses a challenging problem in sensory neuroscience and offers experimentally testable predictions, which could advance our understanding of probabilistic coding in the brain.
Weaknesses:
1. Timing Claims: While the algorithms converge rapidly in simulations, the claim that they match neural time constants is questionable. The nonlinearities in the equations (e.g., digamma functions, logarithms) and the need for precise noise in the sampling algorithm may pose challenges for realistic neural implementations. This issue warrants more discussion.
2. Experimental Validation: The evaluation against experimental data is vague, particularly regarding spike-based network implementations. The authors suggest potential experiments but do not provide concrete plans or comparisons to existing neural data.
3. False Positives: Both algorithms struggle with false-positive elimination, especially in complex odor mixtures. While this aligns with human behavior, it raises concerns about the practical utility of the models.
4. Figures and Typos: Figure 1 contains indistinguishable curves, which hampers interpretability. Additionally, minor typographical errors (e.g., "auxillary" instead of "auxiliary") detract from the manuscript's polish.
Recommendation:
This paper is technically strong and offers valuable insights into olfactory inference. However, the concerns about timing, experimental validation, and false positives reduce its immediate impact. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address these issues, particularly the timing claims and experimental comparisons.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The study is technically rigorous and biologically relevant.
- It introduces novel elements (e.g., spike-and-slab prior) and builds on established work.
- The predictions are experimentally testable, offering potential for future validation.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The timing claims may not hold for realistic neural implementations.
- The experimental evaluation is underdeveloped.
- False positives remain a significant limitation.
Overall, this paper makes a meaningful contribution to computational neuroscience and is likely to stimulate further research in the field.
