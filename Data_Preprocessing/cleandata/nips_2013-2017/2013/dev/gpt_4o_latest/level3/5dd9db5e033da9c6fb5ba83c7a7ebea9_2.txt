The paper introduces a novel algorithm for exact submodular minimization using Douglas-Rachford splitting on a constructed dual problem. This approach is significant as submodular functions are widely used in machine learning, computer vision, and signal processing. The authors leverage the proximal problem formulation, which simplifies implementation, avoids hyperparameter tuning, and facilitates parallelization. The originality lies in combining known techniques—proximal methods, dual decomposition, and reflection-based optimization—in a novel way to address the submodular minimization problem. This work could have a substantial impact due to the prevalence of submodular functions in practical applications.
The paper is technically sound and well-organized, with a clear exposition of the algorithm and its connections to prior work. However, there are areas where clarity could be improved. For instance, the explanation of level sets around line 072 and the definition of \(y(A)\) near line 134 require more detail to enhance reader comprehension. Additionally, while the experiments demonstrate fast convergence of the proposed method, the lack of sufficient detail for reproducibility is a significant weakness. The omission of comparisons to graph cuts for the MRF problem is particularly concerning, as graph cuts are a well-established baseline in this domain.
The experimental results are promising, showing that the Douglas-Rachford splitting method converges faster than other proximal methods and is well-suited for parallelization. However, the paper does not provide theoretical guarantees for the running time of the proposed algorithm, which is a notable limitation compared to competing methods. Furthermore, the observation that the parallel methods require more iterations to converge than standard implementations needs clarification, as this could impact the practical utility of the approach.
In terms of significance, the algorithm addresses a challenging problem and has the potential to advance the state of the art in submodular minimization. However, its reliance on specialized methods for subproblem projections may limit its general applicability. The authors acknowledge this limitation but do not explore its implications in depth.
Strengths:
1. Original combination of known techniques for submodular minimization.
2. Promising experimental results, particularly for parallel implementations.
3. Avoidance of hyperparameter tuning and ease of implementation.
Weaknesses:
1. Lack of theoretical guarantees for running time.
2. Insufficient experimental details for reproducibility.
3. Missing comparisons to graph cuts for the MRF problem.
4. Some unclear explanations in the text.
Recommendation:
While the paper makes a meaningful contribution to submodular minimization, the lack of theoretical guarantees and reproducibility details, as well as the omission of key comparisons, weaken its overall impact. I recommend acceptance conditional on addressing these issues, particularly by providing more experimental details, clarifying the parallel methods' behavior, and including comparisons to graph cuts.
