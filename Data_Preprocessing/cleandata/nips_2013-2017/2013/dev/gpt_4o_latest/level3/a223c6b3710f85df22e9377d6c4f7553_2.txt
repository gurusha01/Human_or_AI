The paper presents a theoretical study of model selection in high-dimensional regression, specifically addressing the "large p, small n" scenario using LASSO-type selectors. Its main contribution is the introduction of the Generalized Irrepresentability Condition (GIC), a relaxation of the standard irrepresentability condition, which is pivotal for ensuring the success of LASSO in identifying the true support of the model. The authors analyze the GIC in the context of the Gauss-LASSO selector, a two-stage method combining LASSO with least squares estimation, and provide rigorous theoretical guarantees for its performance under both deterministic and random design settings.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Theoretical Contribution: The proposed GIC is a significant relaxation of the standard irrepresentability condition, broadening the applicability of LASSO-based methods. This is a meaningful theoretical advancement, as it addresses scenarios where the standard condition fails.
2. Rigorous Analysis: The authors provide detailed theoretical results, including a threshold for the regularization parameter that ensures the LASSO estimator's support contains the ground truth. Theorem 2, in particular, establishes that the signed support of the LASSO estimator matches the zero-noise problem with high probability.
3. Extension to Random Designs: The extension of the analysis to random Gaussian designs is well-executed and demonstrates the robustness of the proposed GIC. The results are supported by careful mathematical derivations, including conditions for exact support recovery.
4. Practical Implications: By tying GIC to the KKT conditions of LASSO in the noiseless case, the paper provides a clear motivation for its use. The Gauss-LASSO selector is shown to outperform standard LASSO in certain settings, making it a promising tool for high-dimensional regression problems.
Weaknesses:
1. Limited Applicability in High-Noise Scenarios: The conditions in Eq. (13-14) may not hold in high-noise settings, limiting the practical applicability of the results. This limitation is acknowledged but not deeply explored.
2. Clarity Issues: Some notations, such as \(v0\) and \(T0\) in Section 1.3, are unclear and require better explanation. Additionally, the reference to Eq. (16) in Lemma 2.1 needs correction.
3. Empirical Validation: While the theoretical contributions are strong, the paper lacks empirical results to validate the practical performance of the Gauss-LASSO selector under real-world conditions. This would strengthen the paper's impact and relevance.
Recommendation:
Overall, this paper makes a valuable theoretical contribution to the field of high-dimensional regression and model selection. It advances the understanding of LASSO-type methods by introducing a more general condition and rigorously analyzing its implications. However, the lack of empirical validation and limited discussion of high-noise scenarios slightly diminish its practical impact. I recommend acceptance, provided the authors address the clarity issues and consider adding a discussion on potential empirical validations or extensions to high-noise settings.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Novel and significant theoretical contribution (GIC).
- Rigorous and well-supported analysis for deterministic and random designs.
- Advances the state of the art in LASSO-based model selection.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Limited applicability in high-noise scenarios.
- Lack of empirical validation.
- Minor clarity and notation issues.
This paper is a strong candidate for acceptance, given its theoretical depth and potential to inspire further research in high-dimensional model selection.
