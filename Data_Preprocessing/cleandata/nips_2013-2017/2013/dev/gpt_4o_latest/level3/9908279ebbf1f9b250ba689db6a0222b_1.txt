The paper presents a novel method for robust principal component regression (PCR) tailored to high-dimensional non-Gaussian data, making significant theoretical and practical contributions to the field. The authors extend classical PCR by leveraging elliptical distributions, a semiparametric generalization of Gaussian distributions that includes heavy-tailed and dependent structures. This innovation allows the method to handle complex datasets, such as those in finance and biomedical imaging, while maintaining optimal parametric rates for regression coefficient estimation.
The paper is technically sound, with claims supported by rigorous theoretical analysis and comprehensive experiments. The authors demonstrate the advantages of classical PCR over linear regression in low-dimensional settings, particularly in handling collinearity and exploiting low-rank structures. They further extend these insights to high-dimensional settings, introducing a robust sparse PCR method that uses multivariate Kendall's tau for covariance estimation. Theoretical results are validated through parameter sweeps, showing alignment between mean square error predictions and empirical outcomes. The method consistently outperforms traditional PCR and lasso regression on elliptical distributions while matching PCR's performance for Gaussian data. Real-world experiments on financial data further underscore its practical utility, achieving lower prediction errors compared to competing methods.
The paper is well-organized and clearly written, with detailed explanations of the methodology and supportive figures. However, there are areas requiring clarification. First, the implementation details of lasso regression, particularly regarding feature selection and sparsity adjustments, are insufficiently described. This omission makes it challenging to fully assess the comparative performance of the proposed method. Second, the authors focus exclusively on a subset of financial data (the "Financial" sector) without justifying this choice or testing across multiple sectors. Broader validation would strengthen the generalizability of their findings.
In terms of originality, the paper makes a novel contribution by extending PCR to elliptical distributions and addressing high-dimensional challenges. The work builds on recent advancements in robust covariance estimation and sparse PCA, distinguishing itself from prior research. The significance of the results is high, as the method addresses a critical gap in handling non-Gaussian data, with potential applications in finance, genomics, and biomedical imaging.
Pros for acceptance:
1. Strong theoretical contributions with rigorous proofs and optimal parametric rates.
2. Empirical validation on both synthetic and real-world data.
3. Novel extension of PCR to elliptical distributions, broadening its applicability.
Cons for acceptance:
1. Insufficient details on lasso regression implementation.
