The paper presents a novel approach to analyzing calcium imaging data using a "bilevel sparse heterarchical matrix factorization" (SHMF) framework. This method addresses the challenge of inferring neurons, their assemblies, and their temporal dynamics from calcium imaging data, a task of significant importance in neuroscience. Unlike prior methods, SHMF jointly infers neurons and assemblies, incorporates structured sparsity constraints, and does not require prior knowledge of the number of assemblies. This is a notable advancement over existing techniques like MNMMF and KSVDS, which require predefined parameters and often rely on separate clustering steps.
Strengths:  
The paper is technically robust and introduces a novel methodology that advances the state of the art in calcium imaging analysis. The bilevel SHMF framework is a significant contribution, as it allows for the simultaneous decomposition of data into neurons, assemblies, and their temporal activities. The incorporation of structured sparsity constraints and the ability to infer hierarchical and heterarchical relationships between neurons and assemblies are particularly innovative. The method's performance on synthetic data is impressive, outperforming MNMMF and KSVDS in recovering assembly assignments and detecting calcium transients. Additionally, the parallel inference capability is a strength, as it enables robust identification of neuronal time courses. The paper is clearly written, well-organized, and provides sufficient references to prior work, ensuring clarity and contextual grounding.
Weaknesses:  
The application of SHMF to real data from rat hippocampus calcium imaging is less convincing. While the method demonstrates the ability to distinguish overlapping and correlated cells, the conclusions drawn from the real data are unclear and lack sufficient interpretation. The inferred dictionary, a key component of the framework, is not adequately discussed, leaving gaps in understanding its role and quality. Furthermore, some technical details, such as the optimization of trade-off parameters, adjacency matrix binarization, and noise sensitivity, are missing. These omissions may hinder reproducibility and limit the method's practical applicability. The reliance on Adina for dictionary initialization, while effective, could be seen as a limitation, as it introduces dependency on an external method.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:  
Pro:  
- Novel and technically sound methodology with strong synthetic data performance.  
- Joint inference of neurons and assemblies with structured sparsity constraints.  
- Potentially impactful for neuroscience labs working with calcium imaging data.  
Con:  
- Limited clarity and interpretability of results on real-world data.  
- Missing details on key technical aspects, such as parameter optimization and noise handling.  
- Dependency on Adina for dictionary initialization could limit flexibility.  
Overall Assessment:  
This paper represents a significant contribution to the field of calcium imaging analysis, offering a novel and impactful method for inferring neurons and assemblies. While there are some weaknesses, particularly in the real-data analysis and technical details, the strengths outweigh these concerns. The method's originality, technical rigor, and potential significance make it a valuable addition to the conference. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the identified weaknesses.
