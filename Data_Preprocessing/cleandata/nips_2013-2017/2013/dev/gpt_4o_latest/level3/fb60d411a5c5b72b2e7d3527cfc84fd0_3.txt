The paper proposes a novel method for constructing intermediate distributions in Annealed Importance Sampling (AIS) by averaging moments instead of the conventional geometric averages. This approach is specifically tailored for exponential family distributions and is supported by theoretical analysis and empirical results. The authors argue that their method, termed moment averaging, provides a more effective path for AIS, particularly when estimating partition functions of restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs). The paper also introduces a piecewise linear schedule for optimizing the proposed path and discusses its connections to natural gradient updates and potential extensions to non-exponential family models.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Potential Impact: The idea of moment averaging as an alternative to geometric averages is innovative and has the potential to improve the performance of AIS significantly. The empirical results, particularly for RBMs, demonstrate the practical utility of the proposed method.
2. Theoretical Contributions: The paper provides a variational interpretation of the proposed path and derives an asymptotically optimal schedule. Equations 4 and 5, which relate the optimal path to the Fisher information metric, are particularly insightful.
3. Empirical Validation: The experiments, though limited in scope, show that moment averaging outperforms geometric averages in terms of effective sample size (ESS) and accuracy of partition function estimates. The results are promising and suggest broader applicability.
4. Potential Extensions: The discussion on possible extensions, such as applying the method to non-exponential family models and optimizing the trajectory globally, opens avenues for future research.
5. Reproducibility: The authors emphasize the importance of reproducible science and advocate for sharing source code, which is commendable.
Weaknesses:
1. Theoretical Motivation: The theoretical justification for why moment averaging should outperform geometric averages is underdeveloped. While the variational interpretation is helpful, a deeper exploration of the theoretical underpinnings is needed.
2. Terminology and Clarity: The term "high curvature" is mischaracterized and should be replaced with "large information distance per theta distance." This mislabeling could confuse readers unfamiliar with the topic.
3. Experimental Scope: The experiments are limited to second-order models (e.g., RBMs), despite claims that the method is applicable to arbitrary exponential family models. Extending the experiments to other models would strengthen the paper.
4. Unclear Results: In Section 5.1, the rationale for larger variance (1437.89) being better is unclear and counterintuitive. This result requires further explanation.
5. Insufficient Quantitative Evidence: The use of terms like "substantially" (e.g., on Page 7) without quantitative backing weakens the claims. More rigorous statistical analysis would improve the paper.
6. Equation 3: While noted as "cool," Equation 3 lacks sufficient elaboration, leaving its implications underexplored.
7. Path Interpolation: The paper does not adequately explain why interpolating sufficient statistics is preferable to interpolating parameter values, which is a key aspect of the proposed method.
Recommendation:
Overall, the paper makes a valuable contribution to the field of probabilistic modeling and Monte Carlo methods. Its novel approach to AIS paths and promising experimental results make it a strong candidate for acceptance. However, the authors should address the theoretical gaps, clarify ambiguous results, and expand the experimental scope to strengthen the paper further. 
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Novel and impactful method for AIS.
- Promising empirical results with RBMs.
- Opens avenues for future research and extensions.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Limited theoretical motivation.
- Restricted experimental scope.
- Some ambiguous and underexplored results.
Final Recommendation: Accept with Minor Revisions.
