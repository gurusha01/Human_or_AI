The paper addresses the model selection properties of the Gauss-Lasso procedure, a two-step method combining Lasso and Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimators. Its primary contribution is the introduction of a Generalized Irrepresentability Condition (GIC), which is shown to be weaker than the traditional irrepresentability condition required for Lasso. The authors rigorously prove that under GIC, the Gauss-Lasso procedure can recover the true support of the parameter vector with high probability. This is a significant theoretical advancement, as it broadens the applicability of support recovery in high-dimensional regression settings.
Strengths:
1. Novel Contribution: The introduction of GIC and its theoretical justification is a meaningful step forward in understanding model selection in high-dimensional regression. The authors convincingly argue that GIC is less restrictive than standard irrepresentability, thereby covering a broader class of problems.
2. Theoretical Rigor: The proofs are detailed and build upon foundational results in the field, such as restricted eigenvalue conditions and KKT conditions. The paper also improves upon prior results by relaxing assumptions on the minimum coefficient size required for support recovery.
3. Comparison with Existing Work: The paper situates its contributions well within the existing literature, referencing key works such as [14], [21], and [23]. It highlights how Gauss-Lasso outperforms Lasso under certain conditions, particularly when the irrepresentability condition fails.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity and Organization: The exposition is dense and could benefit from significant streamlining. For example, the introduction and technical sections are overly verbose, making it difficult for readers to grasp the key insights quickly. Redundant explanations, such as repeated discussions of GIC, should be condensed.
2. Lack of High-Level Intuition: While the theoretical results are strong, the paper lacks a clear high-level explanation of how these results improve upon prior work, such as [1]. A concise summary of the novel tools and techniques used in the proofs would enhance accessibility.
3. Empirical Validation: The paper is entirely theoretical, and while this is acceptable for a foundational contribution, empirical comparisons with other two-step procedures (e.g., [2], [3]) would strengthen the claims. Specifically, it would be useful to demonstrate the practical advantages of Gauss-Lasso under GIC.
4. Sparse Approximation: The paper does not address how Gauss-Lasso performs when the parameter vector is approximately sparse, a scenario common in real-world applications. It is unclear whether the procedure can still identify the largest components reliably.
Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Clarity: Streamline the introduction and technical sections to focus on the main contributions. Clearly delineate how GIC differs from and generalizes standard irrepresentability.
2. Comparative Analysis: Include a detailed comparison with other two-step procedures, particularly regarding the strength of GIC versus weaker conditions.
3. Practical Relevance: Discuss the performance of Gauss-Lasso in approximately sparse settings and provide empirical results to validate the theoretical claims.
4. Highlight Novelty: Add a concise summary of the novel proof techniques and tools used, emphasizing how they advance the state of the art.
Recommendation:
The paper tackles an important problem and makes a significant theoretical contribution by introducing GIC and demonstrating its utility for Gauss-Lasso. However, the presentation and contextual comparisons need substantial improvement. With revisions to improve clarity, include empirical validation, and address approximately sparse settings, the paper could make a strong contribution to the field. Conditional acceptance is recommended.
