The paper addresses the problem of distributed best-arm identification in multi-armed bandits (MAB), focusing on collaborative learning among \( k \) players under communication constraints. The authors propose algorithms for both single and multiple communication rounds and analyze the trade-off between communication and learning performance. The key contributions include achieving a \( \sqrt{k} \)-speed-up in the single communication round setting, an \( \epsilon^2/Rk \)-speed-up for \( R \) communication rounds, and proving a matching lower bound for the one-round case. The results are significant as they provide the first non-trivial guarantees for distributed MAB in collaborative settings, which is relevant for large-scale applications like model selection and web-based decision-making.
Strengths:
1. Technical Soundness: The paper is technically rigorous, with well-supported claims through theoretical analysis. The authors provide clear upper and lower bounds, demonstrating the optimality of their results in specific settings. The inclusion of a matching lower bound for the one-round case strengthens the validity of their claims.
2. Originality: The work is novel in addressing the distributed MAB problem with a focus on collaborative exploration. While previous research has explored competitive multi-player MAB or distributed stochastic optimization, this paper uniquely tackles the trade-off between communication and learning in a collaborative framework.
3. Significance: The results are impactful, offering practical insights for distributed systems where communication is costly. The algorithms are particularly relevant for modern distributed frameworks like MapReduce, making the work valuable to both researchers and practitioners in the field.
4. Clarity: The paper is well-written and organized, with a clear exposition of the problem, related work, and contributions. The theoretical results are presented with sufficient detail, and the algorithms are described in a way that facilitates reproducibility.
Weaknesses:
1. Experimental Validation: The paper lacks empirical results to complement the theoretical findings. While the theoretical analysis is robust, experiments demonstrating the practical performance of the proposed algorithms would strengthen the paper.
2. Limited Discussion of Assumptions: The paper assumes a uniform load balancer and unrestricted message sizes in communication rounds. A discussion of how these assumptions affect real-world applicability would be beneficial.
3. Minor Corrections: Some notational inconsistencies and typographical errors were noted, such as unclear transitions between sections and occasional missing citations for referenced works.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper addresses a timely and important problem in distributed learning, providing novel theoretical insights.
- The results are technically sound and advance the state of the art in distributed MAB.
- The work is well-written and accessible to the NIPS community, with potential for significant impact.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The lack of experimental validation limits the practical applicability of the results.
- The assumptions regarding communication and load balancing may not fully align with real-world distributed systems.
Recommendation:
I recommend acceptance of this paper, as its contributions are significant and well-aligned with the interests of the NIPS community. Addressing the minor weaknesses, particularly by adding experimental results in a future revision, would further enhance the paper's impact.
