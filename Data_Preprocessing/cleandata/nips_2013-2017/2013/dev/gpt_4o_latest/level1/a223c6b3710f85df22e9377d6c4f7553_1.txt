The paper presents a novel two-stage method, the Gauss-Lasso selector, for model selection in high-dimensional regression settings where the number of covariates \( p \) exceeds the sample size \( n \). The authors address the limitations of the Lasso, which relies on the restrictive irrepresentability condition for correct support recovery. They propose a generalized irrepresentability condition (GIC), which is weaker and more broadly applicable. The Gauss-Lasso first applies the Lasso to identify an initial active set of covariates and then refines the selection using ordinary least squares (OLS) restricted to this set. The authors provide theoretical guarantees for the Gauss-Lasso under GIC, demonstrating its ability to recover the true support with high probability. They also extend their analysis to random Gaussian designs and show that the Gauss-Lasso achieves nearly optimal sample complexity and detection thresholds.
Strengths
1. Novelty and Generalization: The introduction of GIC as a relaxation of the irrepresentability condition is a significant theoretical contribution. It broadens the applicability of model selection techniques to cases where the Lasso fails.
2. Theoretical Rigor: The paper provides detailed proofs and conditions under which the Gauss-Lasso achieves correct support recovery. The results improve upon prior work by relaxing assumptions and reducing dependencies on restrictive conditions like mutual incoherence.
3. Practical Implications: The Gauss-Lasso is computationally efficient, leveraging the simplicity of the Lasso and OLS while achieving superior performance in challenging high-dimensional settings. This makes it relevant for applications in genomics, signal processing, and other fields.
4. Comparison to Prior Work: The paper situates its contributions within the context of existing literature, such as the Lasso, adaptive Lasso, and thresholding methods, and highlights its advantages in terms of weaker assumptions and improved guarantees.
Weaknesses
1. Empirical Validation: The paper lacks experimental results to validate the theoretical findings. While the theoretical contributions are strong, empirical demonstrations on synthetic or real-world datasets would strengthen the paper's impact and practical relevance.
2. Clarity of Presentation: The paper is dense and assumes significant familiarity with high-dimensional statistics. Key ideas, such as the intuition behind GIC and its practical implications, could be better highlighted for a broader audience.
3. Limited Scope of Extensions: While the paper extends its analysis to random Gaussian designs, it does not explore other types of design matrices or noise distributions, which could limit its generalizability in practice.
Arguments for Acceptance
- The paper makes a significant theoretical contribution by introducing GIC and demonstrating its utility in high-dimensional model selection.
- It addresses a well-known limitation of the Lasso and provides a computationally efficient alternative with provable guarantees.
- The results are likely to inspire further research and practical applications in high-dimensional statistics and machine learning.
Arguments Against Acceptance
- The lack of empirical validation weakens the practical impact of the work.
- The dense and technical presentation may limit accessibility to a broader audience, including practitioners.
Recommendation
Overall, this paper is a strong theoretical contribution to the field of high-dimensional regression and model selection. While the lack of empirical results is a limitation, the novelty and rigor of the theoretical analysis make it a valuable addition to the conference. I recommend acceptance, with a suggestion to include experimental validation and improve clarity in future revisions.
