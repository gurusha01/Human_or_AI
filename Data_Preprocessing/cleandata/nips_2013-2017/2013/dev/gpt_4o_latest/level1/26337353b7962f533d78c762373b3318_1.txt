This paper introduces a novel framework, Sparse Heterarchical Matrix Factorization (SHMF), for unsupervised learning in hierarchical data structures, with a specific application to calcium imaging data. The authors propose a multi-level matrix decomposition approach that captures hierarchical and heterarchical relationships between levels of data (e.g., pixels → neurons → assemblies). Unlike prior work, SHMF jointly learns these relationships and enforces structured sparsity constraints, offering a unified framework for interpreting complex neural data. The method is validated on synthetic datasets and real-world calcium imaging data, demonstrating its ability to recover neuronal assemblies and their temporal dynamics with higher sensitivity and comparable precision to existing methods.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Originality: The paper addresses a significant gap in unsupervised learning by extending bilinear matrix factorization to a multi-level, heterarchical framework. This approach is novel and well-motivated by the hierarchical nature of neural data.
2. Technical Soundness: The optimization strategy, based on block coordinate descent, is rigorously described and supported by prior literature. The inclusion of structured sparsity constraints is a thoughtful addition that aligns with the biological properties of neural data.
3. Empirical Validation: The method is thoroughly evaluated on synthetic data, where ground truth is available, and on real-world calcium imaging data. The results demonstrate the method's robustness, particularly in identifying neuronal assemblies and detecting calcium transients.
4. Significance: Given the growing importance of calcium imaging in neuroscience, SHMF has the potential to become a valuable tool for analyzing neural circuits. Its ability to jointly infer neurons, assemblies, and their temporal dynamics is a clear advancement over existing methods.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity: While the paper is dense with technical details, some sections (e.g., optimization and multi-level generalization) could benefit from clearer explanations or additional diagrams to aid understanding, particularly for readers less familiar with matrix factorization techniques.
2. Evaluation Metrics: The evaluation focuses on sensitivity and precision but lacks a comprehensive analysis of computational efficiency, scalability, and robustness to hyperparameter choices. These aspects are crucial for practical adoption.
3. Comparison to Prior Work: While the paper compares SHMF to existing methods like MNNMF+Adina and KSVDS+Adina, the discussion could be expanded to provide deeper insights into the trade-offs (e.g., computational cost, interpretability) between these approaches.
4. Generality: The framework is tailored to calcium imaging data, and its applicability to other domains with hierarchical data structures is not explicitly demonstrated.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper presents a significant methodological contribution with clear implications for neuroscience.
- The empirical results are compelling, showing improvements over state-of-the-art methods in key tasks.
- The work is well-situated within the existing literature and addresses an important, underexplored problem.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The clarity of the presentation could be improved, particularly in the optimization and generalization sections.
- The evaluation lacks a detailed analysis of computational efficiency and scalability.
- Broader applicability beyond calcium imaging is not demonstrated.
Recommendation:
Overall, this paper makes a strong contribution to the field of unsupervised learning and its application to neuroscience. While there are areas for improvement in clarity and evaluation, the novelty and significance of the work outweigh these concerns. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to improve clarity and expand the discussion on evaluation metrics and broader applicability.
