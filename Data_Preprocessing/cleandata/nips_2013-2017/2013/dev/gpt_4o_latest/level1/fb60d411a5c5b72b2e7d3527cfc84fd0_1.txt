The paper proposes a novel sequence of intermediate distributions for annealed importance sampling (AIS) based on moment averaging, contrasting it with the traditional geometric averaging approach. The authors analyze the theoretical properties of the proposed method, derive an asymptotically optimal piecewise linear schedule, and empirically evaluate its performance on estimating partition functions of restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs). The key contribution lies in demonstrating that moment averaging often outperforms geometric averaging, particularly in cases where geometric paths fail to adequately capture regions of high probability in the target distribution. The paper also provides a variational interpretation of the two approaches and discusses their asymptotic equivalence under perfect transitions.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Theoretical Contributions: The introduction of moment averaging as an alternative to geometric averaging is a significant contribution. The theoretical analysis, including the derivation of the cost functional and the optimal binned schedule, is rigorous and well-supported.
2. Empirical Validation: The authors provide extensive experiments on both synthetic data (e.g., Gaussian distributions) and real-world RBMs, demonstrating the practical benefits of moment averaging. The results are compelling, particularly in cases where geometric paths fail, such as under poor mixing conditions.
3. Clarity and Organization: The paper is well-written and logically structured. The inclusion of illustrative examples, such as the Gaussian case, helps clarify the intuition behind moment averaging.
4. Broader Impact: The proposed method has potential applications beyond AIS, including other path-based sampling algorithms like parallel tempering and tempered transitions. This broadens the paper's significance.
Weaknesses:
1. Computational Overhead: While the authors address the computational challenges of moment matching in intractable models, the proposed approximations (e.g., MAS cheap) may still be resource-intensive for larger models. A more detailed analysis of the trade-offs between accuracy and computational cost would strengthen the paper.
2. Limited Exploration of Suboptimal Mixing: The theoretical analysis assumes perfect transitions, which is often unrealistic in practice. While the authors acknowledge this limitation, a deeper exploration of the impact of poor mixing on the proposed method would be valuable.
3. Comparison with Other Methods: The paper primarily compares moment averaging with geometric averaging. Including comparisons with other state-of-the-art AIS variants or alternative partition function estimation techniques would provide a more comprehensive evaluation.
4. Generality of Results: The focus on exponential family models limits the generality of the proposed method. While the authors suggest broader applicability, explicit demonstrations on non-exponential family distributions would strengthen this claim.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper addresses a fundamental problem in partition function estimation and provides a novel, theoretically grounded solution.
- The empirical results convincingly demonstrate the practical utility of moment averaging, particularly in challenging scenarios.
- The work has potential implications for a wide range of sampling-based algorithms, making it relevant to a broad audience.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The computational feasibility of the proposed method, particularly for large-scale models, remains somewhat unclear.
- The theoretical analysis does not fully account for practical challenges like poor mixing, which could limit the method's applicability.
Recommendation:
Overall, this paper makes a strong contribution to the field of AIS and partition function estimation. While there are some limitations, the strengths outweigh the weaknesses, and the proposed method has clear potential to advance the state of the art. I recommend acceptance, with minor revisions to address the concerns about computational overhead and broader applicability.
