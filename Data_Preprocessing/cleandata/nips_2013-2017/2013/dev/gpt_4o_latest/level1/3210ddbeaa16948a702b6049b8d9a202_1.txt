The paper introduces a novel approach to approximating the χ² similarity using sign stable random projections, specifically focusing on their application in high-dimensional and streaming data contexts. The authors propose storing only the signs of projected data (1-bit representation) after applying α-stable random projections, which significantly reduces storage and computational costs. Notably, they demonstrate that for α = 1 (Cauchy random projections), the collision probability between signs can be approximated as a function of the χ² similarity, a widely used metric in histogram-based features for text and vision applications. The paper provides theoretical bounds for collision probabilities, experimental validation on real-world datasets, and practical applications in classification tasks, showcasing the method's promise for large-scale learning.
Strengths:
1. Technical Soundness: The paper is technically rigorous, providing theoretical bounds for collision probabilities and validating them through simulations and experiments. The authors also derive two approximations for collision probabilities, which are shown to be accurate in practice.
2. Novelty: The use of sign stable random projections to approximate χ² similarity is a novel contribution. While sign-based methods have been explored for other metrics (e.g., sim-hash for cosine similarity), this work extends the idea to χ² similarity, which is particularly relevant for histogram-based features.
3. Practical Significance: The proposed method addresses challenges in high-dimensional and streaming data scenarios, such as storage efficiency and computational scalability. The ability to use 1-bit representations for large-scale applications is a significant advantage.
4. Experimental Validation: The authors validate their approach on real-world datasets (e.g., UCI-PEMS and MNIST-Small) and demonstrate its utility in classification tasks. The experiments confirm the accuracy of the proposed approximations and the practical applicability of the method.
5. Clarity and Organization: The paper is well-organized and clearly written, with detailed explanations of theoretical results, experimental setups, and implications.
Weaknesses:
1. Bound Tightness: While the theoretical bound for collision probabilities is exact for α = 2 and reasonably sharp for α ≥ 1.5, it becomes less accurate for α ≤ 1. This limitation is acknowledged, but a tighter bound for smaller α values would strengthen the contribution.
2. Limited Scope of Experiments: The experimental validation is limited to a few datasets. While the results are promising, additional experiments on larger and more diverse datasets would provide stronger evidence of the method's generalizability.
3. Comparison with Alternatives: The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with other methods for approximating χ² similarity, such as those based on nonlinear transformations or kernel approximations. This would help contextualize the advantages and limitations of the proposed approach.
4. Focus on χ² Similarity: The method is tailored to χ² similarity, which, while widely used, may not generalize to other similarity measures. A discussion on the adaptability of the approach to other metrics would be valuable.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper addresses an important problem in high-dimensional and streaming data analysis.
- It provides a novel and practical solution with strong theoretical and experimental support.
- The proposed method has clear applications in large-scale machine learning and information retrieval.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The theoretical bound for collision probabilities is not tight for small α values.

- The paper lacks a comprehensive comparison with alternative methods.
Recommendation:
Overall, this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of large-scale learning and similarity estimation. While there are some limitations, the strengths outweigh the weaknesses. I recommend acceptance, with minor revisions to address the experimental scope and comparisons with alternative methods.
