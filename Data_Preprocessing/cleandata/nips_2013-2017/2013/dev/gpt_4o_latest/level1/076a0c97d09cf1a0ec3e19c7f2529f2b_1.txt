The paper introduces novel kernel-based nonparametric tests for detecting Lancaster three-variable interactions and total independence, leveraging embeddings of signed measures into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). The proposed tests are computationally efficient, consistent against all alternatives for a broad family of kernels, and particularly sensitive to higher-order interactions where two independent causes jointly influence a third variable. This sensitivity makes the Lancaster test especially useful for detecting V-structures in directed graphical models, outperforming existing nonparametric tests in such scenarios. The paper also extends the framework to cases where variables are multivariate or lie in structured, non-Euclidean domains, and demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed methods on synthetic datasets.
Strengths
1. Technical Soundness: The paper is technically rigorous, providing clear mathematical formulations for the proposed tests. The use of RKHS embeddings ensures consistency against all alternatives, a significant advantage over traditional methods.
2. Novelty: The work generalizes pairwise independence tests (e.g., HSIC) to three-variable interactions, filling a gap in the literature. The introduction of the Lancaster interaction test as a surrogate for detecting higher-order factorizations is particularly innovative.
3. Significance: The ability to detect non-additive interactions and V-structures in graphical models is a meaningful contribution to both machine learning and statistics. The proposed methods could have broad applications in causal inference and structure learning.
4. Empirical Validation: The experiments convincingly demonstrate the superiority of the Lancaster test over competing methods, particularly in high-dimensional settings and scenarios with weak pairwise but strong joint dependencies.
5. Clarity: The paper is well-organized, with detailed derivations and clear explanations of the proposed methods. The inclusion of experimental benchmarks enhances the accessibility of the results.
Weaknesses
1. Scalability for Higher Dimensions: While the paper briefly discusses extensions to more than three variables, the computational complexity of higher-order interactions (e.g., summing over all partitions) is prohibitive. This limits the practical applicability of the methods to datasets with more than three interacting variables.
2. Limited Real-World Applications: The experimental validation focuses solely on synthetic datasets. While these are well-designed, the lack of real-world benchmarks leaves open questions about the practical utility of the methods in diverse domains.
3. Kernel Selection: The paper does not provide detailed guidance on kernel selection or parameter tuning, which could affect the performance of the proposed tests in practice.
4. Comparison with Conditional Independence Tests: While the Lancaster test is shown to outperform conditional independence tests in detecting V-structures, the paper does not explore scenarios where conditional independence tests might be more appropriate, such as datasets with strong causal assumptions.
Recommendation
The paper makes a significant contribution to the field of nonparametric hypothesis testing and is well-suited for NeurIPS. However, addressing the scalability issues and validating the methods on real-world datasets would strengthen the impact of this work. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions.
