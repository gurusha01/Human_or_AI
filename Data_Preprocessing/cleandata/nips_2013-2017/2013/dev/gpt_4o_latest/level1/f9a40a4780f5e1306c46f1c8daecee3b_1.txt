This paper presents two novel Bayesian entropy estimators, ĤDBer and ĤDSyn, specifically designed to estimate the entropy of binary spike trains in neural data. The authors address a key limitation of existing entropy estimators, which fail to exploit the characteristic statistical structure of neural spike trains, such as sparsity and higher-order correlations. By incorporating prior knowledge about spike train statistics through parametric and empirical synchrony distributions, the proposed methods achieve more accurate and efficient entropy estimation. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of these estimators on both simulated and real neural datasets, showing substantial improvements over traditional methods like the Nemenman–Shafee–Bialek (NSB) estimator.
Strengths
1. Technical Innovation: The use of hierarchical mixture-of-Dirichlets priors with carefully chosen base measures (e.g., Bernoulli and empirical synchrony distributions) is a significant advancement. It allows the estimators to incorporate domain-specific knowledge, such as spike sparsity and correlation structures, leading to faster convergence and reduced bias.
2. Theoretical Rigor: The paper provides a thorough mathematical formulation of the proposed estimators, including derivations of posterior entropy estimates and computational optimizations to handle high-dimensional data efficiently.
3. Empirical Validation: The authors validate their methods on both simulated data and real neural recordings, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing estimators. The inclusion of practical applications, such as quantifying temporal dependencies in neural signals, highlights the utility of the proposed methods.
4. Clarity of Results: The figures and comparisons (e.g., convergence plots) effectively illustrate the advantages of the proposed estimators, particularly ĤDSyn, in capturing complex neural statistics.
Weaknesses
1. Limited Scope of Evaluation: While the proposed methods perform well on the datasets tested, the paper does not explore their applicability to other types of neural data or non-neural domains. It remains unclear how generalizable the approach is.
2. Dependence on Prior Knowledge: The success of the estimators, especially ĤDSyn, relies heavily on the quality of the empirical synchrony distribution. If the sample size is small or the distribution is poorly estimated, the performance may degrade.
3. Computational Complexity: Although the authors address computational challenges, the methods may still be computationally intensive for very large neural populations or datasets with high temporal resolution.
