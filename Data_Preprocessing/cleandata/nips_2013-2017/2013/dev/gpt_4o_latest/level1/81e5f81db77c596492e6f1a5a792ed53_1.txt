This paper presents a novel approach to sparse principal subspace estimation using a convex relaxation based on the Fantope, a convex hull of rank-d projection matrices. The authors propose a semidefinite program (SDP) that generalizes DSPCA to higher dimensions (d > 1) and demonstrate its computational efficiency via an ADMM algorithm. The paper establishes near-optimal convergence rates for subspace estimation without relying on restrictive spiked covariance models, extending theoretical guarantees to a broader class of input matrices, including Kendall's tau correlation matrices. The authors also provide numerical evidence showing the superiority of their method over deflation-based approaches in terms of both statistical and computational efficiency.
Strengths:
1. Technical Contribution: The paper introduces a novel SDP formulation for sparse principal subspace estimation, which is both computationally tractable and theoretically sound. The use of the Fantope as a constraint is innovative and addresses limitations of prior methods.
2. Theoretical Guarantees: The authors rigorously establish near-optimal convergence rates and provide support recovery guarantees under general statistical settings. These results extend beyond the restrictive spiked covariance model, making the work broadly applicable.
3. Algorithmic Development: The ADMM-based algorithm is well-designed, leveraging efficient projections onto the Fantope and dynamic penalty updates to ensure convergence. The closed-form solution for Fantope projection is a practical highlight.
4. Empirical Validation: The simulation study is thorough, comparing the proposed method (FPS) against multiple deflation-based baselines. The results convincingly demonstrate the advantages of FPS, particularly in challenging settings with shared support or high noise levels.
5. Broader Applicability: The framework accommodates non-standard input matrices, such as Kendall's tau correlation, extending its utility to robust and nonparametric settings.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity: While the paper is technically rigorous, it is dense and may be challenging for readers unfamiliar with convex optimization or sparse PCA. The notation, while precise, could benefit from additional explanation in some sections (e.g., the Fantope constraint).
2. Practical Considerations: The paper does not provide detailed guidance on selecting the regularization parameter Î» or the subspace dimension d in practice. While cross-validation is mentioned as a potential solution, no concrete methodology is proposed.
3. Empirical Scope: The simulations focus on synthetic data with Gaussian distributions. It would strengthen the paper to include real-world datasets or non-Gaussian settings to demonstrate robustness in practical applications.
4. Computational Complexity: Although the ADMM algorithm is efficient, the reliance on eigendecomposition for Fantope projection may still be computationally expensive for very large-scale problems. A discussion of scalability or potential approximations would be valuable.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper makes a significant theoretical and algorithmic contribution to sparse subspace estimation, addressing longstanding challenges in the field.
- The proposed method is novel, well-supported by theory, and empirically validated, demonstrating clear advantages over existing approaches.
- The extension to non-standard input matrices (e.g., Kendall's tau) broadens the applicability of the method.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The paper's clarity and accessibility could be improved, particularly for readers outside the immediate domain of sparse PCA or convex optimization.
- Practical aspects, such as parameter selection and scalability, are not fully addressed, limiting immediate applicability.
Recommendation:
Overall, this paper represents a strong scientific contribution to the field of high-dimensional statistics and optimization. While there are minor concerns regarding clarity and practical considerations, these do not detract significantly from the quality of the work. I recommend acceptance, with suggestions for improving clarity and including more practical guidance in the final version.
