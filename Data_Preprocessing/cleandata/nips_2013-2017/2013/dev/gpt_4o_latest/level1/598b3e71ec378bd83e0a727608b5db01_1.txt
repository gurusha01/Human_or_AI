The paper addresses the problem of exploration in Multi-Armed Bandits (MAB) within a distributed setting, where \( k \) players collaborate to identify an \(\epsilon\)-optimal arm. The authors focus on the tradeoff between the number of arm pulls required by each player and the amount of inter-player communication. The key contributions include a demonstration of a \(\sqrt{k}\) parallel speedup with a single communication round, a lower bound proving the optimality of this speedup, and an algorithm achieving the ideal \( k \)-speedup with logarithmic communication in \( 1/\epsilon \). The paper also introduces a multi-round algorithm that achieves a tradeoff between communication rounds and learning performance. These results are contextualized within the broader literature on distributed learning, including prior work on collaborative MAB problems and distributed optimization.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Originality: The paper introduces a distributed MAB framework that is both collaborative and communication-efficient, addressing a gap in the literature. The focus on a single communication round is particularly relevant for practical distributed systems like MapReduce.
2. Theoretical Contributions: The authors provide rigorous theoretical guarantees, including upper and lower bounds on the tradeoff between communication and learning performance. The \(\sqrt{k}\) speedup result is particularly compelling and well-supported.
3. Clarity of Results: The paper clearly delineates its contributions, such as the one-round and multi-round algorithms, and provides detailed analyses of their performance.
4. Relevance and Impact: The results are significant for large-scale applications where communication costs are a bottleneck, such as web search ranking and model selection in distributed systems.
5. Comparison to Related Work: The paper situates its contributions within the context of prior work, such as distributed stochastic optimization and non-stochastic MAB problems, and highlights its novelty in addressing collaborative exploration.
Weaknesses:
1. Experimental Validation: The paper lacks empirical results to validate the theoretical findings. While the theoretical analysis is robust, experiments on real-world distributed systems would strengthen the paper's claims and demonstrate practical applicability.
2. Clarity in Presentation: While the theoretical sections are detailed, they may be difficult to follow for non-experts. Simplifying the exposition or including more intuitive explanations would improve accessibility.
3. Limited Exploration of Multi-Round Communication: Although the paper introduces a multi-round algorithm, the exploration of this setting is less detailed compared to the single-round case. Further analysis or experiments could provide deeper insights into the tradeoffs in this regime.
4. Assumptions on Communication: The assumption of unlimited message size in communication rounds is somewhat idealized and may not hold in practical systems. A discussion of how this assumption impacts the results would be valuable.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper makes a significant theoretical contribution to the field of distributed MAB, with results that are both novel and impactful.
- The \(\sqrt{k}\) speedup result and the associated lower bound are particularly strong contributions that advance the state of the art.
- The topic is highly relevant to the NeurIPS community, given the increasing importance of distributed learning in large-scale applications.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The lack of experimental validation limits the practical impact of the results.
- The presentation could be improved to make the paper more accessible to a broader audience.
- The exploration of multi-round communication is less comprehensive, leaving some questions unanswered.
Recommendation:
Overall, the paper is a strong theoretical contribution to the field of distributed MAB and addresses an important problem. While the lack of experiments and some presentation issues are notable weaknesses, these do not outweigh the paper's significant contributions. I recommend acceptance, with the suggestion that the authors include empirical validation and improve the clarity of exposition in the final version.
