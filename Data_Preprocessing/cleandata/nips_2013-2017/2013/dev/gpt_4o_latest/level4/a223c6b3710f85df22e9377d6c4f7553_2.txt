This paper presents a theoretical study on model selection in the large p, small n setting. The authors propose a generalized irrepresentability condition and utilize it to analyze the GAUSS-LASSO selector. While the primary focus is on theoretical aspects of LASSO-type selectors, some experimental results are included in the appendix.
The key contribution of this work is the introduction of the generalized irrepresentability condition, which relaxes the widely used irrepresentability condition. This condition is derived by examining the KKT conditions of LASSO in the noiseless case. The authors leverage this generalized condition to investigate the GAUSS-LASSO selector, which involves performing LASSO selection, followed by least squares estimation on the selected variables, and designating these variables as the leading ones in the least squares fit. Specifically, the authors demonstrate the existence of a threshold for the regularization parameter, below which the support of the LASSO estimator remains stable and includes the ground truth support. The paper establishes theoretical results for LASSO under both deterministic and random design settings.
Theorem 2 establishes that, with high probability, the signed support of the LASSO estimator matches that of the zero-noise problem. However, it is important to highlight that the conditions in Eq. (13-14) may not always hold. For instance, in scenarios with high noise levels, it may not be possible to identify a suitable Î» or c_1 > 1 that satisfies Eq. (13).
Minor comments:  
1. In Lemma 2.1, Eq. (16) should reference Eq. (5).  
2. The definitions of v0 and T0 in Section 1.3 are not clearly explained, though they appear to represent the restriction of v0 to the indices in T0.
After considering the other reviewers' feedback and the authors' response, I maintain my original recommendation. This is an interesting and valuable theoretical contribution to model selection in the large p, small n setting. The generalized irrepresentability condition and its application to the GAUSS-LASSO selector represent significant advancements in this area.
