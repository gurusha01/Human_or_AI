The authors propose an algorithm designed to learn multilevel sparse representations, formulated as a penalized low-rank matrix factorization problem. In this framework, the number of factors typically exceeds two, with each factor corresponding to a distinct entity within the hierarchy. The estimation of these factors is achieved through standard block coordinate descent methods, where one factor is optimized at a time while the others are held fixed, and sparsity-promoting penalties are applied at each step.
The method is contextualized within the analysis of large-scale calcium imaging data, under the assumption that neurons can be grouped into (potentially overlapping) neuronal assemblies, forming a hierarchy of pixel → neuron → assembly. The objective is to estimate the spatial location of each neuron (in terms of pixels), the membership of each neuronal assembly, and the spike activity of each assembly.
The authors claim that their approach outperforms existing methods on synthetic (but realistic) datasets and is capable of accurately identifying neural assemblies in real experimental data.
Originality
To the best of my knowledge, the ideas presented in this paper are novel. The three-way decomposition approach is particularly intriguing, and I appreciate that the authors incorporate a standard two-way decomposition into their model, enforcing consistency between the two. This additional step could enhance the algorithm's robustness to phenomena such as a neuron in an assembly "missing" a spike.
Quality
My primary concern with this work lies in its computational efficiency. Large-scale calcium imaging experiments often involve tens of thousands of pixels and thousands of time steps. While the multilevel decomposition significantly reduces the dimensionality and certain steps of the algorithm can be parallelized, I suspect that the method may still be computationally intensive and require a substantial number of iterations. These aspects should be explicitly addressed in the paper.
Additionally, I am not entirely convinced of the utility of neural assemblies as a modeling assumption. It is unclear whether such assemblies are a common occurrence in practice. Furthermore, if a subset of neurons shares identical spike patterns, this would naturally manifest in the temporal component of the spatiotemporal matrix. The matrix rank would remain low, and it is not immediately evident how the proposed multilevel hierarchical decomposition offers a distinct advantage. The authors should elaborate on their rationale for this modeling choice.
The regularizers \(\OmegaU\) and \(\OmegaA\) also require further clarification. For instance, what specific convex cell shape priors are employed? Moreover, the authors delegate the selection of regularization weights to the user, which seems critical given the large number of regularizers and their pivotal role in the method's performance. While the authors argue that precise prior estimation of the rank is not essential because the algorithm will shrink irrelevant components to zero, this behavior likely depends heavily on the appropriate tuning of the sparsity penalties. This point warrants further discussion.
Clarity
The paper is not written clearly and, in its current form, is accessible only to experts in calcium imaging data analysis. For example, the authors briefly mention in the results section how neural spikes are translated into calcium activity via a convolution operator but fail to discuss this crucial aspect of spike deconvolution in their algorithm. Instead, they appear to sidestep the issue by "eliminating all transients that overlap more than 20%" (if my interpretation is correct). This is an active area of research (e.g., Vogelstein et al., 2010; Grewe et al., 2010), and I would like to see how the authors position their work within this body of literature.
The inclusion of the main equations as a figure struck me as unusual, though this may be a matter of stylistic preference.
Lastly, the presentation of the real data experiments could be more comprehensive. While videos cannot easily be included in a paper, the results shown in Figure 6 are not particularly compelling and require better explanation. Overall, Figure 6 needs a more detailed discussion. While the approach is interesting, the paper requires substantial clarification on several critical points.
