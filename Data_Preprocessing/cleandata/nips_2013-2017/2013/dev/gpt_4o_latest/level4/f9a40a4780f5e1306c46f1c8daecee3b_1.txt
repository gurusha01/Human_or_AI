The proposed method appears to primarily rely on descriptions based on spike count. It would be valuable to explore how the method performs in scenarios where higher-order dependencies beyond spike count are present. In particular, incorporating a comparison with other methods, such as BUB, in cases where spike trains are generated using a GLM, for instance, would strengthen the argument for the method's accuracy.
Minor comments:  
- Line 163: Missing reference.  
- Line 221: Does \(\alpha = 0\) imply a uniform distribution?  
- Line 296: "for" should be corrected to "form."  
Overall, the manuscript is well-written, and the feasibility of the proposed approach is adequately demonstrated through the experiments presented.
