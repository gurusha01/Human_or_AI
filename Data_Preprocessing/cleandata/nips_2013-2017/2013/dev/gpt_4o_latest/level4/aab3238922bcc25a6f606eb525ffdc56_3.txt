The authors introduce a non-linear dependence measure between two random variables, which is derived as the canonical correlation between random, non-linear projections of the variables after a copula transformation. This transformation ensures that the marginals of the random variables are invariant to linear transformations.
The paper outlines a straightforward yet seemingly effective method for quantifying non-linear dependencies between random variables. A key aspect of the approach is the use of non-linear random projections, specifically employing the "random Fourier features" (RFFs) proposed by Rahimi and Recht (2007). The authors evaluate their proposed randomised dependence coefficient (RDC) against a variety of existing coefficients designed to measure both linear and non-linear dependence. Additionally, they explore the RDC's utility in variable selection for linear prediction tasks. These comparisons and experiments are valuable, as they provide readers with a clear understanding of the RDC's behavior and performance.
The paper is well-written, with each component of the proposed procedure clearly explained. The schematic diagram in Figure 1 is particularly helpful in illustrating the methodology. Furthermore, the comparisons with other dependence measures, alongside the empirical results, are insightful and suggest that the RDC demonstrates promising performance.
While the authors utilize RFFs, recent studies have compared RFFs with other random feature generation methods. For instance, Yang et al. (2012) in "Nystrom Method vs Random Fourier Features: A Theoretical and Empirical Comparison" delve into the theoretical distinctions between RFFs and Nystrom features. One notable difference is the sampling strategy: Nystrom features sample in a manner that accounts for the data's probability distribution, potentially yielding a better kernel approximation. If this property is relevant to the RDC, it might be worthwhile to investigate the use of Nystrom features. Additionally, exploring the impact of alternative non-linear projection methods could be interesting, as RFFs are primarily suited for shift-invariant kernels, whereas Nystrom features can accommodate any kernel function.
Yang et al. also demonstrate that increasing the number of random features significantly improves predictive performance. It would be intriguing to examine how the RDC behaves as the number of features, \(k\), is increased.
I have some reservations regarding the theoretical analysis presented in the paper. Specifically, the discussion of the bound in Equation (10) appears to overlook the tradeoff involving \(k\). To minimize the \(LC/\sqrt{k}\) term, \(||m||_F\) could grow substantially relative to \(n\), but this dependency is obscured by describing it as \(O(1/\sqrt{n})\). As it stands, the theoretical analysis does not fully complement the strong empirical results.
Regarding the properties of the RFF approximation in linear prediction, it is possible that the approximation functions as a regularizer. Consequently, I am uncertain whether the type of generalization bounds typically used for prediction algorithms are entirely appropriate for analyzing the performance and behavior of a dependence measure.
A minor issue: the reference to Recht is incorrectly cited as "Brecht" in the text.
===============
After reviewing the authors' rebuttal, I am satisfied with their response. The authors should ensure that the constraints in the canonical correlation analysis (CCA) optimization problem are clearly articulated. Overall, I find this work highly interesting, with strong empirical results. While the theoretical analysis remains incomplete, this does not significantly detract from the importance and impact of the contribution.
