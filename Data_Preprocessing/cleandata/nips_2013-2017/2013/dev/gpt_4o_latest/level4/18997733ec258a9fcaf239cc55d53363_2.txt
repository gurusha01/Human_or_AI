--- Paraphrased Review ---
Original Comments:
This paper introduces a UCB-based contextual bandit algorithm designed to leverage information presented in the form of a graph structure. Specifically, the authors examine a contextual bandit framework with linear payoffs, where the unknown coefficient vectors are user-dependent. A graph structure is provided for the users, and an assumption is made regarding the relationship between the graph structure and the user coefficient vectors, ensuring that the graph conveys meaningful information about these vectors. The proposed algorithm utilizes this information by employing the Laplacian matrix of the graph to transfer knowledge gained from one user to other users with similar coefficient vectors. The authors support their approach with both a regret bound and numerical experiments.
This work represents a natural extension of existing techniques and contributes to an important research direction aimed at integrating bandit methodologies into more practical settings. Overall, the paper is well written. However, there are instances where the English could be improved (see below for specific typos), and I found the intuition provided in Section 4 to be difficult to follow.
After Rebuttal:
After a detailed discussion of this submission with the other reviewers, I have decided to lower my quality score. Initially, I attributed my difficulty in understanding the intuition and design choices in the paper to my limited familiarity with graph-based methods. However, I am now convinced that the intuition is not clearly presented. Additionally, it is unusual to see the implementation of CB while the analysis focuses on TCB. There is no discussion on whether CB could also be analyzed. While it is true that LinUCB and SupLinUCB exhibit a similar discrepancy, the former was thoroughly studied empirically, and the latter was analyzed theoretically in a separate work. Although the technical components of the contribution are sound, I no longer consider this paper a strong candidate for acceptance.
Typos:
- Line 129: "We model the similary" → "We model the similarity"
- Line 137: "That is, despite (1) may contain ..." → "That is, although (1) may contain ..."
- Line 207: "but it rather contains graph ..." → "but contains the graph ..."
- Lines 371/372: "lends itself to be" → "turns out to be"
The paper offers an interesting and natural extension of contextual bandits by incorporating additional information available in the form of a graph, which is a topic of interest in the machine learning community. However, the work lacks novelty and contains several aspects, such as the intuition, that are not well executed.
