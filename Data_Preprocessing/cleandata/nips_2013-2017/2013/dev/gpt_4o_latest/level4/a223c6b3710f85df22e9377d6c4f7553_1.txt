The manuscript investigates the model selection properties of the Gauss-Lasso procedure, a two-step approach. In the first step, a lasso estimator is applied, followed by fitting an OLS estimator on the subset of variables selected in the first step. The estimated support is determined by selecting the largest \(s\) components (in absolute value) of the OLS estimator.
The primary contribution of the paper lies in introducing the generalized irrepresentability condition and demonstrating that, under this condition, the Gauss-Lasso procedure accurately identifies the support of the parameter vector.
First, I believe the presentation of the material could be significantly improved. Section 3.1 appears unnecessary. Instead, the authors could propose a unified optimization framework that generalizes both (5) and (16), and then present the results for this generalized procedure. As it stands, the material is repetitive. More critically, the authors should clarify how their work advances the results of [1]. Specifically, without delving into the proof details, the reader should be provided with a high-level understanding of the novel techniques employed to achieve these improvements. An outline of the proof, highlighting the key differences from [1], would be helpful.
Additionally, there are other two-step procedures that achieve consistent variable selection, such as those discussed in [2] and [3]. These works address variable selection under conditions weaker than the irrepresentability condition. A comparison between the generalized irrepresentability condition and the conditions in [2] and [3] would strengthen the paper.
Another important question worth exploring is the performance of the Gauss-Lasso procedure when the true parameter vector is only approximately sparse. Would the procedure still identify the \(s\) largest components (in absolute value) in such cases?

The paper addresses an important problem, but the exposition requires substantial improvement. The authors should also provide a more thorough comparison with other two-step procedures in the literature.
