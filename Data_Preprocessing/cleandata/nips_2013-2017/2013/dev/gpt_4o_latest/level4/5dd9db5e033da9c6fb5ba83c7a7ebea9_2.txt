* Summary  
The paper introduces an algorithm for exact submodular minimization by solving a related strongly convex function using the Douglas-Rachford splitting method. A central contribution of the work is the formulation of a dual problem whose structure is amenable to the application of Douglas-Rachford splitting.  
* Details  
(Quality) The paper is technically sound but has two notable shortcomings. First, while the experimental results demonstrate the proposed method's fast convergence compared to competing approaches, they lack sufficient detail to ensure reproducibility. Additionally, for the MRF problem, graph cuts (with publicly available code) can be used as a baseline. It would be valuable to compare the proposed method's runtime against graph cuts for this problem, even accounting for the usual caveats (e.g., Matlab vs. C implementations, general-purpose methods vs. problem-specific ones). Furthermore, I am unclear why the parallel methods require more iterations to converge compared to the standard implementations in Figure 2. Could the authors clarify this?  
Second, although the paper empirically shows that the proposed method outperforms competing approaches in speed, it does not provide theoretical guarantees. Competing algorithms often have convergence rates of O(1/t) or O(1/√t). What is the theoretical running time of the Douglas-Rachford approach?  
(Clarity) Overall, the paper is well-written and relatively easy to follow, given the technical nature of the subject. Two suggestions to improve readability are:  
1. On line 072, the authors briefly mention a solution method via level sets, but the explanation is incomplete. The method only becomes clear in Section 2 (L150). Adding clarification around line 072 would enhance understanding.  
2. Define y(A) = ∑{a ∈ A} ya around line 134 for better clarity.  
(Originality) The approach leverages established techniques, but their combination is novel.  
(Significance) Submodular functions are widely used in machine learning, and a fast, general-purpose minimization algorithm could have significant impact. However, the main limitation of the proposed method is the need for specialized techniques to project onto B(F_i) for each subproblem.  
In summary, the paper provides a principled framework for minimizing decomposable submodular functions. While the approach is generally well-articulated, adding further details and addressing the noted concerns would enhance the paper's quality.
