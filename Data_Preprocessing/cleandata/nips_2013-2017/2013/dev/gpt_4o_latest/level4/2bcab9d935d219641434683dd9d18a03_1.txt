This paper explores two algorithms designed for rapid inference in generative models of olfaction, aiming to identify the most probable linear combination of odors that constitute an olfactory stimulus. One algorithm utilizes variational inference, while the other relies on a sampling-based approach. Simulation results indicate that both methods perform adequately, with the authors asserting that inference occurs swiftly within the first 100 ms. However, the elimination of false positives (i.e., detecting odors absent from the stimulus) takes significantly longer and becomes increasingly challenging when more than two odors are present. Given the fundamental differences between the two inference approaches, the authors suggest that experimental data could distinguish which method the brain employs.
The manuscript is well-written and addresses an intriguing topic. The mathematical framework is dense but technically robust, with assumptions that align well with the challenges faced by the olfactory system.
The primary concern lies in the claim that inference can occur within time intervals comparable to those observed in the brain. This assertion is based on the time constants introduced in equation 3.10, which are selected to match neural time constants. However, the differential equations on the right-hand side involve numerous nonlinearities (e.g., logarithmic and exponential functions), raising doubts about whether a neural system could execute these computations with the required precision within the specified time frame. This issue also extends to the sampling-based algorithm. While the authors acknowledge in the discussion that a realistic neural implementation might reduce performance, I believe the timing challenges would be even more pronounced.
A secondary concern pertains to the evaluation of the two models against experimental data, particularly if both are implemented as spike-based networks. The discussion lacks clarity on what specific measurements would be necessary to differentiate between the sampling and variational inference hypotheses.
In conclusion, while the manuscript is technically compelling, its ability to provide a plausible explanation for olfactory processing in the brain remains uncertain.
Minor Comments:
- Figure 1: The curves are difficult to distinguish from the axes. Consider using a logarithmic vertical axis and avoid stretching the figure across the entire page.
- Typo: After Eq. 3.11, "auxillary" should be corrected to "auxiliary."
- Typo: Remove the full stop in the sentence preceding Eq. 3.14.
- Typo: Before Eq. 3.17, "for each odour" should be corrected to "for each odor."
Summary: This paper analyzes two algorithms for rapid inference in generative models of olfaction. While technically sound and engaging, questions remain about its relevance to neural mechanisms.
