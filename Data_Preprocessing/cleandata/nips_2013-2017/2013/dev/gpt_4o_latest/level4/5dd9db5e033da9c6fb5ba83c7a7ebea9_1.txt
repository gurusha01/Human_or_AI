This paper formulates the problem of minimizing decomposable submodular functions as an orthogonal projection problem, enabling the design of algorithms that are inherently parallelizable. Additionally, by concentrating on a specific subclass of decomposable functions, the authors demonstrate that the proximal problem can be solved in fewer iterations compared to existing approaches.
The authors evaluate several established methods for minimizing the Lov√°sz extension over [0,1]^n and provide experimental evidence to support their theoretical claims.
However, the paper lacks empirical validation of the speedups achieved when the proposed approach is implemented as a parallel algorithm, which is a key aspect emphasized in the paper.
Overall, the paper is well-written and clearly presented. It effectively frames the problem of minimizing decomposable submodular functions as an orthogonal projection problem, facilitating the development of parallelizable algorithms. Moreover, the authors show that focusing on a specific subclass of decomposable functions reduces the number of iterations required to solve the proximal problem.
