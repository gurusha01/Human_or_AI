Response to author feedback:  
Thank you for providing clarification regarding the novelty of the robust PCA approach. It would be beneficial to highlight this novelty more prominently in the paper. Additionally, I recommend explicitly discussing the potential generalization to cases involving more than one PCA component, even if the full proof cannot be included in this paper. Simply stating in the Introduction that the focus is on the special case of one component—given its inherent interest and the support of positive empirical results—would add significant value.

Summary:  
This paper extends principal component regression (PCR) by introducing a robust variant that replaces the covariance matrix with multivariate Kendall's tau. The authors propose a straightforward algorithm for learning the model and, more importantly, provide theoretical analysis, including convergence rate guarantees. The proposed method is evaluated on both simulated and equity data.

Quality:  
The proposed method is conceptually simple, involving the estimation of the population Kendall's tau, extracting its first eigenvector, and subsequently performing linear regression on the observations. The approach is intuitive and well-suited for handling data with outliers, making it a compelling alternative to classical PCR in such scenarios.
The use of Kendall's tau as a substitute for the covariance matrix in PCA is an interesting idea, supported by Oja's theorem. However, it is unclear whether this constitutes a novel contribution of the paper, as no prior references are provided, and the authors do not explicitly claim it as a key contribution. This aspect has the potential for broader impact beyond the specific example discussed in the paper. A standalone study on this robust PCA estimator could itself be a valuable contribution. The authors should clarify how their work relates to prior research, particularly the recent ICML'13 paper by Han and Liu.
The theoretical analysis of PCR is a valuable addition. However, the discussion is restricted to the specific case where the outcome depends solely on the first principal component. It is unclear whether the results extend to the more general case involving the first K components. At a minimum, the authors should explicitly state that their theoretical analysis is limited to this special case, as the paper currently does not address the standard PCR setup.
The experiments are well-conducted and effectively demonstrate the advantages of the robust variant. For a theory-focused paper, the experimental results are sufficient. The inclusion of equity data, along with evidence of its non-normality, is a nice touch that strengthens the motivation for the proposed method.

Clarity:  
The paper is reasonably well-written for a theory-heavy manuscript. However, the scope and contributions are somewhat ambiguous. Specifically, it is unclear whether the use of Kendall's tau for robust PCA is novel, the authors do not explicitly acknowledge the limitation to a special case of PCR, and some prior results are labeled as "well known" without proper citations.
A notable issue is that the proofs for the main contributions (Theorems 3.2 and 3.3) are relegated to the Supplementary Material without any mention in the main text. While it is understandable that space constraints may preclude including full proofs, providing an outline or summary in the main paper would enhance clarity.

Originality:  
The paper introduces two key contributions: a novel robust PCR technique and new theoretical results for PCR in general. The significance of the first contribution hinges on whether the use of Kendall's tau in PCA is considered novel. If not, the robust PCR algorithm itself is relatively straightforward.
The theoretical analysis is valuable and builds on recent works by Oja, Vu and Lei, and Ravikumar et al., providing new insights into PCR.
---
Significance:  
The robust method is clearly beneficial for practitioners of PCR, particularly given the theoretical guarantees for convergence rates. However, the impact is somewhat constrained by the focus on the simplified model where the outcome depends only on the first principal component. While the equity data example demonstrates practical utility, it is only a single application, limiting the broader generalizability of the results.

Detailed comments:  
- The second sentence of the Abstract is overly complex and attempts to cover too many aspects of the paper at once. Consider breaking it into at least two sentences for improved readability.  
- Page 3: The phrase "As a well-known result..." requires a citation. In general, the term "well known" is not ideal in scientific writing. It is used twice in the same paragraph to describe results that may not be obvious to many readers.  
- Section 3.1: While it is helpful to remind readers about the elliptical distribution, listing all equivalent formulations may not be necessary, especially since the subsequent analysis relies on only one of them.

In summary, the paper introduces a new method for robust principal component regression and provides interesting theoretical results for PCR. The primary limitation is the restriction of the analysis to the simplest PCR case involving only one principal component.
