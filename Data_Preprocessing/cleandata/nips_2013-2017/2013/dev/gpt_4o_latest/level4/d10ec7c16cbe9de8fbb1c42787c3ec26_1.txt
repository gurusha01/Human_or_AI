This paper provides a novel perspective on Bayesian posterior updates (BPU) by framing them as a system of iterated random functions (IRF) [4]. By proving a general convergence theorem for IRFs with the semigroup property, the authors analyze the convergence of algorithms for change point detection problems [17]. The primary contributions of the paper are as follows:
- Establishing a general convergence theory for IRFs with the semigroup property (Theorem 1).  
- Recasting existing (exact) algorithms for the classical change point problem (CCPP) and the multiple change point problem (MCPP) within the IRF framework, and proving their convergence using Theorem 1.  
- Proposing a fast approximate algorithm for MCPP and demonstrating its convergence based on Theorem 1.  
I find this to be a strong paper with significant potential impact. While BPU is inherently a Markov chain, its analysis within the IRF framework is both natural and insightful. However, previous convergence results for IRFs are not directly applicable to BPU due to the lack of a Lipschitz condition. Instead, the authors leverage the semigroup property of BPU to establish a novel type of convergence theory. I anticipate that this theory will have broad applicability across various domains.
Pros:  
- The paper introduces a fresh perspective by identifying BPU as a special case of IRFs with the semigroup property (Section 3).  
- A general convergence theory for IRFs with the semigroup property (Theorem 1) is developed, which holds promise for a wide range of applications.  
- A fast algorithm for MCPP (Section 4.1) is proposed, and its convergence is rigorously proven (Theorem 2).  
Cons:  
- The connection between the theoretical results (Theorem 2) and the experimental results (Figure 1) is unclear (see the first point in 'Other comments' below).  
- The paper does not introduce any practical applications of multiple change point detection (see the second point in 'Other comments' below).  
Quality:  
The paper is technically robust, and its claims are well-supported by theoretical results.  
Clarity:  
The manuscript is clearly written and well-structured.  
Originality:  
The perspective of interpreting BPU as IRFs with the semigroup property, along with the derived convergence theorem (Theorem 1), is novel.  
Significance:  
The established connection between BPU and IRFs with the semigroup property, as well as the developed convergence theory, could serve as a foundation for other researchers to analyze algorithms for different problems.  
Other comments:  
- It would be helpful if Eqs. (19) and (20) were visually represented in the posterior path graphs in Figure 1. This would clarify how the simulation supports Theorem 2. In Section 4.3, the authors mention that "in some cases, they might deviate for a while, but quickly snap back together once the change points have occurred." However, this is not evident in the figure, as the change points are not explicitly marked.  
- Including a practical example of MCPP would enhance the paper's relevance (none seem to be provided in [17] either). Specifically, it would be useful to explain in which applications the rule λₑ = min(λₛ₁, λₛ₂) is appropriate. Intuitively, it seems more natural to assume that the distribution of Xₑ changes at both λₛ₁ and λₛ₂. Additionally, if I understand correctly, Theorem 2 guarantees convergence only after all sensors are broken. However, practitioners may be more interested in convergence when any single sensor fails or when a user-focused sensor fails.  
- Some of the θs in and around Eq. (4) may not need to be bold-faced.  
- In Line 225, the phrase "probabilities 10 by message-passing" appears corrupted. Is "10" meant to be a citation?  
- In the last line of Section 5, parentheses around Eq. (29) are missing.  
In summary, this is a strong paper that introduces a novel perspective on Bayesian posterior updates as a system of iterated random functions with the semigroup property. It establishes a general convergence theory for such systems, with techniques and results that could have broad applicability.
