The paper presents a novel formulation of the sparse subspace discovery problem, framing it as the task of identifying sparse matrices within a fanotope, which is defined as the convex hull of rank-d projection matrices. This new formulation leads to a convex optimization problem that is addressed using an ADMM algorithm. The authors provide theoretical guarantees for support recovery and Frobenius norm error. Additionally, a series of illustrative synthetic experiments demonstrate the proposed method's improved performance in recovering a sparse factorization of a target matrix, as measured by the Frobenius norm.
The proposed formulation is both elegant and innovative, offering an intuitive alternative to the traditional sparse PCA objective. Furthermore, the method allows for drop-in replacements of the covariance matrix, such as Kendall and Pearson correlations, which can also be nearly-optimally decomposed. This enables an analog of nonlinear sparse PCA, incorporating the familiar constraints from nonparanormal models.
However, a more detailed discussion of the synthetic experiments would enhance the paper. Specifically, the number of selected variables appears to be quite high relative to what one might expect for matrix Pi, which is described as having rank 5 and being fairly sparse. This raises questions about the optimal sparse decomposition for the overlap and non-overlap examples, and whether the proposed method achieves this decomposition with hundreds of selected variables. Additionally, how does DSPCA perform in comparison? While the Frobenius norm is a useful error metric, it does not provide the full picture. The claim that FPS produces estimates that "are typically sparser" is not convincingly supported by the presented results, and further clarification or evidence is needed here.
Regarding notation, the symbol \(\vee\) should be explicitly defined. While its meaning can be inferred from the context, it is sufficiently non-standard to warrant a clear and formal definition.
A few minor issues should also be addressed: the phrase "difficult to interepretation" should be corrected to "difficult to interpret," and Figure 1 should use consistent notation for the Frobenius norm throughout the paper.
Overall, this is a clearly written paper with a novel contribution that recasts the sparse PCA problem and introduces a straightforward new method for estimating sparse subspaces.
