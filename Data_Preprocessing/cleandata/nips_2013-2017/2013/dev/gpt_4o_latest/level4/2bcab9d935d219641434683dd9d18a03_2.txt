This paper investigates two competing hypotheses regarding how the olfactory system might infer the presence and concentration of odors based on the firing rates of olfactory receptor neurons in a complex, mixed environment. The authors define a simple probabilistic model and propose two inference algorithms: one leveraging variational inference and the other relying on sampling. To ensure neural plausibility, dynamical update rules are derived for these algorithms. The biological feasibility of the proposed methods is evaluated using simulated data, leading the authors to conclude that both algorithms could theoretically operate within natural time constraints and produce distinguishable firing patterns.
The study addresses a prominent topic in computational neuroscience and at NIPS: the potential mechanisms by which neural systems might perform probabilistic reasoning and computation. Building on a probabilistic model for olfaction introduced at NIPS 2012 (Beck et al. [1]), the authors enhance the model by incorporating a spike-and-slab prior over odor concentrations and propose two novel inference algorithms. Since Bayesian inference in such models is inherently challenging, developing neurally plausible implementations is a significant undertaking. The authors employ a range of creative approaches to tackle the problem of olfactory inference, resulting in innovative and thought-provoking contributions.
The paper's main conclusion is that both variational inference and sampling could theoretically function as mechanisms for olfactory inference. However, the authors provide limited biological evidence to support the idea that either algorithm is actually utilized by real neural systems or that the implementation-level requirements of these algorithms are biologically plausible. Further exploration of the computational and anatomical constraints imposed by these methods is left as an open question for future research.
The proposed inference algorithms represent a notable departure from other sampling-based approaches and introduce compelling ideas to the expanding field of probabilistic inference in neural circuits. Nonetheless, the lack of biological or experimental evidence supporting probabilistic inference in olfactory systems remains a critical gap. This work extends prior research by presenting a more realistic probabilistic model and two novel inference algorithms for olfaction. While the paper is technically rigorous and theoretically intriguing, the biological constraints necessary for implementing these algorithms in neural systems pose significant challenges.
