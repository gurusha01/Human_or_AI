The paper offers an intriguing perspective on Bayesian inference, framing it as a system of iterated random functions, with a particular emphasis on Bayesian changepoint detection. This perspective facilitates the convergence analysis of message passing algorithms, a topic of broad interest. The authors present a general framework for convergence analysis, with a strong emphasis on detailing the proof techniques involved.
I found the conceptualization of Bayesian inference as iterated random functions to be compelling and believe it will resonate with others as well. It was particularly noteworthy to see how this approach enables the derivation of algorithms with provable geometric convergence. However, I feel the paper could benefit from a deeper discussion on the implications of this theoretical framework and the insights it provides for designing efficient algorithms. While the paper focuses specifically on changepoint detection, it would be helpful to clarify whether this focus is due to some unique properties of this problem. Additionally, it would be valuable to explore other model classes to which this framework could be extended and to discuss the conditions under which the assumptions are likely to hold.
The simulation section could also be enhanced by providing greater clarity on the experimental setup, explicitly indicating the locations of the changepoints, and drawing clearer connections between the observed results and the theoretical convergence behavior as \( n \) increases. Overall, this is an interesting contribution that demonstrates convergence analysis for message passing algorithms. The paper could be further strengthened by improving its accessibility for readers unfamiliar with the tools and by elaborating on the contexts in which these tools are most applicable.
