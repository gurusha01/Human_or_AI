The article addresses the challenging problem of inferring neurons and their assemblies from calcium imaging recordings. It introduces a "bilevel sparse heterarchical matrix factorization" approach, which jointly infers neurons (represented by their pixel-correlates) and the assemblies they belong to (potentially more than one per neuron). More broadly, the method decomposes an observation matrix into a product of several sparse matrices, with the rank decreasing from lower to higher levels. It allows for the imposition of (structured) sparsity constraints at each level and extends beyond hierarchical structures, unlike prior work (Jenatton et al., 2012; Kim and Xing, 2012). Furthermore, the proposed method does not require prior knowledge of the exact number of assemblies, though the authors note that the number of inferred assemblies depends on user-defined optimization parameters.
The method demonstrates strong performance on synthetic data:  
(i) It outperformed MNMMF (Cichocki and Zdunek, 2006) and KSVDS (Rubinstein et al., 2010) in recovering assembly assignments of neurons, with all methods (including the proposed one) initialized using Adina cell sorting (Diego et al., 2013).  
(ii) It showed higher sensitivity than MNMMF, Adina, or cell sorting in detecting calcium transients of individual neurons.  
The paper also includes an example using real experimental data (calcium imaging in the rat hippocampus). However, the reviewer found it difficult to draw clear conclusions from these images, aside from observing that neurons appeared less spatially sparse compared to the initial state derived from the Adina algorithm.
The article emphasizes the parallel inference of structures at all levels, including the most basic level (the dictionary), as well as the time courses at each level. This parallel inference is cited as a key factor in the robust identification of neuronal time courses. However, the inferred dictionary (images of single neurons) is not discussed in the paper. The reviewer suggests that showing reconstructed images of single neurons (e.g., supplementary Fig. 6), alongside the ground truth and reconstructions from other methods, would be more informative than the calcium recording images with unknown ground truth (Fig. 6).
Quality  
The paper is technically robust and provides a detailed description of the proposed cost function, with optimization details included in the Supplemental Material. While some details are missing—such as how the trade-off parameters were optimized (or chosen and used in simulations), how adjacency matrices were binarized for evaluation (line 308), or how sensitive the method was to noise levels (line 300)—the article is overall a well-rounded and complete piece of work.
Clarity  
The paper is clearly written.
Originality  
To the reviewer's knowledge, the proposed approach is novel, and the relevant literature is appropriately cited.
Significance  
The results have potential significance for labs conducting calcium imaging on cell assemblies. The authors demonstrate that the parallel optimization of assembly assignments and time courses at all levels enhances the robustness of inference. For experiments assuming coherent activation of neurons within assemblies, this method could prove highly valuable. Another notable advantage is its flexibility in incorporating prior knowledge at any level of detail. (It is unfortunate, however, that the method appears to rely on initializing the dictionary with one derived from Adina. In principle, the same knowledge used by Adina could be incorporated at the 0-th level of inference.)  
In summary, this is an interesting and technically sound article with potential value for researchers working with structured data, particularly those studying calcium imaging of neural assemblies.
