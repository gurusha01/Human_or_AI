Review - Paper Summary:  
--------------  
The paper investigates algorithms and their theoretical analysis for various scenarios of distributed best-arm identification within the multi-armed bandit (MAB) framework. The authors address both best-arm and ε-best-arm identification tasks, utilizing k "workers" under two communication models: a single communication round and R communication rounds. For the single-round setting, the authors establish a √k speed-up, while for R communication rounds, they demonstrate an ε^{2/R} k speed-up. Notably, when R = O(log(1/ε)), the algorithm achieves the optimal speed-up factor of k. Additionally, the result for the single communication round is supported by a matching lower bound.  
Quality, Clarity, Originality, and Significance:  
------------------------------------------------  
The paper is well-executed, written with clarity, and presents significant and original contributions. (While I did not review the supplementary material in its entirety, apart from the proof of the lower bound, the other results appear credible.) Overall, I believe this is a strong paper that would appeal to the NIPS community. My feedback is minor and can be easily addressed by the authors.
