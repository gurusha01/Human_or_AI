This paper tackles the challenge of constructing hypothesis tests using kernel methods to identify interactions among three variables. The study builds upon HSIC (Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion), which is traditionally used to detect interactions between two variables via kernel methods. Among the various types of three-variable interactions, the authors focus on detecting the Lancaster interaction, a signed measure defined as ¥delta L = Pxyz - PxyPz - PxzPy - PyzPx - 2PxPyPz. In the proposed approach, the marginal and joint probabilities in this expression are embedded into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, with the method being valid as long as the kernels satisfy the ISPD (Integrally Strictly Positive Definite) condition. Through simulation experiments, the authors employ a permutation test using ¥delta L as the test statistic to demonstrate the method's effectiveness in identifying three-way interactions.
On page 8, the statement "Figure 2 plots the Type II error" should instead refer to "Figure 3." The paper is well-written, with appropriate references and rigorous proofs. As noted in the manuscript, extending this method to detect higher-order interactions and structured interactions would be a valuable direction for future research.
