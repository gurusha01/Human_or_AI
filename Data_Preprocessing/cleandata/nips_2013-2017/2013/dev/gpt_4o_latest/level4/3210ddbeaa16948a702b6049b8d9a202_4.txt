This paper demonstrates that the collision probability resulting from alpha-stable random projections can be approximated using functions of Chi-Square similarity. Specifically, when alpha equals 1, the approximation takes a closed-form expression. This finding facilitates the approximation of Chi-Square-related kernels through linear kernels following sign Cauchy random projection.
That said, the derived bounds tend to be loose, and the application section appears rushed and incomplete in its current form.
The paper could be improved by focusing more on its theoretical contributions while providing only brief suggestions for potential applications. Ultimately, the primary strength of the paper lies in its theoretical insights. Despite the looseness of the bounds and the limitations in the application section, the work is intriguing and holds potential practical value or, at the very least, could inspire new methodologies.
After considering the reviews, author response, and subsequent discussion, my score (7) remains unchanged. I value novel, albeit unpolished, contributions over polished but incremental work. I hope the authors will enhance the writing in the final version if the paper is accepted.
The results are original, and the new bounds represent a valuable addition to the literature and the research community.
