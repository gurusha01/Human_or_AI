The authors tackle the challenge of sparse principal component analysis in scenarios where multiple components need to be estimated. The conventional approach computes principal components sequentially, employing a heuristic step known as "deflation" to transition to subsequent components. This sequential approach is inherently fragile, and questioning its robustness is entirely reasonable. The authors propose estimating the matrix through projection onto the Fantope, which serves as a convex relaxation of the set of orthogonal matrices.
The paper introduces an efficient algorithmic framework to address this problem and provides a statistical analysis of the solution. The manuscript is well-written and will likely attract researchers working in this widely studied area.
A key question arises: why is the orthogonality constraint essential in sparse PCA? In standard (dense/full) PCA, orthogonality naturally results from the eigenvalue decomposition, which yields orthogonal factors in low-rank matrix approximations. However, when sparsity is introduced as an additional constraint, why should orthogonality still be enforced? This point warrants further clarification.
The experimental section is unconvincing. A phase-transition diagram illustrating the conditions under which the proposed method outperforms competitors, particularly as the support of the factors begins to overlap, would have been valuable. Additionally, the idea of estimating multiple principal components simultaneously has already been explored by Journee et al. (reference [8] in the paper, though all authors should be explicitly named). Why is there no comparison with their method, especially since their code is publicly available? A numerical comparison with sparse matrix factorization methods is also missing. Furthermore, comparing the supports identified by each method on real-world datasets could provide additional insights.
Overall, the paper addresses a relevant problem, is well-written, and proposes a method that appears efficient for the authors' stated objectives. However, the orthogonality constraint seems more problematic than beneficial, and a more thorough discussion on this aspect is needed. The algorithm represents an incremental update of DSPCA [1] with the addition of the Fantope constraint, and the theoretical contributions, while solid, are largely incremental and not particularly groundbreaking.
