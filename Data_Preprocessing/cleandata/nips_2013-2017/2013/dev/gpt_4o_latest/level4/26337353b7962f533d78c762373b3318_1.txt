This paper introduces a technique for decomposing a matrix into a product of more than two sparse matrices in a hierarchical fashion, where the rank progressively decreases from the lower to higher levels. The proposed approach is referred to as multi-level sparse matrix factorization. A key advantage of this decomposition is the ability to apply varying levels of regularization across different levels.
In general, the concept of multi-level sparse factorization is innovative and has been presented with clarity.
1) Tuning
It may be possible to derive data-driven methods for tuning, rather than relying on user-specified values.
2) Optimization
Could the authors provide insights into the convergence properties of the proposed learning algorithm, such as its convergence speed or computational complexity? Overall, this is an interesting and novel approach.
