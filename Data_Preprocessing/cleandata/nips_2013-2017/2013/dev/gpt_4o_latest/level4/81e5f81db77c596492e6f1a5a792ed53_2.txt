The authors address the Sparse PCA problem, which involves performing PCA under the assumption that the "principal vectors" are supported on only a small subset of the variables. They introduce a convex relaxation to tackle this problem and provide an analysis of its performance. Additionally, they develop an ADMM-based approach to efficiently solve the resulting semidefinite program (SDP). The authors also present theoretical results for the case where a Kendall's tau matrix is used as input instead of the standard sample covariance matrix.
The paper is well-written, and the authors have done a commendable job of clearly explaining the key concepts as they are introduced. The results presented in the paper appear to be correct.
I find the convex formulation to be a strong aspect of the paper. The techniques employed to derive it are straightforward, which is a notable strength. This formulation integrates well with the ADMM algorithm and Lemma 4.1. I have a minor suggestion: it would be helpful if the authors mention earlier in the paper (perhaps alongside the motivation for the convex relaxation) that they have a closed-form expression for the projection onto the fantope.
That said, the statistical analysis appears somewhat lacking, particularly in the low-rank and near-low-rank cases. For instance, when there are only \(d\) nonzero eigenvalues, the bound provided by the authors could potentially deviate significantly from the minimax bound. On a related note, the statement "It is possible (with more technical work) to tighten the bound..." in the last paragraph of page 5 could be rephrased. Without a discussion of what this technical work entails, the statement does not seem to add much value.
Although the proofs are included in the Appendix, it would be beneficial for the authors to provide a brief proof sketch immediately after stating each result in the main text. This would aid readers, especially since reviewers are not obligated to consult the supplementary material.
The section on Simulation Results also feels underdeveloped. The figures need improvement, as Figure 1(a) is difficult to interpret in a printed version of the paper. Additionally, the authors should clarify (either in the text or figure captions) the precise meaning of "overlapping" and "non-overlapping" sparsity patterns. It would also be helpful to include an intuitive explanation of why the algorithm's performance differs significantly between these cases and under what circumstances this distinction is important.
A minor point: the authors should consider revising the phrase "... has a wide range of applications - Science, engineering, ...". It would be more informative to provide a few concrete examples of applications, accompanied by references.
In summary, the authors propose a simple convex relaxation (along with an efficient ADMM-based solution method) for the Sparse PCA problem. The paper is well-written, but the results would benefit from additional intuitive explanations or proof sketches in the main text. While the convex relaxation and the associated ADMM algorithm are appealing, the performance of the proposed method is less convincing in certain natural cases, such as the low-rank or near-low-rank settings. Furthermore, the simulation results could be made more compelling with clearer figures and more detailed explanations.
