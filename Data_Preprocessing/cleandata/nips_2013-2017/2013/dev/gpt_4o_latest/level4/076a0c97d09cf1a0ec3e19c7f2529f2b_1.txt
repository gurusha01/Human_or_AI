The paper broadens the scope of kernel dependence tests to encompass three-way interactions. This represents an intriguing and well-executed contribution to an important problem area, for which there are currently very few available tools. Overall, the paper is well-written.
A few minor suggestions:  
- Provide a more explicit explanation of the V-structure when it is first introduced.  
- Include a reference or explanation for V-statistics, as they may not be as familiar to readers (e.g., I was aware of U-statistics but not V-statistics).  
- Equation (1) is unclear in its current form. The definition of P^* needs to be more precise, and the "where" following (1) does not clarify the equation adequately.  
In the experiments section, clarify the sample size used. This is a commendable extension of kernel dependence tests to three-way interactions.
