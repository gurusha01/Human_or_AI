Thank you for your rebuttal. Based on your clarifications, I now believe I understand your algorithm and confirm that it is correct. However, I am puzzled as to why Algorithm 2 in Figure 2 is presented with CB instead of TCB. The version with CB does not function as intended, and including CB in Figure 2 is misleading. I strongly recommend revising this and presenting TCB in the depiction of your algorithm.
Additionally, I would appreciate it if you could address the necessity of knowing \( L(u1, \ldots, un) \) (or rather an upper bound on this quantity) and rewrite Theorem 1 accordingly. It is unrealistic to assume that this exact value is available. This assumption is non-trivial, as it implies prior knowledge about the quality of the graph and its relationship to \( u1, \ldots, un \).

Original Review (prior to comments on Theorem 1):
This paper explores an extension of linear bandit algorithms, specifically linear bandits with graph information. For example, in a recommendation system, access to a social network to which users belong can provide valuable insights. It is reasonable to assume that users connected in the graph may share similar interests. Each user is modeled as a linear bandit problem, with the bandits interconnected via a graph that encodes the similarity between their parameters.
The authors assume that the graph structure is known to the algorithm. At each time step \( t \), the algorithm receives a user ID and a context, and it must recommend an arm accordingly. The proposed algorithm, GOB.lin, addresses this problem by building on LinUCB. Unlike LinUCB, GOB.lin leverages graph information to exploit the similarities between users in the recommendation system. The authors provide a regret bound for the algorithm and present promising and convincing numerical experiments.
It would also be helpful if you could provide additional intuition for your algorithm. For instance, could it be interpreted as \( n \) bandits where, if arm \( it \) is selected at time \( t \), the estimate \( w{j,t} \) of arm \( j \) is updated as:  
\[
w{j,t,k} = (1 - e(it, j)) w{j,t-1,k} + e(it, j) \tilde{r}_t,
\]
where \( \tilde{r}t = M{t-1}^{-1} at \tilde{\phi}{t,k} \) represents the "classic linear bandit update" for \( w{it,t} \), and \( e(it, j) \) (ranging between 0 and \( 1/t \)) quantifies the distance between \( it \) and \( j \)? This distance could depend solely on \( it \) and \( j \) and might be easily computed using the graph (e.g., if two nodes are directly connected, \( e(it, j) = 1/t \); if no path exists, \( e(it, j) = 0 \); and for intermediate cases, \( e(it, j) \) reflects their proximity). Such an explanation would enhance clarity and simplify the presentation of your algorithm.
Additional Remarks:
- Page 2, Line 89: "....a new model distribuited..."?  
- Page 3, Line 129: "We model the similarly among users...."?  
After reviewing the rebuttal, I am now convinced that the proof is correct and that the algorithm functions as intended. However, I urge you to revise its presentation. Currently, you propose an algorithm that does not work as presented (Figure 2 with CB) and then analyze a modified version (TCB) that does work (as shown in Theorem 1). I have significantly revised my score and now recommend accepting this paper, which is both interesting and addresses a timely topic. However, I strongly suggest that the authors rewrite the paper to improve its clarity in the final version.
