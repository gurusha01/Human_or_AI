This paper presents a novel approach to measuring nonlinear correlation, which is structured into three key steps: (1) copula transformation, (2) random nonlinear projection, and (3) canonical correlation analysis (CCA). The authors provide theoretical guarantees for each step, making the proposed method robust and credible. They further validate the effectiveness of their approach through experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets.
The paper is well-written and demonstrates significant novelty. As highlighted by the authors, the RDC score is computationally efficient. The experimental results, particularly those presented in Fig. 4, effectively showcase the practical utility of the proposed method. I found the paper highly engaging and enjoyable to read. While nonlinear correlation itself has not been a primary focus in the machine learning community, I see this work as a valuable foundational tool for more complex tasks, such as regression, as suggested by one of the experiments. I strongly recommend accepting this paper for its innovative contribution and practical relevance.
