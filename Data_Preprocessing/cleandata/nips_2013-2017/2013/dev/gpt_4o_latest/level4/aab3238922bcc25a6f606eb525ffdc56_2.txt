The RDC is a non-linear dependency estimator that adheres to Renyi's criteria and leverages the recently introduced FastFood speedup technique (ICML13). The method follows a straightforward three-step process: 1) transform the data into copula space, preserving the dependency structure while disregarding the marginal distributions, 2) generate k non-linear features for each data point (drawing inspiration from Bochner's theorem), and 3) solve the standard CCA eigenvalue problem on the resulting paired datasets. In essence, RDC can be interpreted as a copula-based variation of kCCA (though this characterization might be somewhat misleading). Its effectiveness is convincingly demonstrated through experiments on a set of classical non-linear bivariate dependency scenarios and 12 real-world datasets using a forward feature selection framework.
The paper is well-written and easy to follow. While the proposed approach primarily combines existing techniques in a clever way, it nonetheless represents a meaningful contribution to the field.
Some comments:  
- I am not entirely convinced by the decision to simply "set k to 10." The parameter k appears to have a more significant impact than the paper acknowledges.  
- Line 74: Could you clarify what is meant by "same structure as HGR"?  
- Equation (5): Replace m with n.  
- Line 217: "which is independent" should be rephrased as "by independence."  
RDC is a simple yet computationally efficient estimator of the HGR coefficient, but the choice of k warrants further discussion. I have reviewed the authors' rebuttal.
