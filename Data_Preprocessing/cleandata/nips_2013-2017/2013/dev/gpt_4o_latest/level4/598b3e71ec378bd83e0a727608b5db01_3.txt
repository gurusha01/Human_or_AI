The paper addresses the challenge of minimizing simple regret in multi-armed bandit problems, specifically focusing on the sample complexity of identifying the arm with the highest payoff. The authors investigate whether parallel processing on \(k\) processors can accelerate existing algorithms. They introduce an algorithm that achieves a \(\sqrt{k}\) speedup with only a single round of communication between nodes and prove that no greater speedup is possible under this communication constraint. Additionally, they demonstrate that an optimal speedup of \(k\) can be achieved by allowing \(O(\log(1/\epsilon))\) communication rounds, where \(\epsilon\) represents the desired precision.
I thoroughly enjoyed reading this paper; it is exceptionally well-written. While I initially believed that most interesting questions surrounding best-arm selection had been resolved, the authors present a novel and practically significant framework, accompanied by elegant results on the complexity of the proposed learning problem. The results are highly original, even though their proofs do not rely on groundbreaking new techniques. Nonetheless, the technical content appears robust. Overall, I have only minor comments and questions regarding the paper.
Detailed Comments  
Line 182: The presentation of results for using Algorithm 3 to select the best arm is somewhat incomplete. You only express the results for \(\epsilon > 0\); for completeness, these should also be stated in terms of \(\Delta_*\).  
Line 194: In the last row, replace \(r\) with \(R\) to maintain consistency with Corollary 4.2.  
Line 211: Would it not be more natural to require that an algorithm identifies the best arm with probability at least \(1 - \delta\)? Kalyanakrishnan et al. (2012) and Gabillon et al. (2012) provide algorithms for the more general task of selecting the \(m\) best arms. Could you comment on how your results might extend to that setting?  
Line 263: The phrasing of Lemma 3.3 is somewhat ambiguous. Based on the proof of Lemma 3.4, it seems the statement should specify that the probability refers to a fixed player identifying the best arm with the given probability. As currently written, it could be misinterpreted to mean that all players identify the correct arm with the stated probability.  
Line 307: While I understand that optimizing the constants was not your focus, could you provide any insights into how much these factors could potentially be improved? The constants 400 and 50 seem somewhat arbitrary—could they be significantly reduced?  
Line 398: \(\Delta_*\)  
Line 467: Update "H. D. III" to "H. Daumé III" for accuracy, or better yet, use "H. Daumé III" consistently throughout.  
Summary  
This paper offers an elegant solution to a well-motivated and novel learning problem. The writing style and technical quality are excellent.
