The paper investigates the collision probability of a specific hashing scheme for points in \( \mathbb{R}^D \). The hash function selects a random vector of \( D \) i.i.d. samples from a symmetric alpha-stable distribution, and to hash a point \( x \), it computes the dot product of \( x \) with the random vector and returns the sign of the result. This scheme has been previously studied for the 2-stable distribution (commonly referred to as sim-hash). The primary result demonstrates that for \( \alpha = 1 \) on binary data, the collision probability can be approximated by a function of the chi-square similarity. However, for general data, the authors themselves acknowledge that the bound is far from the actual collision probability, making its interpretation unclear—particularly with respect to the comparison between the bound and the chi-square similarity.
The paper includes experiments suggesting that the collision probability is approximately equal to certain functions of the chi-square similarity, enabling an approximation of chi-square similarity from the collision probability and these functions. However, this approach seems to forgo the advantages of linear SVMs and efficient nearest neighbor search (as highlighted in the introduction) in favor of kernel SVMs and exhaustive search. When employing linear SVMs, the kernel implicitly defined by the LSH is used, but the paper does not adequately explain how effective this kernel is. While chi-square similarity is known to be useful, this does not necessarily imply that any function of it will also be useful.
Although I have not verified all the proofs in the appendix, the ones I reviewed appear correct, with clear and well-structured details. The problem of designing a hashing scheme that approximates the chi-square similarity is an intriguing one, but the paper falls short of making significant progress toward resolving it.

Rebuttal Comments: The streaming application is an interesting addition, but for all three applications discussed (linear SVM, nearest neighbor search, and streaming), the key issue remains whether the kernel implicitly defined by the hashing scheme is effective—a point that is still insufficiently substantiated. It would be valuable to evaluate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed hashing scheme when used directly with linear SVMs (as outlined in the introduction), perhaps on a dataset like MNIST. While the paper establishes a connection between the collision probability of the hashing scheme based on stable distributions and certain functions of the chi-square similarity, it does not demonstrate the utility of these functions for learning tasks or provide concrete algorithms for leveraging chi-square similarity.
