This paper introduces a compelling nonparametric method for testing three-variable interactions (and independence) by leveraging the embedding properties of ISPD kernels. The manuscript is generally well-written, clear, and thorough in its presentation of the underlying algebraic proofs. With the growing demand for efficient statistical tools to detect complex interaction effects in bioinformatics, this work holds significant promise for practical applications.
While the paper focuses on illustrating its utility for identifying gene interactions, it would have been valuable to include experiments on real-world (non-synthetic) datasets and/or comparisons with other genomics methods, such as those based on partial correlation. Additionally, the concluding paragraph's suggestion that the method could be extended to interactions involving more than three variables appears somewhat inconsistent with the limitations discussed in Section 4.3. Furthermore, it would be intriguing to explore how the proposed approach performs in high-dimensional settings.
Minor concern: Figure 3 is not referenced in the main text. Overall, this is a robust and innovative statistical approach with significant potential. However, it would benefit from a more comprehensive evaluation against other state-of-the-art methods for interaction testing.
