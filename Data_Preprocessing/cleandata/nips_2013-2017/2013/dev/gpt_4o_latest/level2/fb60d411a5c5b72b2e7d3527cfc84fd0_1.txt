The paper introduces a novel approach to constructing intermediate distributions for Annealed Importance Sampling (AIS) by leveraging moment averaging instead of the conventional geometric averaging. The authors propose a theoretical framework for evaluating alternative paths and demonstrate that moment averaging can outperform geometric paths in estimating partition functions, particularly for restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs). The paper also derives an asymptotically optimal piecewise linear schedule and provides a variational interpretation of the proposed method. Empirical results validate the effectiveness of moment averaging, showing improved accuracy and efficiency in partition function estimation.
Strengths
1. Novelty and Theoretical Contributions: The paper proposes a novel path for AIS based on moment averaging, which is a significant departure from the widely used geometric averaging. The theoretical analysis, including the derivation of an asymptotically optimal schedule and variational interpretations, is rigorous and well-motivated.
2. Empirical Validation: The experiments are extensive and include both synthetic scenarios (e.g., annealing between Gaussians) and practical applications (e.g., RBMs trained on MNIST). The results convincingly demonstrate the advantages of moment averaging, particularly in cases where geometric paths fail to capture high-probability regions effectively.
3. Clarity of Exposition: The paper is well-organized and clearly written, with detailed explanations of the theoretical derivations and experimental setups. The inclusion of illustrative examples, such as the Gaussian case, aids in understanding the proposed method.
4. Broader Applicability: The authors highlight the potential of moment averaging to improve other path-based sampling algorithms, such as path sampling and parallel tempering, suggesting broader implications for the field.
Weaknesses
1. Assumption of Perfect Transitions: The theoretical analysis assumes perfect Markov chain transitions, which may not hold in practice, especially for high-dimensional or multimodal distributions. While the authors acknowledge this limitation, a more detailed discussion of its practical implications would strengthen the paper.
2. Computational Overhead: Moment averaging requires estimating and matching moments, which can be computationally expensive for intractable models like RBMs. Although the authors propose a cheaper approximation (MAS cheap), the trade-offs between accuracy and computational cost are not thoroughly explored.
3. Limited Comparison with Other Methods: While the paper focuses on comparing moment and geometric paths, it does not benchmark against other advanced AIS adaptations or alternative partition function estimation techniques. This limits the broader contextualization of the proposed method.
4. Reproducibility: The paper lacks sufficient details on the implementation of moment matching and the specific settings used for PCD training, which may hinder reproducibility.
Arguments for Acceptance
- The paper addresses a significant problem in AIS by proposing a novel and theoretically sound method that improves performance in both synthetic and real-world scenarios.
- The work is well-grounded in theory and demonstrates clear empirical benefits, advancing the state of the art in partition function estimation.
- The proposed method has potential applications beyond AIS, making it relevant to a broader audience in the machine learning and statistical physics communities.
Arguments Against Acceptance
- The reliance on the assumption of perfect transitions may limit the practical applicability of the theoretical results.
- The computational cost of moment averaging, particularly for intractable models, is not fully addressed, leaving questions about its scalability.
- The lack of comparison with other advanced methods reduces the paper's ability to position itself within the broader landscape of partition function estimation techniques.
Recommendation
Overall, the paper makes a strong contribution to the field with its novel approach and thorough analysis. Despite some limitations, the strengths outweigh the weaknesses, and the work is likely to stimulate further research in path-based sampling methods. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the concerns about computational cost and reproducibility.
