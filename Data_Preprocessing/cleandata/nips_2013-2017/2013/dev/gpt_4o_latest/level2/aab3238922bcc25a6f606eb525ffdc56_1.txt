The paper introduces the Randomized Dependence Coefficient (RDC), a novel measure of nonlinear dependence between random variables of arbitrary dimensions, inspired by the Hirschfeld-Gebelein-RÃ©nyi (HGR) Maximum Correlation Coefficient. RDC is computationally efficient (O(n log n)), invariant to marginal distribution transformations, and easy to implement, requiring only five lines of R code. The authors position RDC as an alternative to existing nonlinear dependence measures, such as Kernel Canonical Correlation Analysis (KCCA), Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC), and Maximal Information Coefficient (MIC), addressing their limitations in computational cost, scalability, and ease of use.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Practicality: RDC offers a practical and scalable approach to estimating nonlinear dependence, with computational complexity significantly lower than many existing methods. Its simplicity of implementation (five lines of R code) enhances its accessibility for practitioners.
2. Theoretical Foundation: The paper builds on the well-established HGR coefficient and provides a clear theoretical justification for RDC, including its relationship to canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and kernel methods.
3. Empirical Validation: The authors conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating RDC's robustness to noise, scalability, and superior performance in feature selection tasks compared to other methods.
4. Reproducibility: The inclusion of R source code and detailed parameter settings ensures that the results are reproducible, a critical factor for scientific contributions.
5. Significance: The ability to measure nonlinear dependence in high-dimensional data efficiently is a valuable contribution, particularly for applications in feature selection and independence testing.
Weaknesses:
1. Parameter Sensitivity: While the authors provide heuristics for setting parameters (e.g., the number of random features and scaling factor), the method's performance may still depend on careful tuning, which could limit its applicability in some scenarios.
2. Limited Theoretical Guarantees: Although the paper discusses RDC's relationship to HGR and kernel methods, it does not provide strong theoretical guarantees for its consistency or optimality in finite-sample regimes.
3. Comparative Analysis: The paper omits comparisons with some popular methods (e.g., KCCA in certain experiments) due to challenges in hyperparameter selection. This weakens the comprehensiveness of the evaluation.
4. Overfitting in Specific Cases: The experiments reveal that RDC may overfit in linear association patterns and struggle with step-function relationships due to the smoothness prior induced by sinusoidal features.
Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Provide more robust guidelines or automated methods for parameter selection to improve usability.
2. Explore theoretical guarantees for RDC's performance, particularly in finite-sample scenarios.
3. Include additional comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, even if hyperparameter tuning is challenging, to strengthen the empirical evaluation.
4. Discuss potential extensions of RDC to address its limitations in specific association patterns.
Recommendation:
The paper presents a significant and practical contribution to the field of nonlinear dependence measures. While there are some limitations, the strengths outweigh the weaknesses, particularly in terms of scalability, ease of implementation, and empirical performance. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the parameter selection and theoretical guarantees.
