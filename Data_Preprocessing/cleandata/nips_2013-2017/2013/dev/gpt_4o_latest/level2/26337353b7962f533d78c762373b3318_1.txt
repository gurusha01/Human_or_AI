The paper introduces a novel framework, Sparse Heterarchical Matrix Factorization (SHMF), for multi-level sparse matrix decomposition, with a specific focus on calcium imaging data. The authors propose a bilevel SHMF model that simultaneously identifies neurons, their assemblies, and temporal activity patterns, addressing the hierarchical and heterarchical relationships between these entities. Unlike prior work, the method jointly optimizes all levels of the decomposition, rather than relying on a greedy, level-by-level approach. The authors demonstrate the efficacy of SHMF through experiments on synthetic and real-world calcium imaging data, showing improved sensitivity and robustness compared to existing methods.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Originality: The paper presents a significant advancement over existing bilinear and hierarchical decomposition methods by introducing a bilevel framework that jointly learns relationships and sparse representations. This is a clear innovation in the field of unsupervised learning for neuroscience data.
2. Technical Soundness: The optimization framework is well-motivated and rigorously described. The use of structured sparsity constraints and joint optimization is a thoughtful design choice that aligns well with the problem domain.
3. Experimental Validation: The authors provide comprehensive experiments on synthetic data with known ground truth and real-world calcium imaging data. The results demonstrate the model's ability to recover neuronal assemblies and temporal activity patterns with high sensitivity and precision.
4. Practical Significance: The method addresses a critical problem in neuroscience—interpreting calcium imaging data to unravel neural network structures. The ability to identify overlapping and highly correlated neurons, as well as their assemblies, is a valuable contribution to the field.
5. Clarity: The paper is well-organized and clearly written, with detailed explanations of the methodology, optimization process, and experimental setup.
Weaknesses:
1. Scalability: While the proposed method is effective, its computational complexity is not discussed in detail. Joint optimization over multiple levels can be computationally expensive, especially for large-scale datasets.
2. Parameter Sensitivity: The framework requires setting several hyperparameters (e.g., tradeoff parameters η, λ, and rank bounds ql). The paper does not provide sufficient guidance on how to select these parameters, which may limit reproducibility and usability.
3. Limited Comparison: Although the method is compared to several baselines, some state-of-the-art approaches in matrix factorization or neural data analysis are not included, potentially leaving gaps in the evaluation.
4. Real-World Validation: While the results on real calcium imaging data are promising, the lack of ground truth for assemblies in real-world data limits the ability to rigorously validate the model's performance.
Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Include a discussion on the computational complexity and scalability of the proposed method.
2. Provide more guidance on parameter selection and analyze the sensitivity of the model to these parameters.
3. Expand the experimental comparison to include additional state-of-the-art methods.
4. Explore potential extensions of the framework to handle larger datasets or real-time data analysis.
Recommendation:
The paper makes a strong scientific contribution by addressing a challenging problem with a novel and well-validated approach. Despite minor concerns about scalability and parameter sensitivity, the work is of high quality and has significant potential for impact in neuroscience and unsupervised learning. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the outlined weaknesses.
