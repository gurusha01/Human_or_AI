This paper investigates the olfactory system's ability to infer odors from receptor neuron activity by proposing two biologically plausible algorithms: a variational inference method and a sampling-based approach. The authors introduce a more realistic "spike and slab" prior for odor distributions, which assumes that most odors have zero concentration. Both algorithms are mapped onto neural dynamics and tested for speed and accuracy using simulations. The results demonstrate that both methods can infer odors within 100 ms, making them consistent with behavioral observations. Despite similar performance in terms of speed and accuracy, the algorithms differ in their assumptions about neural connectivity and coding strategies, making them experimentally distinguishable. These distinctions could provide valuable insights into how the brain encodes probabilities and performs inference.
Strengths
1. Novelty and Realism: The use of the "spike and slab" prior is a significant improvement over previous smooth priors, as it better reflects the sparsity of odors in natural environments. This enhances the ecological validity of the model.
2. Biological Plausibility: The authors make a commendable effort to map the algorithms onto neural dynamics, ensuring that the proposed mechanisms are consistent with known properties of the olfactory system, such as divisive normalization and reciprocal connectivity.
3. Experimental Predictions: The paper provides clear, testable predictions about neural activity that could help distinguish between the two algorithms experimentally. This is a valuable contribution to the field.
4. Thorough Evaluation: The simulations are well-designed, testing the algorithms under various conditions, including different numbers of odors and time courses. The comparison to human behavior (e.g., false positives in odor identification) adds an interesting dimension.
Weaknesses
1. Generative Model Simplifications: The model assumes linear concentration addition, binary weights, and Poisson noise, which are unlikely to fully capture the complexity of the olfactory system. While the authors acknowledge this, it limits the applicability of their findings to real-world scenarios.
2. Complex Nonlinearities: The neural implementation requires neurons to compute complex nonlinear functions (e.g., logarithms, digamma functions), which may be biologically challenging. The paper does not sufficiently address how these computations could be approximated in realistic neural circuits.
3. Learning Assumptions: The study assumes that the network has already learned the mapping from odors to receptor neurons and the prior distributions. This sidesteps the critical question of how such mappings and priors are acquired, which is a fundamental aspect of sensory processing.
4. Experimental Feasibility: While the paper suggests experimental approaches to test its predictions, it does not provide detailed guidance on how to address practical challenges, such as identifying the specific brain regions involved in olfactory inference.
Recommendation
The paper makes a strong contribution to understanding olfactory inference by proposing biologically plausible algorithms and providing testable predictions. However, its reliance on simplified models and assumptions about learning limits its impact. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the feasibility of neural implementations and to provide a clearer roadmap for future experimental validation.
Arguments for Acceptance
- The work is novel and addresses a significant problem in sensory neuroscience.
- The proposed algorithms are biologically plausible and generate experimentally testable predictions.
- The simulations are thorough and align with behavioral observations.
Arguments Against Acceptance
- Simplifications in the generative model may limit real-world applicability.
- The neural implementation requires biologically challenging computations.
- The paper does not address how the system learns the priors and mappings.
Overall, this paper is a valuable contribution to the field and has the potential to inspire further research on olfactory inference and probabilistic coding in the brain.
