This paper addresses the problem of distributed exploration in Multi-Armed Bandits (MAB) with a focus on collaboration among \(k\) players to identify an \(\epsilon\)-optimal arm. The authors propose algorithms that balance the trade-off between the number of arm pulls and inter-player communication, presenting novel results for both single-round and multi-round communication settings. The paper demonstrates that allowing \(k\) players to communicate only once can achieve a \(\sqrt{k}\)-factor parallel speedup, while an ideal \(k\)-factor speedup is achievable with communication logarithmic in \(1/\epsilon\). These results are complemented by theoretical lower bounds, showing the tightness of the proposed approaches.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Significance: The paper introduces a distributed MAB framework that is both practically relevant and theoretically challenging. The focus on collaborative exploration, as opposed to competitive settings in prior work, is a meaningful contribution to the field. The results, particularly the \(\sqrt{k}\)-speedup for single-round communication and the logarithmic communication for ideal speedup, are novel and advance the state of the art.
2. Theoretical Rigor: The paper provides strong theoretical guarantees, including upper and lower bounds, which are well-supported by detailed proofs. The results are presented in terms of the hardness measure \(H_\epsilon\), aligning with established MAB literature.
3. Practical Relevance: The algorithms are designed with distributed systems in mind, such as MapReduce, where communication costs are a bottleneck. This makes the work highly applicable to large-scale, real-world problems.
4. Clarity of Results: The paper clearly articulates the trade-offs between communication and learning performance, providing a comprehensive analysis of single-round and multi-round settings. The explicit trade-off between communication rounds and arm pulls is particularly insightful.
Weaknesses:
1. Experimental Validation: The paper lacks empirical results to validate the theoretical findings. While the theoretical contributions are strong, experiments on real-world or synthetic datasets would strengthen the paper by demonstrating practical feasibility and performance.
2. Limited Scope of Applications: The paper focuses solely on the exploration setting (e.g., \((\epsilon, \delta)\)-PAC), leaving out the regret minimization setting, which is a significant aspect of MAB problems. Extending the results to regret minimization would broaden the impact of the work.
3. Assumptions and Simplifications: Some assumptions, such as uniform random arm selection in the single-round algorithm, may not hold in practical scenarios. Additionally, the communication model assumes arbitrary message sizes, which might not align with real-world constraints in distributed systems.
4. Clarity of Presentation: While the theoretical results are rigorous, the paper is dense and could benefit from improved organization and clearer explanations, particularly in the proofs and algorithm descriptions. Some details, such as the constants in the bounds, could be better explained.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:
Pro:
- The paper addresses a timely and important problem in distributed learning.
- The theoretical contributions are novel, rigorous, and well-aligned with the MAB literature.
- The results have practical implications for large-scale systems with communication constraints.
Con:
- The lack of experimental validation limits the practical impact of the work.
- The focus on exploration-only settings narrows the scope of the contributions.
- Some assumptions and simplifications may reduce applicability in real-world scenarios.
Recommendation:
I recommend acceptance with minor revisions. The paper makes significant theoretical contributions to distributed MAB exploration, but the authors should address the lack of experimental validation and clarify some aspects of the presentation. Adding a discussion on extending the results to regret minimization would further enhance the paper's impact.
