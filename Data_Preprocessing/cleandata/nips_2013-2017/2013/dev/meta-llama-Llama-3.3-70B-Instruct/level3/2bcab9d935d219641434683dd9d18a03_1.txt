This paper presents a novel approach to estimating the entropy of neural spike trains using Bayesian methods. The authors introduce two new entropy estimators, ĤDBer and ĤDSyn, which utilize a hierarchical mixture-of-Dirichlets prior with a base measure designed to incorporate prior knowledge about spike trains. The key idea is to use the synchrony distribution, which characterizes the statistical structure of spike patterns, as a base measure for the Dirichlet distribution.
The paper is well-written and technically sound, with a clear explanation of the methodology and results. The authors provide a thorough discussion of the limitations and potential applications of their approach. The use of simulations and real neural data to evaluate the performance of the estimators is also a strength of the paper.
One of the main strengths of the paper is its ability to capture the statistical structure of spike trains, which is not accounted for by traditional entropy estimators. The authors demonstrate that their estimators outperform existing methods, such as the Nemenman-Shafee-Bialek (NSB) estimator, in simulations and real data applications.
However, there are some limitations and potential concerns with the paper. For example, the choice of prior distribution for the hyperparameters α and p may affect the performance of the estimators. The authors acknowledge this and provide some discussion of the sensitivity of the results to the choice of prior. Additionally, the computational complexity of the estimators may be a concern for large datasets.
In terms of significance, the paper addresses an important problem in neuroscience, namely the estimation of entropy from neural spike trains. The results have implications for our understanding of neural coding and information processing in the brain. The paper also contributes to the development of new statistical methods for analyzing neural data, which is an active area of research.
Overall, I would argue in favor of accepting this paper, as it presents a novel and well-motivated approach to estimating entropy from neural spike trains. The paper is well-written, technically sound, and demonstrates the potential of the proposed methodology in simulations and real data applications.
