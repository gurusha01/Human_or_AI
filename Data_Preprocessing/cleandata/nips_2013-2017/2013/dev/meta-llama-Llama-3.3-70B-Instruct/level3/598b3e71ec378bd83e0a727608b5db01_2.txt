This paper presents a novel approach to sparse principal subspace estimation, a problem that has garnered significant attention in recent years due to its importance in high-dimensional data analysis. The authors propose a convex relaxation of the sparse principal subspace estimation problem based on the convex hull of rank-d projection matrices, known as the Fantope. This relaxation leads to a semidefinite program (SDP) that can be solved efficiently using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM).
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, including its motivation and relevance to various fields. The technical contributions of the paper are significant, and the authors demonstrate a deep understanding of the underlying mathematics. The theoretical framework developed in the paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the statistical properties of the proposed estimator, including its convergence rate and support recovery guarantees.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to handle a wide range of input matrices, including sample covariance and Kendall's tau correlation matrices. The authors also provide a general theoretical framework that can be applied to other types of input matrices, making the paper a valuable contribution to the field.
The simulation results presented in the paper demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, known as Fantope Projection and Selection (FPS), in comparison to other deflation-based methods. The results show that FPS dominates in all cases, with significant improvements in mean squared error.
In terms of originality, the paper presents a novel approach to sparse principal subspace estimation, and the authors make a significant contribution to the field by providing a comprehensive theoretical framework and an efficient algorithm for solving the resulting SDP.
