This paper presents a novel approach to Bayesian inference in complex models by treating it as an instance of an abstract system of iterated random functions (IRF) with semigroup property. The authors propose a general convergence theory for IRF and apply it to the analysis of exact and approximate message-passing inference algorithms in the context of distributed sequential change point detection problems using latent variable graphical models.
The paper is well-written and provides a clear introduction to the problem and the proposed approach. The authors demonstrate a good understanding of the existing literature and provide a thorough analysis of the convergence properties of the proposed algorithms. The use of semigroup property to prove convergence is a nice technique, and the authors provide a clear explanation of how it works.
The strengths of the paper include:
* A novel and interesting approach to Bayesian inference in complex models
* A thorough analysis of the convergence properties of the proposed algorithms
* A clear and well-written presentation of the material
However, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement:
* The novelty of the approach is not entirely clear, and it would be helpful to provide more context and comparison to existing work
* The theoretical analysis is limited to a special case, and it would be interesting to see how the approach can be generalized to more complex models
* The experiments are well-conducted, but it would be helpful to provide more details on the experimental setup and the results
* Some of the results are listed as "well-known" without citations, which could be improved by providing more references to the existing literature
Overall, the paper presents a interesting and novel approach to Bayesian inference in complex models, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of the convergence properties of the proposed algorithms. However, there are some areas for improvement, particularly in terms of providing more context and comparison to existing work, and generalizing the approach to more complex models.
