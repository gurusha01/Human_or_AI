This paper presents a comprehensive study on principal component regression (PCR) and its application to high-dimensional non-Gaussian data. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the classical PCR and propose a new robust sparse PCR method under an elliptical model, which generalizes the Gaussian distribution and allows for heavy-tailed data. The paper is well-organized, and the writing is clear and concise.
The main contributions of the paper are two-fold. First, the authors provide a sharp characterization of the potential advantage of classical PCR over least square estimation in low dimensions under the Gaussian model. They show that PCR is insensitive to collinearity and can utilize the low-rank structure of the covariance matrix, while least square estimation is vulnerable to collinearity and cannot utilize the low-rank structure. Second, the authors propose a robust sparse PCR method under an elliptical model, which can estimate the regression coefficients in the optimal parametric rate.
The paper provides a thorough theoretical analysis of the proposed method, including the estimation of the leading eigenvector of the scatter matrix and the regression coefficient. The authors also provide numerical experiments on both synthetic and real-world data to demonstrate the empirical usefulness of the proposed method. The results show that the proposed method outperforms the classical PCR and Lasso methods in terms of estimation accuracy and prediction error.
The strengths of the paper include:
* A thorough analysis of the classical PCR and its advantages over least square estimation
* A novel proposal of a robust sparse PCR method under an elliptical model
* A comprehensive theoretical analysis of the proposed method
* Numerical experiments on both synthetic and real-world data to demonstrate the empirical usefulness of the proposed method
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes that the dimensionality of the data is fixed, which may not be the case in practice
* The paper does not provide a clear comparison with other existing methods, such as ridge regression and elastic net
* The paper could benefit from more detailed discussions on the choice of tuning parameters and the computational complexity of the proposed method
Overall, the paper is well-written and provides a significant contribution to the field of statistics and machine learning. The proposed method has the potential to be widely applicable in practice, especially in situations where the data is high-dimensional and non-Gaussian.
