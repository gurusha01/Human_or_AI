This paper proposes a novel perspective on Bayesian posterior updates as a system of iterated random functions with semigroup property and establishes a general convergence theory for it. The authors analyze the convergence of algorithms for change point detection problems using the proposed framework and prove the convergence of existing algorithms for classical and multiple change point problems. A fast approximate algorithm for multiple change point problems is also proposed, and its convergence is proven based on the established theory.
The paper has a significant impact, with a novel perspective and convergence theorem that could have a wide range of applications. The pros of the paper include its new perspective, general convergence theory, and fast algorithm for multiple change point problems. However, the cons of the paper include the lack of clarity between the theory and experiment, and the absence of practical applications for multiple change point detection.
The paper is technically sound, clearly written, and well-organized, with a high level of originality and significance. The authors provide a detailed proof of the main theorem and illustrate the results with simulated examples. The paper also provides a thorough analysis of the convergence of the proposed algorithm and compares it with existing algorithms.
