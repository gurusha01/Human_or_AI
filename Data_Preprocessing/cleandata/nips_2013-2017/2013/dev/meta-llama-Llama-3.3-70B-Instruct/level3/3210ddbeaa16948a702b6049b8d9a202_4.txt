This paper presents a method for approximating collision probability after alpha-stable random projections using functions of Chi-Square similarity, with a close-form approximation when alpha = 1. The authors provide bounds for the collision probability, which can be loose, and the application part appears rushed and incomplete, requiring further improvement. 
The paper's main contribution lies in its theoretical aspect, and it can be improved by focusing on theory with hints for applications. Despite its limitations, the paper is considered interesting and valuable, with potential for practical applications or motivation for new techniques. The paper's originality and new bounds are seen as a useful addition to the literature and the community, making it a notable contribution.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis. However, the application part could be more comprehensive and better executed. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of the work. 
The paper is clearly written, well-organized, and adequately informs the reader. The authors provide enough information for an expert reader to reproduce the results. The paper's originality lies in its novel combination of familiar techniques, and it is clear how this work differs from previous contributions. The related work is adequately referenced.
The results are important, and other researchers or practitioners are likely to use these ideas or build on them. The paper addresses a difficult problem in a better way than previous research and advances the state of the art in a demonstrable way. The paper provides unique theoretical results, which are also backed up by numerical experiments on both synthetic and real-world data.
