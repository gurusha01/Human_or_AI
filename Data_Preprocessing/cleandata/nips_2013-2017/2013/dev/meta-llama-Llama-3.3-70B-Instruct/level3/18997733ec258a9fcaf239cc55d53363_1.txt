This paper proposes two novel Bayesian entropy estimators, ĤDBer and ĤDSyn, for estimating the entropy of binary spike trains. The estimators use a hierarchical mixture-of-Dirichlets prior with a base measure designed to integrate prior knowledge about spike trains into the model. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of these estimators on simulated and real neural data, showing that they outperform traditional methods.
The paper is well-organized and clearly written, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments. The introduction provides a good background on the problem of entropy estimation and the limitations of existing methods. The methodology section is detailed and provides a clear explanation of the proposed estimators. The results section presents a thorough evaluation of the estimators on various datasets, demonstrating their accuracy and robustness.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to incorporate prior knowledge about the structure of spike trains into the model. The use of a synchrony distribution as a base measure allows the estimators to capture the sparsity and correlation structure of the data. The authors also provide a clear explanation of the computational efficiency of the estimators, which is important for large-scale neural data analysis.
However, there are some minor errors and areas for improvement. For example, there are grammatical mistakes on pages 2 and 3, and some of the figures could be improved for clarity. Additionally, the authors could provide more intuition on the algorithm and its interpretation, such as a possible interpretation as n bandits with updated estimates based on the distance between users.
Overall, I recommend acceptance of the paper, but with significant revisions to improve clarity and presentation. The paper is interesting and relevant to the field, and the proposed estimators have the potential to make a significant impact on neural data analysis. With some revisions to address the minor errors and areas for improvement, the paper could be even stronger.
