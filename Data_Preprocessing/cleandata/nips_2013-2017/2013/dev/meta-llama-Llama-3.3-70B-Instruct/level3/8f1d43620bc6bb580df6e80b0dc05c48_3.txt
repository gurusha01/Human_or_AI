This paper proposes a novel approach to Bayesian inference by treating it as a specific instance of an abstract system of iterated random functions (IRF) with a semigroup property. The authors develop a general convergence theory for such IRFs and apply it to the analysis of exact and approximate message-passing inference algorithms in the context of distributed sequential change point detection problems using latent variable graphical models.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of their approach, including the mathematical derivations and proofs. The use of a semigroup property to analyze the convergence of IRFs is a new and interesting contribution to the field.
The results of the paper are significant, as they provide a theoretical framework for understanding the convergence of message-passing algorithms in complex models. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through simulations on a star graph with four nodes, showing that the approximate algorithm closely tracks the exact one.
The paper has several strengths, including:
* A clear and well-motivated introduction to the problem of Bayesian inference in complex models
* A novel and interesting approach to analyzing the convergence of IRFs using a semigroup property
* A detailed and rigorous mathematical derivation of the convergence theory
* A demonstration of the effectiveness of the approach through simulations
However, there are also some weaknesses and potential areas for improvement:
* The paper assumes a significant amount of background knowledge in graphical models, message-passing algorithms, and Bayesian inference, which may make it difficult for non-experts to follow
* The simulations are limited to a small star graph, and it would be interesting to see how the approach performs on more complex models and larger graphs
* The authors could provide more discussion on the potential applications and implications of their approach, as well as its relationship to other work in the field
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication, as it makes a significant contribution to the field of Bayesian inference and provides a novel and interesting approach to analyzing the convergence of message-passing algorithms.
