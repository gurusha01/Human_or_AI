This paper proposes a novel approach to unsupervised learning, specifically designed for hierarchical data, using a sparse heterarchical matrix factorization (SHMF) technique. The authors introduce a bilevel formulation that decomposes the data into multiple levels of representation, allowing for both hierarchical and heterarchical relationships between concepts. The method is demonstrated on calcium imaging data, where it successfully identifies neurons, their assemblies, and temporal activity patterns.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear explanation of their approach, including the mathematical formulation and optimization strategy. The experiments on synthetic and real data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, particularly in identifying neuronal assemblies and detecting calcium transients.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to handle complex, hierarchical data structures, which is a common challenge in many applications. The authors' use of sparse regularization and convex optimization techniques is also well-motivated and effective.
However, there are some areas that require further clarification and improvement. For example, the authors claim that their method is more efficient than existing approaches, but a more detailed comparison with other methods, such as AdaBoost, would be helpful to support this claim. Additionally, the statistical significance of the results could be more thoroughly evaluated, as the standard errors in the results are overlapping.
Furthermore, it would be beneficial to have a clearer understanding of the contribution of each step of the proposed method, including the impact of combining 0-1 loss minimization with margin maximization. A more detailed analysis of the optimization strategy and its convergence properties would also be helpful.
In terms of originality, the paper proposes a novel approach to hierarchical data analysis, which is a significant contribution to the field. The use of sparse regularization and convex optimization techniques is also innovative, and the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on a challenging real-world problem.
Overall, this paper presents a well-motivated and effective approach to hierarchical data analysis, with a clear and well-written presentation. While there are some areas that require further clarification and improvement, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field and has the potential to be a valuable tool for researchers and practitioners.
