This paper proposes a novel approach to unsupervised learning, called sparse heterarchical matrix factorization (SHMF), which decomposes a matrix of observations into a product of multiple sparse matrices. The method is motivated by the analysis of calcium imaging data in neuroscience, where there is a natural hierarchy of concepts, such as pixels, neurons, and assemblies. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of SHMF on both synthetic and real-world data, showing that it can recover the underlying structure of the data and provide plausible interpretations.
The paper is well-written and easy to follow, making a significant contribution to the literature by combining existing concepts in a novel way. The authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of the methodology, including the optimization scheme and the use of structured sparsity constraints. The experimental results are impressive, demonstrating the ability of SHMF to detect neurons, assemblies, and their relationships in a single framework.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to handle both hierarchical and heterarchical relations between concepts, allowing for a more flexible and realistic representation of the data. The use of a block coordinate descent strategy for optimization is also a notable aspect, as it enables the joint estimation of multiple variables.
However, there are some minor errors and unclear points in the paper, such as equation (5) and line 74, which require correction or clarification. Additionally, the choice of the parameter k, set to 10, requires more discussion, as it plays a crucial role in the RDC estimator.
In terms of originality, the paper presents a novel combination of existing techniques, such as dictionary learning and sparse coding, to address a specific problem in neuroscience. The authors also provide a thorough review of related work, highlighting the differences and advantages of their approach.
The significance of the paper lies in its potential to advance the state of the art in unsupervised learning and neuroscience. The proposed method can be applied to a wide range of problems, including image and signal processing, and can provide new insights into the analysis of complex data.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, as it presents a significant contribution to the field, with a clear and well-written presentation, impressive experimental results, and a thorough review of related work. However, the authors should address the minor errors and unclear points, and provide more discussion on the choice of parameters.
