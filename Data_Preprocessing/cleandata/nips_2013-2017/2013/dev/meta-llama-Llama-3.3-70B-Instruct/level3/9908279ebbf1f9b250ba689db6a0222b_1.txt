This paper proposes a new method for robust principal component regression (PCR) for non-Gaussian data, which outperforms classical linear regression by exploiting low rank structure and being insensitive to collinearity. The authors assume elliptically distributed random vectors and noise, and demonstrate better performance than traditional PCR on various elliptical distributions and similar performance on Gaussian distributions.
The paper is well-organized, with clear explanations of related work, significant contributions, and mathematical concepts. The authors validate their method through simulations and real-world finance data, showing that it outperforms standard PCR and lasso regression techniques. The results are supported by theoretical analysis, which provides a rate of convergence for the proposed estimator.
The strengths of the paper include its ability to handle high-dimensional non-Gaussian data, its robustness to outliers and heavy-tailed distributions, and its improved performance over traditional PCR and lasso regression. The authors also provide a thorough analysis of the theoretical properties of their method, including its consistency and convergence rate.
However, there are some areas for improvement. The authors could clarify the implementation of lasso regression, including details on feature selection and sparsity pattern determination. Additionally, the authors' results could be strengthened by demonstrating improved performance in multiple sectors, rather than just a subset of stock data, to increase the robustness of their findings.
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of robust PCR and has the potential to be a valuable tool for analyzing high-dimensional non-Gaussian data. The authors' use of elliptical distributions and multivariate Kendall's tau provides a robust and efficient way to estimate the regression coefficients, and their theoretical analysis provides a solid foundation for the method.
