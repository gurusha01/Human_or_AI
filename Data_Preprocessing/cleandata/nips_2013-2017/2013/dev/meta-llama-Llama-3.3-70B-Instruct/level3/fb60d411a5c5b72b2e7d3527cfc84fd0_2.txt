This paper proposes a new approach to principal component regression (PCR) using moment averaging (MA) paths, providing theoretical and empirical evidence for its advantages over traditional geometric averaging (GA) paths. The authors give a rigorous analysis of the proposed MA path, with sound theoretical claims and thorough proofs. The empirical results show promise, but could be strengthened by exploring alternative annealing schedules and comparing their performance on larger models.
The paper is well-written and well-structured, making it easy to follow. However, some calculations in the supplementary material could be made more explicit. The paper represents a highly original contribution to the field of PCR, with the potential to inspire further work and improve techniques for inference, learning, and model comparison.
The proposed MA approach has the potential to improve PCR, but its adoption may be hindered by added complexity and the competitiveness of GA on some models. The impact of this work may be more significant in inspiring future research rather than immediate practical applications.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel approach to PCR with theoretical and empirical evidence for its advantages.
* The analysis is rigorous and well-structured, making it easy to follow.
* The paper has the potential to inspire further work and improve techniques for inference, learning, and model comparison.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The empirical results could be strengthened by exploring alternative annealing schedules and comparing their performance on larger models.
* The added complexity of the MA approach may hinder its adoption in practice.
* The competitiveness of GA on some models may limit the impact of this work in immediate practical applications.
Overall, I recommend accepting this paper as it represents a significant contribution to the field of PCR, with the potential to inspire further work and improve techniques for inference, learning, and model comparison. However, the authors should consider addressing the limitations of their empirical results and the added complexity of their approach in future work.
