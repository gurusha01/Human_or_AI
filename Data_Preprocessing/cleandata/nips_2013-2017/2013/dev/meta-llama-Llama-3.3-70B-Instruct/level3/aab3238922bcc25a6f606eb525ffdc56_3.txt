This paper proposes a novel approach to unsupervised learning, called sparse heterarchical matrix factorization (SHMF), which decomposes a matrix of observations into a product of more than two sparse matrices. The authors motivate their work with a concrete problem in neuroscience, where they aim to extract meaningful structures from calcium imaging data. The proposed method allows for both hierarchical and heterarchical relations between concepts at different levels and learns these relations jointly with the sparse factorization.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear explanation of their approach, including a useful schematic diagram. The empirical results on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in detecting neurons, assemblies, and their temporal activities. The authors also provide a thorough comparison with other methods, including CellSorting, Adina, MNNMF+Adina, and KSVDS+Adina.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to handle complex data with overlapping and correlated structures. The proposed method is able to detect and differentiate between these structures, making it a valuable tool for analyzing calcium imaging data. The authors also provide a detailed discussion of the optimization procedure, which is a non-convex problem, and propose a block coordinate descent strategy to solve it.
However, there are some limitations and concerns with the paper. The use of Random Fourier Features (RFFs) may be limited, and alternative schemes such as Nystrom features could be explored for generating random features. Additionally, the theoretical treatment presented has some concerns, including the discussion of the bound in (10) and the potential for the RFF approximation to act as a regulariser. The reference to Recht is incorrectly referred to as "Brecht" in the text, and the authors should clarify the constraints in the CCA optimisation problem.
Overall, the paper presents an interesting and novel approach to unsupervised learning, with promising empirical results. However, the theoretical analysis is incomplete, which somewhat detracts from the impact and importance of the work. With some revisions to address the concerns mentioned above, this paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of unsupervised learning.
