This paper presents a novel approach to Bayesian inference by treating it as a specific instance of an abstract system of iterated random functions (IRF) with semigroup property. The authors develop a general convergence theory for IRF and apply it to the analysis of exact and approximate message-passing inference algorithms in the context of distributed sequential change point detection problems using latent variable graphical models.
The paper's primary theoretical results are strong contributions and technically sound, with simulated and experimental results adding to the paper's strength. The authors provide a clear and well-organized presentation of their work, making it easy to follow and understand. The application to real-world data is a strong point, and the choice of dataset and analysis may impact the results, but further analysis is needed to confirm the strength of the method.
One potential limitation of the paper is the assumption of a principal component model, which may not characterize all scenarios where the proposed method outperforms linear regression. However, the authors acknowledge this limitation and provide a clear discussion of the implications.
The originality of the paper lies in its two main theoretical contributions and the development of a novel algorithm, despite building on recent results. The two main theorems are significant contributions to the field, with Theorem 2.2 being the first explicit characterization of observations in the proposed framework. The new method shows promise for use by others, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the implications and potential applications.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of their work. The paper is well-written and well-organized, making it easy to follow and understand.
The clarity of the paper is excellent, with clear explanations of the main concepts and results. The authors provide sufficient information for the expert reader to reproduce the results, and the presentation is well-organized and easy to follow.
