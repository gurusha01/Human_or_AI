This paper proposes a novel approach to unsupervised learning, called sparse heterarchical matrix factorization (SHMF), which decomposes a matrix of observations into a product of multiple sparse matrices. The method is motivated by the problem of analyzing calcium imaging data in neuroscience, where there is a natural hierarchy of concepts, such as pixels, neurons, and assemblies. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on both synthetic and real-world data, showing that it can recover the underlying structure of the data and provide plausible interpretations.
The paper has several strengths. Firstly, the idea of using a multi-level decomposition to capture the hierarchical structure of the data is simple yet powerful. The authors provide a clear and well-organized presentation of their method, including a detailed description of the optimization algorithm used to learn the model. The experimental results are also impressive, demonstrating the ability of the method to detect neurons, assemblies, and their relationships in a single framework.
However, there are also some weaknesses and potential concerns. One issue is the novelty of the approach, which may not be entirely new. The authors acknowledge the relation to previous work on hierarchical topic models and multilinear decompositions, and it is not entirely clear how their approach differs from these existing methods. Additionally, the optimization problem is non-convex, which may lead to local minima and affect the stability of the results.
Another concern is the practice of splitting a work into minimal publishable units, which may not be in the best interest of the community. The authors mention that their work is related to papers 539 and 956, which describe multiclass and semi-supervised variants of the same idea. It would be more beneficial to have a single, comprehensive paper that presents all the variants and results, rather than splitting them into separate papers.
In terms of the criteria for evaluation, the paper scores well on clarity and significance. The writing is clear and easy to follow, and the results are significant and relevant to the field of neuroscience. However, the originality of the approach is questionable, and the paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison to existing methods. The quality of the paper is good, with a well-organized presentation and a clear description of the method and results.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, but with some revisions to address the concerns mentioned above. The authors should provide a more detailed comparison to existing methods, and consider merging their work with related papers to provide a more comprehensive presentation of their results.
