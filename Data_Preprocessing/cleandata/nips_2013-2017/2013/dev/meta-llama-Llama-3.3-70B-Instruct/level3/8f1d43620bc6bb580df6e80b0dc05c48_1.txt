This paper proposes a general formalism for iterated random functions with a semigroup property, which encompasses exact and approximate Bayesian posterior updates as specific instances. The authors develop a convergence theory for these iterated random functions and apply it to analyze the convergence of exact and approximate message-passing algorithms in a sequential change point detection problem formulated via a latent variable directed graphical model.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of their methodology and results. The use of a semigroup property to analyze the convergence of iterated random functions is a novel and interesting approach. The application of this theory to message-passing algorithms in change point detection problems is also a significant contribution.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The development of a general convergence theory for iterated random functions with a semigroup property, which can be applied to various Bayesian inference problems.
* The application of this theory to analyze the convergence of exact and approximate message-passing algorithms in change point detection problems.
* The provision of simulation results to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approximation algorithm.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes that the sequence of random elements {θn} is i.i.d., which may not be the case in practice.
* The sub-Gaussianity assumption on the sequence {log θ∗n} may not be satisfied in all scenarios.
* The paper could benefit from more discussion on the implications of the results and the potential applications of the proposed methodology.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper presents a novel and interesting approach to analyzing the convergence of iterated random functions.
* The application of this theory to message-passing algorithms in change point detection problems is a significant contribution.
* The paper provides a clear and detailed explanation of the methodology and results.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The paper makes some strong assumptions about the sequence of random elements {θn} and the sub-Gaussianity of {log θ∗n}.
* The paper could benefit from more discussion on the implications of the results and the potential applications of the proposed methodology.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, as it presents a novel and interesting approach to analyzing the convergence of iterated random functions and makes a significant contribution to the field of Bayesian inference. However, the authors should be encouraged to address the weaknesses of the paper and provide more discussion on the implications of the results and the potential applications of the proposed methodology.
