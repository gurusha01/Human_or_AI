This paper explores the advantages of principal component regression (PCR) over classical linear regression, particularly in low-dimensional settings under the Gaussian model. The authors also propose a robust sparse principal component regression method for high-dimensional non-Gaussian data, which can handle heavy-tailed and tail-dependent distributions. The method uses the multivariate Kendall's tau as a robust estimator of the covariance matrix.
The paper is well-written, with clear explanations and helpful examples. The authors provide a thorough discussion of the advantages of PCR, including its insensitivity to collinearity and its ability to utilize the low-rank structure of the covariance matrix. The proposed robust sparse PCR method is also well-motivated, and the authors provide a detailed analysis of its theoretical properties.
The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, particularly in non-Gaussian settings. The authors show that the robust sparse PCR method outperforms the classical sparse PCR method in terms of estimation accuracy, and that it is a safe alternative to the classical method even when the data are normally distributed.
However, there are some concerns about the sensitivity of the AIS outcomes to the accuracy of moment matching and the computational cost of the new method compared to geometric averaging. The authors do not provide a detailed comparison of the computational costs of the two methods, which would be helpful in evaluating the practicality of the proposed method.
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of principal component regression, particularly in non-Gaussian settings. The proposed robust sparse PCR method has the potential to handle high-dimensional complex data and provides a useful alternative to existing methods.
