This paper proposes a novel framework for analyzing the convergence of online learning algorithms with predictable loss sequences, including applications to various problems such as change point detection. The approach is based on a general formalism of iterated random functions with semigroup property, which allows for the analysis of both exact and approximate Bayesian posterior updates.
The paper is well-written and provides a clear exposition of the main ideas and results. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach by applying it to a multiple change point problem via latent variable graphical models. The simulation results show that the proposed approximate message-passing algorithm can closely track the exact posterior probabilities.
The main strengths of the paper are:
* The novel framework for analyzing online learning algorithms with predictable loss sequences
* The application of the framework to various problems, including change point detection
* The clear and well-organized exposition of the main ideas and results
* The simulation results demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm
However, there are some minor criticisms and suggestions for improvement:
* The proof presentations could be improved for better clarity and readability
* Some implicit assumptions and unclear inequalities in the derivations could be explicitly stated and clarified
* The authors could provide more references to related work and discuss the connections to existing literature
* The simulation results could be more comprehensive and include comparisons with other existing algorithms
Overall, the paper is solid and provides interesting results. The authors have addressed the reviewer's concerns with learning rates and Section 5 in their response, and the paper is considered suitable for publication after the rebuttal period.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel framework for analyzing online learning algorithms with predictable loss sequences
