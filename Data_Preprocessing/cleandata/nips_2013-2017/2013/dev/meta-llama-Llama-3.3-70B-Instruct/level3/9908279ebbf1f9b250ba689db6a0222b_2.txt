This paper proposes a novel approach to Bayesian inference by treating it as a specific instance of an abstract system of iterated random functions (IRF) with a semigroup property. The authors develop a general convergence theory for such IRFs and apply it to the analysis of exact and approximate message-passing inference algorithms in the context of distributed sequential change point detection problems using latent variable graphical models.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of their approach, including the necessary mathematical background and proofs. The proposed algorithm is simple and efficient, with a computational complexity of O(d) at each time step, making it suitable for large-scale applications.
The strengths of the paper include:
* A novel and innovative approach to Bayesian inference, which provides a new perspective on the problem and has the potential to lead to new insights and applications.
* A thorough and detailed analysis of the convergence properties of the proposed algorithm, including a proof of geometric convergence under certain conditions.
* A clear and well-organized presentation, with a good balance between mathematical rigor and intuitive explanations.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes a certain level of familiarity with graphical models and message-passing algorithms, which may make it difficult for readers without a strong background in these areas to follow.
* The analysis of the convergence properties of the algorithm is based on certain assumptions about the distribution of the data, which may not always be satisfied in practice.
* The paper could benefit from more numerical experiments and comparisons with other algorithms to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in practice.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication, as it presents a novel and innovative approach to Bayesian inference, with a thorough and detailed analysis of its convergence properties. However, I would suggest that the authors consider adding more numerical experiments and comparisons with other algorithms to demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach in practice.
