This paper proposes a novel convex relaxation for the Sparse PCA problem, which is a popular technique for unsupervised dimension reduction. The authors develop an ADMM-based method for efficient solution and provide theoretical results for Kendall's tau matrix input. The paper is well-written, with clear explanations of concepts, and the results appear to be correct. The convex formulation is one of the paper's strengths, as it allows for efficient computation and provides a tight relaxation for simultaneous rank and orthogonality constraints on the positive semidefinite cone.
The statistical analysis is weak, particularly in near low rank and low rank cases, with potentially loose bounds and a need for tighter bounds through additional technical work. The authors should provide proof sketches in the main text, rather than relying on the appendix, to help readers understand the results without needing to read supplementary material.
The simulation results section is weak, with difficult-to-read figures and a need for clearer explanations of "overlapping" and "non-overlapping" sparsity patterns and their impact on performance. The paper could benefit from more specific examples and references to applications of the proposed method, rather than general statements about its wide range of applications.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of the work. The paper is clearly written, well-organized, and adequately informs the reader.
The originality of the paper lies in its novel combination of familiar techniques, including the use of the Fantope constraint and ADMM algorithm. The paper provides a unique theoretical framework for analyzing the statistical properties of the method for arbitrary input matrices, which extends the applicability and provable guarantees to a wide array of settings.
The significance of the paper is high, as it addresses a difficult problem in a better way than previous research. The paper provides a unique data, unique conclusions on existing data, or a unique theoretical or pragmatic approach. The results are important, and other people (practitioners or researchers) are likely to use these ideas or build on them.
