This paper introduces a novel approach to nonlinear correlation, consisting of three steps: copula transform, random nonlinear projection, and CCA, with theoretical guarantees for each step. The authors demonstrate the approach's usefulness using synthetic and real data sets, with experiments showcasing its utility. The paper is well-written, easy to follow, and has high novelty, making it an enjoyable read. 
The approach has potential applications in more realistic tasks, such as regression, and is a valuable building block for future research. The strengths of the paper include its novelty, interesting approach to nonlinear correlation, and the fact that it is well-written and easy to follow. The weaknesses of the paper are minimal, but one potential area for improvement could be the addition of more experimental results to further demonstrate the approach's effectiveness.
The paper meets all the criteria for a good scientific contribution, including quality, clarity, originality, and significance. The claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results, and the authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of the work. The paper is clearly written, well-organized, and provides enough information for the expert reader to reproduce its results.
