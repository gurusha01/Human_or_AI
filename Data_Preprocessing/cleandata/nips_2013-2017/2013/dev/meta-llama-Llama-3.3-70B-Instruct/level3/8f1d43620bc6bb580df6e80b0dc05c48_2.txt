This paper proposes a novel approach to Bayesian inference by treating it as an instance of an abstract system of iterated random functions (IRF) with a semigroup property. The authors develop a general convergence theory for such IRFs and apply it to the analysis of exact and approximate message-passing algorithms for sequential change point detection problems. The paper is well-written, and the ideas are clearly presented.
The main strength of the paper is its ability to provide a unified framework for understanding various Bayesian inference algorithms, including exact and approximate message-passing algorithms. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach by applying it to a multiple change point problem via latent variable graphical models. The simulation results show that the approximate algorithm tracks the exact posterior probabilities well, even in cases where the exact algorithm is computationally infeasible.
However, there are some potential issues with the paper. Firstly, the experiment on the network's ability to not forget has flaws, as the new nonlinearity may not need to train as much to reach the likelihood, which could be the reason it doesn't forget as much. This could be addressed by providing additional experiments, such as training on a subset of digits and then adding the remaining digits, to test the network's ability to avoid getting stuck in a local minimum.
Additionally, the paper lacks comparison with other results, such as those on permutation invariant MNIST, and does not consider dropout in the input as a data augmentation. This makes it difficult to evaluate the significance of the results and to understand how they relate to other work in the field.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of their work. The paper is clearly written, well-organized, and provides enough information for an expert reader to reproduce the results.
The originality of the paper is high, as it proposes a novel approach to Bayesian inference and develops a new convergence theory for IRFs. The paper also provides a unique perspective on the relationship between Bayesian inference and iterated random functions. The significance of the paper is also high, as it has the potential to impact the field of Bayesian inference and machine learning.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, but with some revisions to address the potential issues mentioned above. The paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field, and with some additional experiments and comparisons, it could be even stronger.
