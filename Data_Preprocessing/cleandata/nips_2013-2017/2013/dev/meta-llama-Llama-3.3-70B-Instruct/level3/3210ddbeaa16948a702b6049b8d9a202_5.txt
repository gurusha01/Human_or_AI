This paper proposes a novel approach to principal component regression, which is an interesting and innovative finding. The authors establish a low error bound on the approximation in the binary case, which is a strong result. Additionally, the paper proposes a new result that one can approximate cos^{-1}(chi^2) by inner product, which has potential applications in high-dimensional sparse approximations of the chi-square kernel. 
However, the paper's writing is extremely poor, making it unclear what the goal of the paper is, and the logic seems reversed and free-flowing. The approximation of chi^2 is less satisfying, as it requires applying the cosine function to transform the sign(x)*sign(y) term, losing computational savings in large-scale learning.
The paper's finding has potential applications in high-dimensional sparse approximations of the chi-square kernel, which could be useful in text and image applications. To further improve the paper, the authors should compare their proposed approach with other existing methods, such as the linear approximation to the chi2 kernel with geometric convergence rate proposed in a recent arXiv paper.
The authors' rebuttal mentions the potential application of the proposed approach to streaming data, which is an interesting point. However, the main concerns remain the lack of theoretical and practical insights into the acos(chi2) kernel and the poor writing and organization of the paper.
Overall, the paper has some interesting and innovative findings, but it requires significant improvement in terms of writing, organization, and comparison with existing methods.
