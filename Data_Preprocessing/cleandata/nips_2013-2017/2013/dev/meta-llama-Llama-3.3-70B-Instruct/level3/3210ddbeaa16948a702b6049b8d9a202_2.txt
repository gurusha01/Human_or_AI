This paper proposes a novel approach to principal component regression, which is a widely used technique in statistics. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the classical principal component regression and its advantages over the classical linear regression, particularly in handling collinearity and utilizing the low-rank structure of the covariance matrix. They also propose a robust sparse principal component regression method under an elliptical model, which is a semiparametric generalization of the Gaussian distribution. The method is shown to be effective in estimating the regression coefficients in high-dimensional settings.
The paper is well-structured and easy to follow, with clear explanations of the proposed methods and theoretical results. The authors provide extensive empirical evaluations on both synthetic and real-world data, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method. The use of multivariate Kendall's tau as a robust estimator of the covariance matrix is a notable contribution.
However, there are some areas that need improvement. The paper could benefit from more careful editing to improve the flow and clarity of the writing. Some of the sentences are long and convoluted, making it difficult to follow. Additionally, the presentation of the experimental results could be improved, with clearer figures and more detailed descriptions of the results.
The paper also lacks rigorous similarity estimation, with no concrete upper bound-type relations between pairwise metrics in the original and Hamming spaces. This is an important aspect of hashing schemes, and the authors should provide more theoretical analysis to support their claims.
Furthermore, the paper does not explicitly address the time efficiency of the proposed method, particularly when the random projection matrix is Cauchy. The authors should provide more discussion on the computational complexity of the method and its scalability to large datasets.
Overall, the paper proposes an interesting and novel approach to principal component regression, with extensive empirical evaluations and theoretical analysis. However, there are some areas that need improvement, particularly in terms of writing clarity, experimental presentation, and theoretical rigor.
