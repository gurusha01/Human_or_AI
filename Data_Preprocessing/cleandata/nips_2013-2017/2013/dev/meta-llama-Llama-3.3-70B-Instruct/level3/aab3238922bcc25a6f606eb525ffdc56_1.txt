This paper introduces a novel method called Sparse Heterarchical Matrix Factorization (SHMF) for unsupervised analysis of data with a natural hierarchy of concepts. The authors propose a multi-level decomposition of the data matrix into a product of sparse matrices, allowing for both hierarchical and heterarchical relations between concepts at different levels. The method is demonstrated on calcium imaging data, where it successfully identifies neurons, their assemblies, and temporal activity patterns.
The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with clear explanations of the methodology and experimental results. The authors provide a thorough discussion of related work and demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through experiments on synthetic and real-world data. The results show that SHMF outperforms existing methods in identifying neuronal assemblies and detecting calcium transients.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to handle complex data with overlapping and correlated structures, which is a common challenge in neuroscience applications. The authors' use of sparse coding and dictionary learning techniques allows for efficient and accurate identification of neurons and their assemblies.
However, the originality of the paper is somewhat limited, as it builds upon existing techniques such as sparse coding and non-negative matrix factorization. While the authors do introduce a new framework for multi-level decomposition, the individual components of the method are not particularly novel.
Additionally, the comparison between SHMF and other methods could be more comprehensive. For example, the authors could provide a more detailed analysis of the computational efficiency and scalability of their method, particularly in comparison to other approaches such as KSVDS+Adina.
Another potential concern is the role of the dimensionality parameter in the SHMF framework. The authors mention that the ranks of the estimated matrices can be lower than their nominal dimensionality, but it is unclear how this affects the performance of the method. Further investigation into the regularization effect of the dimensionality parameter and its impact on the final results would be beneficial.
Overall, the paper presents a useful contribution to the field of unsupervised data analysis, particularly in the context of neuroscience applications. While there are some limitations to the originality and comprehensiveness of the work, the authors demonstrate a clear understanding of the challenges and opportunities in this area, and their method shows promise for future research and applications.
