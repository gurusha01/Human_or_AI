This paper proposes a novel convex relaxation of sparse principal subspace estimation based on the convex hull of rank-d projection matrices (the Fantope). The authors introduce a semidefinite program that generalizes the DSPCA approach to d â‰¥ 1 dimensions and provide a general theoretical framework for analyzing the statistical properties of the method for arbitrary input matrices. The paper makes a significant contribution to the field of sparse PCA by providing a computationally tractable and statistically efficient method for estimating sparse principal subspaces.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem of sparse PCA and its limitations. The proposed method is elegantly formulated, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of its statistical properties. The use of the Fantope constraint and the ADMM algorithm is well-motivated, and the authors provide a detailed description of the algorithm and its implementation.
The paper has several strengths, including:
* The proposed method is computationally efficient and scalable, making it suitable for large-scale applications.
* The authors provide a general theoretical framework for analyzing the statistical properties of the method, which can be applied to a wide range of input matrices.
* The method is shown to be statistically efficient, with a near-optimal rate of convergence in subspace estimation.
* The authors provide a detailed analysis of the method's performance in simulations, demonstrating its superiority over existing deflation-based methods.
However, the paper also has some weaknesses, including:
* The notation used in the paper, such as \vee, should be clearly defined to avoid confusion.
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of synthetic experiments, including optimal sparse decomposition and comparison with other methods like DSPCA.
* Minor errors in writing and figure notation should be corrected.
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of sparse PCA and provides a novel and efficient method for estimating sparse principal subspaces. The authors' use of the Fantope constraint and the ADMM algorithm is well-motivated, and the paper provides a thorough analysis of the method's statistical properties.
