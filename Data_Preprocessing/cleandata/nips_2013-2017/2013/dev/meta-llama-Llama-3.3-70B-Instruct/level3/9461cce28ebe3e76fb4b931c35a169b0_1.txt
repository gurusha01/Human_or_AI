This paper proposes a novel approach to unsupervised learning, called sparse heterarchical matrix factorization (SHMF), which decomposes a matrix of observations into a product of multiple sparse matrices. The method is motivated by the analysis of calcium imaging data in neuroscience, where there is a natural hierarchy of concepts, such as pixels, neurons, and assemblies. The authors introduce a bilevel SHMF approach, which allows for both hierarchical and heterarchical relations between concepts at different levels, and can learn these relations jointly with the sparse factorization.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of their approach, including the mathematical formulation and optimization strategy. The experimental results are strong, with a thorough evaluation on synthetic and real-world data, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method in detecting neurons, assemblies, and their temporal activities.
The strengths of the paper include:
* A novel and well-motivated approach to unsupervised learning, which addresses a specific problem in neuroscience
* A clear and detailed explanation of the mathematical formulation and optimization strategy
* Strong experimental results, with a thorough evaluation on synthetic and real-world data
* A good comparison with existing methods, demonstrating the advantages of the proposed approach
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The optimization strategy, while effective, may not be the most efficient or scalable approach, particularly for large datasets
* The choice of hyperparameters, such as the tradeoff parameters η and λ, may require careful tuning and may not be straightforward to determine
* The method may not be easily applicable to other domains, where the hierarchy of concepts is not as well-defined as in neuroscience
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of unsupervised learning, with a novel and effective approach to addressing a specific problem in neuroscience. The strengths of the paper outweigh its weaknesses, and it is a good candidate for acceptance.
