This paper proposes a general formalism of iterated random functions with semigroup property, which can be used to analyze the convergence of Bayesian posterior updates in complex models. The authors apply this formalism to the problem of sequential change point detection in latent variable graphical models, and provide a convergence theory for the iterated random functions. The paper also presents an approximate message-passing algorithm for computing the posterior probabilities of change points in a distributed setting.
The paper has several strengths. Firstly, it provides a novel and general framework for analyzing the convergence of Bayesian posterior updates, which can be applied to a wide range of problems. Secondly, the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach by applying it to a specific problem of sequential change point detection, and provide a detailed analysis of the convergence of the algorithm. Thirdly, the paper presents an approximate message-passing algorithm that can be used in practice, and provides a theoretical analysis of its convergence.
However, the paper also has some weaknesses. Firstly, the notation and terminology used in the paper can be confusing, and some of the equations and proofs are difficult to follow. Secondly, the paper assumes that the reader is familiar with a range of technical concepts, including sub-Gaussian random variables, Orlicz norms, and graphical models, which may make it difficult for non-experts to understand. Thirdly, the paper could benefit from more numerical experiments and simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in practice.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria of quality, clarity, originality, and significance. The paper presents a novel and well-motivated approach to analyzing the convergence of Bayesian posterior updates, and provides a detailed and rigorous analysis of the algorithm.
