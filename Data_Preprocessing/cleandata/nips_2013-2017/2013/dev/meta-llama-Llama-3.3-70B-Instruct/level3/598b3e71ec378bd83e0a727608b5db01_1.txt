This paper proposes a novel convex relaxation of sparse principal subspace estimation based on the convex hull of rank-d projection matrices (the Fantope). The authors establish a near-optimal convergence rate for estimation of the principal subspace of a general covariance matrix without assuming the spiked covariance model. The paper also provides a general theoretical framework for analyzing the statistical properties of the method for arbitrary input matrices, including sample covariance and Kendall's tau correlation matrices.
The strengths of the paper include its clear writing style, the non-trivial and reasonable problem formulation, and the simple yet clever proposed solutions. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the statistical properties of the estimator, including a near-optimal convergence rate and support recovery guarantees. The paper also includes a detailed description of an efficient ADMM algorithm for solving the proposed semidefinite program.
However, there are some minor issues with the paper. For example, the proof of Lemmas 3.3 and 3.4 contains some minor errors, including a multiplicator and a division issue. Additionally, the definition of "speed-up" and the claim that the majority vote method achieves no speed-up could be clarified.
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of sparse principal subspace estimation and provides a useful framework for analyzing the statistical properties of the estimator. The results are important and have the potential to be used by practitioners and researchers in the field.
