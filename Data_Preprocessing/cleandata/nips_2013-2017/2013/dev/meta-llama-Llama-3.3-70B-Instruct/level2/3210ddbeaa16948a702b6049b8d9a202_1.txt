This paper proposes a method for efficient approximation of the lα distance (0 < α ≤ 2) in high-dimensional data using stable random projections. The authors suggest storing only the signs of the projected data, which leads to significant savings in storage space and enables efficient linear algorithms for search and learning applications. The paper focuses on the probability of collision, i.e., when the two signs differ, and derives a theoretical bound for this probability. The bound is exact when α = 2 and is fairly sharp for α close to 2.
The authors also investigate the case when α = 1, which is important in practice, especially when features are generated from histograms. They show that the collision probability can be accurately approximated using the χ2 similarity, which is a popular measure in computer vision and natural language processing. The paper provides experimental results on real and simulated data, demonstrating the accuracy of the proposed approximations.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel method for efficient approximation of the lα distance using stable random projections and sign hashing.
* The derivation of a theoretical bound for the collision probability, which is exact when α = 2 and fairly sharp for α close to 2.
* The investigation of the case when α = 1 and the proposal of accurate approximations using the χ2 similarity.
* The provision of experimental results on real and simulated data, demonstrating the accuracy of the proposed approximations.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes that the data are nonnegative, which may not always be the case in practice.
* The bound for the collision probability is not tight for α ≤ 1, and a better approximation is needed for these cases.
* The paper does not provide a comprehensive comparison with existing methods for approximating the lα distance.
Overall, the paper presents a novel and efficient method for approximating the lα distance using stable random projections and sign hashing. The proposed approximations are accurate and have the potential to be widely adopted in practice. However, further research is needed to address the limitations of the paper and to provide a more comprehensive comparison with existing methods.
