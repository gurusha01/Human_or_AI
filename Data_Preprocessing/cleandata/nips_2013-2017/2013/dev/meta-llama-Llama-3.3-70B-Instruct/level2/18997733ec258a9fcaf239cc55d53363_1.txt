This paper introduces a novel algorithmic approach to solving networked bandit problems, which are formalized as multi-armed bandit problems with a strong social component. The authors propose a global recommendation strategy, called GOB.Lin, which allocates a bandit algorithm to each network node and allows it to share signals with neighboring nodes. The algorithm is designed to leverage user similarities represented as a graph, and its performance is evaluated on synthetic and real-world datasets.
The main claims of the paper are that GOB.Lin outperforms state-of-the-art methods for contextual bandits that do not use relational information, and that its variants, GOB.Lin.MACRO and GOB.Lin.BLOCK, can achieve significant computational savings while maintaining good performance. The paper provides a theoretical analysis of GOB.Lin, including a regret bound, and presents experimental results on two real-world datasets, Last.fm and Delicious.
The support for the claims is strong, with a clear and detailed description of the algorithm and its variants, as well as a thorough experimental evaluation. The paper also provides a good discussion of the limitations of the approach and potential avenues for future work.
The usefulness of the ideas presented in the paper is high, as they have the potential to improve the performance of recommender systems in social networks. The paper reflects common knowledge in the field, with correct use of terms and evidence of understanding of relevant literature.
The novelty of the work is significant, as it presents a new approach to solving networked bandit problems. The references are comprehensive, accessible, and relevant, with proper citations.
The completeness of the paper is good, with sufficient details provided for reproducibility. The limitations of the approach are acknowledged, and potential solutions are discussed.
The strengths of the paper include its clear and detailed description of the algorithm and its variants, its thorough experimental evaluation, and its good discussion of the limitations of the approach. The weaknesses of the paper include the potential scalability issues of the GOB.Lin algorithm and the need for further evaluation on larger datasets.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, as it presents a significant contribution to the field of recommender systems and networked bandit problems. The paper is well-written, and the ideas presented are novel and useful.
