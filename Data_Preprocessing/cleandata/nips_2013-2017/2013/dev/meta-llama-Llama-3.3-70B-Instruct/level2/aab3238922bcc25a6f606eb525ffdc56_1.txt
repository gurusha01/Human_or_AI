This paper introduces the Randomized Dependence Coefficient (RDC), a novel measure of nonlinear dependence between random variables of arbitrary dimension. The authors claim that RDC is a scalable, easy-to-implement, and computationally efficient estimator of the Hirschfeld-Gebelein-Rényi Maximum Correlation Coefficient (HGR). The paper provides a thorough review of the existing literature on non-linear dependence measures and highlights the limitations of current methods, such as high computational demands, limited applicability to scalar random variables, and difficulty in implementation.
The authors support their claims through a combination of theoretical analysis and empirical experiments on both synthetic and real-world data. They demonstrate that RDC has a low computational cost of O(n log n) and is easy to implement, with just five lines of R code provided in the appendix. The paper also shows that RDC performs well in estimating non-linear dependence, especially in non-functional association patterns, and is competitive with other state-of-the-art methods, such as HSIC, CHSIC, and MIC.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the RDC methodology, including the estimation of copula transformations, generation of random non-linear projections, and computation of canonical correlations. The experimental results are thorough and well-presented, with a detailed comparison of RDC with other methods on various datasets.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The introduction of a novel and efficient measure of non-linear dependence, RDC, which addresses the limitations of current methods.
* A thorough review of the existing literature on non-linear dependence measures and their limitations.
* Empirical experiments on both synthetic and real-world data, demonstrating the effectiveness of RDC in estimating non-linear dependence.
* A clear and concise explanation of the RDC methodology and its implementation.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The choice of non-linearities φ : R → R is a well-known problem common to all non-linear regression methods, and the authors' choice of sinusoidal projections may not be optimal for all datasets.
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the relationship between RDC and other non-linear dependence measures, such as KCCA and MIC.
* The authors mention that the development of better methods to set the parameters of RDC is left as future work, which may be a limitation of the current implementation.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of statistics and machine learning, and the RDC methodology has the potential to be widely adopted in various applications. The authors' claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and empirical experiments, and the paper is well-written and easy to follow.
