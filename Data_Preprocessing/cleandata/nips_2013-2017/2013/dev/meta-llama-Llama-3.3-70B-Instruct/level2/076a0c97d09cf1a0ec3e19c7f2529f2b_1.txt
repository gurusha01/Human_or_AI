This paper introduces a nonparametric test for three-variable interaction, specifically the Lancaster interaction, using kernel embeddings of signed measures into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). The test statistic is based on the norm of the embedding of the Lancaster interaction measure, which is a signed measure that vanishes whenever the joint distribution can be factorized in a non-trivial way. The authors also propose a test for total independence, which is a special case of the Lancaster interaction test.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem of nonparametric testing of interaction between variables. The technical sections are also well-organized, and the authors provide a detailed explanation of the kernel embedding approach and the derivation of the test statistics.
The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed tests in detecting three-variable interactions, particularly in cases where pairwise independence tests may not be sufficient. The results show that the Lancaster interaction test outperforms competing approaches, such as conditional independence tests, in detecting V-structures in directed graphical models.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The introduction of a new nonparametric test for three-variable interaction, which fills a gap in the existing literature.
* The use of kernel embeddings of signed measures, which provides a flexible and powerful framework for testing interactions.
* The thorough experimental evaluation, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed tests in various scenarios.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The computational cost of the proposed tests, which may be prohibitive for large datasets.
* The limitation to three-variable interactions, which may not be sufficient for more complex datasets.
* The lack of comparison to other nonparametric tests, such as those based on mutual information or distance covariance.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of nonparametric testing of interaction between variables. The proposed tests have the potential to be widely applicable in various fields, including machine learning, statistics, and data science.
