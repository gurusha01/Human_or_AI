This paper proposes a novel approach to unsupervised learning, called sparse heterarchical matrix factorization (SHMF), which is particularly suited for analyzing data with a natural hierarchy of concepts. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method on calcium imaging data, where they aim to identify neurons, their assemblies, and the temporal evolution of both. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, related work, and their proposed approach.
The main claim of the paper is that SHMF can simultaneously interpret a calcium imaging sequence in terms of the constituent neurons, their membership in assemblies, and the time courses of both neurons and assemblies. The authors support this claim with experiments on synthetic and real-world data, showing that their method can accurately recover the structure from difficult synthetic data and yield plausible interpretations of real-world calcium imaging data.
The paper is strong in several aspects. Firstly, the authors provide a thorough review of related work, highlighting the limitations of existing approaches and the advantages of their proposed method. Secondly, the paper is well-organized, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their approach, including the mathematical formulation and optimization strategy. Thirdly, the experiments are well-designed, and the authors provide a detailed analysis of the results, including a comparison with other methods.
However, there are some limitations to the paper. Firstly, the authors could provide more discussion on the choice of hyperparameters, such as the tradeoff parameters η and λ, and how they affect the performance of the method. Secondly, the authors could provide more analysis on the computational complexity of their method and how it compares to other approaches. Finally, the authors could provide more discussion on the potential applications of their method beyond calcium imaging data.
In terms of novelty, the paper presents a significant improvement over existing approaches, particularly in its ability to learn the relations between concepts at different levels and to impose structured sparsity constraints. The authors also provide a comprehensive review of related work, highlighting the advantages and limitations of existing approaches.
In terms of significance, the paper has the potential to make a significant impact in the field of neuroscience, particularly in the analysis of calcium imaging data. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method in identifying neurons, their assemblies, and the temporal evolution of both, which is a crucial step in understanding the complex activation patterns in live neural tissue.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, as it presents a novel and significant contribution to the field of unsupervised learning, with a clear and concise presentation, thorough review of related work, and well-designed experiments.
