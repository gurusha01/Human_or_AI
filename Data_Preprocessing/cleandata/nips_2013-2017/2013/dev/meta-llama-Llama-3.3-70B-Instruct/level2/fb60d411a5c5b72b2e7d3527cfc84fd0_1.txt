This paper presents a novel sequence of intermediate distributions for exponential families, defined by averaging the moments of the initial and target distributions, to improve the performance of annealed importance sampling (AIS) in estimating partition functions. The authors provide a theoretical analysis of the asymptotic performance of both the geometric and moment averages paths and derive an asymptotically optimal piecewise linear schedule.
The main claims of the paper are: (1) the proposed moment averages path can outperform the traditional geometric averages path in estimating partition functions, and (2) the authors derive an asymptotically optimal piecewise linear schedule for the moment averages path. The paper supports these claims through a combination of theoretical analysis and empirical experiments on restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs).
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the background, methodology, and results. The theoretical analysis is thorough, and the empirical experiments are well-designed and comprehensive. The authors also provide a variational interpretation of the moment averages path, which helps to understand its behavior.
The paper has several strengths, including: (1) the proposal of a novel and effective method for estimating partition functions, (2) a thorough theoretical analysis of the asymptotic performance of the method, and (3) comprehensive empirical experiments to validate the method. The paper also has some limitations, including: (1) the assumption of perfect transitions, which may not always hold in practice, and (2) the requirement of estimating moments of the target distribution, which can be challenging for complex models.
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of machine learning and statistics, and the proposed method has the potential to improve the performance of AIS in estimating partition functions. The paper is well-suited for publication in a top-tier conference like NIPS.
