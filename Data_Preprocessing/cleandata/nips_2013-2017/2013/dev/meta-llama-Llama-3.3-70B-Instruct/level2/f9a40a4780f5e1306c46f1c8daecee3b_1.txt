This paper presents two novel Bayesian entropy estimators, ĤDBer and ĤDSyn, designed to estimate the entropy of binary spike trains from simultaneously recorded neurons. The authors claim that their estimators outperform traditional methods by exploiting the statistical structure of neural responses, particularly the sparsity and correlation structure of spike patterns.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise overview of the background and related work in entropy estimation. The technical contributions of the paper are sound, and the authors provide a thorough derivation of their estimators. The use of a hierarchical mixture-of-Dirichlets prior with a base measure designed to integrate prior knowledge about spike trains is a novel and interesting approach.
The authors evaluate their estimators on several simulated and real neural datasets, demonstrating their performance and comparing them to existing estimators such as the Nemenman-Shafee-Bialek (NSB) and Best Upper Bound (BUB) estimators. The results show that ĤDBer and ĤDSyn perform exceptionally well, especially ĤDSyn, which converges faster with increasing sample size.
The paper also provides an interesting application of the estimators to quantify temporal dependence in neural data, using the "block mutual information" to analyze the coding of a single neural time-series.
The strengths of the paper include its technical soundness, clear writing, and thorough evaluation of the estimators. The weaknesses are minor, including some notation and formatting issues, and the fact that the authors could provide more discussion on the limitations and potential extensions of their work.
Overall, I believe that this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of neural data analysis and entropy estimation, and I recommend it for acceptance.
