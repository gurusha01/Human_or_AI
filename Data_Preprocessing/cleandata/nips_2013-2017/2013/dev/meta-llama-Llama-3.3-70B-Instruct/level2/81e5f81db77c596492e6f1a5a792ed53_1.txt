This paper proposes a novel convex relaxation of sparse principal subspace estimation based on the convex hull of rank-d projection matrices (the Fantope). The authors establish a near-optimal convergence rate for estimation of the principal subspace of a general covariance matrix without assuming the spiked covariance model. They also provide a general theoretical framework for analyzing the statistical properties of the method for arbitrary input matrices, including sample covariance and Kendall's tau correlation matrices.
The paper's main contributions are:
1. A novel semidefinite program with a Fantope constraint for sparse principal subspace estimation.
2. A near-optimal rate of convergence in subspace estimation without assumptions on the rank of the solution or restrictive spiked covariance models.
3. A general theoretical framework that accommodates other matrices, in addition to sample covariance.
4. An efficient ADMM algorithm to solve the SDP.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their methodology and theoretical results. The simulation study demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method, FPS, compared to deflation-based methods.
Strengths:
* The paper addresses a significant problem in high-dimensional statistics, and the proposed method has the potential to improve the accuracy and efficiency of sparse principal subspace estimation.
* The authors provide a comprehensive theoretical framework, including a near-optimal convergence rate and a general framework for analyzing statistical properties.
* The ADMM algorithm is efficient and easy to implement.
Weaknesses:
* The paper assumes exact sparsity on the principal subspace, which may not always be the case in practice. It would be interesting to investigate the performance of FPS under weak sparsity assumptions.
* The choice of dimension d and regularization parameter λ is crucial in practice, and the authors do not provide a clear guideline for selecting these parameters.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel and efficient method for sparse principal subspace estimation, which has the potential to improve the accuracy and efficiency of existing methods.
* The authors provide a comprehensive theoretical framework, including a near-optimal convergence rate and a general framework for analyzing statistical properties.
* The simulation study demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to deflation-based methods.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The paper assumes exact sparsity on the principal subspace, which may not always be the case in practice.
* The choice of dimension d and regularization parameter λ is crucial in practice, and the authors do not provide a clear guideline for selecting these parameters.
Overall, I recommend accepting this paper, as it proposes a novel and efficient method for sparse principal subspace estimation, provides a comprehensive theoretical framework, and demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method through a simulation study. However, the authors should consider addressing the limitations of their method, such as the assumption of exact sparsity and the choice of dimension d and regularization parameter λ, in future work.
