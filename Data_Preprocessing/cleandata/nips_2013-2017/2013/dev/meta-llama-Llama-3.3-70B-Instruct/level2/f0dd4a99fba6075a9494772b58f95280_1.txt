This paper presents several applications of Optimistic Mirror Descent, an online learning algorithm that leverages predictable sequences to improve performance. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in various domains, including offline optimization, structured optimization, zero-sum games, and convex programming.
The paper's main claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experiments. The authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the Optimistic Mirror Descent algorithm and its applications, making it easy to follow for readers familiar with online learning and optimization.
The paper's strengths include its ability to recover existing algorithms, such as Mirror Prox, and its extension to new domains, such as zero-sum games and convex programming. The authors also provide a thorough analysis of the algorithm's performance, including regret bounds and convergence rates.
One of the paper's weaknesses is its reliance on smoothness assumptions, which may not always hold in practice. The authors acknowledge this limitation and suggest potential directions for future research, such as using bundle methods to derive more general conditions for predictability.
The paper is well-organized, and the writing is clear and concise. The authors provide sufficient details for reproducibility, including pseudocode and mathematical derivations. The references are comprehensive, and the authors engage with relevant literature in the field.
In terms of novelty, the paper presents a significant improvement over existing approaches in several domains. The authors' use of predictable sequences to improve optimization performance is a new and interesting contribution to the field.
The paper's significance lies in its potential to impact various areas of research, including optimization, game theory, and machine learning. The authors' results have implications for the design of more efficient algorithms and the development of new applications.
