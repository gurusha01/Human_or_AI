This paper presents a novel approach to model selection in high-dimensional linear regression, introducing the Gauss-Lasso selector as a two-stage method that first applies the Lasso and then performs ordinary least squares on the selected model. The authors prove that, under a generalized irrepresentability condition (GIC), the Gauss-Lasso selector correctly recovers the active set with high probability. The GIC is shown to be weaker than the standard irrepresentability condition, allowing for a broader range of applications.
The paper is well-organized and clearly written, with a thorough introduction to the problem and related work. The technical sections are detailed and provide a comprehensive analysis of the Gauss-Lasso selector. The authors also provide an example to illustrate the range of applicability of the GIC and discuss further related work.
The main contributions of the paper are:
1. The introduction of the Gauss-Lasso selector as a novel approach to model selection in high-dimensional linear regression.
2. The formulation of the generalized irrepresentability condition (GIC), which is shown to be weaker than the standard irrepresentability condition.
3. The proof that, under GIC, the Gauss-Lasso selector correctly recovers the active set with high probability.
The strengths of the paper include:
1. The novelty of the approach: The Gauss-Lasso selector is a new and interesting method for model selection in high-dimensional linear regression.
2. The thorough analysis: The authors provide a detailed and comprehensive analysis of the Gauss-Lasso selector, including a proof of its correctness under GIC.
3. The comparison to related work: The authors discuss related work and compare their approach to existing methods, highlighting the advantages of the Gauss-Lasso selector.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
1. The technical complexity: The paper assumes a strong background in linear regression, convex optimization, and statistical theory, which may make it challenging for non-experts to follow.
2. The lack of numerical experiments: The paper does not include numerical experiments to demonstrate the performance of the Gauss-Lasso selector in practice.
Overall, the paper is well-written and presents a significant contribution to the field of high-dimensional linear regression. The Gauss-Lasso selector is a novel and promising approach to model selection, and the authors' analysis provides a thorough understanding of its properties and limitations.
