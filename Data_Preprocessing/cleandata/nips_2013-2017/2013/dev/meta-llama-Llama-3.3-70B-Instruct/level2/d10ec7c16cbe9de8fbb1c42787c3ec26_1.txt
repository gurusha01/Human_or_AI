This paper proposes a general formalism of iterated random functions with semigroup property, which can be used to analyze the convergence of Bayesian posterior updates and message-passing algorithms in graphical models. The authors provide a convergence theory for iterated random functions and apply it to the analysis of exact and approximate message-passing algorithms for a sequential change point detection problem.
The main claim of the paper is that the proposed formalism can be used to analyze the convergence of message-passing algorithms, which is a significant contribution to the field. The authors support this claim by providing a convergence theory for iterated random functions and applying it to a specific problem.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem and the proposed formalism. The technical sections are also well-organized, and the authors provide detailed proofs of the main results.
The paper has several strengths. First, the proposed formalism is general and can be applied to a wide range of problems. Second, the authors provide a convergence theory for iterated random functions, which is a significant contribution to the field. Third, the authors apply the proposed formalism to a specific problem and provide numerical results to demonstrate its effectiveness.
However, the paper also has some weaknesses. First, the paper assumes that the reader is familiar with graphical models and message-passing algorithms, which may not be the case for all readers. Second, the paper could benefit from more numerical results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed formalism. Third, the paper could be improved by providing more discussion on the limitations of the proposed formalism and potential future directions.
In terms of novelty, the paper proposes a new formalism for analyzing the convergence of message-passing algorithms, which is a significant contribution to the field. The paper also provides a convergence theory for iterated random functions, which is a new result.
In terms of significance, the paper has the potential to impact the field of graphical models and message-passing algorithms. The proposed formalism can be used to analyze the convergence of message-passing algorithms, which is an important problem in the field.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication. The paper makes a significant contribution to the field, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem and the proposed formalism. The technical sections are also well-organized, and the authors provide detailed proofs of the main results.
