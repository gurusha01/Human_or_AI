The authors investigate the Sparse PCA problem, which involves principal components that depend on a limited number of variables. They propose a convex relaxation to solve this problem and provide an analysis of its performance. Additionally, they develop an ADMM-based method to efficiently solve the resulting SDP. The authors also present theoretical results using a Kendall's tau matrix as input, rather than the traditional sample covariance matrix.
The paper is well-structured and clearly written, with the authors doing an excellent job of explaining key concepts as they are introduced. The presented results appear to be accurate.
The convex formulation is a notable strength of the paper, achieved through simple techniques that complement the ADMM formulation and Lemma 4.1. A minor suggestion is to mention the closed-form expression for the projection onto the fantope earlier in the paper, potentially alongside the motivation for the convex relaxation.
However, the statistical analysis seems somewhat lacking, particularly in near-low-rank and low-rank cases. If there are only d non-zero eigenvalues, the authors' bound could be significantly far from the minimax bound. The statement "It is possible (with more technical work) to tighten the bound..." in the last paragraph of page 5 could be rephrased, as it does not contribute constructively without discussing the potential technical work involved.
Including a brief proof sketch after each result would be helpful, even with the Appendix containing all proofs, as reviewers are not required to read supplementary material.
The Simulation Results section also appears weak, with figures needing reworking, such as Figure 1(a), which is difficult to see in a printed version. Explaining "overlapping" and "non-overlapping" sparsity patterns in the text and/or caption would be beneficial, along with an intuitive explanation for the performance differences in these cases and their significance.
A minor point is that the authors could rephrase ".. has a wide range of applications - Science, engineering, ... " to instead point readers to specific applications with references.
Overall, the authors propose a simple convex relaxation with an efficient solution method for the Sparse PCA problem. While the paper is well-written, the results could benefit from intuitive justification and proof sketches in the main text. The convex relaxation and ADMM algorithm are notable strengths, but the performance in natural cases like low-rank or near-low-rank settings is not satisfactory, and the simulation results are not entirely persuasive.
