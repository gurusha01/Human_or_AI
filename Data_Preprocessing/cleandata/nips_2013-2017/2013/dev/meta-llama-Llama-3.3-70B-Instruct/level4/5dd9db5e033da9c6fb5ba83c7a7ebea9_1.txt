This manuscript reformulates the minimization of decomposable submodular functions as an orthogonal projection, yielding algorithms that can be readily parallelized. By concentrating on a specific subset of decomposable functions, the authors demonstrate that the proximal problem can be resolved in fewer iterations than existing methods. 
The authors examine various established techniques for minimizing the Lovasz extension over the unit cube in n-dimensional space and provide experimental validation of their assertions. 
However, a notable omission is the lack of empirical evidence confirming the speed enhancements when the method is implemented as a parallel algorithm, a key benefit touted in the paper. 
The manuscript is well-organized and clearly presented, effectively conveying its technical content. The approach outlined in the paper, which involves casting the minimization problem as an orthogonal projection to facilitate parallelization, is a key contribution, and the authors' focus on a specific subclass of decomposable functions enables them to achieve improved iteration efficiency in solving the proximal problem.
