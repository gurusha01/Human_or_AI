This manuscript explores two rival hypotheses regarding the olfactory system's ability to deduce the presence and concentration of odors from the firing rates of olfactory receptor neurons in response to complex, mixed stimuli. The authors propose a basic probabilistic model and introduce two inference algorithms: one utilizing variational inference and the other employing sampling techniques. To formulate these algorithms in a manner consistent with neural plausibility, dynamical update rules are derived. The authors then evaluate the biological feasibility of these algorithms using simulated data and conclude that either approach could potentially operate within natural time constraints, with distinguishable outcomes based on observed firing patterns.
The paper delves into a prominent topic within the NIPS community and the broader field of computational neuroscience, investigating whether and how probabilistic reasoning and computation can be performed in neural systems. By extending a previously introduced probabilistic model for olfaction (Beck et al. [1]), the authors incorporate a spike-and-slab prior over odor concentrations and propose two novel inference algorithms. Given the complexity of Bayesian inference in these models, developing neurally plausible algorithm implementations poses a significant challenge. The authors employ a range of innovative approaches to address the problem of olfactory inference, yielding novel and insightful proposals.
The primary finding of this study suggests that both variational inference and sampling could potentially be effective, although the authors provide limited biological evidence to support the actual employment of these methods in real systems or the reasonableness of the implementation-level requirements imposed by these algorithms. A more comprehensive evaluation of the computational and anatomical constraints associated with these algorithms is left for future investigation.
The proposed inference algorithms differ substantially from other sampling-based approaches, contributing unique ideas to the growing body of literature on probabilistic inference in neural circuits. However, the existence of biological or experimental evidence supporting probabilistic inference in olfactory systems remains to be determined. This manuscript builds upon existing research by introducing a more realistic probabilistic model and two novel inference algorithms for olfaction. While the work is technically sound and theoretically intriguing, the biological constraints necessary to realize these algorithms in neural systems are considerable.
