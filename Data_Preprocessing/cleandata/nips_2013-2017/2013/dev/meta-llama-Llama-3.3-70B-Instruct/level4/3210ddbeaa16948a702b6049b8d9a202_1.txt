This paper examines the collision probability of a hashing scheme for points in R^D, where the hash function selects a random vector comprising D i.i.d. samples from a symmetric alpha-stable distribution, and the hash of a point x is determined by the sign of the dot product of x and the random vector. Notably, a similar scheme using a 2-stable distribution has been previously studied, known as sim-hash. The primary result demonstrates that for alpha=1 on binary data, the collision probability can be approximated by a function of the chi-square similarity. However, the authors acknowledge that the bound for general data is far from the actual collision probability, rendering its significance and comparison to chi-square similarity unclear.
The paper presents experimental results indicating that the collision probability is approximately equal to certain functions of the chi-square similarity, enabling the approximation of chi-square similarity from the collision probability and these functions. Nevertheless, this approach may necessitate the use of kernel SVM and exhaustive search, rather than linear SVM and efficient near neighbor search, which were initially proposed as advantages. The utility of the implicitly defined kernel by the LSH, particularly for chi-square similarity, is not adequately explained.
Upon reviewing the provided proofs in the appendix, the ones examined appear to be correct, with clear and easy-to-follow details. Although the question of finding a hashing scheme that approximates chi-square similarity is intriguing, the paper does not make significant progress in resolving it.
In response to the rebuttal comments, the proposed streaming application is indeed interesting, but the crucial factor in all three applications (linear SVM, near neighbor search, and streaming) is the usefulness of the kernel implicitly defined by the hashing scheme, which remains inadequately supported. To strengthen the paper, it would be beneficial to report the accuracy and speed achieved using the hashing scheme directly with linear SVM on a dataset like MNIST. The paper establishes a relationship between the collision probability of a hashing scheme based on stable distribution and a function of chi-square similarity but fails to demonstrate the usefulness of this function for learning tasks and how to derive algorithms for chi-square similarity.
