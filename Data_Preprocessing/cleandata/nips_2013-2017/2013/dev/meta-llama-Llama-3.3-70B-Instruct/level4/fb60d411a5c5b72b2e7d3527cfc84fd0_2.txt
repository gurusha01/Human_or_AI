Review- Summary 
======= 
The proposed article introduces an alternative approach to annealed importance sampling (AIS) by utilizing paths based on averaging moments, as opposed to the traditional geometric averages of the initial and target distributions. The authors provide a comprehensive analysis, supported by both theoretical and empirical evidence, to demonstrate the advantages of their moment averaging (MA) method.
Quality 
======= 
The paper presents a rigorous examination of the MA path, with theoretically sound claims and accurate proofs, aside from minor typographical errors. However, the empirical results, which employed a linear annealing schedule for the geometric averaging (GA) path, could be further enhanced by exploring alternative schedules, as suggested in previous studies (Neal, 1998; Salakhutdinov & Murray, 2008). This could potentially lead to more reasonable samples, particularly in the context of larger RBMs, as hinted at in figures 2 and 3.
Clarity 
======= 
The paper is well-structured and clearly written, making it easy to follow the main arguments. Nevertheless, the supplementary material could benefit from additional explicit calculations, such as the Fisher information matrix used in the integral on page 4, to enhance clarity.
Originality 
=========== 
This paper represents a significant and original contribution to the field, as it deviates from the conventional geometric paths used in AIS. The proposed MA approach is not only innovative but also technically challenging, demonstrating the authors' ingenuity.
Significance 
============ 
AIS is a widely adopted technique in statistical machine learning, and the MA approach has the potential to improve the estimation of partition functions, particularly for complex models. Moreover, better annealing strategies can have a broader impact on model comparison, inference, and learning. Although the proposed strategy may not be immediately adopted due to its added complexity and the competitive performance of GA in certain scenarios, it has the potential to inspire further research in this direction.
Minor comments 
============== 
– Supp. 1: consider using $\theta0 = \theta$ instead of $\theta = \theta0$ for consistency.
– Supp. 2: using $pa$ and $pb$ for $p0$ and $p1$ throughout would improve notation consistency.
– Supp. 2.1: the Lagrangian's first term should be revised to $\lambda ( 1 - \sumx q(x) )$ or $\lambda ( \sumx q(x) - 1 )$ for accuracy.
– Supp. 3.1: the correct equation should be $\dot s(\beta) = 2\beta$.
– Supp. 3.2: a factor of 2 is missing in the derivative of $\lambda(\beta)$. This contribution has the potential to make a significant impact on future research in learning, inference, and model comparison, and while it may not be immediately adopted for partition function estimation, it is likely to inspire further theoretical work in this direction.
