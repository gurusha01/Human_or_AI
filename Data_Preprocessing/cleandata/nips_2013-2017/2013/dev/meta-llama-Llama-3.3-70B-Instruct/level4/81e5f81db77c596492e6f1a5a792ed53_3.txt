The paper presents a innovative reformulation of the sparse subspace discovery problem, framing it as the identification of sparse matrices within a fanotope, which is the convex hull of rank-d projection matrices. This formulation yields a convex optimization problem that is solved utilizing an ADMM algorithm, with theoretical guarantees provided for support recovery and error in the Frobenius norm. The authors also include a series of synthetic experiments that demonstrate improved performance in recovering a sparse factorization of a target matrix, as measured by the Frobenius norm.
The proposed formulation is noteworthy for its elegance and offers a novel, intuitive alternative to the traditional sparse PCA objective. Furthermore, the method allows for the near-optimal decomposition of drop-in replacements for a covariance matrix, such as Kendall and Pearson correlation, enabling an analogue of non-linear sparse PCA under familiar constraints from nonparanormal work.
However, a more detailed discussion of the synthetic experiments would be beneficial. Notably, the number of selected variables appears to be quite high, particularly for matrix Pi, which is of rank 5 and inherently sparse. It would be informative to determine the optimal sparse decomposition for both the overlap and non-overlap examples and to assess whether the method achieves this decomposition with the selected variables numbering in the hundreds. Additionally, a comparison with DSPCA in this regard would be valuable. While the Frobenius norm serves as an error term, it only tells part of the story. The claim that FPS yields estimates that are "typically sparser" is not substantiated by the results, and further clarification is needed.
Regarding notation, a clear definition of the symbol \vee would be helpful, as its meaning, although inferable from context, is sufficiently non-standard to warrant explicit explanation. Minor corrections include changing "difficult to interepretation" to "difficult to interpret" and ensuring consistent notation for the Frobenius norm in Figure 1 and throughout the paper.
Overall, the paper is well-written and contributes a novel perspective on the sparse PCA problem by introducing a straightforward method for estimating sparse subspaces.
