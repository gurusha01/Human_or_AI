This paper provides a comprehensive examination of algorithms and their corresponding analyses for various distributed best-arm identification scenarios in the context of multi-armed bandits (MAB) problems. The authors explore both best-arm and epsilon-best arm identification, considering scenarios where k "workers" communicate either once or through R rounds. Notably, they achieve a speed-up of \sqrt{k} with a single round of communication and a speed-up of \epsilon^{2/R} k with R rounds. Specifically, when R is on the order of O(log(1/\epsilon)), the algorithm reaches the optimal speed-up factor of k. Furthermore, the results for a single communication round are substantiated by a corresponding lower bound.
In terms of quality, clarity, originality, and significance, the paper excels. It is well-written, its contributions are substantial, and it presents novel ideas. Although I did not thoroughly review the supplementary material, except for verifying the proof of the lower bound, the other findings appear credible and align with the expectations for a paper of this caliber. Overall, I believe this paper would be engaging and relevant to the NIPS community, with my suggestions being minor and easily addressable by the authors.
