The paper explores the issue of minimizing simple regret in multi-armed bandit problems, focusing on the sample complexity of identifying the arm with the highest payoff. The authors investigate whether previously known algorithms can be accelerated through parallel processing on k processors. They propose an algorithm that achieves a sqrt(k) speedup by limiting node communication to a single instance and demonstrate that no greater speedup is possible with this communication restriction. Additionally, they show that an optimal speedup of k can be attained with O(log 1/epsilon) communication rounds, where epsilon represents the desired precision.
I found the paper to be highly enjoyable and well-written. Despite my initial impression that most interesting problems related to best-arm selection had already been solved, the authors successfully introduce a novel and practically relevant framework, providing elegant results concerning the complexity of the resulting learning problem. Although the results are original, they do not require groundbreaking new techniques to prove. The technical content appears sound, and I have only minor complaints and additional questions regarding the paper.
Detailed comments:
-------------------------
182: The results for using Alg 3 to select the best arm are not adequately presented. While the results are stated for epsilon > 0, they should also be expressed in terms of Delta_* for completeness.
194: To maintain consistency with Corollary 4.2, "r" should be replaced with "R" in the last row.
211: Wouldn't it be more straightforward to require an algorithm to successfully return the best arm with a probability of at least 1-delta? Kalyanakrishnan et al. (2012) and Gabillon et al. (2012) provide algorithms for the more general problem of selecting the m best arms. Could the authors comment on how their results generalize to this setting?
263: The wording of Lemma 3.3 is somewhat confusing. As inferred from the proof of Lemma 3.4, it should state that the probability of a fixed player identifying the best arm is such and such. The current statement may be misinterpreted to mean that all players identify the correct arm with the specified probability.
307: Although the authors did not aim to optimize constants, can they provide insights into how much these factors can be improved? The factors of 400 and 50 seem arbitrary; is it possible to significantly reduce them?
398: Delta_*
467: The citation should be formatted as H. Daum√© III instead of H. D. III.
The paper presents an elegant solution to a well-motivated new learning problem, with an excellent writing style and technical quality.
