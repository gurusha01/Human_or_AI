The concept presented is straightforward yet yields notable results, making it a potentially acceptable paper if its novelty is confirmed. A thorough examination of the novelty aspect is essential to determine the paper's validity. 
The classification of the algorithm as a boosting technique is questionable, as it appears to lack the characteristic manipulation of example distributions. Instead, it resembles a pursuit algorithm, relating it more closely to the pursuit literature, such as kernel matching pursuit, than to the boosting literature. Although similar, it is not identical to existing works.
Regarding the overlap with papers 539 and 956, it is notable that paper 956 presents a multiclass variant of the idea, while paper 539 offers a semi-supervised variant. Both of these could be concisely presented within paper 481, suggesting that the division of the work into separate papers may not be the most effective approach. It is recommended that paper 481 be accepted, while papers 539 and 956 are rejected. The author could then be advised to reference these extensions in the final version of the paper and reserve a more in-depth discussion for a future journal publication.
Specific comments include: on page 1, line 44, the problem may not always be convex, even with surrogate losses, depending on the function family. Accepting paper 481, which contains the core idea, is recommended.
