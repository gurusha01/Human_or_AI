This manuscript presents a comprehensive examination of the post-Lasso estimator within the context of high-dimensional sparse regression, offering a new theoretical guarantee and simulated experiments that demonstrate the procedure's benefits.
The authors provide a thorough analysis, including a toy example that clearly illustrates the advantages of the post-Lasso. However, there are several areas that require improvement.
Firstly, the literature review is incomplete, missing key references that theoretically analyze the post-Lasso or its variations, such as "Pivotal Estimation of Nonparametric Functions via Square-root Lasso" by Alexandre Belloni, Victor Chernozhukov, and Lie Wang, and "L1-Penalized Quantile Regression in High-Dimensional Sparse Models" by Alexandre Belloni and Victor Chernozhukov. The authors should also address a recent study, "Trust, but verify: benefits and pitfalls of least-squares refitting in high dimensions" by Johannes Lederer, which challenges the theoretical benefits of the post-Lasso in certain situations.
Several corrections are necessary: on line 134, the uniqueness of the minimizers of G is assumed without justification, which is only true under additional assumptions on the Gram matrix, as discussed in "On Sparse Representations in Arbitrary Redundant Bases" by J-J. Fuchs and "The Lasso Problem and Uniqueness" by Ryan J. Tibshirani. The authors should adapt these results to prove uniqueness under suitable assumptions, as the current proof relies on unproven uniqueness at several points.
Additionally, the authors should remove the unused definition of t_0 on line 303, add a comment on the dependence of the lambda parameter on the unknown quantity eta on line 307, and clarify the benefits of the assumptions with respect to reference [23] on line 317.
Section 3.1 appears redundant, as it presents the same results as Section 2.1, and could be removed to make room for additional comments and missing references. The authors may also want to investigate further comparisons between the deterministic and random cases.
On line 408, the authors should attempt to improve the term depending on exp(-t_0/2), which seems to be the weak point of the probability control in Theorem 3.4. There are also minor errors, such as the misspelling of "Cand√®s" on lines 441 and 443, and a potential sign issue on line 553.
The authors should address two general questions: firstly, the lack of adaptivity in their procedure, which requires prior knowledge of the sparsity level, and secondly, the conditions under which T_0 equals S, as mentioned on line 267.
Overall, the manuscript is well-written, clear, and of high interest to statisticians and practitioners, but requires revisions to address the mentioned issues and improve its overall quality.
