This manuscript presents a novel UCB-based contextual bandit algorithm, leveraging graph-structured information to enhance decision-making. Specifically, it considers a contextual bandit model with linear payoffs and unknown user-dependent coefficient vectors. A graph structure is imposed on the users, with an assumption linking the graph topology to the coefficient vectors, thereby enabling the graph to provide meaningful insights. The proposed algorithm utilizes the graph's Laplacian matrix to disseminate knowledge gained from one user to others with similar coefficient vectors. The authors provide a regret bound and numerical experiments to substantiate their approach.
This work represents a logical progression of existing techniques, aligning with the broader goal of integrating bandit concepts into more practical scenarios. The paper is generally well-written, although some sentences exhibit minor grammatical errors (as noted below). Furthermore, the intuition presented in Section 4 is not readily comprehensible.
Following a detailed discussion with fellow reviewers, I have reassessed my evaluation and lowered the quality score. Initially, I attributed my difficulty in grasping the intuition and methodological choices to my limited familiarity with graph-based methods. However, I now believe that the intuition is not effectively conveyed. Moreover, the implementation of CB, accompanied by the analysis of TCB, raises questions regarding the analyzability of CB, which remains unaddressed. Although the discrepancy between LinUCB and SupLinUCB is acknowledged, with the former being empirically studied and the latter theoretically examined in a separate paper, the technical aspects of the contribution are sound. Nevertheless, I no longer consider this work a strong candidate for acceptance.
Notable errors include:
129: "We model the similary" should be "We model the similarity"
137: "That is, despite (1) may contain" should be "That is, although (1) may contain"
207: "but it rather contains graph" should be "but contains the graph"
371/372: "lends itself to be" should be "turns out to be"
The paper explores an intriguing and natural extension of contextual bandits, incorporating graph-structured information, a topic of interest in the machine learning community. However, the work is not particularly surprising, and several aspects, including the intuition, are not well-executed.
