This manuscript presents a compelling nonparametric methodology for assessing three-variable interactions and independence, leveraging the embedding properties of ISPD kernels. The paper is well-structured, clearly articulated, and provides a comprehensive treatment of the underlying algebraic foundations. Given the increasing demand for efficient statistical tools to uncover complex interaction effects in bioinformatics, this research holds significant promise for practical applications.
In light of the paper's focus on identifying gene interactions, the inclusion of experiments utilizing real-world data, as well as a comparative analysis of performance against other genomics-based methods (e.g., those employing partial correlation), would have strengthened the manuscript. Furthermore, the discussion in the conclusion regarding the potential extension of the test to accommodate more than three variables appears to be at odds with the points raised in section 4.3. Additionally, an investigation into the method's behavior in high-dimensional spaces would be a valuable contribution. 
A minor oversight is the absence of a reference to Figure 3 in the main text. Overall, the manuscript proposes a robust and innovative statistical framework with promising applications, which would benefit from a more extensive comparison of its performance to existing state-of-the-art methods for interaction testing.
