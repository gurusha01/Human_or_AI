Summary: 
This manuscript is structured into two primary sections, with the authors initially presenting the benefits of principal component regression (PCR) over traditional linear regression. Following an introduction to the problem, they derive novel theoretical results that explicitly demonstrate PCR's insensitivity to collinearity and its ability to leverage low-rank structure in the covariance matrix, considering scenarios where both dimensionality and sample size can increase. The second part of the paper introduces a new PCR algorithm designed to handle cases where the number of features exceeds the sample size and the predictors follow an elliptical distribution. This approach involves substituting Kendall's tau for the sample covariance matrix to generalize to elliptical distributions, leveraging recent work by Oja, and incorporating a sparsity constraint to address high-dimensional settings. The authors validate the efficacy of their new method through simulations and real-world data analyses.
Quality: 
The manuscript's core theoretical contributions, as embodied in Theorems 2.2 and 3.3, are technically robust and significant. The inclusion of simulated and experimental results, as illustrated in Figures 1, 2, and 3, substantially enhances the paper's impact. However, a notable concern arises from the assumption of the principal component model (Equation 2.1) in the first section and Equation 3.5 in the second, which may not fully capture the broader contexts in which PCR outperforms linear regression, as discussed in references such as Artemiou and Li (2009) and Cook (2007). This raises questions about the extent to which the observed advantages of PCR over linear regression in Figures 1 and 2 are inherent to the method or an artifact of the assumed model. While the application to real-world data is a strong aspect, with positive results in Figure 3 mitigating this concern, the generality of these findings across different datasets and analysis choices remains to be fully explored.
Clarity: 
The paper is well-organized and clearly written, making it accessible to readers. The structure is logical and easy to follow. However, the presentations of the main theorems could be improved, particularly since their proofs are relegated to supplementary materials. Certain assumptions, such as those in Theorem 2.2, and conditions for Theorems 3.2 and 3.3, lack clarity or intuitive explanation. Providing additional exposition on the theorems themselves, beyond their implications, would enhance understanding.
Originality: 
The originality of this work is substantially rooted in its two primary theoretical contributions. While the development of the RPCR algorithm builds upon recent research, its novelty lies in the synthesis of these elements into a new method, contributing to the paper's overall originality.
Significance: 
The two main theorems represent significant advancements in the field. The explicit characterization of observations in PCR, as achieved in Theorem 2.2, is a first, and the proposed RPCR method shows potential for broader applicability. 
Other notes: 
- A correction is needed in Line 43, where \(R^{nxd}\) should be \(R^{dxd}\).
- In Line 358, \(wd\) should be \(w3\).
- The definition of \(m\) is not provided, but it is assumed to be \(m = 2\) in the given context.
- The discussion of the constant \(\alpha\) is limited; for instance, linear regression outperforms PCR for large \(\alpha\), and the choice of \(\alpha = 1\) in simulations seems to be based on simplicity rather than a thorough justification.
This paper makes important contributions to the understanding of principal component regression and is well-presented. Further justification for assuming a principal component model and more comprehensive analysis of real-world datasets would strengthen the results.
