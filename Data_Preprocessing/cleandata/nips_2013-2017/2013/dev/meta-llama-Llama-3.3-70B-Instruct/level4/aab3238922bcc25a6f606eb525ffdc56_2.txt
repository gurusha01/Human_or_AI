The RDC estimator is a non-linear dependency measurement technique that fulfills Renyi's requirements and leverages the FastFood acceleration method introduced at ICML13. The approach involves three primary steps: 1) transforming the data into a copula form, which retains the dependency structure while disregarding marginal distributions, 2) extracting k non-linear features from each data point, drawing inspiration from Bochner's theorem, and 3) applying the standard CCA eigenvalue problem to the resulting paired datasets. Essentially, RDC can be viewed as a copula-based adaptation of kCCA, despite the potential for this description to be misleading. The method's efficiency is demonstrated through its application to a range of classical non-linear bivariate dependency scenarios and 12 real-world datasets, utilizing a forward feature selection process.
The paper is exceptionally well-written and easy to comprehend. Although the concept is constructed by combining existing elements, it represents a substantial addition to the field. 
Several points warrant further consideration:
- The choice of k being set to 10 seems oversimplified, as it appears to have a more significant impact than acknowledged in the paper.
- The phrase "same structure as HGR" at line 74 requires clarification.
- Equation (5) contains a notation error, where 'm' should be replaced with 'n'.
- Line 217 could be rephrased for better understanding; specifically, the statement "which is independent" could be expanded to highlight that the independence property makes RDC a straightforward and computationally efficient estimator of the HGR coefficient, but a more in-depth discussion on the selection of k is necessary. Having reviewed the author's rebuttal, these points remain relevant.
