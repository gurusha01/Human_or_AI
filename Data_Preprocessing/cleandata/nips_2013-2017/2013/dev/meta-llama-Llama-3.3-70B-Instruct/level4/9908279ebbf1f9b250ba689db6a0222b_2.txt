The authors present a novel robust and sparse principal component regression (PCR) estimator tailored for non-Gaussian data, leveraging theoretical foundations that justify the use of PCR over traditional least squares regression, particularly in the presence of low-rank structures and data characterized by heavy and dependent tails. The efficacy of this approach is convincingly demonstrated through both simulated and real-world equity data experiments.
The manuscript boasts lucid writing and makes two substantial contributions:
1. It elucidates the scenarios under which PCR is preferred over standard least squares regression, highlighting advantages such as invariance to collinearity and the effective exploitation of low-rank structures in the design or sample covariance matrix. These concepts are illustrated through simple yet insightful synthetic experiments.
2. The authors address the challenge of large-d-small-n cases by introducing a robust variant of PCR, grounded in an elliptical family of densities model. This model is particularly adept at capturing data with heavy and dependent tails.
A notable aspect of the proposed algorithm is its simplicity, which involves:
- Projecting the data onto the sparse principal eigenvector of the sample Kendall's tau, analogous to sparse PCA on the sample covariance, achieved via the truncated power algorithm.
- Subsequent regression of Y on Xu.
Additional observations include:
- A suggested correction at line 373, where the reference to the F distribution could be more accurately represented as an exponential distribution.
- A query regarding the scaling of the prediction error by a factor of 100, as opposed to adjusting the error axis scale, which may stem from a misunderstanding.
Following a rigorous demonstration of the advantages of PCR over least squares regression, the paper innovatively presents a semiparametric approach to sparse and robust PCR. The author's rebuttal has been carefully considered.
