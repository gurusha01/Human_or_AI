This manuscript proposes a significant enhancement to existing estimators of entropy in multidimensional binary distributions, a crucial aspect of advancing our understanding of the neural code. The timing of this work is particularly opportune, given the increasing prevalence of multi-electrode recordings that rely on robust analysis methods, such as the one presented, to facilitate interpretation. 
The approach outlined in this submission leverages the sparsity of population responses, particularly when binned over brief time intervals, where the most common response is characterized by the absence of neuronal spikes, with response frequencies decreasing rapidly as the number of spikes increases. By integrating this prior knowledge into a Bayesian framework, the authors develop an estimator that achieves a bias comparable to that of current estimators but requires substantially less data, thereby addressing a critical constraint in empirical research.
An exemplary application of this method to real-world data reveals synergistic coding in retinal ganglion cells over time, although this section would benefit from expansion to yield more robust and compelling findings. The derivation and results are presented with clarity, and my comments are largely minor. Overall, this work represents a notable improvement in entropy estimation methodologies, attributable to the employment of a more refined prior than those utilized in previous studies.
