The authors propose a novel algorithm for learning multilevel sparse representations, formulated as a penalized low-rank matrix factorization problem with more than two factors, each representing a distinct entity in the hierarchy. The factors are estimated using standard block coordinate descent methods, where each factor is optimized while keeping the others fixed, and sparsity-promoting penalties are applied at each step.
In the context of large-scale calcium imaging data analysis, the method assumes a hierarchical structure of pixels, neurons, and assemblies, aiming to estimate neuron locations, assembly memberships, and spike patterns. The authors claim that their approach outperforms existing methods on artificial and real data, correctly identifying neural assemblies.
Regarding originality, the ideas presented are innovative, and the three-way decomposition approach is noteworthy. The inclusion of a standard two-way decomposition and the enforcement of consistency between the two decompositions can enhance the algorithm's robustness to certain phenomena.
However, the paper's quality raises concerns about efficiency, as large-scale calcium imaging experiments involve vast amounts of data. Although the multilevel decomposition reduces dimensionality, and some steps can be parallelized, the algorithm's computational speed and iteration requirements need to be discussed.
Furthermore, the usage of neural assemblies is not entirely convincing, as it is unclear how often they appear in practice. The incorporation of the proposed multilevel hierarchical decomposition may not provide a direct benefit, and the authors should elaborate on this aspect. Additionally, the regularizers used, such as ΩU and ΩA, require clarification, including the convex cell shape priors employed.
The choice of regularization weights is left to the user, which seems critical given the large number of regularizers and their importance. The authors' claim that accurate prior estimation of the rank is not crucial, as the algorithm will shrink non-relevant components to zero, may depend heavily on the correct choice of sparsity penalties.
The paper's clarity is a significant issue, making it inaccessible to non-experts in calcium imaging data analysis. The authors briefly mention the translation of neural spikes into calcium activity but do not discuss this crucial aspect of spike deconvolution in their algorithm. The relationship to existing literature on this topic, such as Vogelstein et al. (2010) and Grewe et al. (2010), should be established.
The presentation of the main equations as a figure is unconventional, and the real data experiments could be more thoroughly presented. Figure 6 requires a better explanation, and the results could be more convincing. Overall, the paper proposes an interesting approach but needs significant clarification on several important issues.
