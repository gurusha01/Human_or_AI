This manuscript presents a novel hashing approach that establishes a relationship between the chi-squared similarity of two high-dimensional vectors, x and y, and the Hamming distance of their sign vectors obtained through random projections using a matrix R, whose elements are drawn from an alpha-stable distribution. The authors provide a theoretical lower bound of the chi-squared similarity measure in terms of the cosine of the normalized Hamming distance between the sign vectors. Furthermore, for the specific case of alpha=1 with an i.i.d. Cauchy matrix, empirical evidence suggests that this bound closely approximates the actual similarity measure, enabling competitive performance with existing kernel-based classification methods.
The concepts introduced in this paper are intriguing, with potential applications in efficiently computing the chi-squared similarity measure, as noted by the authors. However, several concerns need to be addressed: 
- The manuscript would benefit from meticulous editing to improve its clarity and flow. The primary focus on the chi-squared similarity measure becomes apparent only in Section 7, and the experimental results are dispersed throughout the paper, disrupting its coherence. 
- Unlike other hashing schemes, such as sim-hash and LSH, which provide both lower and upper bounds relating original and Hamming space metrics, this approach falls short in establishing a rigorous similarity estimation technique. The authors should discuss the challenges in proving the converse relation. 
- While the method is space-efficient, its time efficiency for alpha=1 with a Cauchy random projection matrix is not explicitly addressed, unlike the case for alpha=2, where fast transforms are known. 
- Normalizing the x-axis in Figs 2 and 3 to the same limits would facilitate a clearer visualization of the empirical tightness of the proposed bounds, as the current scales hinder comparison. 
Post-rebuttal edit: My assessment of the paper remains unchanged, as the ideas presented are novel and have significant potential impact. However, I concur with other reviewers that the paper requires thorough reorganization, addressing gaps in the narrative, particularly the relationship between chi-squared similarity and the approximations in Theorem 2 and Lemma 5, and clarifying the experimental results to make them more convincing. The paper proposes an efficient method for estimating chi-squared similarity through Hamming distances of alpha-stable random projections but falls short of establishing a rigorous metric equivalence between the original and embedded spaces, a limitation offset by extensive empirical evaluations.
