The authors introduce a novel, non-linear measure of dependence between two random variables, which is essentially the canonical correlation between non-linear, random projections of the variables following a copula transformation that maintains the marginals' invariance to linear transformations.
This study presents a straightforward yet apparently effective method for quantifying non-linear dependencies between random variables. A key aspect of this work is the utilization of non-linear random projections via the "random Fourier features" approach proposed by Rahimi and Recht (2007). The authors conduct a comprehensive comparison of their newly proposed randomized dependence coefficient (RDC) with various other coefficients for measuring both linear and non-linear dependence. Additionally, they investigate the suitability of RDC for variable selection in linear prediction problems. These comparisons and experiments are valuable, as they provide insight into the behavior of RDC.
The paper's overall presentation is clear, with each component of the procedure well-described. The schematic diagram in Figure 1 is particularly helpful in illustrating the process. The comparison with other dependence coefficients, combined with the empirical results, is also informative and suggests that RDC's performance is promising.
Although the authors employ random Fourier features (RFFs), recent studies, such as Yang et al. (2012), have compared RFFs with other schemes for generating random features, including the Nystrom method. Notably, the Nystrom method samples randomly, taking into account the probability distribution of the data, which can lead to a better estimate of the underlying kernel. Considering the potential benefits of using Nystrom features, which can be computed for any type of kernel function, unlike RFFs that are limited to shift-invariant kernels, could be an interesting direction for future research. Furthermore, exploring the effect of increasing the number of random features (k) on the performance of RDC, as suggested by Yang et al.'s empirical findings, could provide valuable insights.
However, I have some concerns regarding the theoretical treatment presented in the paper. The discussion of the bound in equation (10) appears to overlook the tradeoff involving k. It seems that driving the LC/sqrt(k) term to be small could result in a significant increase in ||m||_F compared to n, which is not explicitly addressed. As it stands, I am unsure whether the analysis is sufficient to support the empirical performance of RDC.
Regarding the properties of the RFF approximation for linear prediction, it is possible that the approximation acts as a regularizer. Therefore, I question whether the type of generalization bound used for prediction algorithms is entirely suitable for quantifying the performance and analyzing the behavior of a dependence measure.
One minor point is that the reference to Recht is incorrectly cited as "Brecht" in the text.
After reading the author rebuttal, I am satisfied with their response. The authors should ensure that they clarify the constraints in the CCA optimization problem. Overall, I find the work to be extremely interesting and effective empirically. Although the theoretical analysis appears to be incomplete, it does not significantly detract from the impact and importance of the work.
