This paper examines the model selection properties of the Gauss-Lasso procedure, a two-step method where a lasso estimator is first fitted, followed by an OLS estimator on the subset of selected variables, with the estimated support determined by the largest s components of the OLS estimator in absolute value.
The primary contribution of this work is the introduction of a generalized irrepresentability condition, under which the Gauss-Lasso procedure is shown to correctly recover the support of the parameter vector. 
However, the presentation of the material can be significantly enhanced. For instance, Section 3.1 appears redundant and could be integrated into a more generalized optimization procedure that encompasses both equations (5) and (16), allowing for a more streamlined presentation of results. Furthermore, it would be beneficial to clearly articulate how this work improves upon existing results, such as those in [1], by highlighting novel methodologies and outlining the proof to distinguish it from previous studies.
Additionally, the comparison with other two-step procedures, like those in [2] and [3], which achieve consistent variable selection under less stringent conditions than the irrepresentable condition, is warranted. Specifically, an evaluation of how the generalized irrepresentable condition stacks up against the conditions imposed in these works would provide valuable context.
Another pertinent question to address is the performance of the Gauss-Lasso procedure when the unknown parameter vector exhibits approximate sparsity. Would the procedure still identify the s largest components in absolute value in such scenarios?
References [1] (M.J. Wainwright), [2] (Fei Ye, Cun-Hui Zhang), and [3] (Sara van de Geer, Peter BÃ¼hlmann, and Shuheng Zhou) provide relevant background and comparative studies on sparsity recovery and variable selection.
In conclusion, while the paper tackles a significant problem, there is considerable room for improvement in the exposition and in situating the work within the broader context of research on two-step procedures for variable selection.
