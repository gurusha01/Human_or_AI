This manuscript presents a novel methodology for analyzing nonlinear correlation, comprising a three-stage process: (1) applying a copula transformation, (2) utilizing random nonlinear projection, and (3) employing Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA). The authors provide theoretical justifications for each stage, lending credibility to their approach. The efficacy of this methodology is demonstrated through experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets.
The paper is well-structured and exhibits a high degree of innovation. As noted by the authors, the computation of the RDC score is straightforward. The experimental results, particularly Figure 4, effectively illustrate the usefulness of the proposed approach. The manuscript is engaging and enjoyable to read. Although the calculation of nonlinear correlation may not be a central focus within the machine learning community, it serves as an intriguing foundation for more complex tasks, such as regression, as hinted at in one of the experiments. Therefore, I strongly advocate for the acceptance of this paper.
The approach outlined in this paper offers a fresh and compelling perspective on the metric of nonlinear correlation, characterized by a high level of novelty.
