This paper presents a novel approach to decomposing a matrix into a product of multiple sparse matrices in a hierarchical manner, with decreasing rank from lower to higher levels, referred to as multi-level sparse matrix factorization. A key advantage of this decomposition is the ability to apply different levels of regularization at various levels. 
Overall, the concept of multi-level sparse factorization is innovative and well-explained.
1) Calibration
The development of data-driven methods for calibration, as an alternative to relying on user-defined parameters, would be beneficial.
2) Optimization
It would be informative to provide an analysis of the convergence properties of the proposed learning algorithm, including aspects such as convergence rate and computational complexity. The method proposed is both interesting and novel.
