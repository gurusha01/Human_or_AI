This manuscript presents a novel approach to constructing hypothesis tests using kernel methods for detecting three-variable interactions, building upon the Hilbert Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) that traditionally identifies two-variable interactions. The authors focus on detecting Lancaster interactions, a specific type of three-variable interaction characterized by the signed measure δL = Pxyx - PxyPz - PxzPy - PyzPx - 2PxPyPz. The proposed methodology embeds the requisite marginal and joint probabilities into a kernel Hilbert space, ensuring its efficacy under the condition of Integral Strictly Positive Definiteness (ISPD). Simulation experiments utilize a permutation test with δL as the test statistic to demonstrate the method's capability in identifying three-way interactions.
A minor correction is noted: on page 8, the statement "Figure 2 plots the Type II error" should refer to "Figure 3" instead. The paper is well-structured, clearly written, and adequately supported by relevant references and proofs. As highlighted in the manuscript, potential extensions of this method to detect higher-order interactions and structured interactions would be particularly valuable.
