This manuscript presents a novel viewpoint on Bayesian posterior updates (BPU) by framing them as a system of iterated random functions (IRF) with a semigroup property. The authors achieve this by proving a comprehensive convergence theorem for IRF with semigroup property, which is then applied to analyze the convergence of algorithms designed for change point detection problems. The key contributions of this work include:
- Establishing a broad convergence theory for IRF with semigroup property, as outlined in Theorem 1,
- Demonstrating how existing algorithms for both the classical change point problem (CCPP) and the multiple change point problem (MCPP) can be cast within the IRF framework, with their convergence proven based on Theorem 1,
- Proposing a rapid approximate algorithm for MCPP and verifying its convergence, also grounded in Theorem 1.
Overall, I find this to be a significant and impactful paper. The analysis of BPU as a Markov chain naturally lends itself to examination within the IRF framework. However, previous convergence results for IRF are not directly applicable to BPU due to the lack of satisfaction of the Lipschitz condition. The authors circumvent this by leveraging the semigroup property of BPU to develop an alternative convergence theory. This established theory is anticipated to have a wide range of applications.
The strengths of the paper are:
- It offers a fresh perspective on BPU as a special case of IRF with semigroup property,
- It establishes a general convergence theory for IRF with semigroup property, which may have broad potential applications,
- It introduces a fast algorithm for MCPP, complete with convergence guarantees.
However, there are areas for improvement:
- The connection between the theoretical framework (Theorem 2) and the experimental results (Figure 1) is not clearly elucidated,
- The paper does not introduce any practical applications of multiple change point detection.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, with claims well-supported by theoretical underpinnings. The writing is clear, and the organization is logical. The novelty of the paper lies in its perspective on BPU as IRF with semigroup property and the derived convergence theorem. The significance of this work stems from its potential to provide a foundation for other theoreticians to analyze algorithms for various problems.
Additional comments include:
- Enhancing Figure 1 to reflect Eqs.(19) and (20) in the posterior path graphs would strengthen the support for Theorem 2,
- Incorporating practical examples of multiple change point detection would be beneficial, particularly in illustrating the applicability of the rule lambdae = min(lambdas1, lambda_s2),
- Minor corrections, such as addressing the bold-facing of certain thetas around Eq.(4) and clarifying the text in Line 225, would improve the manuscript's readability and accuracy.
In conclusion, this is a well-crafted paper that contributes a new perspective on Bayesian posterior updates as a system of iterated random functions with semigroup property, along with a general convergence theory that may have extensive applications.
