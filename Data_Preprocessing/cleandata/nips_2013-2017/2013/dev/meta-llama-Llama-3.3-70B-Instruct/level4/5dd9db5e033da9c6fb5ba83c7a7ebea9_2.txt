* Summary 
This manuscript proposes an algorithm for exact submodular minimization, leveraging the Douglas-Rachford splitting method to solve a related strongly convex function. The key contribution lies in constructing a dual problem that facilitates the application of Douglas-Rachford splitting.
* Details 
(Quality) The manuscript demonstrates technical strength but has two primary limitations. Firstly, although the experimental evaluation showcases the fast convergence of the proposed method compared to competing approaches, it lacks sufficient detail for reproducibility. Additionally, the MRF problem can be solved using graph cuts, for which online code is available. A comparison of the running time of the proposed method against graph cuts would be insightful, even considering the differences in implementation (e.g., Matlab vs. C, general method vs. specialized one). Furthermore, the authors should clarify why the parallel methods require more iterations to converge than the standard implementations in Figure 2.
Secondly, while the manuscript empirically demonstrates the proposed method's superiority over competing approaches, it fails to provide theoretical guarantees. Competing algorithms have established running times of O(1/t) or O(1/sqrt{t}), whereas the running time of the Douglas-Rachford approach remains unclear.
(Clarity) Overall, the manuscript is well-written and relatively easy to follow. However, two suggestions can enhance readability: 
1. The authors discuss a solution method via level sets on line 072, but the details are only revealed in section 2 (L150). Clarification around line 072 would be beneficial.
2. Defining y(A) = \sum{a \in A} ya around line 134 would improve understanding.
(Originality) The approach combines known techniques in an original manner.
(Significance) Given the prevalence of submodular functions in machine learning, a fast and general minimization algorithm is likely to have a significant impact. However, the current method's reliance on specialized techniques for projecting onto B(F_i) for each subproblem is a drawback. 
The manuscript presents a principled approach to minimizing decomposable submodular functions, which is generally well-described but could benefit from additional details to enhance its overall quality.
