This manuscript presents a theoretical examination of model selection in scenarios where the number of predictors (p) is large and the number of observations (n) is small. The authors introduce a generalized irrepresentability condition, which they utilize to investigate the properties of the GAUSS-LASSO selector. The GAUSS-LASSO selector is a method that first applies LASSO for variable selection and then performs least squares estimation on the selected variables, prioritizing them in the estimation process.
A key contribution of this work is the development of the generalized irrepresentability condition, which relaxes the requirements of the traditional irrepresentability condition. This innovation is motivated by an analysis of the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions for LASSO in the absence of noise. By applying this condition to the GAUSS-LASSO selector, the authors demonstrate the existence of a threshold for the regularization parameter. Below this threshold, the support of the LASSO estimator remains consistent and encompasses the support of the true model. Furthermore, the authors establish theoretical guarantees for LASSO in both deterministic and random design settings.
Notably, Theorem 2 indicates that, with high probability, the support of the signed support of the LASSO estimator coincides with that obtained in the noiseless scenario. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that the conditions outlined in Equations (13-14) may not always be satisfied, particularly in cases where the noise level is elevated, making it challenging to identify a suitable regularization parameter (lambda) or a value of c_1 greater than 1 that fulfills these conditions.
Minor suggestions for improvement include:
1. In Lemma 2.1, referencing Equation (16) would be more appropriate as Equation (5).
2. The notation v0 and T0, as discussed in Section 1.3, could be clarified. Although it appears to represent the restriction of v0 to the indices in T0, further explanation would enhance readability.
Upon considering the comments from other reviewers and the authors' response, the original assessment remains unchanged. This paper offers an intriguing theoretical exploration of model selection in high-dimensional, low-sample-size settings, introducing a generalized irrepresentability condition and its application to the GAUSS-LASSO selector.
