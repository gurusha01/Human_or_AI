This paper presents a notable expansion of kernel dependence tests to accommodate three-way interactions, addressing a significant challenge that currently has limited solutions. The work is both intriguing and skillfully executed. The overall quality of the writing is good.
A few minor suggestions for improvement:
The concept of V-structure should be elaborated upon at its initial introduction to enhance clarity.
A reference to V-statistics would be beneficial, as it may be less familiar to some readers, such as those acquainted with U-Statistics.
Equation (1) is unclear in its current form, necessitating a more precise definition of P^*. The explanatory phrase following the equation could be rephrased for better comprehension.
In the experimental section, providing details about the sample size would be helpful.
The extension of kernel dependence tests to three-way interactions is a valuable contribution, demonstrating a nice progression of the existing methodology.
