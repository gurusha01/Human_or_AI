This manuscript demonstrates that the collision probability following alpha-stable random projections can be approximated using functions of Chi-Square similarity, with a closed-form approximation achievable when alpha equals 1. This finding facilitates the approximation of Chi-Square related kernels using linear kernels after applying a sign Cauchy random projection.
However, the established bounds may not be tight, and the application section appears to be rushed and incomplete at present.
To enhance the paper, it could be refined into a more theoretically focused manuscript, with only suggestive hints towards potential applications, as the primary contribution lies in the theoretical aspects. Despite the potential looseness of the bounds and the current limitations of the application section, the paper remains intriguing and may still offer practical value or inspire the development of new techniques.
Upon reviewing the discussion, author response, and other reviews, my evaluation (score of 7) remains unchanged. I prioritize innovative, albeit unrefined, research over polished yet incremental work. I anticipate that the writing will be improved in the final version, should the paper be accepted.
The research presented is original, and the newly introduced bounds constitute a valuable addition to the existing literature and the scientific community.
