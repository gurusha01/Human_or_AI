This manuscript offers a novel perspective on Bayesian inference by framing it as a system of iterated random functions, with a specific emphasis on Bayesian changepoint detection. This perspective enables the analysis of convergence of message passing algorithms, a topic of broad interest. The authors present a general framework for convergence analysis, focusing on the technical details of the proof methodology.
The concept of Bayesian inference as iterated random functions is intriguing and likely to resonate with others. The derivation of algorithms with demonstrable geometric convergence is a notable aspect. To enhance the paper, a more in-depth discussion on the implications and insights of this theoretical framework for developing efficient algorithms would be beneficial. The focus on changepoint detection raises questions about its uniqueness and the potential for extending this approach to other model classes, where the underlying conditions are reasonably assumed to hold. 
The simulation section would benefit from clearer setup details, such as the location of changepoints and a more explicit connection between observed and theoretical convergence rates. Overall, the paper presents an interesting convergence analysis for message passing algorithms. However, its impact could be broadened by improving accessibility for readers unfamiliar with the specialized tools and contexts in which they are applied, thereby enhancing the paper's clarity and appeal to a wider audience.
