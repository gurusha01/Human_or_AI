Response to author feedback: 
I appreciate the authors' clarification on the novelty of the robust PCA approach, and I recommend that they also highlight this novelty prominently in the paper. Additionally, I suggest explicitly stating the potential for generalizing the approach to cases with multiple PCA components, even if a full proof is not feasible within the paper's scope. A simple acknowledgment in the Introduction that the current work focuses on the special case of one component, due to its inherent interest and positive empirical results, would be beneficial.
Summary: 
This paper proposes a robust variant of principal component regression (PCR) by utilizing multivariate Kendall's tau instead of the covariance matrix. The authors provide a straightforward algorithm for learning the model and conduct a theoretical analysis, including the convergence rate. The model's effectiveness is demonstrated through simulations and an application to equity data.
Quality: 
The presented method is relatively simple, involving the estimation of population Kendall's tau, computation of its first eigenvector, and subsequent linear regression. The approach is intuitive, making it preferable to classical PCR when dealing with outlier-prone data. The use of Kendall's tau in PCA is a valuable idea, justified by Oja's theorem. However, its novelty as a contribution is unclear, and the authors should clarify its relationship to existing works, such as the recent paper by Han and Liu in ICML'13.
The theoretical analysis of PCR's properties is a significant contribution. Nevertheless, it is limited to the special case where the outcome is related only to the first principal component. The authors should explicitly mention this limitation and consider generalizing their results to cases where the outcome is related to multiple components. The experiments are well-conducted and effectively illustrate the robust variant's advantages, providing sufficient support for a theoretical paper.
Clarity: 
The paper is reasonably well-written, given its theoretical focus. However, the scope and contributions could be more clearly defined. The novelty of using Kendall's tau for robust PCA is not explicitly stated, and the analysis is limited to a special case of PCR without clear acknowledgment. Some results are labeled as "well-known" without citations, which could be improved.
A notable issue is that the proofs for Theorems 3.2 and 3.3 are relegated to the Supplementary material without mention in the main paper. While space constraints are understandable, providing an outline of the proofs would enhance the paper's clarity.
Originality: 
The paper presents two novel aspects: a robust PCR technique and new theoretical analysis of PCR. The significance of the first novelty depends on whether the use of Kendall's tau in PCA is considered a new contribution. If not, the algorithm for robust PCR may be seen as straightforward. The theoretical analysis builds upon recent works by Oja, Vu and Lei, and Ravikumar et al., offering useful new results.
Significance: 
The robust method is clearly useful for PCR applications, especially given the theoretical analysis of its convergence rate. However, the significance might be limited by the reliance on a simple model where the output depends only on the first principal component. While the application to equity data demonstrates practical effectiveness, it is a single example. The method's broader impact could be enhanced by addressing more complex models.
Detailed comments: 
- The Abstract's second sentence is complex and attempts to cover all aspects of the paper at once; consider splitting it into multiple sentences for clarity.
- Page 3: The phrase "As a well-known result" requires a citation. In general, avoiding the term "well-known" in scientific writing is advisable, as it may not be obvious to all readers.
- Section 3.1: While reminding readers about elliptical distributions is helpful, listing all equivalent formulations may not be necessary if only one is used in the subsequent analysis.
The paper introduces a novel method for robust principal component regression and presents interesting theoretical results for PCR in general. The primary limitation is the restriction of the analysis to the simplest case of PCR, involving only one principal component.
