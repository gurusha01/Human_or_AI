This research examines two distinct algorithms designed for rapid inference in olfactory generative models, aiming to identify the most probable linear combination of odors in an olfactory stimulus. The approaches employed include variational inference and a sampling-based method. Simulation results indicate satisfactory performance for both algorithms, with the authors asserting that inference can be completed swiftly, typically within 100 ms, although eliminating false positives, particularly when dealing with more than two odors, proves more challenging and time-consuming. Given the fundamental differences between these inference schemes, it is suggested that experimental investigation could determine which approach the brain utilizes.
The manuscript is well-structured and explores an intriguing topic. The mathematical sections, although dense, are technically robust and grounded in realistic assumptions about the olfactory system's operational challenges.
However, a significant concern arises regarding the claim of achieving inference times comparable to those of the brain. This assertion relies on time constants introduced in equation 3.10, chosen to align with neural time constants. Nonetheless, the presence of nonlinear operations (such as logarithmic and exponential functions) on the right-hand side of these differential equations raises questions about the neural system's capability to perform these operations with the required precision within the specified time frames. Similar concerns apply to the sampling-based algorithm. While the authors acknowledge that a realistic neural implementation might decrease performance, it is believed that timing issues would be even more pronounced.
Another issue, somewhat unclear, pertains to the evaluation of these models against experimental data, especially if both are implemented as spike-based networks. The discussion lacks specificity regarding what measurements would be necessary to distinguish between the sampling and variational inference hypotheses.
In summary, while the manuscript is technically engaging, its suitability as an explanatory approach for olfaction in the brain remains questionable.
Minor comments include:
- Figure 1 could be improved by using a logarithmic vertical axis and adjusting its size to avoid stretching across the entire page.
- A typo is noted after Eq 3.11, where "auxillary" should be corrected.
- A period is incorrectly placed before Eq. 3.14 and should be removed.
- Before Eq. 3.17, "for each odour" should be corrected for spelling consistency.
An examination of two algorithms for fast inference in olfactory generative models is provided, presenting a sound and interesting analysis, although doubts persist regarding its explanatory potential for understanding olfaction.
