Upon examining the method, it appears to prioritize descriptions that rely heavily on spike count. To further demonstrate its effectiveness, it would be intriguing to investigate its performance in scenarios where higher-order dependencies beyond spike count are present. A comparative analysis with other methods, such as BUB, using spike-trains generated according to a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) would provide a more compelling argument for the method's accuracy.
Minor points:
line 163: a reference is missing
line 221: does \alpha=0 imply a uniform distribution?
line 296: "for" should be replaced with "form". The manuscript is well-written, and the feasibility of the approach is adequately demonstrated through the presented experiments.
