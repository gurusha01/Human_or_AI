This manuscript explores a scenario where multiple contextual linear bandits are interconnected through an underlying graph, assuming that the weight vectors of adjacent nodes are similar. This model appears to be well-suited for recommendation systems in social networks.
The proposed algorithm employs classical contextual linear bandits on each node, with the node being tried determined by nature, and then shares this information with neighboring nodes to update their model estimates and confidence widths using Laplacian regularization.
However, the provided regret analysis is underwhelming. The authors analyze a different algorithm than the one proposed and evaluated in the experiments, without providing a clear justification for this discrepancy. There is no discussion on how the differences between contextual bandits (CB) and transductive contextual bandits (TCB) impact the algorithm, its evaluation, and deployment. At the very least, the distinction between TCB and CB should be more thoroughly explained, beyond simply referencing existing work.
The current analysis also lacks clarity on the magnitude of terms such as ln|M_t| and 2L, and their behavior with respect to T and n, which is necessary to glean insight from the provided regret bound. Additionally, the influence of graph noise on these quantities is not explored.
Typically, analyses for linear bandits provide guidance on setting the exploration parameter α, but this is not the case here. The dependence of the upper bound on α is also unclear, and it is not apparent if it is embedded within other quantities.
In contrast, the experiments are well-executed and thoroughly described, with a high degree of reproducibility. The use of real data and detailed explanations of practical considerations is commendable.
One notable concern is the lack of a parameter to control the "lesser extent" and "somehow informatively" updates desired through the graph, as mentioned in the paper. Regularizing the Laplacian instead of using the identity matrix might be a more principled approach to achieving this regularization, as hinted at in the experimental section.
Other concerns include the use of L(u1,...un) in the regret bound instead of the regularized version, despite the Laplacian being regularized in the algorithm.
Ultimately, while this is a good work, the inclusion of theoretical analysis for a modified algorithm with an unclear relationship to the original makes the paper confusing. Removing the theoretical analysis would likely increase the overall score. The paper presents a promising extension of contextual bandits to a graph-based setting, with excellent experiments, but the analysis falls short and appears to be of limited utility.
