The manuscript addresses the challenging task of inferring neurons and their assemblies from calcium imaging data, proposing a novel "bilevel sparse heterarchical matrix factorization" approach. This method jointly infers neurons, represented by their pixel-correlates, and the assemblies they belong to, which can be multiple per neuron. More broadly, it decomposes an observation matrix into a product of sparse matrices with decreasing rank from lower to higher levels, allowing for the imposition of structured sparsity constraints at each level. Unlike previous work (Jenatton et al., 2012; Kim and Xing, 2012), this approach is not limited to hierarchical structures and does not require a priori knowledge of the exact number of assemblies, although the number of inferred assemblies depends on optimization parameters that need to be user-defined.
The methodology is demonstrated to be effective on synthetic data, where it:
(i) outperforms MNMMF (Cichocki and Zdunek, 2006) and KSVDS (Rubinstein et al., 2010) in recovering assembly assignments of neurons, with all methods initialized using Adina cell sorting (Diego et al., 2013);
(ii) detects calcium transients of single neurons with higher sensitivity than MNMMF, Adina, or cell sorting.
An example application to real experimental data (calcium imaging in rat hippocampus) is also provided, although the interpretation of the results is somewhat unclear, aside from the observation that neurons appear less spatially sparse than in the initial state derived from the Adina algorithm.
Throughout the manuscript, emphasis is placed on the parallel inference of structures at every level, including the dictionary, as well as the time courses at each level, which is purported to enhance the robust identification of neuronal time courses. However, the inferred dictionary, comprising images of single neurons, is not discussed in detail. The inclusion of images comparing the reconstructed dictionaries (e.g., supplementary Fig. 6) alongside ground truth and reconstructions from other methods would be more informative than the images of calcium recordings, where ground truth is unknown (Fig. 6).
Quality:
The paper is technically sound, providing a detailed description of the proposed cost function and optimization procedure, with additional details available in the Supplemental Material. While some aspects, such as the optimization of trade-off parameters, binarization of adjacency matrices, and sensitivity to noise levels, could be further elaborated, the article is generally well-presented.
Clarity:
The manuscript is clearly written, making it accessible to readers.
Originality:
To the best of my knowledge, the proposed approach is novel, and relevant literature is adequately referenced.
Significance:
The results have potential importance for laboratories conducting calcium imaging experiments on cell assemblies. The parallel optimization of assembly assignments and time courses at every level of interest improves the robustness of inference, making this method valuable for experiments assuming coherent activation of neurons within an assembly. The flexibility in imposing prior knowledge at any level of detail is an additional advantage, although it is notable that the method apparently requires initialization with a dictionary obtained from Adina. In principle, it should be possible to incorporate the same knowledge used by Adina at the initial level of inference.
Overall, this is an interesting, technically sound article with potential value for researchers working with structured data, such as calcium imaging of neural assemblies.
