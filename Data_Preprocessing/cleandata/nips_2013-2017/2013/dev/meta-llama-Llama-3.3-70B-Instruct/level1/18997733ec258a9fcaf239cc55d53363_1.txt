This paper introduces a novel algorithmic approach to solving networked bandit problems, which arise in various industrially relevant applications such as online advertisement and recommendation systems. The authors propose a global recommendation strategy, called GOB.Lin, which allocates a bandit algorithm to each network node and allows it to share signals with neighboring nodes. The algorithm is designed to leverage user similarities represented as a graph, and its performance is evaluated on synthetic and real-world datasets.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem and their approach. The related work section is thorough, and the authors adequately reference previous contributions in the field. The technical sections are well-organized, and the pseudocode for the GOB.Lin algorithm is easy to follow.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The authors propose a novel approach to solving networked bandit problems, which has the potential to improve the performance of recommendation systems.
* The algorithm is well-motivated, and the authors provide a clear explanation of how it works.
* The experimental evaluation is thorough, and the authors compare their approach to state-of-the-art methods.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The algorithm has a quadratic dependence on the number of nodes, which may limit its scalability.
* The authors assume that the graph structure is known, which may not always be the case in practice.
* The experimental evaluation could be more comprehensive, with more datasets and baselines.
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel approach to solving networked bandit problems, which is a significant contribution to the field.
