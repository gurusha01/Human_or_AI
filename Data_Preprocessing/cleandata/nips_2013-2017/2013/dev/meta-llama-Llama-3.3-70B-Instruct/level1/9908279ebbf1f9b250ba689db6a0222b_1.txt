This paper presents a comprehensive study on principal component regression (PCR) and its application to high-dimensional non-Gaussian data. The authors make two significant contributions: (1) they characterize the advantage of classical PCR over least square estimation in low dimensions under the Gaussian model, and (2) they propose a robust sparse PCR method for high-dimensional elliptically distributed data.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the background and motivation of the research. The technical sections are also well-organized, and the authors provide detailed proofs and derivations of their results.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The authors provide a thorough analysis of the classical PCR method and its advantages over least square estimation in low dimensions.
* The proposed robust sparse PCR method is novel and has the potential to handle high-dimensional complex data.
* The authors provide extensive numerical experiments on both synthetic and real-world data to demonstrate the effectiveness of their method.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes that the data follows an elliptical distribution, which may not be realistic in all scenarios.
* The authors do not provide a detailed comparison with other existing methods for high-dimensional regression, such as lasso or ridge regression.
* Some of the technical proofs and derivations are lengthy and may be difficult to follow for non-experts.
Overall, I would rate this paper as a strong accept. The authors have made significant contributions to the field of PCR, and their proposed method has the potential to be widely applicable. However, I would suggest that the authors provide more detailed comparisons with other existing methods and consider more realistic scenarios in their numerical experiments.

Quality: 8/10
Clarity: 9/10
Originality: 9/10
Significance: 9/10
Recommendation: Accept with minor revisions. The authors should provide more detailed comparisons with other existing methods and consider more realistic scenarios in their numerical experiments. Additionally, they should consider simplifying some of the technical proofs and derivations to make the paper more accessible to non-experts.
