This paper proposes a method of sign stable random projections, which uses only the signs of the projected data to efficiently approximate the lα distance (0 < α ≤ 2) in high dimension. The authors analyze the probability of collision (i.e., when the two signs differ) and show that when α = 1 (i.e., Cauchy random projections), the probability of collision can be accurately approximated as a function of the chi-square (χ) similarity. The authors also provide experimental results to validate their proposed method, which demonstrate its effectiveness in large-scale learning applications.
The paper is well-written and clearly explains the main ideas and contributions. The authors provide a thorough review of previous work on stable random projections and chi-square similarity, and they clearly motivate the need for their proposed method. The technical contributions of the paper are sound, and the authors provide a detailed analysis of the probability of collision and its relationship to the chi-square similarity.
The strengths of the paper include its clear and concise writing style, its thorough review of previous work, and its sound technical contributions. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the advantages and limitations of their proposed method, which demonstrates their understanding of the topic.
The weaknesses of the paper include the fact that some of the experimental results are based on small datasets, which may not be representative of larger-scale applications. Additionally, the authors could provide more discussion on the potential applications of their proposed method in different fields, such as computer vision and natural language processing.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication. The paper makes a significant contribution to the field of machine learning and provides a thorough analysis of the proposed method. The authors demonstrate a clear understanding of the topic and provide a well-written and well-organized paper.
