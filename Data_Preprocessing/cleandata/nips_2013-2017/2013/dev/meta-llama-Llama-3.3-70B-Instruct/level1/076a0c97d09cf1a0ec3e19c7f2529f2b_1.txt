This paper introduces a novel nonparametric test for three-variable interactions, specifically the Lancaster interaction and total independence, using kernel embeddings of signed measures into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). The test statistics are straightforward to compute and are consistent against all alternatives for a large family of reproducing kernels. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of the Lancaster test in detecting cases where two independent causes individually have weak influence on a third dependent variable, but their combined effect has a strong influence, making it particularly suited for finding structure in directed graphical models.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem of nonparametric testing of interaction between variables. They also provide a thorough review of previous work in this area, including the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) and Distance Covariance. The technical sections of the paper are rigorous and well-explained, with clear definitions and derivations of the test statistics.
The experiments section provides a thorough evaluation of the proposed tests on two synthetic datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the Lancaster statistic in detecting three-variable interactions. The results show that the Lancaster statistic outperforms competing approaches, including the total independence statistic and two-variable based tests, in detecting interactions as dimensionality increases.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The introduction of a novel nonparametric test for three-variable interactions, which addresses a significant gap in the existing literature.
* The use of kernel embeddings of signed measures into an RKHS, which provides a flexible and powerful framework for testing interactions.
* The thorough evaluation of the proposed tests on synthetic datasets, which demonstrates their effectiveness in detecting interactions.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The computational cost of detecting interactions of higher order, which requires summing over all partitions and can be prohibitive for large datasets.
* The limited generalizability of the Lancaster interaction test to more than three dimensions, due to the combinatorial nature of joint cumulants.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper introduces a novel and significant contribution to the field of nonparametric testing of interaction between variables.
* The technical sections of the paper are rigorous and well-explained, with clear definitions and derivations of the test statistics.
* The experiments section provides a thorough evaluation of the proposed tests, demonstrating their effectiveness in detecting interactions.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The computational cost of detecting interactions of higher order may limit the applicability of the proposed tests to large datasets.
* The limited generalizability of the Lancaster interaction test to more than three dimensions may limit its usefulness in certain applications.
Overall, I recommend accepting the paper, as it provides a significant contribution to the field of nonparametric testing of interaction between variables, and the strengths of the paper outweigh its weaknesses.
