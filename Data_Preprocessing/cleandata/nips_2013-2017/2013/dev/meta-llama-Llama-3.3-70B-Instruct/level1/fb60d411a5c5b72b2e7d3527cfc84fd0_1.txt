This paper presents a novel sequence of intermediate distributions for exponential families, defined by averaging the moments of the initial and target distributions, to improve the performance of annealed importance sampling (AIS) in estimating partition functions. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the asymptotic performance of both the geometric and moment averages paths and derive an asymptotically optimal piecewise linear schedule.
The paper is well-written, and the authors demonstrate a clear understanding of the underlying concepts and related work. The introduction provides a good overview of the problem and the motivation behind the proposed approach. The technical sections are detailed and well-organized, making it easy to follow the authors' reasoning.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel path for exponential families, which is shown to perform well empirically in estimating partition functions of restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs).
* A thorough analysis of the asymptotic performance of both the geometric and moment averages paths, including the derivation of an asymptotically optimal piecewise linear schedule.
* The provision of a variational interpretation of the moment averages path, which helps to understand its behavior and advantages over the geometric averages path.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The assumption of perfect transitions, which may not always hold in practice, and the lack of a thorough analysis of the impact of imperfect transitions on the performance of the proposed approach.
* The limited experimental evaluation, which focuses primarily on RBMs and may not be representative of other types of models or datasets.
* The lack of a direct comparison with other state-of-the-art methods for estimating partition functions, which makes it difficult to assess the relative performance of the proposed approach.
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The paper presents a novel and well-motivated approach to improving the performance of AIS in estimating partition functions.
* The analysis is thorough and well-organized, and the authors provide a clear understanding of the underlying concepts and related work.
* The experimental results are promising and demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach in estimating partition functions of RBMs.
Arguments con acceptance:
* The assumption of perfect transitions may not always hold in practice, and the lack of a thorough analysis of the impact of imperfect transitions on the performance of the proposed approach is a limitation.
* The experimental evaluation is limited, and a more comprehensive comparison with other state-of-the-art methods is needed to assess the relative performance of the proposed approach.
* The paper may benefit from additional discussions on the potential applications and extensions of the proposed approach, as well as the potential challenges and limitations that may arise in practice.
Overall, the paper presents a well-motivated and well-analyzed approach to improving the performance of AIS in estimating partition functions. While there are some limitations and areas for improvement, the paper demonstrates a clear understanding of the underlying concepts and related work, and the experimental results are promising. With some revisions to address the limitations and provide a more comprehensive evaluation, the paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field.
