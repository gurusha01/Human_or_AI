This paper studies the exploration problem in Multi-Armed Bandits (MAB) in a distributed setting, where multiple players collaborate to identify an ε-optimal arm. The authors investigate the tradeoff between the number of arm pulls required by each player and the amount of communication between them. The main result shows that by allowing the players to communicate only once, they can learn √k times faster than a single player, achieving a factor √k parallel speedup. The authors also provide a lower bound, demonstrating that this speedup is essentially optimal.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem and their results. The technical sections are also well-organized, and the proofs are thorough and easy to follow. The authors provide a detailed analysis of their algorithms and provide bounds on the number of arm pulls and communication rounds required.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The authors provide a novel and interesting problem setting, which is relevant to many real-world applications.
* The main result is significant, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of their algorithm and its performance.
* The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem and their results.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The problem setting is somewhat restrictive, as it assumes that the players can communicate only once. It would be interesting to see how the results generalize to more complex communication models.
* The authors do not provide a direct comparison with existing algorithms, which makes it difficult to assess the significance of their results.
* Some of the technical sections are quite dense, and it may be challenging for non-experts to follow the proofs and analysis.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, as it provides a significant contribution to the field of MAB and distributed learning. The authors provide a thorough analysis of their algorithm and its performance, and the results are interesting and relevant to many real-world applications.
