This paper presents two approximate inference algorithms for the olfactory system to determine the presence of odors based on the activation of receptor neurons. The authors derive neural implementations of a variational algorithm and a sampling-based algorithm, using a more realistic "spike and slab" prior distribution over odors. They map these algorithms onto neural dynamics and simulate them, finding that both can infer correct odors in less than 100 ms. The paper relates to previous work at NIPS and elsewhere, building on the work of Beck et al. (2012) and others.
The strengths of the paper include its clear and well-organized presentation, making it easy to follow and understand the authors' arguments. The use of a more realistic prior distribution and the derivation of neural implementations of the algorithms are significant contributions. The simulations provide valuable insights into the performance of the algorithms, and the discussion of the results is thorough and well-supported.
However, there are some weaknesses to consider. The authors assume a simple generative model, which may not capture the full complexity of the olfactory system. The algorithms require the implementation of relatively complicated nonlinearities, which may be challenging to realize in a biological system. Additionally, the paper focuses solely on inference, assuming that the network has already learned the mapping from odors to odorant receptor neurons and the priors.
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The paper presents a clear and well-organized argument, making it easy to follow and understand the authors' contributions.
* The use of a more realistic prior distribution and the derivation of neural implementations of the algorithms are significant contributions to the field.
* The simulations provide valuable insights into the performance of the algorithms, and the discussion of the results is thorough and well-supported.
Arguments con acceptance:
* The authors assume a simple generative model, which may not capture the full complexity of the olfactory system.
* The algorithms require the implementation of relatively complicated nonlinearities, which may be challenging to realize in a biological system.
* The paper focuses solely on inference, assuming that the network has already learned the mapping from odors to odorant receptor neurons and the priors, which may not be realistic.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and thorough presentation of their work. While there are some weaknesses to consider, the strengths of the paper outweigh them, making it a valuable contribution to the field. I would recommend acceptance, with some revisions to address the weaknesses mentioned above. 
In terms of the four criteria, I would evaluate the paper as follows:
* Quality: 8/10 (the paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and thorough presentation of their work, but there are some weaknesses in the assumptions and the simplicity of the generative model).
* Clarity: 9/10 (the paper is easy to follow, and the authors provide a clear and well-organized presentation of their arguments).
* Originality: 8/10 (the paper presents a new and interesting approach to the problem of odor inference, but builds on previous work in the field).
* Significance: 8/10 (the paper provides valuable insights into the performance of the algorithms and the neural implementation of inference in the olfactory system, but may not have a significant impact on the field as a whole).
