This paper proposes a novel approach to submodular function minimization by exploiting the equivalence between the discrete problem and a continuous best approximation problem. The authors introduce a proximal problem that is easier to solve and provides a more user-friendly tool for solving the original discrete problem. They also propose several algorithms, including dual block-coordinate descent, Douglas-Rachford splitting, and accelerated projected gradient, to solve the proximal problem. The paper provides a thorough review of relevant results from submodular analysis and discusses the relationships between the discrete and proximal problems.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel approach to submodular function minimization that avoids the need for cumbersome parameter tuning and is easy to implement and parallelize.
* The introduction of a proximal problem that provides a more user-friendly tool for solving the original discrete problem.
* The proposal of several algorithms to solve the proximal problem, including dual block-coordinate descent, Douglas-Rachford splitting, and accelerated projected gradient.
* The provision of a thorough review of relevant results from submodular analysis and the discussion of the relationships between the discrete and proximal problems.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes that the submodular function can be decomposed into a sum of "simple" functions, which may not always be the case.
* The paper does not provide a thorough comparison with existing methods for submodular function minimization, such as the minimum-norm-point algorithm and the Fujishige-Wolfe algorithm.
* The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed algorithms.
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel approach to submodular function minimization that has the potential to be more efficient and easier to implement than existing methods.
