This paper proposes a general formalism of iterated random functions with semigroup property, which encompasses exact and approximate Bayesian posterior updates as specific instances. The authors develop a convergence theory for these iterated random functions and apply it to analyze the convergence behavior of exact and approximate message-passing algorithms in a sequential change point detection problem formulated via a latent variable directed graphical model.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of their proposed framework and its application to the change point detection problem. The theoretical results are supported by simulations, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approximate message-passing algorithm.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a general formalism that unifies exact and approximate Bayesian posterior updates, which can be applied to various inference problems.
* The development of a convergence theory for iterated random functions, which provides a framework for analyzing the behavior of these algorithms.
* The application of the proposed framework to a specific problem, namely change point detection, which demonstrates the practical relevance of the theory.
* The provision of simulation results, which support the theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes a certain level of familiarity with graphical models and message-passing algorithms, which may make it difficult for readers without this background to follow.
* The theoretical results are based on certain assumptions, such as the sub-Gaussianity of the log-likelihood ratios, which may not always hold in practice.
* The simulation results are limited to a specific example, and it would be useful to see more extensive simulations to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed algorithm.
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of Bayesian inference and change point detection, and the proposed framework has the potential to be applied to a wide range of problems. The authors have provided a clear and detailed explanation of their work, and the simulation results support the theoretical findings.
