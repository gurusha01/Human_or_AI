This paper proposes a new method, called the Gauss-Lasso selector, for model selection in high-dimensional linear regression. The method is a two-stage procedure that first uses the Lasso to estimate a model, and then performs ordinary least squares regression on the estimated model. The authors prove that the Gauss-Lasso selector correctly recovers the support of the true model under a condition called the generalized irrepresentability condition (GIC), which is weaker than the standard irrepresentability condition required by the Lasso.
The paper is well-written and provides a clear explanation of the proposed method and its theoretical guarantees. The authors also provide a detailed comparison with existing methods and show that the Gauss-Lasso selector has better performance in certain scenarios.
The strengths of the paper are:
* The proposed method is simple and easy to implement, and has a clear theoretical justification.
* The authors provide a detailed analysis of the method's performance and compare it with existing methods.
* The paper addresses an important problem in high-dimensional statistics and provides a new perspective on model selection.
The weaknesses of the paper are:
* The theoretical guarantees provided by the authors are based on certain assumptions about the data, such as the generalized irrepresentability condition, which may not always hold in practice.
* The authors do not provide extensive numerical experiments to demonstrate the performance of the Gauss-Lasso selector in practice.
* Some of the technical proofs and derivations are relegated to a longer version of the paper, which may make it difficult for readers to fully understand the details of the method.
Overall, I believe that the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of high-dimensional statistics and provides a new and interesting approach to model selection. The authors have done a good job of motivating the problem, proposing a new method, and providing a theoretical analysis of its performance.

Quality: 8/10
Clarity: 9/10
Originality: 8/10
Significance: 9/10
Overall score: 8.5/10
I recommend accepting the paper, but suggest that the authors provide more numerical experiments to demonstrate the performance of the Gauss-Lasso selector in practice, and make the technical proofs and derivations more accessible to readers.
