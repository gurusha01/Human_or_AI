This paper introduces the Randomized Dependence Coefficient (RDC), a novel measure of nonlinear dependence between random variables of arbitrary dimension. The RDC is based on the Hirschfeld-Gebelein-Rényi Maximum Correlation Coefficient and is defined in terms of correlation of random non-linear copula projections. The authors demonstrate that RDC is invariant with respect to marginal distribution transformations, has low computational cost, and is easy to implement.
The paper is well-written and clearly organized, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments. The introduction provides a thorough review of existing measures of dependence, highlighting their limitations and motivating the need for a new approach. The authors also provide a detailed explanation of the RDC, including its definition, properties, and relationship to other estimators.
The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of RDC in measuring nonlinear dependence, particularly in comparison to other state-of-the-art methods. The authors show that RDC is resistant to additive noise, has a low computational cost, and performs well in feature selection tasks on real-world datasets.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The introduction of a novel measure of nonlinear dependence that addresses the limitations of existing methods
* A thorough theoretical analysis of the RDC, including its properties and relationship to other estimators
* A comprehensive experimental evaluation of the RDC, demonstrating its effectiveness in various scenarios
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The choice of non-linearities φ : R → R is a critical assumption in RDC, and the authors could provide more guidance on how to select this function in practice
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the computational complexity of RDC, particularly in comparison to other methods
* Some of the experimental results, such as the feature selection tasks, could be more thoroughly evaluated and discussed
Arguments pro acceptance:
