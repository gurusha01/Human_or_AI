This paper proposes a biologically inspired mechanism for artificial neural networks based on local competition, which relies on local winner-take-all (LWTA) behavior. The authors demonstrate the benefits of LWTA across various networks and pattern recognition tasks, showing that it enables performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while preventing catastrophic forgetting. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the concept of local competition in biological neural networks.
The strengths of the paper include its novelty, as it introduces a new mechanism for artificial neural networks inspired by biological neural circuits. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the benefits of LWTA, including its ability to prevent catastrophic forgetting and its potential for continual learning. The experimental results are also impressive, demonstrating the effectiveness of LWTA networks on various tasks, including digit recognition and sentiment analysis.
However, there are some weaknesses to the paper. One potential concern is that the authors do not provide a detailed analysis of the computational costs associated with LWTA networks. Additionally, the authors could have explored more extensively the relationship between LWTA and other related methods, such as max-pooling and dropout.
In terms of the criteria described in the Qualitative Evaluation section, the paper scores well on originality, as it introduces a new mechanism for artificial neural networks. The paper also scores well on significance, as it demonstrates the potential of LWTA networks for continual learning and preventing catastrophic forgetting. However, the paper could be improved in terms of clarity, as some of the sections are dense and difficult to follow.
