This paper presents several applications of Optimistic Mirror Descent, an online learning algorithm that leverages predictable sequences to improve performance. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in various domains, including offline optimization, structured optimization, zero-sum games, and convex programming.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the concept of predictable sequences and their application in online learning. The technical sections are thorough and well-organized, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments. The results are impressive, and the authors provide a detailed analysis of the algorithm's performance in different settings.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to unify various concepts and techniques from online learning, optimization, and game theory. The authors show how the Optimistic Mirror Descent algorithm can be used to recover existing results, such as the Mirror Prox algorithm, and how it can be applied to new problems, such as zero-sum games with partial information.
The paper also raises several interesting questions and directions for future research. For example, the authors mention that the notion of predictable sequences can be used to derive adaptive optimization procedures that can provide rapid convergence in practice. They also suggest that techniques from bundle methods can be used to further restrict the set of possible gradients and improve the algorithm's performance.
In terms of the review criteria, I would rate the paper as follows:
* Quality: 9/10 (the paper is well-written, and the technical sections are thorough and well-organized)
