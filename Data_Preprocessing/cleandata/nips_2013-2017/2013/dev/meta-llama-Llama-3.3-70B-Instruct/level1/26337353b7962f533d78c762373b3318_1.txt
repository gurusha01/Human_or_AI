This paper proposes a novel approach to unsupervised learning, called sparse heterarchical matrix factorization (SHMF), which is particularly suited for applications with a natural hierarchy of concepts. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on calcium imaging data, where they aim to identify neurons, their assemblies, and the temporal evolution of both. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear overview of the related work, the proposed method, and the experimental results.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel and principled approach to multi-level decomposition, which allows for both hierarchical and heterarchical relations between concepts.
* The ability to learn the nature of these relations rather than imposing them, which is a significant improvement over previous work.
* The development of an optimization scheme that allows for joint optimization over all levels, rather than a greedy level-by-level approach.
* The demonstration of the effectiveness of the proposed approach on both synthetic and real-world calcium imaging data.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The complexity of the proposed approach, which may make it difficult to understand and implement for readers without a strong background in matrix factorization and optimization.
* The lack of a clear comparison to other state-of-the-art methods, which makes it difficult to assess the significance of the results.
* The limited evaluation of the proposed approach, which is mainly focused on calcium imaging data, and may not be generalizable to other applications.
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel and principled approach to multi-level decomposition, which has the potential to be widely applicable.
* The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on a challenging real-world problem, which is a significant contribution to the field.
* The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear overview of the related work, the proposed method, and the experimental results.
Arguments con acceptance:

Overall, I believe that the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of unsupervised learning, and the proposed approach has the potential to be widely applicable. However, the authors could improve the paper by providing a clearer comparison to other state-of-the-art methods, and by evaluating the proposed approach on a wider range of applications.
