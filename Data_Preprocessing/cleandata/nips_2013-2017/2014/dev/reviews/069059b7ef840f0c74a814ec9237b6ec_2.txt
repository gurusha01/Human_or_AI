This paper presents clustering framework using pairwise similarity function model.
Different data partitions are used to construct different nonparametric classifiers.
The optimal clustering is obtained by minimizing the generalization error of the 
learned classifiers related to data partitions.
The authors consider two nonparametric classifiers in their framework:
the plug-in and the nearest-neighbor classifier. 
The authors prove also a result interesting in itself, namely that the generalization
error bound for the unsupervised plug-in clustering is asymptotically equal to the
weighted volume of cluster boundary for Low Density Separation. 
This paper tights together two important machine learning subjects: multi-class 
classification problem and clustering. Furthermore, it has strong theoretical background.
The paper is however very poorely written.
The introduction is well-organized however in the next sections the authors
go into several technical details and do not summarize their results in the 
compact understandable form. Two technical lemmas given in Section 2 only deepen
the confusion. Thus, it is extremely difficult to measure the real impact of this paper.
Section 2 contains too many technical details that are given before giving the reader any sort of intuition. 
Besides the presented lemma statements are completely unclear. 
For instance:
Lemma 1:
 - is it possible to say how n{0} depends on \sigma{0} and VC characteristics of K ?
 - the statements seems not to be put in the grammatical form, the authors should review it
Lemma 2:
 - again the authors introduce many parameters that mutually depend on each other,
 it is almost impossible to guess from all the asusmptions required by the lemma what it 
 says in fact
Lemma 3:
 - similar problems to those mentioned above
Lemma statements are unreadable and some of them are put at the very beginning of the paper.
The authors should spend much more time to work on the presentation of their results.
Maybe some summary of the obtained theoretical results should be conducted before giving exact statements.
The authors should also give some intuition regarding all lemmas presented in the main body of the paper.
The authors present how their techniques may be applied to the exemplar-based clustering but the comparison
with existing state-of-the-art methods is missing. The experimental section is very tiny and does not shed 
any light of advantages of the technique developed by the authors over other clustering algorithms.
The difficulty of the clustering heavily depends on the considered setting: whether data is truly high-dimensional,
or maybe lies on the small-dimensional manifolds, whether data points are sparse or dense, 
whether the groundtruth clusters are convex or there are no
assumptions about their shape, what is the objective function the authors aim to minimize or the groundtruth
clustering they want to approximate well. Without detailed analysis of the performance of the algorithm in the specific
setting defined by these parameters it is almost impossible to say whether the presented method can be applied in 
practice and solves a nontrivial problem.
What is the computational complexity of the algorithms that use presented technique ? This issue is not addressed at all.
Is it possible to extend the analysis for other classifiers (only nearest-neighbor and plug-in classifiers were analyzed) ? 
Is it possible to release some source code files (with the implementation of the presented method) that were used by 
the authors to test their approach ? (The last remark is not crucial though.)
 To sum it up, this paper focuses on the very important machine learning problem and is somehow innovative (presentsnew ideas that according to what authors say: "bridge the gap between clustering and the multilabel classification"; tosome extend I do agree with aurhors' statement). However it seems to me that the authors do not spend much time onpreparing a readable version of the paper. The presentation is chaotic, it is very hard to understand what are the maintheoretical results of the paper. The experimental section is incomplete. No comparison with currently existing methods is conducted.I would suggetst the authors to spend much more time on completely reorganizing the paper according to the points I mentioned above.In particular, sections: 2 and 3 should be completely rewritten.
