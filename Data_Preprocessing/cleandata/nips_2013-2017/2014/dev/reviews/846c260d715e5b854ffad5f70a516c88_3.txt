The paper developed spectral algorithms for the models of [18] and [24]
by developing general theory for the IBP and applying it. Algorithm 1
is a precise description of the approach. Very impressive.
Theorem 3, a challenging result, doesn't really imply anything in
practice, other that "eventually it works", so experimentation is
really needed. Can you say anything about the nature of the
polynomial?
The experimental work looks at some toy data from [18]
and then considers one gene expression data problem.
The experimental work is thus suggestive but not 
convincing in any way. More comparisons are needed.
Now it seems your experimental work is on par with the
standards of the original papers, such as [24]. Their experimental
work is "illustrative" since they have a new model.
Your experimental work needs to be more thorough in showing the
comparison with the original. You work on a few toy
examples. The interesting result, Fig. 4 is not done for MCMC.
Was it able to cope with the size? Perhaps not.
As an example, consider Reed and Ghahramani ICML 2013. 
They give a variety of algorithms compared on
realistic looking data sets, including an analysis
of computational complexity.
Regarding introductory statement:
"the issue of spectral inference in Dirichlet Processes is largely settled [6,7]"
This statement is completely unsupported by the references cited.
Equations (2) and (3): you mean IBP(\alpha) ?
 Impressive spectral algorithm with a convergence result looks good, but the experimentalcomparison is on toy data, whereas the standard for comparisons for new algorithmsis set by Reed and Ghahramani 2013 ICML. Better experimental work needed since thetheory is very vague on performance.
