The authors present a theoretical model of neural population dynamics. Under their model, a noise-driven linear dynamical system is designed to sample a given distribution via hamiltonian monte carlo (following the work of (Boerlin et al, 2011)). At each timestep, the state of this system dictates the membrane potential of a population of neurons, by linear projection. The authors show in simulation that their model reproduces summary statistics characteristic of neural populations (in toy examples), and consider the model's implications upon neural variability and decoding. 
The paper is generally well-written and has a high standard of presentation. The discussion is a bit dense at times, and I believe it could benefit from clearer statements of methods at times (in particular: how exactly was the method of (Boerlin et al, 2011) modified? Also: Was the decoding matrix learned in the simulations? What were the time constants?). 
The form of the model (low dimensional dynamics projected linearly to modulate population response) is related to recent work oriented more toward statistical modeling and data analysis (for instance (Pfau et al, 2013), (Turaga et al, 2013), (Yu et al, 2009), (Ecker et al, 2014)). Some of the points of the paper (for instance, the statistical gains of redundancy implicit in projecting low-dimensional dynamics into a high-dimensional population, the importance of population-level modeling) appear as motivation in some of this literature.The success of such statistical models renders this more theoretical & "biophysically plausible" approach more timely, but also makes me wish that real data were shown in the paper.
Overall, I think the approach is interesting and, and the simulated experiments do show compelling/interesting features. However, I find it difficult to extrapolate from the toy examples shown to larger-scale models of population activity. The authors present a sampling-based model of latent, low-dimensional population dynamics, and show that it broadly matches the characteristics of a neural population in a simplified example. Though polished and well-written, the paper suffers somewhat from an absence of real neural data and the "toy" nature of simulations.
