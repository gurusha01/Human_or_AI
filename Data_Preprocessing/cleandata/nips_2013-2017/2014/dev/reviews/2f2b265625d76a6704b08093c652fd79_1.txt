Summary:
The authors present a continuous attractor neural model which implements (anticipative) tracking. The authors show that spike frequency adaptation (SFA) can induce traveling waves under certain conditions. Interestingly, they show that the effects induced by SFA are similar to those that can be obtained by introducing asymmetric coupling between neurons as in [14], with the advantage that this method does not depend on hard-wired connections. The bulk of the paper is a theoretical analysis of a simplified model and simulations with the complete model for verification. The model can sustain traveling waves and reproduces both perfect tracking and anticipatory tracking. 
Comments to the authors:
The paper is well written and interesting - especially the link between the model of [14] and the demonstration that SFA reproduces a similar effect. 
I am not an expert in this field, so I find it hard to judge how novel this work is - for instance, you refer to [12], saying that it was already known that a continuous attractor network with SFA can exhibit traveling waves, but in the abstract you state that you propose the SFA mechanism to implement tracking. I think it would be good to clearly delineate what your new contributions are in the introduction.
Are the time constants used in the model (e.g. at figure 2B) realistic? Could you comment on this? A factor 60 difference between \tau and \tau_v seems large to me.
How well does the model reproduce experimental results? Such comparison would make the paper more interesting.
Minor issues:
l. 53. unpredictable flash: I don't think this has to do with the predictability of the flash - it can flash at regular intervals. The point is that the flashing stimulus does not move. 
l. 53-55. Despite ...; rephrase -> e.g., Although it is clear that the brain ..., it remains unclear ... .

throughout the Ms.: holding a traveling wave -> contains a traveling wave / can exhibit traveling waves? The paper is well written and seems interesting, although I find it hard to judge the novelty of the work. A comparison with experimental data would make the paper more interesting and relevant.
