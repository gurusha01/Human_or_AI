The paper describes how a sampling approach for representing probability distributions with spiking neurons can be sped up using linear probabilistic population codes (PPCs). The paper first describes how a suitable choice of integrate and fire model can sample from a target distributions via a linear mapping of spikes. Then, it is argued that any product of exponentials distribution can fit within the dynamics of a PPC, and hence can be sampled akin to multi-chain MCMC. The main conclusion is that a single population of K neurons can thus sample K chains, in contrast to requiring K networks to sample K chains. 
Most of the remainder of the paper is used to determine the neural implications of such scheme for encoding probability distributions, in terms of measures often used in neuroscience. 
While the results are interesting, I find the paper unbalanced with respect to the NIPS audience: the PPC methods is described very briefly, and effectively only illustrated in figure 1f ever so briefly. The focus on neural implications (p5,p6 and p7) seems both too much and somewhat arbitrary: it demonstrates that the proposed encoding scheme with the particular chosen network topology is not incompatible with observations. In my opinion, the paper would have benefited from a more elaborate exposition of the results in section 1, including more elaborate demonstrations/graphs of the method. 
I also have the concern that when reading correctly in the PPC paper by Ma et al (2006), there is no limitation in their PPC model that prevents multiple neurons from (similarly) independently computing posterior Gaussian distributions. I believe the distinction in the presented model comes from the particular use of spike-coding rather than rate-coding in the Ma et al paper. This is perhaps a point that should be elaborated more. 
I will add that a number of papers on this topic (e.g. [6]) suffer from the same defect, where the technical details are very hard to extract from the paper (like the coding scheme in [6] as used in equation (1)); to my personal relief, other esteemed NIPS colleagues volunteered the same opinion unprompted. 
Minor question: firing rates in figure 2a are very high for many biological neurons. To what degree does the scheme require such high firing rates?
Typo's:
p3 l142 each neurons -> each neuron
p3 l153 we can encoding -> we can encode
p3 l160 Q: shouldnt "x" be "y" in the equation (from line 159)?
p4 l188 the s sampling
p8 l386 in central question -> is a central question Interesting approach that has a clear place at NIPS. However, the presentation is unbalanced and the computational contribution (sec 1) deserves more prominence and elaboration.
