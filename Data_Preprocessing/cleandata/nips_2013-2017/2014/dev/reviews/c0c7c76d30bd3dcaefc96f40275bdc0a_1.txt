The paper presents a novel approach for column sampling when the data point clusters comprise of non-convex hulls. Column sampling is important in selecting a small subset of data that represents the properties of the original dataset. The presented approach is based upon the computation of Zeta hulls. The authors model the graph cycles by means of the sum-product rule and integrate them using the Zeta function. The authors set up the optimization problem as finding the subset of points with the strongest point extremenesses. The authors also present a scalable algorithm to solve the problem using the anchor graph method which allows the original weighted graph to be reconstructed from a small set of anchors. The authors then perform a low rank approximation of the anchor graph for scalability purpose. The paper also analyzes the time and space complexity. 
The authors evaluate their methodology on synthetic as well as real data from text and image classification. They use several state of the art baseline methods to compare the performance of their model. Their results show that their method outperforms the baseline methods.  The paper provides a novel approach to perform column sampling using Zeta hull pursuits. The authors show promising performance improvements using several baseline methods on real data.
