This paper introduces a scene-centric database called PLACES with more than 6 million of labeled pictures for scene recognition. The purpose of building such a database is to complement to ImageNet which is an object-centric database, and improve the performance of scene recognition by learning deep features using PLACES. The database was built by scraping search engines with composite queries and utilizing Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) for validation. To compare the density and diversity of PLACES with existing databases such as SUN and ImageNet, the authors proposed two metrics and again utilized AMT to get the measures and show the advantages of PLACES. The authors also compared the features learned from PLACES and from ImageNet, and showed the two databases are complementary to each other. In particular, PLACES can result in to better performance for scene recognition and ImageNet better for object recognition.
Strong points of this this work:
1. A solid work on dataset building.
2. Detailed and convincing better result than existing scene databases. Shows the power of data.
Minor concerns and comments:
1. Limited algorithm contribution.
2. For density, nearest neighbors are obtained based on the GIST feature. Though this setting is the same for all the databases, I wonder if depending on a particular feature will lead to any bias for the density metric.
3. For diversity, judgment can be quite difficult if judges are presented with two random images, as it doesn't make sense to judge the similarity between two unrelated random images. I wonder if the authors have similar observations in their AMT experiment.
4. As PLACES and ImageNet are two complementary databases, how about to mix them together to train a model that is good for both object and scene recognition?
 This is a solid work on database building. The paper is clearly written and shows convincing result of the built database. The reviewer assumes that the database will be made publically available, and believes it will have a positive impact to scene image parsing and scene recognition.
