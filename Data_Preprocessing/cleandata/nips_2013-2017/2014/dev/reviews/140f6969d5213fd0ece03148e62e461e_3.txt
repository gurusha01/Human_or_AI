The paper studies multi-view face recognition in constrained environments. The paper proposes a multi-layer multi-view perceptron (MVP) network to infer the identity and view angle representations by deterministic and random neurons from a single 2D image. The MVP is able to synthesize new view of faces from a single 2D face by a sequence of view representations. The paper derives the Monte Carlo Expectation Maximization (MCEM) procedure to learn the MVP from a pair of faces plus the view label, assuming the output face follows a conditional diagonal Gaussian distribution. The MVP is learned from 200 persons in the MultiPIE dataset and the identity features are employed to classify the reset 137 persons by LDA, which achieves comparable performance as the recent methods using convolutional neural networks.
The paper proposes a novel MVP network to disentangle the face identity and view angle representations, and employs the identity features in LDA for multi-view face recognition. Varying the view angle feature in MVP can synthesize new face views. Overall, the technical approach is sound with some limitations and the performance on the MultiPie is very competitive. Some technical concerns are as follows.
The approach seems to depend on well-aligned normalized 32X32 face images. The experiments on face recognition among 137 persons on MultiPIE leave the scalability of the proposed method in question. It is unclear if the method can benefit from more training samples and how to extend the approach for unconstrained face recognition in real applications.
How critical to assume the conditional diagonal Gaussian distribution for the output y? How many training pairs from 200 persons in MultiPIE are used to learn the MVP? Why the new face views have to be "sequentially" synthesized? 
The claim that this new MVP "simulates/mimics how human brain encodes view representations" is quite weak. The paper presents no convincing evidence or discussion on how human brain encodes view representations and why the mechanism is similar to MVP. So I would not list this as one key contribution of the paper. 
 This is a descent work on multi-view perceptron (MVP) learning for multi-view face recognition. The performance on the MultiPIE is competitive. Though I have the concerns on the scalability of this method and how to apply it to a face recognition system.
