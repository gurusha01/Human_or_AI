This paper studies community detection of stochastic block models in a streaming setting. Motivated by the need to reduce input data size when the number of nodes is large, the author(s) first considered a subsampling technique, where community detection is carried out on a random sample of columns is obtained from the adjacency matrix. The main result is a sharp threshold on the sampling rate. It is shown that below this critical rate, no method can recover the communities with vanishing error rate; and a modified spectral method is provided and proved to be consistent when the sampling rate exceeds the threshold. This result is further used to construct a sub-linear memory streaming algorithm that is consistent.
This paper addresses an important problem, and is clearly written. The theoretical results are sharp and solid. The algorithms are modifications of previous spectral methods, and their practicality is not obvious and is not demonstrated through data examples. This paper studies network community detection under the subsample and streaming context. It is an early effort in such a topic and is likely to make a good impact.
