The paper proposed an inferential and read-out circuit model for decoding odor in locusts. In this circuit, the PN and LN neurons in the antennal lobe engage in inferential computation and the Kanyon cells in the mushroom body perform read-out of the distinct odors. Biological data were taken into consideration in the development of a mathematical model of the circuit's computation, leading to the formulation of the reduced dual circuit, which uses a recurrent circuit between PN cells (lambda), glomerulus activity (y) and LN neurons, which implement the B matrix, to infer and represent the odor in distributed form. The projection from PN activity to KC allows the odor to be read out in sparse representation, with one KC represents roughly one or a few odors. Although some of these ideas about the olfactory circuit have been suggested earlier by G. Laurent and colleagues. This might be the first time the entire computational circuit is put together and mapped into a plausible functional and mathematical form. The insight of using PN and LN cells in recurrent circuit to perform inference is forced by a serious consideration of the biological facts. This model thus provides significant insight into our understanding of olfactory computation, with a fairly plausible and rigorous mathematical framework. The hypothetical connections from LN to PN and their relationship to the projection from PN to KC also provides concrete testable predictions of the model. While parts of this dense paper might need clarification, the work is original and important. A novel mathematical model of the olfactory computation circuit that takes both computational functions as well as biological facts into account. It provides deep insight into the computations of the olfactory circuits.
