The paper considers the setting of a sensor network (or agents) in a noisy environment that are able to communicate locally. The authors prove that theoretical bounds on the number of active queries can be achieved through simple best response dynamics.
The paper is very well-written, technically correct, and the synthetic experiment makes the results clear. The theoretical results are novel and I think that the paper deserves to be published to be published at NIPS.
For the benefit of readers, the paper needs to cite, and relate to, recent papers in NIPS that have presented theoretical guarantees for active learning in the presence of noise:
1. Near-optimal Bayesian active learning with noisy observations. Golovin et al. NIPS 2010.
2. Extensions of generalized binary search to group identification and exponential costs. Bellala et al. NIPS 2010. This paper presents novel and interesting theoretical results for a sensor network in equilibrium of a consensus game, obtained through simple best response dynamics, in a noisy environment.
