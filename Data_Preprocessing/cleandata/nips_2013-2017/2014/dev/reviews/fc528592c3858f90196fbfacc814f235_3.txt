The paper constructs and analyzes SBM estimation algorithms for two settings: partial information (where only some columns of the adjacency matrix are observed), and streaming (where columns are observed one at a time). Information-theoretic lower bounds are established, and an asymptotic analysis of the estimation algorithms is conducted. No simulation study was provided, which I find concerning since some of the algorithms have difficult-to-set tuning parameters.
Quality:
I am not an expert on SBM theory, so I cannot comment on the quality of the proofs - but I did find the presentation to be accessible enough for my level of expertise. The theory appears quite complete, with information-theoretic lower bounds nicely matched by the algorithm upper bounds. I also found it nice how Algorithms 3/4 are simply extensions of 1/2, thus making an explicit connection between the streaming setting and partial-information setting.
My major concern is the lack of simulation study, and the fact that Algorithms 3 and 4 require tuning parameters (which I worry they will be highly sensitive to). While I am convinced that Algorithms 1 and 2 will work in practice, I cannot say the same about Algorithms 3 and 4.
Clarity:
Well-written in most places, but there are some paragraphs of noticeably lower quality, that are obviously written by a different person.
The writing did not make the difference between Algorithms 3 (offline streaming) and 4 (online streaming) clear - it looks like the information is there, but scattered throughout Section 4. The authors should provide a summary paragraph stating exactly how those algorithms differ.
Originality:
I only have superficial knowledge of the theoretical SBM literature, but this paper addresses settings (partial information; streaming) that are atypical in my experience. I would say this paper is original.
Significance:
To the best of my knowledge, I am not aware of SBM estimation algorithms for the partial information or streaming settings. I would consider this paper to be highly significant, had the authors shown via simulation that the algorithms were actually practical to implement and tune.
Minor comments:
-On page 8, the authors claim that the supplementary material contains a precise statement on the performance guarantees on their methods vs streaming PCA. I could not find this statement in the supplementary.
-The abstract does not make it clear that the paper's contribution is solely theoretical, with not even a simulation study. If the paper is accepted as-is, its scope should be made clear in the abstract.
 The paper provides valuable insight into the task of network clustering, under the SBM model with either limited information about the network, or in the streaming setting. However, the lack of even a basic simulation study, coupled with the presence of tuning parameters in Algorithms 3 and 4, lead me to question if the presented algorithms are actually practical.
