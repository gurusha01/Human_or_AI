The authors study the following problem. There are N noisy sensors with local communication capabilities uniformly distributed in a region. There is an underlying function separating the region into positive and negative sub-regions. The objective of the external source is to accurately separate the region with as few queries from the source to sensors as possible. 
The main idea is that local communication amongst sensors can be used to de-noise the system before costly communication with the external source. The authors analyze versions of a best-response dynamic that asynchronously or synchronously updates a sensor's reading to the majority reading of its neighbors. They combine the de-noising with an active learning algorithm from the literature, and show through simulations that this combination outperforms SVMs with de-noising as well as either algorithm prior to de-noising. 
This work is interesting and relevant to NIPS, and is very well-presented. The technical results (both analytical and simulations) are of high quality. 
Some minor issues I had:
— Figure 3 should have y-axes on the same scale so that random noise and pockets of noise can more easily be compared. 
— Based on the simulations, almost all the benefit is coming from de-noising the data. After the data is de-noised, SVM and active learning perform about the same (there are no error bars on the plots, but the difference does not appear to be meaningful regardless of significance). The authors call active learning "our method", but the real contribution seems to be the de-noising. Hopefully this can be clarified in the paper.
— De-noising performance was much better on random noise than pockets of noise in simulations, but the pockets of noise model (or generally, noise that is not independent across sensors) seems more realistic. This result somewhat weakens the contribution of the de-noising algorithm.
— In Figure 2 (right), for synchronous updates with random noise, it looks like there is a slight increase in final noise as the number of rounds increases. This made me wonder: how do results look for 100K rounds with more simulations, and what does the max over final noise look like after each number of rounds? Given that the analytical results were for a single step with independent noise, and that running multiple steps will violate the independent noise assumption, it seems that there could be instances where error in an early step propagates to result in high final noise.
— Not really an issue with the paper, but for consideration: the motivation of the de-noising algorithm is that local communication is cheap while communication with the external source is expensive. Practically speaking, another alternative would be for the sensors to communicate locally to collect information (without the best-response dynamic), and then have a single message sent to the source with information about all sensor readings. If this approach is impractical for some reason (e.g., it still requires more data to be sent to the external source, albeit by a single sensor), it might be worth further specifying the problem to rule this possibility out.
 A well-presented paper with interesting analytical and simulation-based results.
