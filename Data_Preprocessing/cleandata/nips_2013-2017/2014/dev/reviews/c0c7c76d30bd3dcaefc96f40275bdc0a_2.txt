This paper presents a method for non-convex hull learning, with the goal of selecting a small set of representative instances from a dataset (column sampling). The core idea is to select points on the hull based on structural complexity scores of the graph computing using zeta functions. Since naive application of this process involves a matrix inversion, the authors also propose extension based on anchor graphs. The paper is fairly well written, and the proposed idea seems novel. Experimental results on multiple real datasets demonstrate effectiveness of the technique.
I wonder whether the authors have though have robustness of the algorithm to noise/outliers. It seems the algorithm will pick those up even though they are not ideal for column sampling. Secondly, I wonder how the proposed technique relates to DPPs (http://www.nowpublishers.com/articles/foundations-and-trends-in-machine-learning/MAL-044) which also focus on subset selection, although with diversity in mind. It will be very informative to learn about any relationship.
 This paper presents a method for column sampling based on non-convex hull learning using zeta functions. The paper should be of interest to the NIPS community, although inclusion of relationship to other subset selection techniques such as DPP will strengthen the paper.
