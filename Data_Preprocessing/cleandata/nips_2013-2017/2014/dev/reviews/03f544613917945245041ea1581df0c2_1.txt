Summary: The authors propose a new Newton-like method to optimize the sum of a smooth (convex) cost function and multiple decomposable norms. Their contributions are (1) an active subspace selection procedure that allows to speed up the solution of the quadratic approximation problem (2) a proof that solving the quadratic approximation problem over the (changing) active subspace still leads to convergence. The authors also provide numerical results showing that, for two important problems, their methods gives 10x speed up over state-of-the-art methods and, in the appendix, give numerical results that illustrate which fraction of the speed up is due to the quadratic approximation technique and which fraction of the speed up is due to the active subspace selection method.
Quality: The amount of critical information in the appendix makes this paper more suited for a journal than a conference. 
Although I did not check all of the proofs, the ones I did check are correct and well written (apart from a few minor typos).
Clarity: The paper is very well written and organized. A few minor suggestions and questions follow. The references could be numbered in order. Including a curly-braket inside the $\min$ in eq. (1) would make it more clear. In line 114, should not the subscript of $\|x\|$ be $(1,\alpha)$ similar to what is written in line 116 ? In Prop. 1, line 236, it would be helpful to clarify that the orthogonal subspace is a function of $\theta$. In line 259 it seems like the over-bar on top of $Q$ is a notation that was not introduced. In line 266 is would be helpful to clarify that $D$ does not need to be diagonal. Line 299 makes reference to eq. 11 and in Th. 1, line 303, makes reference to eq. 8. The appendix also makes reference to eq. 8. This is confusing since in eq. 11 the optimization is constrained and in eq. 8 it is not. It would help clarify that it is because the problem is quadratic that optimizing over the "free" subspace is equivalent to optimizing over the whole space. In line 308, "gives" should be "give". In line 354, it could be useful to remind the reader again that $\Delta_D$ does not need to be diagonal. In Fig. 1, the authors should explain what the percentages mean as well as what the times mean.
Originality: Although there are ideas in the literature related to this work (and these the authors clearly point out) their specific active selection method is new and so is their proof of convergence.
Significance: The 10x speed up is very encouraging and I am certain that the algorithm in this paper will be significant for several practitioners.  A well written paper with significant theoretical and practical contributions. Unfortunately, the amount of critical information in the appendix makes this paper more suited for a journal (so that reviewers can read all the proofs) than for a conference where there is an 8 page limit on the part of the papers that reviewers are supposed to review.
