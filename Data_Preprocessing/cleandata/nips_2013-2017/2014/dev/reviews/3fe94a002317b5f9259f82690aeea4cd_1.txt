The authors propose a new large-scale scene image dataset which is 60 times bigger than the current
standard SUN dataset. They show that deep networks learned on object centric datasets like ImageNet
are not optimal for scene recognition and training similar networks with large amounts of scene 
images improves their performance substantially.
- The diversity and density approach of analysis datasets relative to each other is quite 
 interesting.
 
- The dataset has substantially more number of images than existing scene image classification 
 benchmark datasets and hence is surely a useful resource.
 
- It is convincingly demonstrated that features from CNN trained on scene-centric images, i.e. on the
 proposed dataset, improves performance compared to those from CNN trained on object centric 
 ImageNet dataset. The other way around is also demonstrated empirically i.e. the later features 
 work better on object centric image classification tasks.
 
- It is also demonstrated with visualizations that CNNs trained with scene images capture landscape
 and spatial structures in the higher layers of the network.
 
Overall the paper is well written, addresses an important problem in computer vision. The analysis
of dataset and cross-dataset performances presented are interesting and the proposed dataset is an 
important resource. I recommend acceptance of the paper. Computer vision is entering a new area in which data might have more values than algorithms. I see this paper as a pioneer work in this area.
