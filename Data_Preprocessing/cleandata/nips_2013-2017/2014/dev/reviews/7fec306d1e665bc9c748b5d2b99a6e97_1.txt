The proposed approach, while straightforward, quite elegantly handles the problem at hand. What prevents this paper from being a clear cut acceptance is the lack of adequate experimental validation.

A more thorough discussion of noise in the exploration step of Algorithm 1 (step 8) would be appreciated. This issue is also not discussed in the experiments section (how much noise was used?).
I also had a few issues with some of the claimed advantages in the paper. Specifically:
(1) The claim that PDDP has an advantage over PILCO since it does not have to solve non-convex optimization problems seems suspect given the non-convexity of the optimization problem solved in the hyper-parameter tuning step.
(2) The claim that PDDP's complexity does not scale with the dimensionality of the state seems inaccurate. Even if it doesn't factor into the computational complexity of the policy learning step, it clearly factors into the computation of the kernel matrices necessary for the GP inferences. This issue should be clarified in the final version.
(3) The claim on line 364 that PDDP keeps a fixed size of data seems only accurate in the special case where I_max = 1 (that is when trajectory collection and optimization are note iterated).
My biggest complaint with the paper is that the experimental results are not very strong. Firstly, there is no comparison of the total cost for PILCO versus PDDP. Secondly, is it the case that there are no straightforward methods to speedup PILCO? A discussion of this point would be appreciated. Lastly, GPDDP appears to do as well or better than PDDP on every dimension (data efficiency and computational efficiency). This seems to undermine the idea that PDDP has the benefit of doing "safe exploration". A discussion of this point would strengthen the experiments section.  The authors present a very nice, approach to combining Gaussian Process Regression and Differential Dynamic Programming that elegantly handles the exploration / exploitation tradeoff. The principal downside of the paper is in the experimental validation.
