This paper presents an algorithm to find the optimal chordal Markov network for a decomposable scoring function. In contrast to previous methods that use constraint satisfaction or linear programming, the authors show that the score of a set of junction trees factorize recursively. They then derive a dynamic programming algorithm and its complexity and show some simulation experiments. 
Compared to the methods out there, this approach to structure learning of Markov networks is quite different and figuring out how to cast the problem such that it can take advantage of dynamic programming is clever. It is clear from the experiments that this method is much faster than GOBNILP. However, it's unlikely to scale given its exponential complexity in the number vertices. It's not clear to me whether the authors actually tested the constraint satisfaction approach (Corander et al) on the same instance as their method, for speed or simply made the statement that they were faster. 
I would have liked the authors to organize and explain the proofs better as they were very difficult to follow. Please also label the axes in Figure 2.  The paper could be more clearly written, but otherwise a novel and interesting approach to exact structure learning of chordal Markov networks that beats the state of art significantly in speed.
