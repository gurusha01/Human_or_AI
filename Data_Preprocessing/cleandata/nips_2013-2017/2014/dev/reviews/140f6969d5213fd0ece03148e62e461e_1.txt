This paper presents a novel way to do multi-view representation of faces using a neural-net like model with deterministic and probabilistic units. The network is trained to recover the identity and view. It can be used to synthesize a new view as well. Generally, the paper does a good job at disentangling the contributing factors to the success of the method, and the results seem quite good.
I wish the authors presented more evidence for why they chose to design their model they way they did. For one, it is not clear that a non-deterministic approach is really needed in this case -- could they have done a model that is fully feed-forward with deterministic neurons? It would have certainly avoided the need to variational/importance sampling inference.
Quality: generally, a good paper with an interesting and well-grounded model, evaluated well on a competitive benchmark and 
Clarity: The paper is well-written and easy to read, for most of the part.
Originality: in some sense, the approach is comparable to the work of Geoff Hinton and collaborators, who use stacks of Restricted Boltzmann Machines, where the top RBM can have the label as a side
Significance: this is likely to be of interest to the facial recognition community, but also to other researchers who work on problems where a hybrid deterministic and generative approach may be a good solution.
Comments and questions:
- How did the authors come up with the structure in Figure 2? What are the insights behind the design choices made?
- The authors should define q(h) at line 165
- Is the MCEM method crucial to the model presented? More analysis on why this particular optimization method was used is in order since MCEM is not exactly a widely used method in the community.
- For inference: how big is S at line 235? How expensive is inference generally? Some numbers and O() notation results would be good.
- Is LDA necessary to get the best results? How do the results look like without LDA?
- I don't think the authors should be using the tangent with how the brain works, except very sparsely. There is not much evidence that the presented method is particularly close to how humans do facial recognition or view point interpolation. 
- Did the authors try their approach on the Labeled Faces in the Wild benchmark? If yes, do they have results to report?
 An interesting novel approach to solving the face recognition problem using a graphical neural net-like model that is trained to recover the identity of the input face and its view. Competitive results on the MultiPIE benchmark and interesting solid experiments.
