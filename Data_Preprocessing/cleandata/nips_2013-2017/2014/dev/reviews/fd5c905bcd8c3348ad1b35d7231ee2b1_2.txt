In this paper, the authors describe a HMM-based model for analysing local field potential data. The generative model assumes that for any particular window (short time period), the brain is in one of a set of discrete states. Conditioned on the state, the different brain regions are then assigned to particular LFP clusters and conditioned on the cluster, the observed data is generated from a GP. Variational Inference is performed using three data sets - toy data, mouse sleep data, and mouse novel environment data. Performance on the toy data is very good (to be expected as the data are generated from the model). Performance on the other datasets is harder to gauge, although this is due to the nature of the problem.
Quality: this paper is of high quality. There is interesting technical development coupled with an interesting problem area. The model proposed is well presented and the performance appears (as far as it is possible to tell) to be good. I have no real criticism with the paper.
Clarity: very well written and very clear.
Originality and significance: the paper tackles an important problem. For me, the originality is predominately in the application of this class of algorithm to this problem - I don't feel that there is a huge amount of originality in the technical development itself. The authors propose a HMM-based model for analysing LFP data and assess it using real data from mice. The model is hierarchal, assuming that the observed data for each region comes from a region specific cluster which is itself conditioned on a global brain state. The performance on the datasets considered is good.
