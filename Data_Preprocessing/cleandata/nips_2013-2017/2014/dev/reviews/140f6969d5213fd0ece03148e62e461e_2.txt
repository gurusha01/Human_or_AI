This paper proposes to use an Autoencoder with both deterministic and stochastic units to learn to reconstruct faces of the same person under different 3D viewpoints.
It is well written and the experiments are pretty solid.
The model in Fig. 2 have certain resemblance to the one in [25]. The main difference is that the v is added and it is predicted by both y and h3. This is useful to be able to use feedforward prediction of v instead of using Bayes rule. It is perhaps a good idea to discuss these differences in the text.
minor:
abstract: 'instinct' could be changed to 'intuition' or 'insight'
in figures 1 and 6 are the examples test or training images?
To make the paper stronger, the authors can try to use the STOA Siamese CNN approach of [24] and see how it compares to the proposed methods. This paper proposes to use an autoencoder for pose representation learning on faces data. The problems are interesting and the experiments seems to suggest the usefulness of the approach.
