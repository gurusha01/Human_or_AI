The paper uses spike frequency adaptation (SFA) to implement anticipative tracking in a Continuous Attractor Neural Network (CANN). 
 Anticipative tracking is interesting because the neural delays in actually perceiving a moving object mean that all our perceptions lag reality.
 Here the authors show that SFA allows for anticipative tracking over a wide range of velocities
 
 The paper is clearly written, to my knowledge the results are novel, interesting, and the performance seems good.
	 I recommend including the paper in the proceedings.
