This paper shows how to apply a method-of-moments technique to
inference in the Indian Buffet Process (IBP). The IBP is an important
nonparametric Bayesian model and has many applications.
Existing inference methods based on sampling are computationally
expensive. The method-of-moments approach to inference developed in
this paper is based on the tensor decomposition approach from [6]. The
main contributions of the present paper are: the moment analysis for
the IBP that motivate the proposed method, computational and sample
complexity analysis for the proposed inference method, and a
demonstration of the method on some synthetic and image recovery
problems, showing a favorable comparison to the "infinite variational
approach".
The paper quite well-written and is well-motivated. One takeaway from
this paper is the view of nonparametric models as "effectively
parametric" models, which permits a "parameter estimation" approach to
inference. This is quite similar to approach taken in [7] for
inference in the mixed-membership block model. I think this is a nice
idea that is worth promoting, and the present paper does this well.
As mentioned above, the main technical contribution is the moment
analysis for the IBP. One interesting aspect of the IBP is that the
third and fourth order moments can be missing some components with
certain "dish probabilities", but together they contain all of the
components.
The concentration inequalities are fairly standard, although there is
a slight improvement over the loose analysis from [23]. The error
analysis essentially follows [23,8]. Much of the discussion in Section
4 on using random projections and the "projected" tensor power method
in an efficient way is actually from [6] (and should be properly
attributed).
Line 91: "z ~ IBP(z)" --- what does this mean?
Line 223: "(...)_epsilon" --- what's epsilon?
Line 283: "average-median theorem" --- where is this used?
Line 582: "convexity of expectations" --- probably you just mean
Jensen's inequality and convexity of the Euclidean norm?
[I've read the author rebuttal.] In summary, the paper is a well-written description of how to use amethod-of-moments based on tensor decompositions for inference in aparticular nonparametric Bayesian model (IBP). There is somealgorithmic and other technical novelty here, though not a whole lot;still, I think the paper is an interesting contribution and should beof interest to the machine learning community.
