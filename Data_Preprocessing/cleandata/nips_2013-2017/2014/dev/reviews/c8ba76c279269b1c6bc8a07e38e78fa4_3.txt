Summary:
The authors study the olfaction circuit in the locust. They propose that KC neurons reconstruct estimates of odor vectors via dynamics in the antennal lobe. Specifically, they propose that LN-PN connections are updated via ICA, while the PN dynamics are determined by gradient descent of the dual of a compressed-sensing optimization problem.
They show performance of this "reduced dual" circuit offers reasonable performance compared to a simple feedforward circuit.
Quality:
The reduced dual circuit is an intriguing hypothesis. If true this would be an exceptional paper. The mathematical development flows from 1) basic MAP inference for identifying odors to 2) low-dimensional dynamics of the problem's dual to 3) the reduced dual circuit and finally to 4) learning LN representations by ICA. This step-by-step development is elegant and is thus very appealing.
However, the plausibility of this hypothesis does not seem sufficiently explored. The paper contains no compelling comparisons to biological data. PN neurons are known to exhibit transient dynamics in response to odors. Do the dynamics of eqn 12 yield sensible dynamical trajectories? Can anything be said about physiological/behavioral adaptations of locusts to new odor environments -- and whether such experimental observations comply with expectations of eqn 16? If no such data are available, it would be useful to discuss which expectations of the reduced dual circuit can be tested with existing data and which are currently hypothetical. Overall, these concerns are underdeveloped in the paper.
What is the motivation to focus specifically on the locust? It seems that the locust is only constraining the choice of M and N. 
The paper has one unfinished figure (line 294)
Clarity:
In section 4 some notation is confusing. x is overloaded to represent both the odor vector and the KC estimate of the odor. I believe this is motivated by developing the general mathematical result first and adding biological mappings later, but it was slightly confusing. Another example: A represents both the ORN->glom map and the PN->KC map.
Otherwise the paper is clear and well-written.
Originality:
To my knowledge this is an especially original paper.
Significance:
The significance of this study seems to rely on experimental verification. Conditioned on that, I think it has potential to be a high-impact paper.
 Simple biological constraints motivate an alternative formulation for a standard optimization problem (compressed sensing) in locust olfaction. The development of these ideas is elegant, but the paper would be strengthened by verifying expectations of the model with current experimental data.
