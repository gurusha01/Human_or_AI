Summary:
This paper attempts to link sparse optimization methodology to the anatomical structure of locust's early
olfactory system. The work is motivated by the observation that odorant molecules are sparsely represented
by the population of Kenyon cells. The authors first mathematically formulate the olfactory system as a MAP
decoder, and give the standard solution to the problem without considering biological constraints. Next, to
make the solution more biologically plausible, the authors reformulate the olfactory system model as a decoder
of a compressive sensing problem, and provide two standard solutions to the dual problem. Then, the authors
argue that each of the components in the solution can be mapped/interpreted to/as a unit of the biological
structure in the olfactory system. However, these maps are described without a strong justification
and there are conceptual problems in linking the math with the biology.
Further clarification on the following points would help readers to gain better insights:
- While LNs and KCs are modeled using a Heaviside function, modeling that is widely accepted in the literature,
the PNs output is modeled as the Lagrange multiplier. Such modeling is not intuitive, and needs to be justified.
In particular, under such modeling, the output of PNs is computed by the gradient decent method in Eq. (10) for
the full dual algorithm, and in Eq. (16) for the reduced dual, which would require iteration to reach an optimal
solution. However, it is not clear how PNs perform the gradient decent method and the iteration mechanism.
The major problem, however, is that the solution to eq. (10) might be negative and the PN output rate (lambda)
has to be positive!
- The B matrix is proposed to replace the A matrix so that the role of LNs can be accommodated into the solution.
However, it is not clear why the solution to Eq. (12) (with the B matrix) is the same as the solution to (10) (with the
A matrix). It needs to be shown that the lambda computed by Eq. (12) converges to the one computed by Eq. (10).
Also, the B matrix is square, implicitly indicating that the numbers of the PNs and LNs is the same. However, this is
not true since there are more PNs than LNs. What would be the performance of the reduced dual circuit if the B matrix
is not square but rectangular, and the ratio of its two dimensions follows the ratio of the numbers of LNs and PNs?
- More on the B matrix. The B matrix is not fixed, and needs to be learned every time a new input is given. As shown
in Fig 3, the proposed method can not always learn the B matrix faithfully. What is the performance of the reduced dual
circuit when the B matrix is poorly learned? Furthermore, B needs to be learned before being used for readout by KCs.
Although, the authors depicted a procedure to deal with this issue of combing learning and readout, there is neither a
justification nor simulations of such a procedure, and it is hard to evaluate its correctness.
Finally, the authors suggest that the connectivity between the PNs and the KCs is, at least structurally, related to the A
matrix. Now, in the recently published article: Caron, S.J.C, Ruta, V., Abbott, L.F. and Axel, R. (2013) Random Convergence
of Afferent Olfactory Inputs in the Drosophila Mushroom Body. Nature 497:113-117, it is argued that the same connectivity
is random. Is there a reason to believe that this does not also apply to the locust?
Originality:
Attempting to bridge an optimization method to the neural circuit of insect's olfactory system.
Clarity:
The paper seems at times to be prepared in a rush. The main message is not clear at the first glance.
Quality:
The authors need to demonstrate that the mapping between the sparse optimization solution and neural circuit makes sense,
and the proposed methods indeed solve the decoding problem.

 The paper falls short both from a mathematical point of view and from the questionable linking of the math with the biology.
