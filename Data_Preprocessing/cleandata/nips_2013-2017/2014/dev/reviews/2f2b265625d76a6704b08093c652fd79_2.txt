SUMMARY
This was an interesting treatment of tracking dynamics using continuous attractor neural networks. In brief, the authors show that spike frequency adaptation is a sufficient condition to induce travelling waves (moving bump attractors). These provide a plausible explanation for anticipatory dynamics when entrained by exogenous input. The notion is that these dynamics may provide a solution to sensorimotor delay problems in the real brain. 
COMMENTS TO AUTHORS
I enjoyed reading this clearly described and well-motivated treatment of continuous attractor networks (and wave equations) in the context of anticipatory dynamics in neuronal networks. I have a few minor points that might improve the presentation of your ideas. 
 
1)	It might be nice to refer to predictive coding as a popular framework for understanding active vision and inference that necessarily rests upon some form of prediction and, implicitly, anticipation in the context of oculomotor delays. In this context, your contribution provides a nice and biologically plausible way of finessing the oculomotor delay problem that could – in principle – be absorbed into an inference scheme using Bayesian filtering? 
2)	On line 53, replace "these supporting evidence" with "this supporting evidence". 
3)	On line 101, I would say "which is generally assumed to have the following form":
4)	It would be nice to supplement Figure 1 with the difference between the symmetric and asymmetric interaction kernels (Equations 4 and 5) to give the reader a fuller intuition about the asymmetry. 
5)	In section 2.3, there may be an important difference between the asymmetric neural networks and the "symmetry breaking" afforded by spike frequency adaptation. I am not sure but the direction of the travelling wave in the asymmetric formulation is pre-determined by the asymmetry in the spatial interaction kernel. If this is the case, then you could say something like:
"Note that both SFA and asymmetric coupling destroy the stability of stationary bump attractors; however, SFA admits moving solutions in either direction. This should be contrasted with the asymmetric coupling implementation; in which the direction of motion is determined by the form of the asymmetry. This could be potentially important in terms of tracking behaviour - in which targets can move in either direction."
6)	I would move Figure 2 to after you have introduced Equation 13 and have defined intrinsic velocity.
7)	In Equation 12, I would either replace u with phi or phi with u in the line below to make it clear that these are both the principal eigenmodes.
8)	On line 305, replace "gives to" with "gives".
I hope that these comments help should any revision be required.
 This was a compelling demonstration of the utility of spike frequency adaptation in neural field models of travelling waves – that may play a useful role in anticipating or tracking.
