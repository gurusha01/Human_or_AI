This paper proposes a new pairwise clustering framework where nonparametric pairwise similarity is derived by minimizing the generalization error unsupervised nonparametric classifier. The proposed framework bridges the gap between clustering and multi-class classification, and explains the widely used kernel similarity for clustering. The authors also prove that the generalization error bound for the unsupervised plug-in classifier is asymptotically equal to the weighted volume of cluster boundary for low density separation. Based on the derived nonparametric pairwise similarity using the plug-in classifier, the authors propose a new nonparametric exemplar-based clustering method with enhanced discriminative capability compared to the exiting exemplar-based clustering methods.
Here are few comments.
1. In equation (6) which which provides and estimate for the regression function, shouldn't there be a \pi^{(i)} in the numerator as was in line 123?
 
2. In lemma 2, kernel bandwidth h should be h_n
3. typo: line 63, remove double the.
3. The theoretical results are interesting and nice, especially the connection to the low density separation is interesting.
4. While the theoretical results are nice, its application towards developing new nonparametric examplar based clustering algorithm looks a little bit complex.
Overall, this is an interesting paper.
