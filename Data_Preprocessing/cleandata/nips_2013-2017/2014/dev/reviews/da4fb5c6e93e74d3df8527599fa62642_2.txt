This paper proposed a calibrated multivariate regression method for fitting high dimensional data. Then they proposed a computational method for solving the optimization problem. The main comments on the details of the paper are as follows:
1.	The main improvement of the model is substituting the Frobenious norm by L_{2,1} norm. The calibration is in fact substituting the variance as standard deviation. The authors used numerical experiments to show its effects. Can the authors give some theoretical explanation or intuitive explanation why the standard deviation works better than variance?
2.	For the numerical experiments, matrix DI is added to show the different variances of the noise. However, in the setting, the range of DI is not large. What will the results be when the range of D_I is much larger? In Table 4.1, when lambda changes in its wide range, are there the similar results?
3.	Some typing errors such as: in (1.2), a lambda is lost.
 The manuscript is clearly written, but lack of novelty and enough experiments.
