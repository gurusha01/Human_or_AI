The paper presents an algorithm for finding a chordal Markov network that maximizes
any given decomposable scoring function. The algorithm is based on a recursive
characterization of clique trees, and it runs in O(4n) time for n vertices. The algorithm is shown experimentally to outperform the current state-of-the-art solution to the problem.
The is a well-written paper that makes a progress on an important problem. The dynamic programming approach is well-described and seems to be highly appropriate for the task. The presented results are encouraging.
