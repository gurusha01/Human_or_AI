This paper proposes an efficient algorithm for clustering networks. The clustering utilizes the stochastic blockmodel and the authors show that the model can be fitted efficiently with partial data and memory constraints. 
Specific Comments:
The version of the stochastic blockmodel reported is a very simple version of the model. Most applications of the stochastic blockmodel use a different intra cluster probability for each cluster and a different inter cluster probability for each pair. Can the blockmodel used herein be used to approximate the more general type of blockmodel?
The results appear to be restricted to the case where p and q have similar structure in terms of n because p=a f(n) and q=b f(n). Could the results be extended to other cases? I suspect that they may hold if p tends to dominate q as n gets large?
The paper would benefit in showing either one or both of the following:
(a) a large but not huge example that shows how a standard stochastic blockmodel fit compares to the fast algorithm presented herein.
(b) the results applied to a huge example (however briefly).  This paper proposes an efficient algorithm for clustering networks. The clustering utilizes the stochastic blockmodel and the authors show that the model can be fitted efficiently with partial data and memory constraints.
