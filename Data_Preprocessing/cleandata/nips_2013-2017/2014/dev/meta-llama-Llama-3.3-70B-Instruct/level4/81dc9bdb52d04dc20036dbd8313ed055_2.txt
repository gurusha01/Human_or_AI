This manuscript proposes an innovative algorithm for determining the optimal chordal Markov network for a decomposable scoring function. Unlike existing approaches that rely on constraint satisfaction or linear programming, the authors demonstrate that the score of a set of junction trees can be factorized recursively, enabling the derivation of a dynamic programming algorithm. The authors also analyze the complexity of this algorithm and provide simulation experiments to validate their approach.
The proposed method differs significantly from current structure learning techniques for Markov networks, and the authors' ability to reformulate the problem to leverage dynamic programming is a notable contribution. The experimental results clearly indicate that this method outperforms GOBNILP in terms of speed. However, its scalability is uncertain due to the exponential complexity in the number of vertices. It is unclear whether the authors directly compared their method's performance with the constraint satisfaction approach (Corander et al) on the same instances or simply asserted their method's superiority.
To improve the manuscript, the authors should reorganize and clarify the proofs, as they are currently difficult to follow. Additionally, Figure 2 would benefit from labeled axes. While the paper could be written more clearly, it presents a novel and intriguing approach to exact structure learning of chordal Markov networks, achieving significant speed improvements over the state-of-the-art.
