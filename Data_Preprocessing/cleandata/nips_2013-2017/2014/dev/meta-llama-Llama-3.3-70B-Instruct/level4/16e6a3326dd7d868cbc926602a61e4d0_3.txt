The authors investigate a problem where N noisy sensors, uniformly distributed in a region and equipped with local communication capabilities, aim to accurately separate the region into positive and negative sub-regions with minimal queries to an external source. The underlying concept is to leverage local sensor communication to de-noise the system prior to engaging in costly communication with the external source. 
The authors examine various iterations of a best-response dynamic, which updates sensor readings to the majority reading of neighboring sensors, either asynchronously or synchronously. By combining this de-noising approach with an active learning algorithm from existing literature, the authors demonstrate through simulations that this integrated method outperforms Support Vector Machines (SVMs) with de-noising, as well as either algorithm applied independently prior to de-noising.
This work is both interesting and relevant to the NIPS conference, with high-quality technical results presented in a clear and well-organized manner. However, several minor issues were noted:
— Figure 3 would benefit from uniform y-axis scales to facilitate a more straightforward comparison between random noise and pockets of noise.
— The simulations suggest that the primary advantage stems from de-noising the data, as SVM and active learning perform similarly after de-noising. The authors refer to active learning as "our method," but it appears that the true contribution lies in the de-noising process, which could be clarified in the paper.
— The de-noising algorithm exhibited superior performance on random noise compared to pockets of noise in simulations. Nevertheless, the pockets of noise model, which represents noise that is not independent across sensors, seems more realistic. This discrepancy somewhat diminishes the impact of the de-noising algorithm.
— In Figure 2 (right), synchronous updates with random noise appear to result in a slight increase in final noise as the number of rounds increases. This raises questions about the outcomes of 100K rounds with additional simulations and the maximum final noise after each round. Given that the analytical results were derived for a single step with independent noise, and that multiple steps may violate this assumption, it is possible that early-step errors could propagate and lead to high final noise.
— Although not a direct issue with the paper, it is worth considering an alternative approach where sensors communicate locally to gather information without the best-response dynamic and then transmit a single message to the source with comprehensive sensor reading information. If this approach is impractical due to specific constraints, further problem specification may be necessary to rule out this possibility.
Overall, the paper presents interesting analytical and simulation-based results in a clear and well-organized manner.
