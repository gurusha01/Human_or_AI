This manuscript presents a novel approach utilizing an Autoencoder that incorporates both deterministic and stochastic units to reconstruct facial images of the same individual from various 3D viewpoints.
The paper is well-structured and clearly written, with robust experimental results.
The architecture depicted in Figure 2 bears some similarity to the model presented in [25], with the key distinction being the introduction of 'v', which is predicted by both 'y' and 'h3'. This modification enables the use of feedforward prediction for 'v' instead of relying on Bayes' rule. It would be beneficial to explicitly discuss these differences within the text.
Minor suggestions include:
- In the abstract, consider replacing 'instinct' with 'intuition' or 'insight' for improved clarity.
- It would be helpful to specify whether the images in Figures 1 and 6 are from the test or training datasets.
To further strengthen the manuscript, the authors may consider comparing their proposed method to the state-of-the-art Siamese CNN approach outlined in [24]. This paper explores the use of an autoencoder for learning pose representations in facial data, tackling interesting problems and demonstrating the potential effectiveness of this approach through experimental results.
