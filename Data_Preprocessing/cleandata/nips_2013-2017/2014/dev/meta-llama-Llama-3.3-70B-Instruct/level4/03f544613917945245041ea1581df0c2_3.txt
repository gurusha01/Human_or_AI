The authors have successfully built upon the findings of [11] and [12], expanding their applicability to more general contexts. Their proposed computational framework is demonstrated to be effective for 
(a) loss functions that are both strongly convex and twice differentiable, and 
(b) regularization functions that are decomposable.
The theoretical underpinnings appear sound, and the numerical results are persuasive. While (b) is a natural fit for sparse learning problems, (a) may be seen as somewhat restrictive given that many sparse learning problems are formulated as non-strongly convex optimization problems.
I have two primary concerns regarding the manuscript:
(1) The condition stated in Eq.(16) seems quite stringent. Could the authors provide illustrative examples to support this requirement?
(2) Block coordinate descent algorithms also present a competitive approach for solving the optimization problem outlined in Section 5.2. A detailed comparison with these methods would be beneficial.
In response to the authors' rebuttal, considering statistical error often diminishes the need for overly precise solutions. To facilitate a more comprehensive comparison between the proposed algorithm and first-order block coordinate descent algorithms, additional experiments, such as those examining the trade-off between computational time and classification error in multi-task learning scenarios, would be valuable. My speculation is that the local quadratic convergence may not offer significant advantages when statistical error is taken into account. However, achieving a highly accurate solution is still desirable if computational resources permit.
Overall, I hold a positive view of this paper's quality and believe it would be a valuable addition to the NIPS conference.
