This manuscript proposes a clustering framework that utilizes a pairwise similarity function model, where various data partitions are employed to construct nonparametric classifiers. The optimal clustering is achieved by minimizing the generalization error of the learned classifiers associated with the data partitions. The authors explore two nonparametric classifiers within their framework: the plug-in and the nearest-neighbor classifier. Additionally, they establish an interesting result, demonstrating that the generalization error bound for unsupervised plug-in clustering is asymptotically equivalent to the weighted volume of the cluster boundary for Low Density Separation.
This paper integrates two crucial machine learning topics: multi-class classification and clustering, boasting a strong theoretical foundation. However, the writing is of poor quality. Although the introduction is well-organized, the subsequent sections delve into intricate technical details without providing a concise, comprehensible summary of the results. The inclusion of two technical lemmas in Section 2 exacerbates the confusion, making it challenging to assess the paper's actual impact. Section 2 is replete with technical details presented prior to providing the reader with any intuition, and the lemma statements are unclear. For instance, Lemma 1 lacks clarity on the dependence of n0 on Ïƒ0 and VC characteristics of K, while the statement appears to be grammatically incorrect. Similarly, Lemma 2 introduces numerous parameters with complex interdependencies, rendering it difficult to discern the lemma's actual claim.
The lemma statements are generally unreadable, and some are positioned at the beginning of the paper. The authors should devote more time to refining the presentation of their results, potentially by summarizing the theoretical findings before presenting the exact statements. Moreover, they should provide intuition regarding the lemmas in the main body of the paper.
The authors demonstrate the applicability of their techniques to exemplar-based clustering but fail to compare their method to existing state-of-the-art approaches. The experimental section is brief and does not illuminate the advantages of the developed technique over other clustering algorithms. The difficulty of clustering is heavily influenced by the specific setting, including data dimensionality, sparsity, and cluster shape. Without a detailed analysis of the algorithm's performance in these settings, it is challenging to determine the method's practical applicability and ability to solve non-trivial problems.
The computational complexity of the algorithms utilizing the presented technique is not addressed. It is unclear whether the analysis can be extended to other classifiers beyond the nearest-neighbor and plug-in classifiers. The release of source code files implementing the presented method would be beneficial, although this is not crucial.
In summary, this paper addresses a vital machine learning problem and presents innovative ideas that bridge the gap between clustering and multi-label classification. However, the authors appear to have devoted insufficient time to preparing a readable version of the paper. The presentation is disorganized, making it difficult to comprehend the main theoretical results. The experimental section is incomplete, lacking comparisons with existing methods. I suggest that the authors thoroughly reorganize the paper, particularly Sections 2 and 3, to address these concerns.
