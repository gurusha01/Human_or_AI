This manuscript presents a novel approach to network clustering, leveraging the stochastic blockmodel to achieve efficient clustering under partial data and memory limitations. 
Specific Comments:
The stochastic blockmodel implementation described in the paper appears to be a simplified variant, whereas most real-world applications employ a more complex version with cluster-specific intra-cluster probabilities and pair-specific inter-cluster probabilities. It would be beneficial to investigate whether the proposed blockmodel can approximate these more general models.
The findings seem to be confined to scenarios where the structures of p and q are similar in terms of n, given their definitions as p = a  f(n) and q = b  f(n). It is worth exploring whether these results can be generalized to other cases, potentially when p dominates q as n increases.
To enhance the manuscript, the authors may consider including one or both of the following:
(a) A moderately sized example illustrating the comparison between a standard stochastic blockmodel fit and the fast algorithm proposed in the paper.
(b) A brief demonstration of the results applied to a large-scale example, showcasing the algorithm's performance in real-world scenarios.
