This manuscript introduces a innovative approach to multi-view face representation using a neural network model that incorporates both deterministic and probabilistic components. The network is trained to reconstruct the identity and viewpoint of the input face, and can also generate new views. Overall, the paper effectively isolates the key factors contributing to the method's success, and the results appear to be of high quality.
However, the authors could provide more justification for their design choices, particularly regarding the use of a non-deterministic approach. It is unclear whether a fully feed-forward model with deterministic neurons would have been sufficient, which would have eliminated the need for variational or importance sampling inference.
Quality: The paper presents a well-grounded and interesting model, evaluated on a competitive benchmark, and the results are generally good.
Clarity: The manuscript is well-written and easy to follow, with most sections being clear and concise.
Originality: While the approach shares some similarities with the work of Geoff Hinton and collaborators, who used stacks of Restricted Boltzmann Machines, the hybrid deterministic and generative approach presented here offers a unique perspective.
Significance: This work is likely to be of interest to the facial recognition community, as well as researchers exploring hybrid approaches for problems that require both deterministic and generative components.
Comments and questions:
- Can the authors provide insight into the design decisions behind the structure in Figure 2, and elaborate on the reasoning behind their choices?
- The definition of q(h) at line 165 should be explicitly stated.
- Is the use of the MCEM method crucial to the model's performance, and can the authors provide more analysis on why this particular optimization method was chosen, given its relatively limited use in the community?
- Regarding inference, what is the size of S at line 235, and what is the computational cost of inference in general? Providing numerical results and big O notation analysis would be helpful.
- Is LDA essential for achieving the best results, and what do the results look like without LDA?
- The authors should exercise caution when drawing analogies between their method and brain function, as there is limited evidence to suggest that their approach closely mimics human facial recognition or viewpoint interpolation.
- Were the authors' results evaluated on the Labeled Faces in the Wild benchmark, and if so, are there any results to report?
Overall, the paper presents a novel and interesting approach to face recognition using a graphical neural network-like model, with competitive results on the MultiPIE benchmark and solid experimental design.
