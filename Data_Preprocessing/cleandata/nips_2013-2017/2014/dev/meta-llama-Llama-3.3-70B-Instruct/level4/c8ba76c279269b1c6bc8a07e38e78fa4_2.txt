We were requested to discuss this paper due to the variability in reviews, and as a result, we would like the authors to address the following key points:
1) The authors should clarify how physiological measures of activity, such as firing rates, are mapped to the variables y and lambda. Specifically, the current formulation of lambda lacks bounds, which may impact the interpretation of the results. A detailed explanation of how this affects the model's interpretation is necessary.
2) The model relies on "negative reciprocal" connectivity between the PNs and LNs, as evident from the use of B and B_transpose in Equation 12. Similarly, symmetry is required between the measurements of the sparse vector x and the projections to the KCs. The authors should provide evidence from the locus anatomy or physiology to support this symmetry or discuss whether the model can function without it.
3) The primary evidence that this model accurately describes the olfactory circuit in locusts is that the odor input is sparse, and the sparse signal is projected into a lower-dimensional, denser representation. However, it is essential to clarify where this transformation occurs, potentially at the level of the ORs, where each OR responds to multiple molecules, and each molecule binds with several ORs. The authors should provide more evidence to support the model, such as the presence of gradient descent dynamics or plasticity/processing between LNs and PNs that can be mapped to the form of ICA presented.
This paper presents a unique approach to modeling a specific neural circuit, combining compressed sensing and ICA to describe the locust olfactory system. The authors derive a mathematical model that takes into account the input from ORNs, the interaction with local interneurons and PNs in the glomerular layer, and the projection to the higher-dimensional space of KCs. The model is formulated as a MAP optimization problem, then reframed as a compressed sensing problem, and finally modified to incorporate knowledge about the biological circuit.
The paper's originality lies in its integration of compressed sensing, ICA, and a particular neural circuit. The presentation of the model is clear, but a more detailed explanation of the biological circuit and its relationship to the model is necessary. Specifically, the authors should clarify how the mixing of molecules occurs, whether each OR binds with multiple molecules, and how the PNs read out the glomeruli.
To strengthen the paper, the authors should provide evidence that the dynamics of the model match the dynamics of the true circuit. This could include comparing simulations of the model with physiological data, such as individual neuron responses, or demonstrating the implementation of ICA in the locust olfactory system. Additionally, the authors could explore whether the model's performance is comparable to behavioral measurements from locusts, such as odor discrimination. While the paper is of interest to the NIPS community in its current form, stronger evidence supporting the model's accuracy would significantly increase its significance.
