This paper presents a methodology for accelerating the sampling of probability distributions using spiking neurons through the implementation of linear probabilistic population codes (PPCs). Initially, it explains how an appropriately chosen integrate-and-fire model can sample from target distributions by linearly mapping spikes. The authors then demonstrate that any product of exponentials distribution can be encapsulated within the dynamics of a PPC, thereby enabling sampling akin to multi-chain Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). The primary conclusion drawn is that a single population of K neurons can sample K chains, contrasting with the requirement of K networks to achieve the same in traditional methods.
The majority of the paper delves into the neural implications of this scheme for encoding probability distributions, utilizing measures commonly employed in neuroscience. Although the results are intriguing, the presentation appears unbalanced for the NIPS audience. The PPC method is described succinctly and illustrated briefly in figure 1f. The emphasis on neural implications, spanning pages 5 through 7, seems excessive and somewhat arbitrary, as it primarily shows that the proposed encoding scheme, with the chosen network topology, does not contradict observational evidence. In my view, a more detailed exposition of the results in section 1, including additional demonstrations and graphs of the method, would have strengthened the paper.
Furthermore, I have concerns regarding the distinction between the presented model and the PPC model by Ma et al (2006). Upon careful reading, it appears that there is no inherent limitation in the Ma et al model that prevents multiple neurons from independently computing posterior Gaussian distributions. The difference seems to stem from the use of spike-coding versus rate-coding in the Ma et al paper, a point that warrants further elaboration.
It's worth noting that several papers on this topic, such as [6], share a similar issue where technical details are challenging to extract, making it difficult to fully understand the methodology. For instance, the coding scheme used in equation (1) of [6] is not clearly explained. Fortunately, other esteemed NIPS colleagues have independently expressed similar concerns, which validates my observations.
On a minor note, the firing rates depicted in figure 2a are remarkably high for many biological neurons. It would be beneficial to clarify the extent to which the proposed scheme relies on such high firing rates.
Additionally, there are a few typographical errors: on page 3, line 142, "each neurons" should be "each neuron"; on page 3, line 153, "we can encoding" should be "we can encode"; on page 3, line 160, the equation seems to contain an error, as "x" might should be "y" (as per line 159); on page 4, line 188, "the s sampling" appears to be a typo; and on page 8, line 386, "in central question" should be "is a central question".
In conclusion, while the approach is interesting and has a clear place at NIPS, the presentation is unbalanced, and the computational contribution, as outlined in section 1, deserves more prominence and elaboration to fully appreciate the methodology's potential.
