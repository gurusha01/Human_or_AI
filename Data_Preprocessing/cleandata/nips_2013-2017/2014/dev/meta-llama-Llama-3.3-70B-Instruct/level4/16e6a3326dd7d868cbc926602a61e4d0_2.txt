SUMMARY:
This manuscript integrates concepts from game theory and active learning to address the challenge of a central entity estimating a decision boundary from noisy sensor data. Assuming independent noise, the authors demonstrate that straightforward simultaneous or asynchronous game dynamics can effectively denoise the system with high probability, given a sufficient number of sensors. The authors provide experimental results in a plane setting, showcasing the efficacy of denoising combined with active learning, which is known to struggle with high noise levels, and comparing favorably to learning without denoising and passive learning with denoising.
CRITIQUE:
The findings are intriguing, the approach is innovative, and the presentation is well-organized. However, the practical significance of the results raises some concerns. While the authors make a compelling case for the potential of denoising sensor collections using simple distributed computations to enable active learning and reduce sensor query loads, the analytical bounds provided leave room for questioning the applicability of this approach in real-world scenarios. For instance, is it realistic to assume N = 10,000 for r = 0.1, as in the experiments? A clearer understanding of reasonable parameter settings, such as r, N, and eta, is necessary to evaluate the utility of this method. Additionally, the assumption of a uniform distribution may not be justified in all cases. 
Furthermore, it is surprising that the discussion of the 2r band around the separator, where the method's performance is uncertain, is limited. For larger values of r, a more sophisticated distance-weighted approach may be more effective. Although a footnote mentions that such an approach performs similarly to the simple majority method, a more detailed comparison, particularly near the boundary, would be valuable.
SPECIFIC COMMENTS:
Page 1: Defining technical terms like active learning and agnostic active learning in simpler language after their initial use would enhance the manuscript's accessibility.
Page 2: The relationship between r, d (dimension), and N is not thoroughly discussed; referencing results from theoretical computer science or graph theory on the connectedness of the communication graph could provide valuable context.
Page 3: An overview of Section 3 at the beginning would be helpful, as its content was not previously introduced.
Page 7: The observation that "pockets of noise appear to be more difficult to denoise" is not unexpected, given that the algorithm was not designed for such cases. It is possible that higher dimensions may mitigate the severity of these pockets.
Page 8: Changing "A synchronous round" to "One synchronous round" could avoid confusion with "asynchronous." Overall, the manuscript presents an interesting and novel approach, but requires more justification regarding its significance and practical applicability.
