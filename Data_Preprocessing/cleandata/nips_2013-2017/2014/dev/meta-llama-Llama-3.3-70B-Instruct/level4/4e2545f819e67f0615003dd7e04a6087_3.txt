The authors propose a theoretical framework for modeling neural population dynamics, wherein a linear dynamical system driven by noise utilizes Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (as introduced by Boerlin et al, 2011) to sample from a specified distribution. This system's state determines the membrane potential of a neuronal population at each time step through linear projection. Simulation results demonstrate that the model successfully replicates key summary statistics of neural populations in simplified scenarios, with implications for neural variability and decoding.
The paper exhibits a high standard of presentation and is well-written overall. However, the discussion could benefit from clearer methodological explanations, such as the specific modifications made to the method of Boerlin et al, 2011, and details regarding the simulation parameters, including whether the decoding matrix was learned and the time constants used.
The model's structure, featuring low-dimensional dynamics linearly projected to modulate population responses, bears resemblance to recent statistical modeling and data analysis studies (e.g., Pfau et al, 2013; Turaga et al, 2013; Yu et al, 2009; Ecker et al, 2014). Certain aspects of the paper, such as the statistical advantages of projecting low-dimensional dynamics into high-dimensional populations and the importance of population-level modeling, are also motivated in this literature. The success of these statistical models renders the current biophysically plausible approach timely, yet it also highlights the need for the inclusion of real data in the paper.
In conclusion, the approach presented is intriguing, and the simulated experiments exhibit compelling features. Nevertheless, it is challenging to extrapolate the findings from the simplified examples to larger-scale models of population activity. The authors successfully demonstrate a sampling-based model of latent, low-dimensional population dynamics that broadly matches neural population characteristics in a simplified example. Although the paper is polished and well-written, its impact is somewhat limited by the absence of real neural data and the reliance on toy simulations.
