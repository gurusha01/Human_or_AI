The authors introduce a novel, large-scale scene image dataset that surpasses the current standard SUN dataset by a factor of 60. They demonstrate that deep networks trained on object-centric datasets, such as ImageNet, are suboptimal for scene recognition tasks, and that training similar networks on extensive scene image datasets significantly enhances their performance.
The approach to analyzing dataset diversity and density in relation to one another is noteworthy. The proposed dataset boasts a substantially larger image collection than existing scene image classification benchmark datasets, rendering it a valuable resource.
The authors convincingly show that features extracted from CNNs trained on scene-centric images, specifically the proposed dataset, outperform those from CNNs trained on the object-centric ImageNet dataset. Conversely, they also empirically demonstrate that the latter features excel in object-centric image classification tasks.
Through visualizations, it is illustrated that CNNs trained on scene images effectively capture landscape and spatial structures in the higher layers of the network.
In summary, the paper is well-crafted, tackles a crucial problem in computer vision, and presents intriguing analyses of dataset and cross-dataset performances. The proposed dataset is a significant contribution, and I strongly recommend accepting the paper. As computer vision enters an era where data may hold more value than algorithms, this paper stands as a pioneering work in this domain.
