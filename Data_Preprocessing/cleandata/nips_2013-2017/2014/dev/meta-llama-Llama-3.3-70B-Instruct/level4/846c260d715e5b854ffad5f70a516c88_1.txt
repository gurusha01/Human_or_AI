This manuscript presents an application of spectral methods to infer parameters of an Indian Buffet Process (IBP) model, incorporating two common emission models: a linear Gaussian model and a sparse factor analysis model. The approach leverages the decomposition of moment tensors, which can be approximately low-rank due to the latent variable structure of the data. The authors compute these decompositions using a power iteration method on symmetrized tensors, a technique well-established in the literature, as exemplified in [6].
The paper's methodology involves calculating the relevant moment tensors and their symmetrized versions, applying a standard tensor power decomposition, and providing concentration proofs for recovery guarantees. Experimental results are also included to demonstrate the application of these spectral fitting methods. However, the overall contribution and originality of the paper seem limited, as it primarily applies existing spectral methodology to the IBP context without introducing substantial novel elements.
Potential contributions that might differentiate this work from a straightforward application of standard methods could include significant deviations in the algorithmic development or the analysis of concentration bounds. For instance, the use of fourth-order moments and the suggestion of a more general methodology for producing concentration of measure bounds are noted, but their novelty and impact outside the scope of this paper are not clearly articulated. It is essential for the authors to highlight and clarify any such contributions in their response and the manuscript.
The writing is generally clear, although some aspects feel underdeveloped or disconnected. The analysis in Section 5 appears abbreviated and lacks explicit links back to the IBP model. Furthermore, the interaction between the concentration of measure and the nonparametric nature of the generative model could be more thoroughly explained, including how the size of K relates to the number of samples m. Notational consistency, such as the use of m and n for the number of samples in different sections, should also be ensured.
The experimental section is somewhat underwhelming, with both initial experiments involving data generated from the model, thus not fully exploring the method's performance under more realistic, model-violating conditions. A more detailed comparison with other algorithms in the third experiment could provide valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed spectral algorithm. If the method and analysis are indeed applications of existing machinery, the experiments could offer a significant contribution by shedding light on the appropriateness and limitations of spectral methods.
Several minor points also warrant attention: the reference to [6,7] in relation to the Dirichlet process seems misplaced, a proof remains in the main text despite the statement that all proofs are deferred to the appendix, and there are suggestions for improving clarity and readability in specific sentences and figures. The plots in Figure 1 could be enhanced for better readability, and the rationale behind stopping the MCMC algorithm in Figure 3 should be clarified. Overall, while the topic is of interest, the paper's failure to illuminate the advantages of spectral methods over traditional approaches or to demonstrate significant methodological innovation limits its impact.
