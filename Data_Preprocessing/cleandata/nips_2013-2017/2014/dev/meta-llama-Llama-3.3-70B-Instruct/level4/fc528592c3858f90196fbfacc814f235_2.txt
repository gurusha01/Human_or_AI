This manuscript investigates community detection in stochastic block models within a streaming framework. Driven by the necessity to reduce the input data size for large node numbers, the authors initially explore a subsampling approach, wherein community detection is performed on a random column sample derived from the adjacency matrix. The primary finding is the establishment of a precise threshold for the sampling rate, demonstrating that community recovery with a vanishing error rate is impossible below this critical threshold. Conversely, a modified spectral method is proposed and proven to be consistent when the sampling rate surpasses the threshold. This outcome is subsequently utilized to develop a sub-linear memory streaming algorithm that achieves consistency.
The paper tackles a significant problem and is well-structured. The theoretical foundations are rigorous and sharp. Although the algorithms represent modifications of existing spectral methods, their practical applicability is not immediately apparent and lacks demonstration through empirical examples. This research explores network community detection under subsampling and streaming conditions, representing an early yet potentially influential contribution to the field.
