Summary: The authors introduce a novel Newton-like optimization method for the sum of a smooth convex cost function and multiple decomposable norms, contributing an active subspace selection procedure to accelerate the solution of the quadratic approximation problem and providing a convergence proof for this approach. They also present numerical results demonstrating a 10x speedup over state-of-the-art methods for two significant problems, with additional appendix results detailing the speedup contributions from both the quadratic approximation technique and active subspace selection. 
Quality: While the paper is comprehensive, the substantial critical information relegated to the appendix suggests it may be more appropriate for a journal publication, where reviewers can thoroughly examine all proofs, rather than a conference setting with an 8-page review limit.
Clarity: The paper is well-organized and clearly written, although a few minor adjustments could enhance clarity. Suggestions include numbering references sequentially, adding a curly bracket to the min function in equation (1) for better readability, and addressing minor typos and notational inconsistencies, such as the subscript of \|x\| in line 114, the introduction of the over-bar notation on Q in line 259, and clarifying that D does not necessarily need to be diagonal in line 266. Additionally, explaining the relationship between optimizing over the "free" subspace and the whole space in the context of quadratic problems could alleviate confusion between equations 8 and 11. Figure 1 could benefit from explanations of the percentages and times depicted.
Originality: Despite drawing on existing literature, the authors' specific active selection method and convergence proof are novel contributions.
Significance: The demonstrated 10x speedup is noteworthy, indicating the algorithm's potential significance for practitioners. The paper offers substantial theoretical and practical contributions, making it well-written and impactful, albeit more suited to a journal due to its comprehensive nature and the detailed proofs in the appendix.
