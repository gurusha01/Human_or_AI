The paper presents two related algorithms for cluster detection under the stochastic block model, addressing scenarios with partial information or in a data streaming context, where only a subset of the adjacency matrix columns are available or a limited number of input bits are retained for computation.
Strengths:
The work contributes to a recently popular area of research, including data-constrained computation and clustering matrices. The primary algorithm's two-step approach is likely the appropriate method for streaming clustering under the stochastic block model, and explicitly highlighting this emphasizes key points.
Weaknesses:
The algorithm has theoretical significance but relies on unrealistic assumptions for moderately sized real-world networks and fails to perform at critical "boundaries" of edge density, such as extremely sparse graphs. The claims regarding the paper's position within the streaming and community detection literature are overstated.
The algorithm description lacks clarity on its primary objective, which appears to be preserving the structure of the input under the stochastic block model with large blocks, ensuring that sampling does not excessively concentrate certain quantities in empirical estimates. For instance, the trimming step seems to serve this purpose, similar to approaches by Feige, Montaneri, and others.
Additional comments:
(1) The problem formulation is unrealistic for community detection in real-world networks, as it assumes non-overlapping clusters and does not generalize to extremely sparse or dense graphs. The work is better viewed as contributing to recent research on spectral-like algorithms for stochastic block models under computational constraints.
(2) The absence of empirical evaluation is notable, although it may be justified given the potential for trivial or overly idealized results.
(3) The assumption that columns are revealed one by one is strong and facilitates stronger results than if elements or blocks were revealed. More formal data streaming models consider alternative data presentation formats.
(4) The authors' claims of novelty are exaggerated, as a cursory search reveals related work on clustering, partitioning, and community detection, including papers such as FENNEL, Online Analysis of Community Evolution in Data Streams, Streaming Graph Partitioning for Large Distributed Graphs, and Sparse Cut Projections in Graph Streams. While the present paper offers novelty, it is more accurate to describe it as a minor improvement on recent work on stochastic block modeling under memory constraints.
Overall, the paper is reasonable and addresses a topic of interest. If accepted, the authors should revise their claims to be more modest and accurate, and improve the presentation to highlight their contributions.
