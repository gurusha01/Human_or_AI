This paper explores the estimation of complex models, referred to as "dirty models," where the parameter is a sum of simpler parameters, each with its own regularization. The authors propose a subspace selection strategy that enables quadratic approximation, building on the concept of decomposable norms. 
As someone not intimately familiar with this line of research, my comments are based on a general understanding of machine learning and model selection. The work seems to combine existing ideas, such as active subspace selection for nuclear norm minimization and quadratic approximation for sparse inverse covariance estimation, in a more general framework of decomposable norms. While this appears elegant, several questions remain.
The reported 10-fold speedup in the algorithm seems modest, as such improvements can often be achieved through implementation optimizations. A more significant consideration is the ease of optimizing, particularly parallelizing, the most computationally demanding parts of the algorithm. From a practical standpoint, this achievement may not be perceived as substantial.
The theoretical presentation is generally clear, although concise, possibly due to page limitations. However, the writing is not flawless, with language errors that distract and sometimes hinder understanding. The use of citations within sentences is unconventional and creates grammatical issues. Poor punctuation also leads to problems, such as unclear sentence structures. In some cases, sentences are ungrammatical to the point of being incomprehensible.
Embedding formulas within the text poses its own set of challenges, often resulting in awkward formatting, such as lines ending with an equal sign followed by a newline. On page 7, a formula exceeds the margin, as do Figure 1 and Table 1 on page 8.
Typically, papers include a conclusion or discussion section, which is absent here. A discussion on future directions, for instance, would be valuable, as the next steps in this research are not clear.
In Algorithm 1, line 7, the superscript "(t)" likely should be "(r)," and the update of the sum on line 8 appears unusual, as it seems to update an expression rather than a variable.
The theoretical development of using quadratic approximation for dirty models with decomposable regularizers is intriguing, but its practical significance is unclear. To some extent, this work seems to conclude a line of development rather than opening a new, interesting avenue. The editing falls short of expectations.
