Review - Summary:
This study examines the olfactory circuit in locusts, proposing that Kenyon cell (KC) neurons reconstruct odor vector estimates through dynamics in the antennal lobe. The authors suggest that local neuron to projection neuron (LN-PN) connections are updated via independent component analysis (ICA), while projection neuron (PN) dynamics are determined by gradient descent of the dual of a compressed-sensing optimization problem.
The performance of this "reduced dual" circuit is compared to a simple feedforward circuit, demonstrating reasonable performance.
Quality:
The reduced dual circuit hypothesis is intriguing and, if validated, would make for an exceptional paper. The mathematical development is logical and elegant, progressing from basic maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference for odor identification to low-dimensional dynamics of the problem's dual, and ultimately to the reduced dual circuit and learning LN representations via ICA.
However, the plausibility of this hypothesis appears insufficiently explored, lacking compelling comparisons to biological data. Projection neuron dynamics, known for their transient responses to odors, are not adequately addressed. Specifically, do the dynamics of equation 12 yield sensible trajectories? Furthermore, can the physiological and behavioral adaptations of locusts to new odor environments be related to the expectations of equation 16? If such data are unavailable, discussing which expectations of the reduced dual circuit can be tested with existing data and which remain hypothetical would be beneficial. Unfortunately, these concerns are underdeveloped in the paper.
The motivation for focusing on locusts is unclear, as it seems to only constrain the choice of parameters M and N.
Additionally, the paper contains an unfinished figure (line 294).
Clarity:
Section 4 notation can be confusing, with x representing both the odor vector and the KC estimate of the odor. Although this notation is likely a result of developing the general mathematical result first and adding biological mappings later, it may cause slight confusion. Another example is the use of A to represent both the olfactory receptor neuron to glomerulus map and the PN to KC map.
Otherwise, the paper is well-written and clear.
Originality:
To the best of my knowledge, this paper presents an exceptionally original concept.
Significance:
The significance of this study relies heavily on experimental verification. If validated, I believe it has the potential to be a high-impact paper. The use of simple biological constraints to motivate an alternative formulation for a standard optimization problem (compressed sensing) in locust olfaction is elegant. However, verifying the model's expectations with current experimental data would strengthen the paper.
