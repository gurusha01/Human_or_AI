This manuscript introduces an innovative method for column sampling in cases where data point clusters exhibit non-convex hulls, a crucial aspect of selecting a representative subset of data that retains the original dataset's properties. The approach leverages the computation of Zeta hulls, wherein graph cycles are modeled using the sum-product rule and integrated via the Zeta function. The optimization problem is formulated as identifying the subset of points with the most pronounced extremeness, solved efficiently using the anchor graph method. This method enables the reconstruction of the original weighted graph from a limited set of anchors, with a subsequent low-rank approximation of the anchor graph to enhance scalability. A thorough analysis of time and space complexity is also provided.
The methodology is extensively evaluated on both synthetic and real-world data, encompassing text and image classification tasks, with comparisons drawn against several state-of-the-art baseline methods. The results unequivocally demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over existing baseline approaches. Overall, the paper contributes a novel Zeta hull pursuit-based framework for column sampling, showcasing significant performance enhancements over benchmark methods on real-world data.
