This paper presents a Hidden Markov Model (HMM)-based approach for analyzing local field potential data, wherein the brain is assumed to be in one of several discrete states during a given time window. The model then allocates brain regions to specific LFP clusters based on the state, and generates observed data from a Gaussian Process conditioned on the cluster. The authors employ Variational Inference to evaluate the model using three datasets: synthetic data, mouse sleep data, and mouse novel environment data. The model performs exceptionally well on the synthetic data, as expected, while its performance on the other datasets is more challenging to assess due to the inherent complexity of the problem.
The overall quality of this paper is high, featuring intriguing technical developments and a compelling problem domain. The proposed model is well-articulated, and its performance appears to be satisfactory, given the limitations of evaluation. I do not have any significant criticisms of the paper.
In terms of clarity, the paper is exceptionally well-written and easy to follow.
Regarding originality and significance, the paper addresses a crucial problem in the field. While the technical development itself may not be highly original, the application of this class of algorithm to the problem at hand is novel and noteworthy. The authors' proposal of an HMM-based model for LFP data analysis, which assumes a hierarchical structure with region-specific clusters conditioned on a global brain state, is a valuable contribution. The model's performance on the considered datasets is impressive, demonstrating the potential of this approach.
