The authors propose a novel recurrent spiking neural network model for sampling from multivariate probability distributions using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. A significant benefit of this approach lies in its ability to decouple computation and representation, allowing samples from the target distribution to be obtained through a linear decoder applied to the network's response, without requiring direct correspondence between neurons and random variables. This enables the emergence of a complex, distributed spatio-temporal code for representing the underlying distribution. Moreover, the flexibility inherent in the network architecture facilitates the parallel execution of multiple MCMC chains, thereby enabling near-instantaneous approximation of the target distribution.
The theoretical framework is supported by computational simulations that (a) validate the feasibility of the proposed approach, (b) demonstrate the network's inference capabilities in the context of a simple generative model, and (c) compare the network's response characteristics with findings from experimental neuroscience. Additionally, the authors investigate the potential of their approach for identifying properties of the underlying distribution when the linear decoder is unknown, a crucial step towards applying this methodology to experimental data.
Overall, this manuscript presents a valuable contribution to the field, introducing several innovative ideas that will likely resonate with a broad research community. The manuscript is well-written, particularly in its introduction and discussion sections, and the computer simulations and accompanying figures effectively illustrate the network's properties. The work aligns perfectly with the conference's scope.
However, several critical remarks detract from the overall positive impression. 
(A) The manuscript contains instances of missing or extraneous words, which, in some cases, affect the content's clarity, as observed in lines 46, 47, 142, 153, 188, 223, and 386.
(B) The definition of spike trains o_i is absent in line 80, and the reset mechanism, referenced in [6], is not mentioned in the vicinity of line 140.
(C) The derivation provided is highly condensed, necessitating reference to [6-8] for a comprehensive understanding. Furthermore, important details, such as the generative model definition, are relegated to the supplementary information (SI). Critical parameters of the simulations, including the number of neurons, decoding matrix in Fig 1, lambda, tau_slow, etc., are not specified, rendering the verification of results challenging. It is essential to include these details in the SI to enhance transparency and reproducibility.
(D) While the network accommodates a high degree of freedom in the recurrent weight matrices, the connections are symmetric, at least in the Gaussian case. This limitation should be explicitly acknowledged.
(E) The accuracy of all equations should be verified. For instance, in line 141, it appears that the summation should be over the first index of the decoder. Additionally, the sparseness parameter lambda influences the spike response but does not feature in other equations to account for this effect, which may require clarification. Similarly, the time constant tauslow, which scales the recurrent weights and drift, lacks specification, raising questions about its arbitrariness or potential equivalence to tauv.
In summary, the manuscript attempts to address multiple research questions within a limited page count, which compromises the clarity of individual sections. The derivation, based on certain approximations, would benefit from an exploration of its range of validity. The multi-chain sampler, an intriguing aspect of this work, deserves more comprehensive treatment. Despite these criticisms, the manuscript is considered a valuable contribution to the conference, pending the authors' addressing of the aforementioned issues. It is anticipated that future research can delve deeper into the ideas presented here, potentially leading to more detailed investigations in follow-up papers. This manuscript, with its introduction of highly interesting ideas, has the potential to make a significant impact, provided that the identified presentation deficits are rectified in the final version.
