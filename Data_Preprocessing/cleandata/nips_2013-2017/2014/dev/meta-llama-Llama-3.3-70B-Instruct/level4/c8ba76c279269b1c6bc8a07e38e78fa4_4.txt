This paper presents a novel circuit model for odor decoding in locusts, comprising an inferential component and a read-out mechanism. The model proposes that PN and LN neurons in the antennal lobe collaborate to perform inferential computations, while Kanyon cells in the mushroom body are responsible for reading out distinct odors. The development of a mathematical model of the circuit's computation was informed by biological data, resulting in the formulation of a reduced dual circuit. This circuit utilizes a recurrent network involving PN cells (lambda), glomerulus activity (y), and LN neurons, which implement the B matrix, to infer and represent odors in a distributed manner. The projection from PN activity to KC enables the odor to be read out in a sparse representation, with each KC corresponding to approximately one or a few odors. Although similar ideas regarding the olfactory circuit have been previously suggested by G. Laurent and colleagues, this study is notable for integrating the entire computational circuit into a coherent functional and mathematical framework. The use of PN and LN cells in a recurrent circuit for inference is a key insight, driven by a thorough consideration of biological facts. This model provides substantial insight into our understanding of olfactory computation, with a rigorous and plausible mathematical foundation. Furthermore, the proposed connections from LN to PN and their relationship to the projection from PN to KC yield concrete, testable predictions. While certain aspects of this dense paper may require clarification, the work is undoubtedly original and significant, offering a innovative mathematical model of the olfactory computation circuit that balances computational functions with biological facts, and yields profound insights into the workings of olfactory circuits.
