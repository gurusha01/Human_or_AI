This manuscript presents an application of the method-of-moments technique to inference in the Indian Buffet Process (IBP), a significant nonparametric Bayesian model with numerous applications. Current sampling-based inference methods are computationally intensive, whereas the proposed method-of-moments approach, built upon the tensor decomposition method from [6], offers a more efficient alternative. The key contributions of this paper include: a moment analysis for the IBP that underpins the proposed method, an examination of the computational and sample complexity of the proposed inference technique, and a demonstration of its efficacy on synthetic and image recovery problems, showcasing a favorable comparison to the "infinite variational approach".
The paper is well-structured and effectively motivated. A notable insight from this work is the perspective of nonparametric models as "effectively parametric" models, enabling a "parameter estimation" approach to inference, similar to the approach taken in [7] for inference in the mixed-membership block model. This concept is worth promoting, and the present paper successfully accomplishes this.
The primary technical contribution lies in the moment analysis for the IBP, which reveals that the third and fourth order moments may lack certain components due to "dish probabilities", yet collectively contain all components. The concentration inequalities, although fairly standard, exhibit a slight improvement over the loose analysis in [23], while the error analysis largely follows [23,8]. However, much of the discussion in Section 4 regarding the utilization of random projections and the "projected" tensor power method is derived from [6] and should be properly attributed.
Several clarifications are required: the notation "z ~ IBP(z)" on Line 91 is unclear, the term "(...)_epsilon" on Line 223 lacks definition, the reference to the "average-median theorem" on Line 283 is unclear, and the phrase "convexity of expectations" on Line 582 likely refers to Jensen's inequality and the convexity of the Euclidean norm.
Having considered the author rebuttal, in summary, this paper provides a well-written description of using a method-of-moments based on tensor decompositions for inference in a particular nonparametric Bayesian model (IBP). Although the technical novelty is limited, the paper remains an interesting contribution that should be of interest to the machine learning community.
