This paper proposes a spectral method framework for inference in non-parametric models, specifically the Indian Buffet Process (IBP) and its variants, including the Linear Gaussian Latent Factor Model and the Infinite Sparse Factor Analysis model. The authors demonstrate the efficiency of this framework by characterizing moments and identifying model parameters, handling non-identifiability issues in higher-order moments. The method is shown to be more efficient than Variational and MCMC inference, with extensive derivations and proofs provided in the appendix.
The paper builds upon existing spectral approaches, extending them to the IBP and providing a detailed mathematical analysis. The method appears to be simple to implement and effective in practice, which may lead to its adoption by other researchers, potentially having a substantial impact. However, it would be beneficial to compare the accuracy of the spectral approach to a full MCMC procedure, particularly in terms of how the method performs when the MCMC procedure is run for an extended period.
The experiments indicate that the spectral method is more efficient than Variational inference, but a more comprehensive comparison to MCMC inference is needed, including an evaluation of the method's accuracy on real-world data, such as the gene expression data. Additionally, the determination of the dimensionality K in Algorithm 1 relies on a truncation of eigenvalues, and further discussion on the influence of this truncation and the choice of epsilon would improve the paper.
The orthogonal tensor decomposition requires multiple random initializations, and it is unclear how many are needed in practice and how severely local optima impact the results. Minor comments include clarifying notation, such as the use of scalars and vectors, and addressing typos in the appendix, including equation numbering and notation consistency. Furthermore, explaining the Poly(.) notation and providing more context for the truncation level in practice would enhance the paper's clarity.
Overall, the authors provide a useful and efficient inference framework, but addressing the aforementioned concerns and providing more comprehensive comparisons to existing methods would strengthen the paper. The spectral approach appears to be accurate and efficient, but its accuracy compared to more exhaustive MCMC procedures remains to be fully explored, particularly in determining model orders in non-parametric models.
