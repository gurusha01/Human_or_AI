This paper presents a novel perspective on discriminative clustering, wherein the authors conceptualize a classifier that distinguishes between cluster classes and establish a bound for the resultant generalization error. This bound is then optimized using a clustering algorithm, specifically a belief-propagation based method.
A key distinguishing feature of this work is the reformulation of the cost function into a unique similarity measure, leveraging a kernel density estimate to circumvent parameter search issues. Although parameters are still present, they are limited to balance parameters and a variance parameter for the kernel density function.
In my opinion, this idea has merit, particularly in reducing the number of parameters required for discriminative clustering, and provides a clearer understanding of the optimization objective of the clustering algorithm.
However, the paper's practical implications are not as thoroughly explored. The primary comparison is made to an exemplar-based clustering approach, which seems unusual given the paper's claim of requiring fewer parameters than other discriminative clustering methods. A more comprehensive comparison to methods like MM clustering or information-theoretic approaches would have been more informative. The space devoted to proving the consistency of the kernel density estimate could have been allocated to such a comparison, as the consistency results largely follow from existing knowledge.
I found the paper challenging to read due to the excessive notation used to explain the core concepts. A concise, summary-style explanation of the algorithm, consolidating all the components, would have been beneficial. While I understand how the various pieces fit together, I had to dedicate time to tracing the usage of parameters, including the variance parameter h, within the overall algorithm.
Ultimately, this is a reasonable idea worthy of consideration, but it would benefit from a more rigorous experimental evaluation to fully demonstrate its potential.
