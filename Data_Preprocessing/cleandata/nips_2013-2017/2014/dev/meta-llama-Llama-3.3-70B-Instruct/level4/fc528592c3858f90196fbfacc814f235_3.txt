The paper presents a comprehensive analysis of SBM estimation algorithms in two distinct settings: partial information, where only a subset of columns in the adjacency matrix are observable, and streaming, where columns are observed sequentially. The authors establish information-theoretic lower bounds and conduct an asymptotic analysis of the estimation algorithms. However, the absence of a simulation study is a notable concern, particularly since some algorithms involve tuning parameters that may be challenging to set.
In terms of quality, although I am not an expert in SBM theory and therefore cannot assess the proofs, I found the presentation to be generally accessible. The theoretical framework appears to be thorough, with information-theoretic lower bounds being nicely complemented by algorithmic upper bounds. The extension of Algorithms 1 and 2 to Algorithms 3 and 4, which establishes a clear connection between the streaming and partial-information settings, is a notable strength. My primary concern lies in the lack of empirical validation, especially for Algorithms 3 and 4, which require tuning parameters that may exhibit high sensitivity.
The paper is well-written in most sections, but there are noticeable discrepancies in writing quality across different paragraphs, suggesting multiple authors. The distinction between Algorithms 3 (offline streaming) and 4 (online streaming) is not clearly articulated, with relevant information scattered throughout Section 4. A summary paragraph highlighting the differences between these algorithms would be beneficial.
Given my limited familiarity with the theoretical SBM literature, the paper appears to address atypical settings, suggesting a degree of originality. The significance of the paper would be substantial if the authors could demonstrate the practicality of their algorithms through simulation studies. However, without such validation, the applicability of these algorithms, particularly those with tuning parameters, remains uncertain.
Minor suggestions include verifying the supplementary material for a precise comparison of performance guarantees between the authors' methods and streaming PCA, as claimed on page 8, and revising the abstract to clearly indicate the theoretical nature of the paper and the absence of simulation studies. The paper offers valuable theoretical insights into network clustering under the SBM model with limited or sequential information. Nonetheless, the omission of even a basic simulation study, coupled with the presence of tuning parameters in certain algorithms, raises questions about their practical feasibility.
