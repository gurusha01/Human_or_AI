This manuscript employs spike frequency adaptation (SFA) to achieve anticipative tracking within a Continuous Attractor Neural Network (CANN) framework. 
The concept of anticipative tracking is noteworthy, as neural delays inherent in perceiving moving objects result in a inherent lag between perception and reality. 
The authors demonstrate that incorporating SFA enables effective anticipative tracking across a broad spectrum of velocities. 
The paper is well-structured and, to the best of my knowledge, presents original, intriguing findings with satisfactory performance. 
I suggest that this paper be included in the conference proceedings, as it offers novel, interesting results that are clearly presented and appear to perform well.
