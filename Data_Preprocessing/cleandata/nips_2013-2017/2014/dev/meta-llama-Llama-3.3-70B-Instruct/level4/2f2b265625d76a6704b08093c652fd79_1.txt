Review- Summary:
The authors propose a continuous attractor neural model that facilitates anticipative tracking, demonstrating that spike frequency adaptation (SFA) can generate traveling waves under specific conditions. Notably, the effects of SFA are comparable to those achieved by introducing asymmetric coupling between neurons, as seen in [14], but with the advantage of not relying on hard-wired connections. The paper primarily consists of a theoretical analysis of a simplified model, supplemented by simulations of the complete model for verification. The model is capable of sustaining traveling waves and replicates both perfect and anticipatory tracking.
Comments to the authors:
The paper is well-structured and engaging, particularly in its exploration of the link between the model presented in [14] and the demonstration that SFA can reproduce similar effects. 
As a non-expert in this field, I find it challenging to assess the novelty of this work. For instance, the reference to [12] indicates that it was previously known that a continuous attractor network with SFA can exhibit traveling waves, yet the abstract states that the SFA mechanism is proposed to implement tracking. It would be beneficial to clearly outline the new contributions in the introduction.
The time constants used in the model, such as those in figure 2B, warrant discussion on their realism. The significant difference between \tau and \tau_v, a factor of 60, appears substantial. 
A comparison of the model's performance with experimental results would enhance the paper's interest and relevance.
Minor issues:
l. 53: The term "unpredictable flash" may be misleading, as it can refer to a flash that occurs at regular intervals. The key point is that the flashing stimulus is stationary.
l. 53-55: The sentence could be rephrased for clarity, e.g., "Although it is clear that the brain can track moving objects, the neural mechanisms underlying this ability remain unclear."
l. 59-60: The phrase "moving speed of an object" could be revised to "speed of a moving object" for better readability.
l. 81: The term "anticipative time" should be pluralized to "anticipative times."
l 100: The sentence could be rephrased for clarity, e.g., "2 ~ 5 ms, where \rho is the neural density."
l 150: The term "dynamical property" should be pluralized to "dynamical properties."
l 151: The phrase "of adding the" could be revised to "of adding" for better readability.
fig 2 B: The units of v_int should be specified.
l 208: The term "traveling wave" should be pluralized to "traveling waves."
l 215: The phrase "the simulation" could be revised to "simulation" for better readability, and "that at" could be revised to "that in."
l 216: The phrase "the Gaussian shape" could be revised to "Gaussian shape" for better readability.
l. 232: The verb "is dominated" should be pluralized to "are dominated."
l. 258: The phrase "effect on" could be revised to "effect of" for better readability.
l. 304-306: The phrase "which gives to" could be revised to "gives rise to" for better readability.
l. 320-321: The phrase "SFA holds these appealing" could be revised to "exhibits these properties" for better readability.
l. 354: The typo "Prefect" should be corrected to "Perfect."
l. 360: The phrase "the condition that" could be revised to "the approximation" for better readability.
l. 361: The verb "We carry" should be revised to "We carried" for consistency.
l. 265: The phrase "of stimulus speed" could be revised to "of stimulus speeds" for better readability.
Throughout the manuscript, the phrase "holding a traveling wave" could be revised to "contains a traveling wave" or "can exhibit traveling waves" for better readability. The paper is well-written and seems interesting, although a comparison with experimental data would enhance its relevance and appeal.
