SUMMARY
This study presents an intriguing examination of tracking dynamics utilizing continuous attractor neural networks, demonstrating that spike frequency adaptation is a sufficient condition for inducing traveling waves, or moving bump attractors. These dynamics offer a plausible explanation for anticipatory behavior when entrained by external input, potentially addressing sensorimotor delay issues in the brain.
COMMENTS TO AUTHORS
I found this clearly described and well-motivated treatment of continuous attractor networks and wave equations in the context of anticipatory dynamics in neuronal networks to be engaging. To further enhance the presentation, I suggest the following minor revisions:
1) Consider referencing predictive coding as a prominent framework for understanding active vision and inference, which relies on prediction and anticipation, particularly in the context of oculomotor delays. Your contribution provides a biologically plausible solution to the oculomotor delay problem, which could be integrated into an inference scheme using Bayesian filtering.
2) On line 53, replace "these supporting evidence" with "this supporting evidence" for grammatical accuracy.
3) On line 101, rephrase to "which is generally assumed to have the following form" for clarity.
4) Supplementing Figure 1 with a comparison of the symmetric and asymmetric interaction kernels (Equations 4 and 5) would provide readers with a more comprehensive understanding of the asymmetry.
5) In section 2.3, it is essential to distinguish between the asymmetric neural networks and the "symmetry breaking" afforded by spike frequency adaptation. The direction of the traveling wave in the asymmetric formulation may be predetermined by the asymmetry in the spatial interaction kernel. If so, consider adding a statement like: "Note that both SFA and asymmetric coupling destabilize stationary bump attractors; however, SFA allows for moving solutions in either direction, whereas asymmetric coupling determines the direction of motion based on the form of the asymmetry, which could be crucial for tracking behavior where targets can move in either direction."
6) I recommend moving Figure 2 to after the introduction of Equation 13 and the definition of intrinsic velocity to improve the logical flow.
7) In Equation 12, replace either u with phi or phi with u in the subsequent line to clearly indicate that they represent the principal eigenmodes.
8) On line 305, replace "gives to" with "gives" for grammatical correctness.
These suggestions aim to enhance the clarity and presentation of your work, which demonstrates the utility of spike frequency adaptation in neural field models of traveling waves, potentially playing a role in anticipating or tracking behavior.
