SUMMARY
This manuscript presents a customized variational approach for inverting state-space models of spectral density embedded in LFP time-series data. Notably, it introduces a tailored variational inversion method utilizing a hidden Markov model of discrete brain states that generate activity, where the form of spectral responses is characterized by a Gaussian process model for the time-series. While this application of variational Bayes is intriguing, it may benefit from being contextualized within the broader framework of dynamical causal modeling and its application to neurobiological time-series.
COMMENTS TO AUTHORS
This detailed description of a variational state-space model inversion for time-series is both interesting and technically impressive. To further enhance the manuscript, consider contextualizing it within the broader context of dynamic causal modeling and highlighting the potential utility of the proposed scheme. The following suggestions may be useful:
1) In the field of neuroscience, variational inversion of state-space models for electrophysiological time-series is often described in terms of dynamic causal modeling. A review of the literature on dynamic causal modeling of cross-spectral density, which has been applied to multi-region LFP time-series and MEG, may be beneficial. The unique contribution of this work lies in its formulation of a state-space model based on a hidden Markov model, contrasting with traditional DCMs that rely on differential equations. This distinction is particularly noteworthy for applications such as sleep staging or endogenous transitions among brain states.
2) The description of the generative model is tailored for a machine learning audience, with terminology such as spectral mixture kernel and Gaussian processes. However, this may cause confusion among engineers, signal processing specialists, and neurobiologists. Providing a glossary or linking the terminology to more standard concepts may be helpful. For instance, the Fourier transform of the spectral mixture corresponds to the auto-covariance function, and the term "kernel" has a colloquial usage that differs from its meaning in other fields, where it refers to the impulse response function or first-order Volterra kernel.
3) When introducing the bound on model evidence or marginal likelihood, consider describing it as the variational free energy. This will facilitate connections between the use of variational free energy in dynamic causal modeling and the current application.
4) To demonstrate the potential usefulness of the approach, consider emphasizing the clusters implicit in the sleep data. For example: "To illustrate the potential importance of our Bayes-optimal state-space model inversion, we can relate the identified clusters during sleep to classical sleep staging schemes, comprising four distinct states. By examining the similarity between the identified clusters (spectral mixtures) and classic spectral profiles, we can decompose stage four into three sub-stages..." Providing a proof of principle that the approach can yield novel insights beyond existing knowledge would be valuable.
MINOR POINTS
1) In the abstract, consider rephrasing to: "The model is capable of estimating the number of brain states..."
2) On page 2, clarify the reference to "the above two methods" by rephrasing to: "More recently, new methods for tensor factorization have been developed; in reference 7, tensor factorization was applied to short-term FFT..." to avoid ambiguity.
3) Below Equation 6, rephrase to: "The parameters describe the auto-correlation content associated with each y" to accurately convey that the characterization is in the time domain, using spectral mixtures to provide constraints on the Gaussian process.
4) At the top of page 8, clarify the prediction results of Table 1, specifically the held-out log predictive probability for different priors, by specifying the probability distribution over which this is calculated.
5) Address the crucial issue in the generative model regarding the accommodation of cross-spectra or cross-covariance functions, which are typically considered in state-space models of spectral density. Acknowledge that the current model does not account for complex cross-spectra and suggest potential extensions in this direction.
6) In the supplementary material, when discussing updates for global probability vectors, mention that using point estimates eliminates the need to consider the entropy of the posterior distribution implicit in the variational free energy, allowing for the direct use of the log posterior.
These comments are intended to be helpful should revisions be necessary. The proposed variational scheme for state-space models, based on a hidden Markov model and a spectral mixture model of electrophysiological time-series, is intriguing and may have applications in sleep staging and classification of epileptic discharges, despite its limited biological plausibility.
