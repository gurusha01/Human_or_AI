The manuscript presents an intriguing model for analyzing brain states from multi-region LFP time-series data, which is segmented into distinct time-windows. Each window's observations are modeled using an infinite mixture of Gaussian Processes, with brain states assigned via an underlying Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP) and brain regions clustered using another HDP. The paper's originality and clarity are notable, but the results' interpretation requires refinement. Specific concerns are outlined below:
a) Clarification on the algorithm used for time-window separation is essential, as it significantly impacts the results.
The distinction between brain connectivity and brain states should be explicitly made, such as at Line 41.
The statement at Line 100, "each window is considered a single observation," lacks clear meaning without summarizing observations within each window using a statistic.
Lines 098 and following exhibit notation confusion: are windows region-specific, as implied by "For each region, the time-series is split...," or common across regions, as suggested by the model formulation?
At Line 107, the definition and selection of L should be provided.
In Line 113, Equation (1) should explicitly define \lambda_g^{(a)}, clarifying whether it's a vector across states or animals, which only becomes clear at Line 124.
Once Equation (6) is established, the induced joint distribution over all windows loses its block diagonal structure and becomes ill-defined due to a non-semi-definite positive joint covariance matrix. This limitation, which renders the infinite mixture of Gaussian Processes non-process-like, should be acknowledged.
In Section 2.2, Gaussian Processes might not be ideal for describing brain connectivity within each state, as their covariance function relies on few parameters and cannot capture the brain's sparse pattern, even when coupled across regions. This limitation should be recognized.
Section 2.3 seems unnecessary, as the tensor characterization of decomposing a matrix of latent probabilities deep in the hierarchy appears unwarranted.
At Line 414, the repeated statement (see Line 410) is weakly explained. The results may depend on the clustering mechanism choice, and it's known that the Dirichlet Process shouldn't be used absolutely for cluster analysis (Antoniak, 1974; Miller and Harrison, 2013). Moreover, fixing the Dirichlet Process parameters (Line 333) undermines the conclusions' support.
The significance of the "network" at Line 418, in relation to existing literature, should be clarified. Overall, the paper is interesting, original, and well-written, but interpreting the results requires improvement.
