This manuscript introduces a novel approach to non-convex hull learning, aiming to identify a compact set of representative data points through column sampling. The key concept revolves around selecting hull points based on structural complexity scores derived from graph computations utilizing zeta functions. To mitigate the computational complexity associated with matrix inversion in the naive implementation, the authors propose an extension leveraging anchor graphs. The paper is well-structured, and the proposed methodology appears to be innovative. Empirical evaluations across multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed technique.
However, it is unclear whether the authors have considered the robustness of their algorithm to noisy or outlier data points. A potential concern is that the algorithm may inadvertently select such points, which are not ideal for column sampling. Furthermore, it would be beneficial to explore the relationship between the proposed method and Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs), which also focus on subset selection but with an emphasis on diversity. Investigating this connection could provide valuable insights.
The manuscript presents an interesting method for column sampling via non-convex hull learning, utilizing zeta functions. The work is likely to be of interest to the NIPS community. Nevertheless, discussing the relationship between the proposed technique and other subset selection methods, such as DPPs, would enhance the manuscript's strength and provide a more comprehensive understanding of its contributions.
