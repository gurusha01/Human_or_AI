This paper endeavors to establish a connection between sparse optimization techniques and the anatomical structure of the locust's early olfactory system, motivated by the observation that odorant molecules are sparsely represented by the population of Kenyon cells. The authors initially formulate the olfactory system as a Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) decoder and provide the standard solution without considering biological constraints. They then reformulate the olfactory system model as a decoder of a compressive sensing problem, offering two standard solutions to the dual problem. The authors argue that each component in the solution can be mapped to a unit of the biological structure in the olfactory system, although these mappings are described without robust justification and are plagued by conceptual issues in linking the mathematical formulations to the biological context.
To enhance reader understanding, further clarification is necessary on several points:
- The modeling of Local Neurons (LNs) and Kenyon Cells (KCs) using a Heaviside function is widely accepted, but the modeling of Projection Neurons (PNs) output as the Lagrange multiplier is not intuitive and requires justification. Specifically, the computation of PNs output via the gradient descent method in equations (10) and (16) for the full and reduced dual algorithms, respectively, necessitates iteration to reach an optimal solution. However, it is unclear how PNs perform this gradient descent and iteration mechanism. A significant concern is that the solution to equation (10) may yield negative values, whereas the PN output rate (lambda) must be positive.
- The introduction of the B matrix to replace the A matrix aims to incorporate the role of LNs into the solution. Nevertheless, it is unclear why the solution to equation (12) with the B matrix is equivalent to the solution to equation (10) with the A matrix. It is essential to demonstrate that the lambda computed by equation (12) converges to the one computed by equation (10). Additionally, the B matrix is square, implying that the numbers of PNs and LNs are equal, which is not the case since there are more PNs than LNs. The performance of the reduced dual circuit when the B matrix is not square but rectangular, with dimensions reflecting the ratio of LNs to PNs, needs to be evaluated.
- Furthermore, the B matrix is not fixed and must be learned for each new input, as shown in Figure 3, where the proposed method sometimes fails to learn the B matrix accurately. The performance of the reduced dual circuit when the B matrix is poorly learned requires investigation. Moreover, the B matrix needs to be learned before being used for readout by KCs. Although the authors propose a procedure to combine learning and readout, it lacks justification and simulation, making it challenging to assess its correctness.
The authors suggest a structural relationship between the connectivity of PNs and KCs and the A matrix. However, a recent article by Caron et al. (2013) argues that similar connectivity in Drosophila is random. It is essential to address whether this randomness also applies to locusts.
In terms of originality, the paper attempts to bridge an optimization method with the neural circuit of an insect's olfactory system, which is a novel approach. However, the clarity of the paper is sometimes compromised, giving the impression that it was prepared hastily, with the main message not being immediately clear.
The quality of the paper is impacted by the need for the authors to demonstrate that the mapping between the sparse optimization solution and the neural circuit is sensible and that the proposed methods effectively solve the decoding problem.
Several minor errors were noted, including typographical mistakes (e.g., "continuosly" instead of "continuously," "multpliers" instead of "multipliers," "inhibtory" instead of "inhibitory," "odor-evoekd" instead of "odor-evoked," "hte" instead of "the," "intepreted" instead of "interpreted," "perfomance" instead of "performance," and "matrics" instead of "matrices") and incorrect references (e.g., "(B)" instead of "(C)").
Ultimately, the paper falls short in both mathematical rigor and the questionable linkage between mathematical formulations and biological principles.
