The manuscript "Zeta Hull Pursuits: Learning Non-convex Data Hulls" tackles the issue of column sampling in datasets by identifying points that minimally alter the Ihara zeta function of a graph, presumably constructed using a kernel. The authors establish fundamental properties of the zeta function and its response to vertex removal, leveraging these insights to develop a fast greedy algorithm for selecting outlier vertices and a more efficient variant utilizing anchors. They demonstrate the potential of these points to enhance classification accuracy on standard datasets.
The paper is well-structured and clearly written, with only minor typographical errors. Upon reviewing the proofs, no errors were found. However, the motivation behind the method may not be sufficiently compelling to warrant acceptance, despite its novelty.
The authors hint at the method's applicability to data summarization without assuming preservation of the convex hull or inscribing ellipsoids, which is arguably the paper's primary strength. They achieve representative point selection in a combinatorial manner. Nevertheless, the rationale behind employing the zeta function is not entirely clear. A more convincing argument for using points that minimize the epsilon objective, potentially through learning non-convex hulls (a concept that remains undefined), would have strengthened the review.
Furthermore, the technical contributions presented in the theorems may not be substantial enough to garner significant attention. Theorem 1 essentially reiterates an established fact about the determinant form of the zeta function, generalized to weighted graphs. Theorems 2 and 3 are straightforward consequences of matrix algebra and singular value decomposition.
In summary, while the paper is well-written, organized, and presents a novel method, the justification and motivation for the approach are not adequately defended, which raises concerns about its overall impact.
