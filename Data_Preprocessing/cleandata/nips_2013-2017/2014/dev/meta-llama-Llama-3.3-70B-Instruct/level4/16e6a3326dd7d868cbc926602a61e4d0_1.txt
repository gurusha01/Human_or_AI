This manuscript examines the deployment of a sensor network, comprising agents that communicate locally, in a noisy environment. The authors demonstrate that theoretical limits on active queries can be attained via straightforward best response dynamics.
The paper is exceptionally well-structured, technically sound, and features a synthetic experiment that effectively clarifies the findings. The theoretical contributions are innovative, and in my opinion, the manuscript warrants publication in NIPS.
To enhance the paper's context and readability, it would be beneficial to include citations and comparisons to recent NIPS publications that have established theoretical guarantees for active learning under noisy conditions, specifically:
1. "Near-optimal Bayesian active learning with noisy observations" by Golovin et al. (NIPS 2010).
2. "Extensions of generalized binary search to group identification and exponential costs" by Bellala et al. (NIPS 2010). This paper presents groundbreaking and intriguing theoretical results for a sensor network in equilibrium within a consensus game, achieved through simple best response dynamics in a noisy setting.
