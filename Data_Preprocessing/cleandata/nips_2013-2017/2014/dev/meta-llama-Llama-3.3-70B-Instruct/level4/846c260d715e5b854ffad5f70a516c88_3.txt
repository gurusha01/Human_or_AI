The authors have successfully developed spectral algorithms for the models presented in [18] and [24] by establishing a general framework for the Indian Buffet Process (IBP) and applying it, with Algorithm 1 providing a detailed outline of their approach, which is indeed impressive.
However, Theorem 3, although a challenging result, has limited practical implications, essentially suggesting that the method will eventually work, thereby emphasizing the need for experimental validation. It would be beneficial to provide insight into the nature of the polynomial involved.
The experimental component of the paper examines toy data from [18] and a gene expression data problem, yielding results that are suggestive but not conclusive. To strengthen the paper, more comprehensive comparisons are necessary.
In comparison to the original papers, such as [24], the experimental work presented appears to meet the standards of illustrative examples for new models. Nevertheless, a more thorough comparison with the original work is required to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The experiments are limited to a few toy examples, and the interesting result in Fig. 4 is not replicated for MCMC, raising questions about its scalability.
For instance, the work by Reed and Ghahramani (ICML 2013) provides a compelling example of how to conduct a thorough comparison of algorithms on realistic datasets, including an analysis of computational complexity.
Regarding the introductory statement that "the issue of spectral inference in Dirichlet Processes is largely settled [6,7]," this claim is not supported by the cited references.
In Equations (2) and (3), it appears that the authors are referring to IBP(Î±). While the spectral algorithm itself, along with its convergence result, is impressive, the experimental comparison is limited to toy data. Given that the theoretical framework provides vague performance guarantees, more rigorous experimental work is needed, especially when compared to the standards set by Reed and Ghahramani (2013).
