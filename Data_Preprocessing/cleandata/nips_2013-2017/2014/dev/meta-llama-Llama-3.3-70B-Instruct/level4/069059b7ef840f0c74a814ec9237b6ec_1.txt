This manuscript presents a novel pairwise clustering framework, wherein nonparametric pairwise similarity is obtained by minimizing the generalization error of an unsupervised nonparametric classifier. The proposed framework effectively bridges the gap between clustering and multi-class classification, providing an explanation for the widely used kernel similarity in clustering contexts. Furthermore, the authors demonstrate that the generalization error bound for the unsupervised plug-in classifier is asymptotically equivalent to the weighted volume of the cluster boundary under low-density separation. By leveraging the derived nonparametric pairwise similarity based on the plug-in classifier, the authors introduce a new nonparametric exemplar-based clustering method, which exhibits enhanced discriminative capability compared to existing exemplar-based clustering approaches.
Several observations and suggestions are noted:
1. Equation (6), which estimates the regression function, appears to be missing a \pi^{(i)} term in the numerator, similar to the expression found in line 123.
2. In Lemma 2, the kernel bandwidth is denoted as h, but it should be represented as h_n for consistency.
3. A minor typo is present in line 63, where the phrase "double the" can be removed for clarity.
4. The theoretical contributions of this work are noteworthy, particularly the connection to low-density separation, which is a compelling aspect of the research.
5. Although the theoretical foundations are sound, the application of these results to develop a new nonparametric exemplar-based clustering algorithm seems somewhat complex.
In conclusion, this paper presents an interesting and valuable contribution to the field, offering a unique perspective on clustering and classification.
