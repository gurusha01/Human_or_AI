The proposed method, although straightforward, effectively addresses the problem at hand with elegance. However, the lack of sufficient experimental validation prevents this paper from being a straightforward acceptance.

A more detailed examination of noise in the exploration phase of Algorithm 1 (step 8) would be beneficial. Unfortunately, this aspect is not explored in the experiments section, including the amount of noise utilized.
I also encountered several issues with some of the claimed advantages presented in the paper. Notably:
(1) The assertion that PDDP has an advantage over PILCO due to the avoidance of non-convex optimization problems is questionable, given the non-convex nature of the optimization problem addressed in the hyper-parameter tuning step.
(2) The claim that PDDP's complexity is independent of the state's dimensionality appears inaccurate. Although it may not affect the computational complexity of the policy learning step, it undoubtedly influences the computation of kernel matrices necessary for GP inferences. This point should be clarified in the final version.
(3) The statement on line 364 that PDDP maintains a fixed data size seems accurate only in the special case where I_max = 1, i.e., when trajectory collection and optimization are not iterated.
My primary concern with the paper lies in the experimental results, which are not particularly strong. Firstly, a comparison of the total cost between PILCO and PDDP is lacking. Secondly, it would be beneficial to discuss whether there are no straightforward methods to accelerate PILCO. Lastly, GPDDP appears to perform as well as or better than PDDP in every dimension (data efficiency and computational efficiency), which undermines the idea that PDDP offers the benefit of "safe exploration." A discussion of this point would enhance the experiments section. The authors present a compelling approach to combining Gaussian Process Regression and Differential Dynamic Programming, effectively handling the exploration/exploitation tradeoff. The primary drawback of the paper lies in its experimental validation.
