This paper presents a calibrated multivariate regression approach for modeling high-dimensional data, accompanied by a computational method to solve the associated optimization problem. The key aspects of the paper are addressed in the following comments:
1. The primary enhancement of the proposed model lies in the substitution of the Frobenius norm with the L_{2,1} norm, where calibration effectively replaces variance with standard deviation. Although numerical experiments demonstrate the impact of this substitution, it would be beneficial for the authors to provide a theoretical or intuitive rationale explaining why standard deviation yields better results than variance.
2. The numerical experiments incorporate matrix DI to illustrate the effects of varying noise levels. However, the range of DI considered in the experiments is relatively narrow. It would be informative to investigate how the results change when the range of D_I is significantly broader. Furthermore, Table 4.1 shows the impact of varying lambda over a wide range; would similar outcomes be observed if this range were extended?
3. Several typographical errors were noted, including the omission of a lambda in equation (1.2).
While the manuscript is well-organized and clearly written, it suffers from a lack of novelty and insufficient experimental validation, which detracts from its overall impact.
