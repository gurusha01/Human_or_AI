This manuscript investigates multi-view face recognition in controlled settings, proposing a novel multi-layer multi-view perceptron (MVP) network that extracts identity and view angle representations from a single 2D image using both deterministic and random neurons. The MVP network is capable of generating new views of faces from a single 2D image by sequencing view representations. To learn the MVP, the authors derive a Monte Carlo Expectation Maximization (MCEM) procedure, assuming the output face follows a conditional diagonal Gaussian distribution, and train it on 200 individuals from the MultiPIE dataset. The learned identity features are then used for classification of the remaining 137 individuals via Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), achieving performance comparable to recent convolutional neural network-based methods.
The paper introduces a unique MVP network for disentangling face identity and view angle representations, utilizing identity features in LDA for multi-view face recognition. By varying the view angle feature in the MVP, new face views can be synthesized. Overall, the technical approach is robust, albeit with some limitations, and demonstrates competitive performance on the MultiPIE dataset. However, several technical concerns arise, including the method's dependency on well-aligned, normalized 32x32 face images, and the scalability of the approach, as evidenced by the experiments on face recognition among 137 individuals in MultiPIE.
Furthermore, questions remain regarding the assumption of a conditional diagonal Gaussian distribution for the output, the number of training pairs used to learn the MVP from 200 individuals in MultiPIE, and the necessity of sequential synthesis of new face views. The claim that the MVP simulates human brain encoding of view representations is not strongly supported, lacking convincing evidence or discussion on the similarity between the MVP mechanism and human brain function. Therefore, this claim should not be considered a key contribution of the paper.
In conclusion, this is a decent study on MVP learning for multi-view face recognition, with competitive performance on the MultiPIE dataset. However, concerns regarding the method's scalability and its applicability to real-world face recognition systems persist, warranting further investigation.
