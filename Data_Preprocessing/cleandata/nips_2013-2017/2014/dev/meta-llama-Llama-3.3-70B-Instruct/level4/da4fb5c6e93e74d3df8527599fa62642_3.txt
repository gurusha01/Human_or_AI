This manuscript presents a novel approach, termed calibrated multivariate regression (CMR), designed for fitting complex, high-dimensional multivariate regression models. It operates under the premise that the noise matrix exhibits an uncorrelated structure, with varying noise variances across different regression tasks. Unlike traditional methods that employ a uniform tuning parameter, lambda, across all tasks, CMR introduces a calibration mechanism by solving a penalized weighted least square problem, where weights are defined as estimates of noise standard deviation, as outlined in equation (2.3). The paper is well-organized and clearly articulated, with a comprehensive appendix that provides detailed technical insights. The conceptual framework of CMR is technically robust, and the proposed computational algorithms, along with the demonstrated statistical properties, appear logical at a high level, although a thorough verification of each step in the derivation and proof was beyond my expertise. The empirical analysis, conducted on both simulated and real datasets, yielded encouraging results. 
At Line 129, it seems there might be a minor typographical error, where "weighted least square program" could potentially be corrected to "weighted least square problem" for clarity and accuracy.
An alternative, straightforward strategy for calibrating the lambda parameter involves performing multiple regressions on each response variable independently. A comparative analysis between this approach and the proposed CMR, using both simulated and real data, would be insightful. It's worth noting that simpler models can sometimes outperform more complex ones in terms of results interpretability and quality on real-world data. Overall, the CMR method proposed in this paper offers a technically sound concept with promising outcomes, warranting further exploration and comparison with existing methodologies.
