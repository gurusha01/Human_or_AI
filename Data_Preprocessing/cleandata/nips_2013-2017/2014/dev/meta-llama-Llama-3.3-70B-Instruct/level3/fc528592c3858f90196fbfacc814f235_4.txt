This paper proposes a novel deep neural network, called Multi-View Perceptron (MVP), which can disentangle identity and view representations from a single 2D face image and generate a full spectrum of multi-view images. The authors draw inspiration from the primate brain's face-processing network, where neurons are specialized for either view or identity. The MVP model consists of deterministic and random hidden neurons, which learn identity and view features, respectively. The model is trained using a variational lower bound of the complete data log-likelihood, and the authors propose a learning algorithm that combines the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm with back-propagation.
The paper makes several contributions, including the proposal of the MVP model, its learning algorithm, and the demonstration of its effectiveness in face recognition and view estimation tasks. The authors also show that MVP can interpolate and predict images under viewpoints that are not observed in the training data, which is a unique capability of the model.
The strengths of the paper include its novel approach to disentangling identity and view representations, its ability to generate high-quality multi-view images, and its state-of-the-art performance in face recognition tasks. The authors also provide a thorough evaluation of the model, including experiments on face recognition, view estimation, and viewpoint interpolation.
However, there are some weaknesses in the paper. The authors assume that the view factor can be modeled as a continuous variable, which may not always be the case in real-world scenarios. Additionally, the model requires a large amount of training data, which can be a limitation in some applications. The authors also do not provide a detailed comparison with other state-of-the-art methods in face recognition and view estimation tasks.
In terms of quality, the paper is well-written and clearly explains the proposed model and its learning algorithm. The authors provide a thorough evaluation of the model, including experiments on several tasks. However, the paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with other state-of-the-art methods and a discussion of the limitations of the model.
In terms of clarity, the paper is well-organized and easy to follow. The authors provide a clear explanation of the proposed model and its learning algorithm, and the experiments are well-described. However, some of the notation and mathematical derivations could be clarified further.
In terms of originality, the paper proposes a novel approach to disentangling identity and view representations, which is a unique contribution to the field. The authors also demonstrate the effectiveness of the model in several tasks, including face recognition and view estimation.
In terms of significance, the paper has the potential to make a significant impact in the field of computer vision, particularly in face recognition and view estimation tasks. The model's ability to generate high-quality multi-view images and its state-of-the-art performance in face recognition tasks make it a valuable contribution to the field.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, as it makes a significant contribution to the field of computer vision and demonstrates a novel approach to disentangling identity and view representations. However, the authors should address the weaknesses mentioned above, including providing a more detailed comparison with other state-of-the-art methods and discussing the limitations of the model.
