This paper proposes a novel algorithm for optimizing superposition-structured statistical estimators, which combines a quadratic approximation framework with an active subspace selection technique. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on two real-world applications: Gaussian Markov Random Fields with latent variables and multi-task learning with superposition-structured regularizers.
The paper is well-written and provides a clear overview of the proposed algorithm and its theoretical guarantees. The authors also provide an extensive experimental evaluation, comparing their approach to state-of-the-art methods and demonstrating significant improvements in computational efficiency.
One of the key strengths of the paper is its ability to handle complex, high-dimensional problems with multiple regularizers. The authors' use of decomposable norms and active subspace selection allows them to efficiently solve problems that would be intractable using traditional methods.
However, there are some limitations to the paper. The authors' comparison to other methods is limited, and it would be useful to see a more comprehensive evaluation of their approach against other state-of-the-art algorithms. Additionally, the paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the theoretical guarantees, particularly in terms of the convergence rate and the conditions under which the algorithm is guaranteed to converge.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of statistical estimation and optimization, and the proposed algorithm has the potential to be widely applicable in a variety of domains.
