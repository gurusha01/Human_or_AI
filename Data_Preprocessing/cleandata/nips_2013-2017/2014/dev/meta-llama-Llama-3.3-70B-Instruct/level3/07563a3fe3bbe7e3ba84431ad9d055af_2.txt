This paper proposes a novel approach to denoising a highly noisy sensor network using local best-response dynamics, allowing for fast learning from a small number of label queries. The authors provide theoretical guarantees for the denoising power of their approach, as well as experimental results demonstrating its effectiveness.
The paper is well-written and clearly organized, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments. The introduction provides a clear motivation for the problem and a concise overview of the main contributions. The related work section is thorough and provides a good context for the paper.
The technical sections of the paper are sound and well-argued. The authors provide a clear and detailed analysis of the denoising dynamics, including a proof of the positive result for synchronous updates and a negative result for arbitrary-order asynchronous updates. The experimental results are also well-presented and demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in practice.
One potential weakness of the paper is that the choice of 32x32 patch size is not well-justified. The authors could provide more detail on why this patch size was chosen and how it affects the results. Additionally, the paper could benefit from more visual aids, such as pictures or diagrams, to illustrate the convnet during surrogate training and feature extraction.
The paper could also benefit from a more detailed comparison to baseline approaches. For example, the authors could compare their results to a baseline approach using a pre-trained convolutional net on ImageNet and training a linear classifier on top of these features. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed approach.
Furthermore, the paper raises several interesting questions for future work. For example, the authors note that their approach is not robust to adversarial update orders, and it is an open question whether an alternative dynamics could be robust to such orders. Additionally, the authors suggest that an alternative dynamics could achieve better denoising in the region near the decision boundary.
Overall, this is a strong paper that makes a significant contribution to the field of active learning and sensor networks. The authors provide a clear and well-argued presentation of their approach, and the experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness in practice.
