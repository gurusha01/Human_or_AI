This paper proposes a novel proximal Newton framework for optimizing superposition-structured statistical estimators, which are commonly used in high-dimensional problems. The authors develop a quadratic approximation framework with active subspace selection to efficiently solve the optimization problem. The algorithm, called QUIC & DIRTY, is shown to be more than 10 times faster than state-of-the-art first-order methods for latent variable graphical model selection and multi-task learning problems.
The paper is well-organized and clearly written, with a good introduction to the problem and a thorough explanation of the proposed algorithm. The authors provide a detailed analysis of the convergence properties of the algorithm and demonstrate its effectiveness on several real-world applications.
However, there are some concerns regarding the originality and clarity of the paper. The idea of using proximal Newton methods for optimization is not new, and the authors could have done a better job of highlighting the novelty of their approach. Additionally, some of the notation and terminology used in the paper may be unfamiliar to non-experts, which could make it difficult to follow.
In terms of significance, the paper addresses an important problem in high-dimensional statistics and provides a significant improvement over existing methods. The results demonstrated on real-world applications are impressive, and the algorithm has the potential to be widely used in practice.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, but with some revisions to improve clarity and highlight the originality of the approach. The authors should also consider adding more details on the implementation and computational complexity of the algorithm to make it more accessible to a wider audience.
