This paper proposes a new method called Calibrated Multivariate Regression (CMR) for high-dimensional data analysis. CMR calibrates each regression task's loss term with respect to its noise level, which is a significant improvement over existing methods. The authors use a smoothed proximal gradient method to compute CMR's optimal solutions and analyze its statistical properties, providing a comprehensive understanding of the method.
The paper is well-written, and the authors have done a great job in explaining the motivation and methodology behind CMR. The numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of CMR in outperforming other multivariate regression methods, especially in cases where the noise levels vary across tasks. The real-data experiment on brain activity prediction also shows promising results.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a new method that addresses the limitation of existing multivariate regression methods
* A thorough analysis of the statistical properties of CMR
* Numerical experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness of CMR
* A real-data experiment that shows the potential of CMR in a practical application
However, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement:
* The computational complexity of CMR is higher than that of existing methods due to the non-differentiable loss term
* The selection of the tuning parameter in CMR requires careful consideration, and the authors could provide more guidance on this
* The interpretation of using noise levels for calibration in CMR could be more intuitive and easier to understand for non-experts
Overall, I believe that this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of multivariate regression and high-dimensional data analysis. The proposed method, CMR, has the potential to improve the accuracy and robustness of regression models in various applications.
