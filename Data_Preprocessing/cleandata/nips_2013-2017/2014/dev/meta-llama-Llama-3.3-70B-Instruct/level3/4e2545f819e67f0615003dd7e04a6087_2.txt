This paper proposes a novel algorithm for learning chordal Markov networks, which is a fundamental problem in machine learning and artificial intelligence. The algorithm is based on a recursive characterization of clique trees and uses dynamic programming to find an optimal junction tree that maximizes a given decomposable scoring function. The paper provides a rigorous analysis of the algorithm's time and space complexity, showing that it can solve instances with up to 18 vertices within a few hours, and even larger instances if the maximum clique size is restricted.
The paper is well-written and provides a clear explanation of the problem, the proposed algorithm, and its analysis. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm, comparing it to a state-of-the-art integer linear programming approach. The paper also provides a detailed discussion of the related work and highlights the advantages of the proposed approach.
However, I have some concerns regarding the paper's clarity and technical details. The paper assumes a high level of familiarity with the topic, which may make it difficult for non-experts to follow. Additionally, some of the technical proofs and derivations are not fully elaborated, which may make it challenging for readers to verify the results.
In terms of the conference guidelines, I would rate the paper as follows:
* Quality: 8/10 (the paper is technically sound, but some proofs and derivations could be more detailed)
* Clarity: 7/10 (the paper is well-written, but assumes a high level of familiarity with the topic)
* Originality: 9/10 (the paper proposes a novel algorithm and provides a rigorous analysis of its complexity)
* Significance: 9/10 (the paper addresses a fundamental problem in machine learning and provides a significant improvement over existing approaches)
Overall, I would recommend accepting the paper, but with some revisions to improve clarity and provide more technical details.
