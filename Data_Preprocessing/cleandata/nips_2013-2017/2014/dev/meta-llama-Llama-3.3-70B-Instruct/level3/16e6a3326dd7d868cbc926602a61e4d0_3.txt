This paper proposes a novel method called calibrated multivariate regression (CMR) for fitting high-dimensional multivariate regression models. The authors introduce a new convex program that calibrates the regularization for each regression task with respect to its noise level, leading to improved finite-sample performance. The CMR estimator is defined as the solution to a convex program that combines a nonsmooth L2,1-loss function with a decomposable L1,p-norm penalty.
The paper provides a thorough analysis of the CMR estimator, including its statistical properties and computational efficiency. The authors develop a smoothed proximal gradient algorithm to solve the CMR optimization problem, which has a worst-case iteration complexity of O(1/ε), where ε is a pre-specified numerical accuracy. Theoretical results show that CMR achieves the optimal rate of convergence in parameter estimation, and numerical experiments demonstrate that CMR outperforms existing multivariate regression methods.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem and their proposed solution. The technical results are of high quality, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of the CMR estimator. The numerical experiments are also well-designed and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
However, there are some minor issues with the paper. For example, the authors could provide more discussion on the relationship between CMR and other existing methods, such as the square-root sparse multivariate regression. Additionally, the authors could provide more details on the real data experiment, which is currently presented in a technical report version.
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of multivariate regression and provides a novel solution to the problem of calibrating regularization for each regression task. The technical results are sound, and the numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
