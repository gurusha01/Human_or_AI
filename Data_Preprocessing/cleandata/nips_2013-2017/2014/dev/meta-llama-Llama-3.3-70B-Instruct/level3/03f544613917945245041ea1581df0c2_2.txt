This paper proposes a novel algorithm for optimizing "dirty models" with decomposable norms, which enables quadratic approximation and achieves a significant speedup over existing first-order methods. The key idea is to combine quadratic approximation with active subspace selection, allowing the algorithm to efficiently solve high-dimensional problems. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on two real-world applications: latent variable graphical model selection and multi-task learning.
The paper's strengths include its clear presentation of the theory, well-organized structure, and convincing empirical results. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the convergence properties of their algorithm and demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art methods.
However, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement. The algorithmic achievement of a 10-fold speedup, while impressive, raises questions about the ease of optimization and parallelization of the algorithm. The presentation of the theory is compact, but the writing could be improved, with language errors, grammatical problems, and poor punctuation throughout the paper. Additionally, the paper lacks a conclusion or discussion section, which would be useful for exploring future directions and implications of the work.
Furthermore, there are errors and inconsistencies in the algorithm and notation, such as a potential typo in the superscript and an unusual update rule. The theoretical development is interesting, but its practical significance and potential for future research are unclear, and the editing quality is not sufficient.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper addresses the criteria of quality, clarity, originality, and significance. The paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The presentation is clear, and the paper is well-organized. The approach is novel, and the paper adequately references related work.
Arguments for acceptance include:
* The paper proposes a novel algorithm that achieves a significant speedup over existing methods.
* The authors provide a thorough analysis of the convergence properties of their algorithm.
* The empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach on real-world applications.
Arguments against acceptance include:
* The paper lacks a conclusion or discussion section.
* There are errors and inconsistencies in the algorithm and notation.
* The editing quality is not sufficient.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, but with revisions to address the weaknesses and areas for improvement mentioned above. The authors should carefully proofread the paper to eliminate language errors, grammatical problems, and poor punctuation. Additionally, they should consider adding a conclusion or discussion section to explore future directions and implications of the work.
