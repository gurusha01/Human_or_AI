This paper proposes a novel method called calibrated multivariate regression (CMR) for fitting high-dimensional multivariate regression models. The approach combines game theory and active learning techniques to denoise a system with noisy sensors, proving that simple game dynamics can successfully denoise the system with high probability. The CMR estimator is defined as the solution to a convex program that calibrates the regularization for each regression task with respect to its noise level, achieving better finite-sample performance than existing methods.
The paper provides a thorough analysis of the CMR estimator, including its statistical properties and computational efficiency. The authors prove that CMR achieves the optimal rate of convergence in parameter estimation and demonstrate its superiority over other multivariate regression methods through numerical simulations. The experimental results show that CMR consistently outperforms existing methods, including the ordinary multivariate regression (OMR) and the oracle estimator.
However, the paper has some limitations. The bounds given in the analysis are loose, leaving room for doubt about the practical applicability of the method. The parameter settings used in the experiments, such as the number of sensors and the noise rate, may not be reasonable in all scenarios, and more discussion is needed on what settings are reasonable. Additionally, the paper lacks discussion on the 2r band around the separator, where the denoising algorithm may not work well, and a more sophisticated distance-weighted approach may be needed for large noise rates.
The paper is well-written, but some technical terms could be defined in simpler terms to make it more accessible to a broader audience. More context and background information would also be helpful in certain sections. The experimental results are impressive, but it would be useful to see more comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods and more analysis of the results.
Overall, the paper presents a novel and interesting approach to multivariate regression, but its significance and practical applicability are questionable due to the looseness of the bounds and the lack of discussion on certain aspects of the method. With some revisions to address these concerns, the paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field.
