This paper proposes a calibrated multivariate regression (CMR) method, which uses the L_{2,1} norm instead of the Frobenius norm and calibrates the regularization for each regression task with respect to its noise level. The authors claim that CMR achieves better finite-sample performance than existing multivariate regression methods and provide numerical experiments to demonstrate its effectiveness.
The paper is well-written and clearly explains the proposed method and its theoretical properties. However, there are some limitations and concerns. Firstly, the use of numerical experiments to demonstrate the effects of the new method lacks theoretical or intuitive explanation for why standard deviation works better than variance. This makes it difficult to understand the underlying reasoning behind the proposed method.
Secondly, the numerical experiments have a limited range for matrix D_I and lambda, and it is unclear how the results would change with a larger range. This raises concerns about the robustness and generalizability of the proposed method.
Thirdly, the manuscript contains typing errors, such as a missing lambda in equation (1.2), which can make it difficult to follow the mathematical derivations.
Lastly, the paper lacks novelty and sufficient experiments to support its claims. The proposed method is similar to existing methods, and the numerical experiments are not comprehensive enough to demonstrate its superiority.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, but the claims are not well-supported by theoretical analysis or experimental results. The paper is well-organized and clearly written, but it lacks clarity in some parts, such as the explanation of the proposed method.
In terms of originality, the paper does not propose a significantly new method, and the ideas are not novel. The paper is related to previous work, but it does not provide a clear explanation of how it differs from existing methods.
In terms of significance, the results are not important, and the paper does not address a difficult problem in a better way than previous research. The paper does not provide unique data, unique conclusions on existing data, or a unique theoretical or pragmatic approach.
Overall, I would not recommend accepting this paper in its current form. The authors need to address the limitations and concerns mentioned above, provide more comprehensive numerical experiments, and clarify the explanation of the proposed method.
