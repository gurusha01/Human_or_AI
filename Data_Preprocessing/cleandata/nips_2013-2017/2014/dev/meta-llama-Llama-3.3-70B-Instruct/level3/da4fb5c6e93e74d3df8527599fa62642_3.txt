This paper proposes a novel algorithm for learning the structure of chordal Markov networks, which is a fundamental problem in machine learning and artificial intelligence. The algorithm, called Junctor, is based on a recursive characterization of clique trees and uses dynamic programming to find an optimal junction tree that maximizes a given decomposable scoring function.
The paper is well-structured and clearly written, with a technically sound idea and promising empirical results on both simulated and real data. The authors provide a rigorous complexity analysis of the algorithm, showing that it runs in O(4^n) time for n vertices, which is a significant improvement over existing algorithms.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The algorithm is guaranteed to find an optimal solution, which is a significant advantage over existing approximate methods.
* The empirical results show that Junctor outperforms a state-of-the-art integer linear programming based solver, GOBNILP, on both synthetic and real data.
* The paper provides a thorough analysis of the algorithm's time and space requirements, which is essential for understanding its scalability.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The algorithm's time complexity is still exponential in the number of vertices, which may limit its applicability to very large datasets.
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with other existing algorithms for learning Markov network structures.
* Some of the technical proofs and derivations are quite involved and may require careful reading to follow.
Overall, I believe that this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence, and its results have the potential to impact a wide range of applications. The paper is well-written, and the authors have made a clear effort to present their ideas in a clear and concise manner.
