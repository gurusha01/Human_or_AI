This paper proposes a novel Newton-like method for optimizing the sum of a smooth cost function and multiple decomposable norms. The authors introduce an active subspace selection procedure and provide a proof of convergence, making significant theoretical and practical contributions to the field. The method is shown to be 10 times faster than state-of-the-art methods for two important problems: latent variable graphical model selection and multi-task learning.
The paper is well-written and organized, although it may be more suited for a journal due to the amount of critical information in the appendix. The authors' active selection method and proof of convergence are new and original, building on existing ideas in the literature. The algorithm's ability to extend active subspace ideas to multiple regularizers is a key contribution.
The strengths of the paper include its significant theoretical and practical contributions, as well as its potential impact on several practitioners. The algorithm's speedup over state-of-the-art methods is impressive, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of the method's convergence properties.
However, the paper may not be suitable for a conference due to its length and content. The appendix contains a significant amount of critical information, which may make it difficult for conference attendees to fully appreciate the paper's contributions.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper makes significant theoretical and practical contributions to the field.
* The authors' active selection method and proof of convergence are new and original.
* The algorithm has the potential to impact several practitioners.
* The paper is well-written and organized.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The paper may be more suited for a journal due to its length and content.
* The appendix contains a significant amount of critical information, which may make it difficult for conference attendees to fully appreciate the paper's contributions.
Overall, I believe that the paper's strengths outweigh its weaknesses, and I recommend acceptance. However, I suggest that the authors consider revising the paper to make it more suitable for a conference presentation, potentially by moving some of the critical information from the appendix to the main body of the paper.
