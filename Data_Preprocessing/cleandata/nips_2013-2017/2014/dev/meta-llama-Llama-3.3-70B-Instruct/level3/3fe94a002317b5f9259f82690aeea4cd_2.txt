This paper presents a novel approach to modeling brain states using local field potential (LFP) data recorded from multiple brain regions in mice. The authors propose an infinite hidden Markov model (iHMM) to capture the time-dependent evolution of brain states, and a state-dependent tensor factorization to characterize the spectral properties of the LFP signals. The model is able to estimate the number of brain states and the number of mixture components in the mixture of Gaussian processes.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of the proposed model and the inference algorithm. The results on the toy data demonstrate the ability of the model to recover the ground truth, and the results on the sleep and novel environment datasets show promising performance in inferring brain states and spectral information.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel model that combines iHMM and state-dependent tensor factorization to capture the time-dependent evolution of brain states and the spectral properties of the LFP signals.
* The development of an efficient inference algorithm using split-merge moves, which allows for the estimation of the number of brain states and the number of mixture components.
* The application of the model to real-world datasets, including sleep and novel environment data, which demonstrates the potential of the model in neuroscience applications.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The limited comparison to other methods, which makes it difficult to fully evaluate the performance of the proposed model.
* The lack of a clear explanation of the hyperparameter settings and the sensitivity of the model to these settings.
* The potential for overfitting, given the complexity of the model and the large number of parameters.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of neuroscience and machine learning, and the proposed model has the potential to be a valuable tool for understanding brain states and their relationship to behavior. However, further work is needed to fully evaluate the performance of the model and to address the limitations mentioned above.
