This paper proposes a new method called calibrated multivariate regression (CMR) for fitting high-dimensional multivariate regression models. The authors argue that existing methods, such as ordinary multivariate regression (OMR), have limitations in terms of regularization and do not calibrate the regularization for each regression task with respect to its noise level. The proposed CMR method addresses these limitations by using a nonsmooth L2,1-loss function, which can be viewed as a special example of the weighted least square loss function. The authors also develop an efficient smoothed proximal gradient algorithm to solve the resulting optimization problem.
The paper provides a thorough analysis of the statistical properties of the CMR estimator, including its rate of convergence and tuning insensitivity. The authors show that CMR achieves the optimal rate of convergence in parameter estimation and that the tuning parameter selection does not involve the unknown parameter max. The paper also presents numerical simulations and a real data experiment to demonstrate the effectiveness of CMR.
The strengths of the paper include its clear and well-organized presentation, its thorough analysis of the statistical properties of the CMR estimator, and its demonstration of the effectiveness of CMR through numerical simulations and a real data experiment. The paper also provides a detailed comparison with existing methods, such as OMR and the square-root sparse multivariate regression.
However, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement. One potential weakness is that the paper assumes an uncorrelated structure for the noise matrix Z, which may not always be the case in practice. The authors could consider extending their method to handle correlated noise. Additionally, the paper could benefit from more discussion on the practical implications of the method, such as its applicability to specific network architectures and its potential limitations in terms of computational complexity.
