This paper proposes a novel approach to modeling brain states using local field potential (LFP) data, which is a source of information about broad patterns of brain activity. The authors introduce an infinite hidden Markov model (iHMM) to capture the evolution of brain states over time, and a state-dependent tensor factorization to characterize the spectral properties of LFPs across brain regions. The model is able to estimate the number of brain states and the number of mixture components in the mixture of Gaussian processes.
The paper is well-written, and the experiments are solid. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on three datasets, including a toy dataset, sleep data, and novel environment data. The results show that the model is able to recover the ground truth in the toy dataset, and infer distinct brain states in the sleep and novel environment datasets.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to capture the time dependency of brain activity, which is a key aspect of brain states. The authors also provide a detailed description of the variational inference scheme, which is used to optimize the model parameters. The use of split-merge moves in the inference scheme is a nice touch, as it allows the model to adapt to the data and avoid local optima.
However, there are some areas where the paper could be improved. For example, the authors could provide more discussion on the differences between their approach and existing methods, such as dynamic causal modeling (DCM) and tensor factorization. Additionally, the authors could provide more details on the hyperparameter settings and the sensitivity of the model to these settings.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, and originality. The paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The writing is clear, and the organization is logical. The paper also presents a novel approach to modeling brain states, which is a significant contribution to the field.
Here is a list of arguments for and against acceptance:
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel approach to modeling brain states using LFP data.
* The experiments are solid, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.
* The paper is well-written, and the writing is clear.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The paper could benefit from more discussion on the differences between the proposed approach and existing methods.
* The authors could provide more details on the hyperparameter settings and the sensitivity of the model to these settings.
