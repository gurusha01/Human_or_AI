This paper presents a novel approach for multivariate regression, called calibrated multivariate regression (CMR), which calibrates the regularization for each regression task with respect to its noise level. The authors propose a convex program that uses a nonsmooth L2,1-loss function, which can be viewed as a special example of the weighted least square loss function. The optimization problem is solved using a smoothed proximal gradient algorithm, which has a worst-case iteration complexity of O(1/ε), where ε is a pre-specified numerical accuracy.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem and the proposed approach. The methodology is thoroughly explained, and the authors provide a detailed analysis of the time and space complexity of the proposed approach. The experimental results on synthetic and real data show that CMR outperforms several state-of-the-art baseline methods, including the ordinary multivariate regression (OMR) method.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposed approach is novel and addresses a significant problem in multivariate regression.
* The authors provide a thorough analysis of the methodology and its complexity.
* The experimental results are convincing and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes an uncorrelated structure for the noise matrix, which may not always be the case in practice.
* The authors do not provide a comparison with other related methods, such as the square-root sparse multivariate regression.
* The paper could benefit from more detailed analysis of the real data experiment, which is currently presented in a technical report version.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the proposed approach is novel and effective. The authors demonstrate the significance of the problem and the effectiveness of the proposed approach through thorough experiments. The paper is a good scientific contribution to the field, and it is likely to be of interest to researchers and practitioners in the area of multivariate regression.
