This paper presents a novel exact algorithm for structure learning of chordal Markov networks using dynamic programming and recursive partition tree structures. The algorithm is proven to be correct and is compared against a modified version of GOBNILP, a state-of-the-art method for Bayesian network exact structure learning. The paper is well-written, relevant, and technically sound, making a significant contribution to the area of learning graphical models of bounded complexity.
The strengths of the paper include its ability to solve moderate-size instances to the optimum within reasonable time, outperforming existing methods such as GOBNILP. The algorithm's time complexity is also well-analyzed, providing a clear understanding of its efficiency. Additionally, the paper provides a comprehensive experimental evaluation, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach on both synthetic and real-world datasets.
However, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement. The paper lacks motivation for learning chordal Markov networks, which could be addressed by providing more background and context on the importance of this problem. Furthermore, the experiments section has some issues, such as assuming small network decomposition width and using unrealistic models for drawing CPTs. The implementation of the code should also be compared against existing integer programming formulations of the problem.
To improve the paper, I suggest adding recent publications on learning Bayesian networks of bounded treewidth as related work, as well as renumbering conditions and definitions for better clarity. Additionally, warnings and references for score pruning rules and other concepts should be added to provide more context and background information. Overall, this paper presents an important contribution to the field, and with some revisions, it has the potential to be even stronger.
