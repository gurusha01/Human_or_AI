This paper proposes a novel approach to modeling brain states using local field potential (LFP) data recorded from multiple brain regions in mice. The authors develop an infinite hidden Markov model (iHMM) that incorporates time dependency and a state-dependent tensor factorization to characterize the spectral properties of the LFP signals. The model is able to estimate the number of brain states and the number of mixture components in the mixture of Gaussian processes.
The paper is well-written and clearly organized, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments and methodology. The introduction provides a thorough background on the concept of brain states and the limitations of existing methods, while the model section provides a detailed explanation of the proposed approach. The results section presents a comprehensive evaluation of the model using three datasets, including a toy dataset, sleep data, and novel environment data.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposed model is novel and addresses the limitations of existing methods, such as dynamic causal modeling (DCM) and tensor factorization.
* The model is able to estimate the number of brain states and the number of mixture components, which is a significant improvement over existing methods.
* The results show that the model is able to recover the ground truth in the toy dataset and provides significant improvements in predictive performance over simpler models.
* The model is able to infer distinct brain states and network properties from the raw, filtered data, which is a significant contribution to the field of neuroscience.
However, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement:
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with existing methods, such as DCM and tensor factorization, to highlight the advantages of the proposed approach.
* The model assumes that the brain states are discrete and finite, which may not be the case in reality. The authors could explore the use of continuous or infinite brain states in future work.
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the implications of the results for neuroscience and the potential applications of the proposed model.
