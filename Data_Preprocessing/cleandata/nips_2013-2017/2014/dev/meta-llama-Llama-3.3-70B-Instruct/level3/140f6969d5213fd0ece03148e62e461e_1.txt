This paper presents a novel approach to multi-view representation of faces using a neural network-like model with deterministic and probabilistic units. The proposed model, called Multi-View Perceptron (MVP), can synthesize new views and recover identity and view information from a single 2D face image. The authors draw inspiration from the primate brain's face-processing network, where neurons are specialized for either view or identity processing.
The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with a clear explanation of the model architecture and training procedure. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of MVP in face recognition, viewpoint estimation, and multi-view reconstruction. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the MultiPIE dataset, outperforming other deep learning-based methods.
One of the strengths of the paper is its originality, as it proposes a new approach to multi-view face representation that combines deterministic and probabilistic units. The use of variational inference and importance sampling is also a notable contribution. The paper is also significant, as it addresses a challenging problem in face recognition and has the potential to impact the field of computer vision.
However, there are some areas where the paper could be improved. The authors could provide more evidence for their model design choices, such as the need for a non-deterministic approach and the use of variational/importance sampling inference. Additionally, the paper could benefit from more analysis on the optimization method, inference expenses, and the necessity of LDA for best results.
Some questions and comments that arise from reading the paper include:
* How does the model handle cases where the input image is of poor quality or has occlusions?
* Can the model be extended to handle other types of variations, such as illumination or expression?
* How does the model compare to other state-of-the-art methods in terms of computational efficiency and scalability?
* Can the model be used for other applications, such as face verification or face tracking?
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of face recognition and multi-view representation. With some additional analysis and experimentation, the model has the potential to become a widely-used tool in computer vision.
