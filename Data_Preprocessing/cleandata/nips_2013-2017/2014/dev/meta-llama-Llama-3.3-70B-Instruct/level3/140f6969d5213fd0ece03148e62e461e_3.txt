This paper proposes a novel approach to modeling brain states using local field potential (LFP) data recorded from multiple brain regions. The authors introduce an infinite hidden Markov model (iHMM) to capture the time-dependent evolution of brain states and a state-dependent tensor factorization to characterize the spectral properties of LFPs. The model is able to estimate the number of brain states and the number of mixture components in the mixture of Gaussian processes.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of the proposed model and its components. The use of variational inference with split-merge moves is a notable contribution, allowing for efficient and flexible modeling of complex brain state dynamics. The results on the toy data demonstrate the model's ability to recover ground truth, and the application to real-world datasets (sleep and novel environment) shows promising results in identifying distinct brain states and inferring relationships between brain regions.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel and flexible model for brain state analysis
* The use of variational inference with split-merge moves, which allows for efficient and flexible modeling
* The application to real-world datasets, which demonstrates the model's potential for neuroscience research
However, there are some limitations and areas for improvement:
* The model assumes a conditional diagonal Gaussian distribution for the output, but the criticality of this assumption and the number of training pairs used to learn the model are unclear.
* The claim that the model simulates how the human brain encodes view representations is weak and lacks convincing evidence or discussion.
* The performance of the model on the sleep and novel environment datasets is promising, but concerns remain about the method's scalability and applicability to larger datasets and more complex brain state analysis tasks.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of neuroscience and brain state analysis. With some revisions to address the limitations and areas for improvement, the paper has the potential to be a strong candidate for acceptance.
