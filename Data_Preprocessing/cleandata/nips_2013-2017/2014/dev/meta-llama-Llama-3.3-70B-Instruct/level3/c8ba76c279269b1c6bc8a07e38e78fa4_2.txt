This paper proposes a novel proximal Newton framework for optimizing superposition-structured statistical estimators, which are commonly used in high-dimensional problems. The authors develop a quadratic approximation framework with active subspace selection to efficiently solve the optimization problem. The algorithm is applied to two real-world applications: latent Gaussian Markov random field structure learning and multi-task learning.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem and their approach. The technical sections are also well-organized and easy to follow. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the convergence properties of their algorithm and demonstrate its effectiveness through numerical experiments.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to handle complex optimization problems with multiple regularizers. The authors show that their algorithm can efficiently solve problems with sparse, low-rank, and group sparse structures, which are commonly encountered in many applications. The use of active subspace selection is also a key innovation, as it allows the algorithm to focus on the most important dimensions of the problem and reduce the computational cost.
The numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm in solving real-world problems. The authors show that their algorithm is significantly faster than state-of-the-art methods, such as proximal gradient descent and alternating minimization, while achieving similar or better accuracy.
However, there are some areas where the paper could be improved. One potential weakness is the lack of comparison with other Newton-like methods, such as quasi-Newton methods or trust-region methods. It would be interesting to see how the proposed algorithm compares to these methods in terms of convergence rate and computational cost.
Another potential area for improvement is the analysis of the convergence properties of the algorithm. While the authors provide a thorough analysis of the convergence properties of their algorithm, it would be useful to see more discussion on the conditions under which the algorithm converges and how the convergence rate depends on the problem parameters.
Overall, this is a well-written paper that proposes a novel and effective algorithm for optimizing superposition-structured statistical estimators. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their algorithm through numerical experiments and provide a thorough analysis of its convergence properties.
