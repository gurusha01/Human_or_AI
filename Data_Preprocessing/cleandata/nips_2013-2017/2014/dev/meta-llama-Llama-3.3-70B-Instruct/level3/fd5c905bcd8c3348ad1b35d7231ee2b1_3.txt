This paper presents a novel approach to modeling brain states using local field potential (LFP) data, which is a type of electrophysiological measurement. The authors propose an infinite hidden Markov model (iHMM) to capture the evolution of brain states over time, and a Gaussian process model to characterize the spectral properties of the LFP signals. The model is able to estimate the number of brain states and the number of mixture components in the mixture of Gaussian processes.
The paper is well-written and clearly explains the technical details of the model and the inference algorithm. The authors also provide a thorough evaluation of the model using both synthetic and real data, including LFP data from mice. The results show that the model is able to recover the underlying brain states and spectral properties of the data, and outperforms other methods in terms of predictive performance.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to provide a principled approach to modeling brain states, which is a complex and challenging problem in neuroscience. The authors' use of a hierarchical Bayesian model and variational inference allows for flexible and efficient modeling of the data, and the results demonstrate the potential of this approach for uncovering new insights into brain function.
However, there are some areas where the paper could be improved. For example, the authors could provide more context and background information on the neuroscience applications of the model, and discuss the potential implications of the results for our understanding of brain function and behavior. Additionally, the paper could benefit from more detailed comparisons with other methods and models in the field, in order to better establish the novelty and significance of the contributions.
In terms of the reviewer guidelines, the paper scores well on the criteria of quality, clarity, and originality. The technical details of the model and inference algorithm are well-explained, and the results are clearly presented and easy to follow. The paper also makes a significant contribution to the field of neuroscience and machine learning, and has the potential to impact future research in this area.
Some minor issues with the paper include unclear references, lack of clarity in equation descriptions, and the need to address complex cross-spectra in the generative model. Additionally, the model may not be biologically plausible, but it could have a role in sleep staging and classification of epileptic discharges.
To improve the paper, the authors could provide a proof of principle that the approach can take us beyond what we already know, such as relating clusters identified during sleep to classical sleep staging schemes. The authors could also revise the abstract, equation descriptions, and supplementary material to improve clarity and address minor issues.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of neuroscience and machine learning, and has the potential to impact future research in this area. With some revisions to address minor issues and provide more context and background information, the paper could be even stronger and more effective in communicating its contributions to the reader.
