This paper proposes a novel mathematical model for optimizing "superposition-structured" or "dirty" statistical estimators, which involve the minimization of a smooth loss function with a hybrid regularization. The authors develop a proximal Newton framework, leveraging iterative quadratic approximations and an alternating minimization approach to update each parameter component. A key contribution is the introduction of a general active subspace selection framework, which reduces the problem size by exploiting the structure of the regularizers.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of their approach. The mathematical derivations are rigorous, and the authors provide convergence guarantees for their algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, showing that it is more than 10 times faster than state-of-the-art first-order methods for latent variable graphical model selection problems and multi-task learning problems.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel mathematical model for optimizing superposition-structured estimators
* The development of a proximal Newton framework with active subspace selection
* The provision of convergence guarantees for the algorithm
* The demonstration of the effectiveness of the approach through experimental results
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The complexity of the mathematical derivations, which may make it difficult for some readers to follow
* The lack of comparison with other second-order methods, which would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the approach's performance
* The limited number of applications considered, which may not fully demonstrate the versatility of the approach
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of statistical estimation and optimization. The proposed approach has the potential to be applied to a wide range of problems, and the authors' use of active subspace selection is a key innovation that enables the efficient solution of large-scale problems.
