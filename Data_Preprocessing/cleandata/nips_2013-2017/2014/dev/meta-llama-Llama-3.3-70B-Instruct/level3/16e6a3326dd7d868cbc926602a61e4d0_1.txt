This paper presents a novel approach to denoising a sensor network in a noisy environment, leveraging local communication among sensors and simple best-response dynamics in a consensus game. The authors provide theoretical guarantees on the denoising power of several natural dynamics, including synchronous and random-order asynchronous updates, and demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through synthetic experiments.
The paper is well-written, technically sound, and clearly organized, making it easy to follow and understand. The authors provide a thorough introduction to the problem setting, related work, and their approach, and the theoretical analysis is rigorous and well-supported by empirical processes and game theory.
The experimental results are impressive, showing that the proposed approach can achieve low error from a small number of queries, outperforming active and passive learning algorithms without denoising, as well as passive learning with denoising. The authors also provide a detailed comparison of synchronous and asynchronous updates, and demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach in different noise settings.
The paper's strengths include its novel approach to denoising sensor networks, its rigorous theoretical analysis, and its impressive experimental results. The authors also provide a clear and concise discussion of the implications of their work and potential future directions.
One potential weakness of the paper is that it could benefit from more discussion of the limitations of the approach and potential challenges in implementing it in practice. Additionally, the authors could provide more context and comparison to recent NIPS papers, such as those by Golovin et al. and Bellala et al., to provide a clearer understanding of the paper's contributions and significance.
Overall, I believe that this paper is deserving of publication at NIPS, as it presents a novel and significant contribution to the field of sensor networks and active learning. The paper's technical soundness, clarity, and experimental results make it a strong candidate for publication.
