This paper proposes a new method called Calibrated Multivariate Regression (CMR) for fitting high-dimensional multivariate regression models. The method calibrates the regularization for each regression task with respect to its noise level, which leads to improved finite-sample performance. The authors develop an efficient smoothed proximal gradient algorithm to solve the resulting optimization problem and provide theoretical guarantees for the method's performance.
The paper is well-written and organized, with minor typos. The proofs provided are correct, and the method's motivation and significance are clearly argued. The authors' approach to finding representative points in a combinatorial fashion without assuming convex hull or enscribing ellipsoids is a primary merit of the paper.
The technical contributions, including Theorems 2.2 and 3.2, are significant and provide a thorough analysis of the method's performance. The numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of CMR in improving classification accuracy and outperforming other multivariate regression methods.
The paper relates to previous work in multivariate regression, including the work on sparse multivariate regression and the square-root sparse multivariate regression. The authors provide a clear comparison of their method with existing methods and demonstrate its advantages.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposed method, CMR, is a novel and effective approach to multivariate regression.
* The authors provide a thorough theoretical analysis of the method's performance.
* The numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of CMR in improving classification accuracy.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The method's computational complexity may be high for large datasets.
* The choice of the smoothing parameter µ may require careful tuning.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the method proposed is significant and effective. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the method's performance, and the numerical experiments demonstrate its advantages. The paper is a valuable contribution to the field of multivariate regression.
