This paper presents an interesting model for analyzing brain states using multi-region LFP time-series data. The proposed infinite hidden Markov model (iHMM) is a novel approach to modeling the evolution of brain states, and the use of Gaussian processes to describe brain connectivity in each state is a promising idea. However, there are several areas that require improvement.
Firstly, the interpretation of results needs clarification, particularly in regards to the algorithm used to separate time-windows. The notation used is sometimes confusing, and the definition of windows and the choice of parameter L could be better explained. Additionally, the paper lacks a clear distinction between brain connectivity and brain states, which could lead to misunderstandings.
The use of Gaussian processes to describe brain connectivity has limitations, including the inability to reproduce the pattern of sparsity of the brain. This should be acknowledged and discussed in the paper. Furthermore, the infinite mixture of Gaussian processes model has limitations, such as the joint covariance matrix not being semi-definite positive, which makes the joint distribution not well-defined.
The necessity of Section 2.3 is questionable, and the use of Dirichlet Process for cluster analysis is criticized for being absolute and not well-supported due to fixed parameters. The results may depend on the choice of clustering mechanism, and the significance of the "network" with respect to the literature is unclear, requiring further explanation and improvement in interpretation.
The paper's strengths include its novel approach to modeling brain states, its ability to estimate the number of brain states and the number of mixture components, and its application to real-world datasets. The use of variational Bayesian split-merge algorithm for inference is also a notable contribution.
To improve the paper, the authors should address the limitations and unclear aspects mentioned above, provide more detailed explanations of the notation and algorithms used, and discuss the implications of their results in the context of neuroscience. Additionally, the authors should consider comparing their approach to other existing methods in the field and providing more comprehensive evaluations of their model's performance.
