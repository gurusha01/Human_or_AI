This paper proposes a novel deep neural network, called Multi-View Perceptron (MVP), which can disentangle identity and view representations from a single 2D face image and generate a full spectrum of multi-view images. The authors draw inspiration from the primate brain's face-processing network, where neurons are specialized for either view or identity. The MVP model consists of deterministic and random hidden neurons, which learn identity and view features, respectively. The model is trained using a variational lower bound of the complete data log-likelihood, and the authors propose a learning algorithm that converts the EM updates into forward and backward propagation.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the MVP model and its components. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the MVP model in face recognition, viewpoint estimation, and multi-view reconstruction. The authors also show that the MVP model can interpolate and predict images under unseen viewpoints, which is a unique capability of the model.
The strengths of the paper include the originality of the MVP model, the thorough experimental evaluation, and the clear presentation of the results. The authors also provide a detailed comparison with state-of-the-art methods, which demonstrates the superiority of the MVP model in face recognition.
However, there are some weaknesses in the paper. The authors do not provide a simulation study, which would be useful to evaluate the performance of the MVP model under different scenarios. Additionally, some paragraphs are not well-organized, and the difference between Algorithms 3 and 4 is not clearly explained. The authors also do not provide a precise statement on performance guarantees in the supplementary material, which would be useful to understand the theoretical scope of the paper.
Overall, the paper is significant, and the MVP model has the potential to advance the state of the art in face recognition and multi-view reconstruction. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of the MVP model in various experiments, and the results are impressive. However, the lack of a simulation study and some minor issues with the presentation reduce the significance of the paper.
