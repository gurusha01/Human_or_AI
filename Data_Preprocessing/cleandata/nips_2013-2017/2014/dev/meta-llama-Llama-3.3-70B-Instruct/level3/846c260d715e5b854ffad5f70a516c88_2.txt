This paper proposes a novel deep neural network, called Multi-View Perceptron (MVP), which can disentangle identity and view representations from a single 2D face image and generate a full spectrum of multi-view images. The authors draw inspiration from the primate brain's face-processing network, where neurons are specialized for either view or identity. The MVP network consists of deterministic and random hidden neurons, which learn identity and view features, respectively. The network is trained using a variational lower bound of the complete data log-likelihood, and the authors propose a learning algorithm that combines the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm with back-propagation.
The paper has several strengths. Firstly, the proposed MVP network achieves state-of-the-art performance on the MultiPIE dataset, outperforming existing methods, including 3D face models and deep learning-based approaches. Secondly, the network can generate high-quality multi-view images, which is demonstrated through a quantitative evaluation. Thirdly, the authors show that the network can be used for viewpoint estimation, achieving comparable results to discriminative methods. Finally, the network can interpolate and predict images under unseen viewpoints, demonstrating its ability to perform multi-view reasoning.
However, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement. Firstly, the notation used in the paper is sometimes unclear, and there are minor errors in the appendix. Secondly, the authors do not provide a detailed comparison with existing approaches, such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which are commonly used for image generation tasks. Thirdly, the network's ability to generalize to unseen viewpoints and identities is not thoroughly evaluated. Finally, the authors do not discuss the potential applications of the MVP network beyond face recognition, such as image generation and editing.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors provide a clear and well-organized presentation of the MVP network and its learning algorithm. However, the paper could benefit from more detailed comparisons with existing approaches and a more thorough evaluation of the network's generalization capabilities.
The originality of the paper lies in its proposal of a novel deep neural network that can disentangle identity and view representations and generate multi-view images. The authors draw inspiration from the primate brain's face-processing network, which is a unique and interesting aspect of the paper. However, the paper builds upon existing work in deep learning and computer vision, and the authors could provide more context and discussion of related work.
The significance of the paper lies in its potential to improve face recognition systems and enable new applications, such as image generation and editing. The authors demonstrate the MVP network's ability to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the MultiPIE dataset and show its potential for viewpoint estimation and multi-view reasoning. However, the paper could benefit from more discussion of the potential impact and applications of the MVP network.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, as it proposes a novel and interesting approach to face recognition and image generation. However, the authors should address the weaknesses and areas for improvement mentioned above, such as providing more detailed comparisons with existing approaches and evaluating the network's generalization capabilities.
