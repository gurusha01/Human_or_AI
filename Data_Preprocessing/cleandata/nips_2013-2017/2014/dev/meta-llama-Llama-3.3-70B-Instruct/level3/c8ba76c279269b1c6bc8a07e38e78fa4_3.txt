This paper proposes a novel quadratic approximation framework with active subspace selection for optimizing "superposition-structured" or "dirty" statistical estimators. The authors develop a proximal Newton method that leverages the structure of decomposable regularization functions to efficiently solve the optimization problem. The key contributions of the paper include a general active subspace selection framework, convergence guarantees for the algorithm, and applications to latent variable graphical model selection and multi-task learning problems.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of their methodology. The use of decomposable norms and active subspace selection allows for efficient computation and significant speedup compared to existing methods. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, showing that it is more than 10 times faster than state-of-the-art methods for certain problems.
However, there are some areas that could be improved. The paper could benefit from more comparisons to biological data, particularly regarding PN neuron dynamics and physiological adaptations to new odor environments. Additionally, the motivation for focusing on the locust is unclear, and the choice of parameters M and N seems to be the only constraint imposed by the locust. The paper also has some notation issues, such as overloading of variables, which can be confusing.
Overall, the paper is considered original, and its significance relies on experimental verification, which has the potential to make it a high-impact paper. The proposed algorithm has the potential to be applied to a wide range of problems, and the authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of their methodology.
