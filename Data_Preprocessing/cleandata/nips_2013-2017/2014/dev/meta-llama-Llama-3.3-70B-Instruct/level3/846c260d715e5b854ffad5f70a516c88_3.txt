This paper proposes a novel deep neural network, called Multi-View Perceptron (MVP), which can disentangle identity and view representations from a single 2D face image and generate a full spectrum of multi-view images. The authors draw inspiration from the primate brain's face-processing network, where neurons are specialized for either view or identity. The MVP model consists of deterministic and random hidden neurons, which learn identity and view features, respectively. The model is trained using a variational lower bound on the log-likelihood, and the authors propose a Monte Carlo Expectation Maximization (MCEM) algorithm to optimize the parameters.
The paper has several strengths. Firstly, the proposed MVP model is novel and has the potential to advance the state-of-the-art in face recognition. The experimental results on the MultiPIE dataset demonstrate that the identity features learned by MVP achieve superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, the model's ability to generate a full spectrum of multi-view images and interpolate unseen views is impressive.
However, there are also some weaknesses. The experimental evaluation is limited to a single dataset, and the comparisons to other methods are not comprehensive. The authors only compare MVP to a few state-of-the-art methods, and the evaluation metrics are limited to face recognition accuracy. Furthermore, the paper lacks a thorough analysis of the model's computational complexity and scalability.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors provide a clear and well-organized presentation of the MVP model and its training procedure. However, the paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the model's strengths and weaknesses.
The originality of the paper is high, as the proposed MVP model is a novel combination of familiar techniques. The authors provide a clear explanation of how their work differs from previous contributions, and the related work section is well-referenced.
The significance of the paper is also high, as the proposed MVP model has the potential to advance the state-of-the-art in face recognition and multi-view image generation. The results demonstrated in the paper are impressive, and the model's ability to interpolate unseen views is a significant contribution to the field.
