This paper proposes a novel deep neural network, called Multi-View Perceptron (MVP), which can disentangle identity and view representations from a single 2D face image and generate a full spectrum of multi-view images. The authors draw inspiration from the primate brain's face-processing network, where neurons are specialized for either view or identity. The MVP model consists of deterministic and random hidden neurons, allowing it to learn both identity and view features. The paper provides a well-written description of the method, including the architecture, learning procedure, and testing procedure.
The strengths of this paper include its originality, as it proposes a new approach to face recognition and multi-view image generation. The use of both deterministic and random hidden neurons is a novel combination, and the authors demonstrate its effectiveness in experiments. The paper also provides a thorough evaluation of the MVP model, including comparisons to state-of-the-art methods and ablation studies.
However, there are some weaknesses to the paper. The authors could provide more analysis of the learned features and how they relate to the primate brain's face-processing network. Additionally, the paper could benefit from more discussion on the limitations of the MVP model and potential future directions.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by experimental results. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of the work. The paper is clearly written, well-organized, and provides enough information for the expert reader to reproduce the results.
The originality of the paper is high, as it proposes a new approach to face recognition and multi-view image generation. The paper is significantly different from previous work, and the authors provide a thorough discussion of related work.
The significance of the paper is also high, as it addresses a difficult problem in face recognition and provides a novel solution. The results are important, and other researchers are likely to use these ideas or build on them. The paper advances the state of the art in face recognition and provides a unique approach to multi-view image generation.
