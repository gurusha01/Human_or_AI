This paper presents a novel deep neural network, called Multi-View Perceptron (MVP), which can disentangle identity and view representations from a single 2D face image and generate a full spectrum of multi-view images. The proposed approach is inspired by the face-processing network in the primate brain, where neurons in different regions are tuned to identity across views or view-specific. The MVP model consists of deterministic and random hidden neurons, which learn identity features and view representations, respectively. The model is trained using a variational lower bound of the complete data log-likelihood, and the parameters are updated using back-propagation.
The paper is well-written and makes significant progress on an important problem in face recognition. The proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the MultiPIE dataset, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the MVP model in disentangling identity and view representations. The model can also generate high-quality multi-view images and estimate viewpoints with comparable accuracy to discriminative methods.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposed MVP model is novel and well-motivated by the face-processing network in the primate brain.
* The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the MVP model in disentangling identity and view representations and generating high-quality multi-view images.
* The model can estimate viewpoints with comparable accuracy to discriminative methods.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The model requires a large amount of training data to learn the identity and view representations.
* The computational cost of training the model can be high due to the use of back-propagation and the large number of parameters.
* The model may not generalize well to unseen viewpoints or lighting conditions.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of face recognition and multi-view perception. The proposed MVP model has the potential to be used in a variety of applications, including face recognition, viewpoint estimation, and image generation.
