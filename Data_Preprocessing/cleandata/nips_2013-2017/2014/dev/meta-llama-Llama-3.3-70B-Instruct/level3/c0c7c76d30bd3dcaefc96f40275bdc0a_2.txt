This paper proposes a novel method for multivariate regression, called calibrated multivariate regression (CMR), which calibrates the regularization for each regression task with respect to its noise level. The authors develop an efficient smoothed proximal gradient algorithm to solve the resulting optimization problem and provide theoretical guarantees for the method. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of CMR through extensive numerical experiments and a real-data application to brain activity prediction.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel and well-motivated method for multivariate regression that addresses the limitation of existing methods.
* The development of an efficient algorithm for solving the optimization problem, which has a worst-case iteration complexity of O(1/Îµ).
* The provision of theoretical guarantees for the method, including the optimal rate of convergence in parameter estimation.
* The demonstration of the effectiveness of CMR through extensive numerical experiments and a real-data application.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The assumption of an uncorrelated structure for the noise matrix, which may not always hold in practice.
* The lack of comparison with other related methods, such as Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs), which also focus on subset selection with diversity in mind.
* The limited discussion of the relationship between CMR and other existing methods, such as the square-root sparse multivariate regression.
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel and well-motivated method for multivariate regression that addresses the limitation of existing methods.
* The method has been extensively tested and demonstrated to be effective in numerical experiments and a real-data application.
* The paper provides theoretical guarantees for the method, including the optimal rate of convergence in parameter estimation.
Arguments con acceptance:
* The assumption of an uncorrelated structure for the noise matrix may not always hold in practice.
* The lack of comparison with other related methods, such as DPPs, may limit the understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of CMR.
* The limited discussion of the relationship between CMR and other existing methods may make it difficult to understand the contribution of the paper.
Overall, the paper is well-written and provides a clear and concise presentation of the proposed method and its theoretical guarantees. The numerical experiments and real-data application demonstrate the effectiveness of CMR, and the paper provides a good contribution to the field of multivariate regression. However, the assumption of an uncorrelated structure for the noise matrix and the lack of comparison with other related methods are limitations that should be addressed in future work.
