This paper proposes a novel approach to modeling brain states using local field potential (LFP) data recorded from multiple brain regions in mice. The authors develop an infinite hidden Markov model (iHMM) that captures the time-dependent evolution of brain states, and a state-dependent tensor factorization that characterizes the spectral properties of the LFP signals. The model is able to estimate the number of brain states and the number of mixture components in the mixture of Gaussian processes.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of the proposed model and the inference algorithm. The use of variational inference with split-merge moves is a notable contribution, as it allows for efficient and flexible modeling of the complex dependencies in the data.
The results on the toy data demonstrate the ability of the model to recover the ground truth, and the results on the sleep and novel environment datasets show promising performance in inferring brain states and spectral information. The comparison with other methods, such as the HDP-HMM and the tensor method, highlights the advantages of the proposed approach.
The paper has several strengths, including:
* The proposal of a novel and flexible model that captures the time-dependent evolution of brain states
* The development of an efficient and scalable inference algorithm using variational inference with split-merge moves
* The demonstration of the model's performance on multiple datasets, including a toy dataset and two real-world datasets
* The comparison with other methods, which highlights the advantages of the proposed approach
However, there are also some weaknesses and potential areas for improvement, including:
* The model's complexity, which may make it challenging to interpret and visualize the results
* The need for careful tuning of the hyperparameters, which may require significant expertise and computational resources
* The limited evaluation of the model's performance, which is primarily based on visual inspection and comparison with other methods
Overall, this paper presents a significant contribution to the field of neuroscience and machine learning, and the proposed model and inference algorithm have the potential to be widely applicable to other domains.
