This paper proposes a novel approach to modeling brain states using local field potential (LFP) data recorded from multiple brain regions. The authors introduce an infinite hidden Markov model (iHMM) to capture the time-dependent evolution of brain states and a state-dependent tensor factorization to characterize the spectral properties of LFPs. The model is able to estimate the number of brain states and the number of mixture components in the mixture of Gaussian processes.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the proposed model and its components. The use of variational inference with split-merge moves is a significant contribution, allowing for efficient and accurate estimation of the model parameters. The application of the model to two novel electrophysiological datasets demonstrates its ability to infer brain states and spectral information for each brain region.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel and innovative approach to modeling brain states using LFP data
* The development of a variational inference scheme with split-merge moves, which is a significant contribution to the field
* The application of the model to real-world datasets, demonstrating its ability to infer brain states and spectral information
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The model assumes that the brain states are discrete and finite, which may not be the case in reality
* The use of a Gaussian process to model the spectral properties of LFPs may not be sufficient to capture the complex dynamics of brain activity
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with other existing methods for modeling brain states
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel and innovative approach to modeling brain states using LFP data
* The development of a variational inference scheme with split-merge moves is a significant contribution to the field
* The application of the model to real-world datasets demonstrates its ability to infer brain states and spectral information
Arguments against acceptance:
* The model assumptions may not be realistic, and the use of a Gaussian process may not be sufficient to capture the complex dynamics of brain activity
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with other existing methods for modeling brain states
* The results may not be generalizable to other datasets or populations.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, as it proposes a novel and innovative approach to modeling brain states using LFP data and demonstrates its ability to infer brain states and spectral information. However, the authors should address the weaknesses mentioned above and provide a more detailed comparison with other existing methods.
