This paper proposes a novel mechanism for anticipative tracking in neural systems, utilizing the property of spike-frequency adaptation (SFA) to induce self-sustained travelling waves in continuous attractor neural networks (CANNs). The authors demonstrate that when the intrinsic speed of the network is larger than that of the external drive, anticipative tracking occurs, and that an increase in SFA amplitude can enhance the capability of a CANN to achieve anticipative tracking with a longer anticipative time.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem of motion information processing in neural systems. The proposed mechanism is simple yet effective, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of the network dynamics and tracking performances. The use of CANNs as a model for neural systems is well-justified, and the incorporation of SFA is a novel and interesting approach.
The paper has several strengths, including the clear presentation of the proposed mechanism, the thorough analysis of the network dynamics, and the demonstration of the effectiveness of the mechanism in achieving anticipative tracking. The authors also provide a good discussion of the limitations of the model and the potential applications of the proposed mechanism.
However, there are some weaknesses in the paper. For example, the authors could provide more details on the biological plausibility of the proposed mechanism, and the relationship between SFA and other negative feedback modulation processes, such as short-term synaptic depression (STD) and negative feedback connections (NFC). Additionally, the authors could provide more simulations or experimental data to support the proposed mechanism and to demonstrate its effectiveness in different scenarios.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the proposed mechanism is novel and interesting. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the network dynamics and tracking performances, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the mechanism in achieving anticipative tracking. With some revisions to address the weaknesses mentioned above, the paper has the potential to be a strong contribution to the field.
