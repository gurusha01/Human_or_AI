This paper proposes a new method called calibrated multivariate regression (CMR) for fitting high-dimensional multivariate regression models. The main claim of the paper is that CMR calibrates the regularization for each regression task with respect to its noise level, achieving improved finite-sample performance and tuning insensitivity. The authors support this claim through theoretical analysis, numerical simulations, and a real-data experiment.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear overview of the problem, the proposed method, and the related work. The theoretical analysis is thorough, and the authors provide sufficient details for reproducibility. The numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of CMR in comparison to existing methods, and the real-data experiment shows the potential of CMR in a practical application.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposed method, CMR, is novel and addresses a significant problem in multivariate regression.
* The theoretical analysis is rigorous and provides insights into the properties of CMR.
* The numerical simulations are thorough and demonstrate the effectiveness of CMR.
* The real-data experiment shows the potential of CMR in a practical application.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes an uncorrelated structure for the noise matrix, which may not always be the case in practice.
* The computational complexity of CMR may be high, especially for large datasets.
* The paper could benefit from more discussion on the choice of the regularization parameter and the smoothing parameter.
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel method that addresses a significant problem in multivariate regression.
* The theoretical analysis is rigorous and provides insights into the properties of CMR.
* The numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of CMR.
* The real-data experiment shows the potential of CMR in a practical application.
Arguments con acceptance:

* The paper could benefit from more discussion on the choice of the regularization parameter and the smoothing parameter.
Overall, I recommend accepting the paper, as it proposes a novel method that addresses a significant problem in multivariate regression, and the theoretical analysis and numerical simulations demonstrate its effectiveness. However, the authors should address the weaknesses mentioned above, such as discussing the choice of the regularization parameter and the smoothing parameter, and considering more general noise structures.
