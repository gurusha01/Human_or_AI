This paper proposes a novel pairwise clustering framework that bridges the gap between clustering and multi-class classification. The authors derive nonparametric pairwise similarity measures from the generalization error bounds of unsupervised nonparametric classifiers, specifically the nearest neighbor classifier and the plug-in classifier. The paper provides a thorough analysis of the generalization error bounds for both classifiers and shows their connection to the weighted volume of cluster boundary for Low Density Separation.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem and their approach. The technical sections are detailed and well-organized, making it easy to follow the derivations and proofs. The authors also provide a comprehensive review of related work and clearly explain how their approach differs from existing methods.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The authors propose a novel and interesting approach to pairwise clustering that combines ideas from classification and clustering.
* The paper provides a thorough analysis of the generalization error bounds for the proposed classifiers and shows their connection to the weighted volume of cluster boundary.
* The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through experiments on real-world datasets.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes that the data is drawn from a uniform distribution, which may not always be the case in practice.
* The authors do not provide a clear comparison with other state-of-the-art clustering methods, which makes it difficult to evaluate the performance of their approach.
* The paper could benefit from more detailed explanations of the experimental setup and the choice of hyperparameters.
Overall, the paper is well-written and provides a significant contribution to the field of clustering. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach and provide a thorough analysis of the underlying theory. However, the paper could benefit from more detailed comparisons with other methods and more comprehensive experimental evaluations.
