This paper introduces a new scene-centric database called Places, which contains over 7 million labeled images of scenes, making it the largest image database of scenes and places to date. The authors propose new methods to compare the density and diversity of image datasets and show that Places is as dense as other scene datasets and has more diversity. They use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to learn deep features for scene recognition tasks and establish new state-of-the-art results on several scene-centric datasets.
The paper is well-written and clearly organized, with a good introduction to the problem of scene recognition and the limitations of current object-centric datasets. The authors provide a thorough description of the Places database and the methods used to collect and annotate the images. The experimental results are impressive, with the Places-CNN outperforming the ImageNet-CNN on several scene classification benchmarks.
The paper's strengths include:
* The introduction of a large and diverse scene-centric database, which has the potential to advance the field of scene recognition.
* The proposal of new methods to compare the density and diversity of image datasets, which can be useful for evaluating the quality of datasets.
* The demonstration of the effectiveness of the Places-CNN in scene recognition tasks, which shows the potential of deep learning methods for this problem.
The paper's weaknesses include:
* The lack of a detailed analysis of the limitations of the Places database and the potential biases in the data.
* The limited discussion of the implications of the results for real-world applications, such as robotics or autonomous vehicles.
* The absence of a comparison with other state-of-the-art methods for scene recognition, which would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the Places-CNN.
Overall, the paper is well-written and makes a significant contribution to the field of scene recognition. The introduction of the Places database and the proposal of new methods to compare the density and diversity of image datasets are particularly noteworthy. However, the paper could be improved with a more detailed analysis of the limitations of the database and the implications of the results for real-world applications.
