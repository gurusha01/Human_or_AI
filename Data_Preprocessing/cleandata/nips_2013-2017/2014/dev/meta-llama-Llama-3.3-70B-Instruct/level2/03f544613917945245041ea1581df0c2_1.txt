This paper proposes a novel proximal Newton framework for optimizing "superposition-structured" or "dirty" statistical estimators, which are commonly used in high-dimensional problems. The authors develop a quadratic approximation framework with active subspace selection, allowing for efficient optimization of these estimators. The paper provides a thorough theoretical analysis, including convergence guarantees and asymptotic quadratic convergence rates.
The main claims of the paper are: (1) the proposed algorithm, QUIC & DIRTY, is more than 10 times faster than state-of-the-art first-order methods for latent variable graphical model selection and multi-task learning problems; (2) the algorithm has a super-linear convergence rate when the sub-problems are solved exactly; and (3) the active subspace selection technique significantly improves the speed of the solver.
The support for these claims comes from a combination of theoretical analysis and empirical experiments. The authors provide a detailed proof of the convergence guarantees and asymptotic quadratic convergence rates, and demonstrate the efficiency of their algorithm on several real-world applications, including Gaussian Markov Random Fields and multi-task learning.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their methodology and results. The use of active subspace selection is a key innovation, allowing for significant speedups in the optimization process. The empirical results are impressive, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in practice.
The paper reflects common knowledge in the field, and the authors demonstrate a thorough understanding of relevant literature. The references are comprehensive, accessible, and relevant, with proper citations.
The novelty of the paper lies in the development of a proximal Newton framework for optimizing superposition-structured estimators, and the introduction of active subspace selection as a key component of the algorithm. The paper presents a significant improvement over existing approaches, which are primarily first-order methods.
The completeness of the paper is good, with sufficient details provided for reproducibility. The authors discuss the limitations of their approach, including the requirement for solving quadratic sub-problems exactly, and provide suggestions for future work.
Overall, this is a strong paper that makes a significant contribution to the field of optimization and statistical estimation. The proposed algorithm has the potential to be widely adopted, and the authors' thorough analysis and empirical evaluation provide a solid foundation for future research.
