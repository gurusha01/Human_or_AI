This paper introduces a novel framework for unsupervised learning of structured predictors with overlapping, global features. The authors propose a conditional random field (CRF) autoencoder that leverages the power and flexibility of CRFs in unsupervised learning without sacrificing their attractive computational properties. The model consists of two layers: a CRF that generates latent structure conditional on the observed data, and a generative model that reconstructs the input conditional on the predicted structure.
The paper makes several key claims, including that the proposed model allows for efficient exact inference without resorting to unrealistic independence assumptions or restricting the kinds of features that can be used. The authors also claim that their model outperforms existing alternatives, including featurized first-order HMMs and standard first-order HMMs, on two canonical tasks in natural language processing: part-of-speech induction and bitext word alignment.
The support for these claims is strong, with experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of the CRF autoencoder on both tasks. The authors provide a detailed analysis of the results, including comparisons to existing models and discussions of the importance of feature engineering in unsupervised structured prediction problems. The paper also provides a thorough discussion of related work, including connections to traditional autoencoders, posterior regularization, and multi-view learning.
The paper is well-written and clearly organized, with a logical flow of ideas and a clear presentation of the technical details. The authors provide sufficient background information and context for the reader to understand the significance of the proposed model and its contributions to the field.
The usefulness of the ideas presented in the paper is high, as the proposed model has the potential to be applied to a wide range of unsupervised structured prediction problems. The authors demonstrate the scalability and modeling flexibility of the CRF autoencoder, which makes it a promising approach for many applications.
