This paper presents a novel approach to denoising a highly noisy sensor network using local best-response dynamics, allowing for fast learning from a small number of label queries. The authors provide theoretical guarantees for the denoising power of several natural dynamics, including synchronous and random-order asynchronous updates, and demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through experiments on synthetic data.
The main claims of the paper are: (1) local best-response dynamics can significantly denoise a highly noisy sensor network without destroying the underlying signal, and (2) the denoised sensor network can be used to learn a good approximation to the target function from a small number of queries. The authors support these claims through a combination of theoretical analysis and experimental results.
The paper is well-written and clearly organized, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments. The theoretical analysis is rigorous and provides a good understanding of the denoising power of the proposed dynamics. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in practice, and the comparison with other learning algorithms (such as Support Vector Machines) provides a useful baseline for evaluation.
The paper has several strengths, including: (1) the novelty of the approach, which combines game-theoretic dynamics with active learning to denoise a sensor network; (2) the rigor of the theoretical analysis, which provides a good understanding of the denoising power of the proposed dynamics; and (3) the effectiveness of the approach in practice, as demonstrated through experiments on synthetic data.
However, the paper also has some limitations. For example, the authors assume that the sensor network is uniformly distributed, which may not always be the case in practice. Additionally, the authors do not provide a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed approach, which could be an important consideration in practice.
Overall, I would rate this paper as a strong accept. The paper presents a novel and effective approach to denoising a highly noisy sensor network, and the theoretical analysis and experimental results provide a good understanding of the approach's strengths and limitations.
