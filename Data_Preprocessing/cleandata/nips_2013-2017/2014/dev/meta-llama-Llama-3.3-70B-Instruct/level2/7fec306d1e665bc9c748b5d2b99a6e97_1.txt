The paper "Probabilistic Differential Dynamic Programming (PDDP)" presents a novel approach to trajectory optimization for systems with unknown dynamics. The main claim of the paper is that PDDP, which combines Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) with Gaussian processes (GPs), can efficiently learn a locally optimal control policy for complex systems. The authors support this claim through a series of experiments on two non-trivial tasks: cart-double inverted pendulum swing-up and six-link robotic arm reaching.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the background and motivation of the work. The proposed approach is thoroughly explained, and the mathematical derivations are sound.
