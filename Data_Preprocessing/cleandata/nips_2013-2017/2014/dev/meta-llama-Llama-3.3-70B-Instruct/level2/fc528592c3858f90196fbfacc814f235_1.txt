This paper presents a novel approach to community detection in sparse networks with partial information and under memory constraints. The authors consider a stochastic block model (SBM) with a finite number of non-overlapping communities and develop two clustering algorithms that can extract the clusters asymptotically accurately in the streaming data model. The first algorithm is offline and requires a memory that scales linearly with the network size, while the second algorithm is online and requires a memory that grows sub-linearly with the network size.
The paper's main claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and simulations. The authors provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of asymptotically accurate clustering algorithms, which is a significant contribution to the field. The proposed algorithms are also shown to be optimal in terms of their memory requirements.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their methodology and results. The use of spectral methods and the concept of indirect edges are particularly interesting and innovative. The authors also provide a thorough discussion of the limitations of their approach and potential avenues for future research.
Here are some arguments for and against acceptance:
Arguments for acceptance:
1. The paper presents a novel and significant contribution to the field of community detection in sparse networks.
2. The authors provide a thorough theoretical analysis and simulations to support their claims.
3. The proposed algorithms are shown to be optimal in terms of their memory requirements.
4. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their methodology and results.
Arguments against acceptance:
1. The paper assumes a specific model (SBM) and may not be applicable to other models or real-world networks.
2. The authors do not provide a comprehensive comparison with existing community detection algorithms.
3. The paper could benefit from more detailed simulations and experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in practice.
Overall, I believe that this paper is a strong contribution to the field and deserves to be accepted. The authors have made a significant effort to provide a thorough theoretical analysis and simulations to support their claims, and the proposed algorithms are innovative and optimal in terms of their memory requirements. With some minor revisions to address the limitations and provide more detailed simulations, this paper has the potential to be a seminal work in the field of community detection.
