This paper introduces a new scene-centric database called Places, which contains over 7 million labeled images of scenes, making it the largest image database of scenes and places to date. The authors propose new methods to compare the density and diversity of image datasets and demonstrate that Places is as dense as other scene datasets and has more diversity. They use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to learn deep features for scene recognition tasks and establish new state-of-the-art results on several scene-centric datasets.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem of scene recognition and the limitations of current object-centric datasets. The proposed database, Places, is a significant contribution to the field, and the authors demonstrate its effectiveness in improving scene recognition performance. The visualization of the CNN layers' responses provides valuable insights into the differences between object-centric and scene-centric networks.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The introduction of a large-scale scene-centric database, which addresses the limitations of current object-centric datasets.
* The proposal of new methods to compare the density and diversity of image datasets, which provides a useful tool for evaluating dataset quality.
* The demonstration of state-of-the-art results on several scene-centric datasets using the proposed database and CNN architecture.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the differences between object-centric and scene-centric networks, and how these differences impact scene recognition performance.
* The authors could provide more insights into the characteristics of the Places database that make it more effective for scene recognition tasks.
* The paper could include more comparisons with other scene recognition methods and datasets to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the proposed approach.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the authors provide a significant contribution to the field of computer vision. The introduction of the Places database and the proposal of new methods to compare dataset density and diversity are notable strengths of the paper. With some additional analysis and comparisons, the paper could be even more effective in demonstrating the value of the proposed approach.
