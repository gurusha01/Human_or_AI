This paper proposes a novel pairwise clustering framework that bridges the gap between clustering and multi-class classification. The authors derive nonparametric pairwise similarity measures by minimizing the generalization error of unsupervised nonparametric classifiers, specifically the nearest neighbor classifier and the plug-in classifier. The generalization error bounds for both classifiers are expressed as a sum of pairwise terms between data points, which can be interpreted as nonparametric pairwise similarity measures. The authors also prove that the generalization error bound for the plug-in classifier is asymptotically equal to the weighted volume of the cluster boundary for Low Density Separation, a widely used criterion for semi-supervised learning and clustering.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of their framework and theoretical results. The use of kernel density estimation and generalized kernel density estimation is well-motivated, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of the consistency of these estimators. The connection to Low Density Separation is also well-established, and the authors provide a clear explanation of how their framework relates to this criterion.
The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed pairwise clustering method, Plug-In Exemplar Clustering (PIEC), which outperforms existing exemplar-based clustering methods on several real-world datasets. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of their algorithm and demonstrate its scalability.
Strengths:
* The paper proposes a novel and well-motivated framework for pairwise clustering that bridges the gap between clustering and multi-class classification.
* The authors provide a thorough analysis of the consistency of the kernel density estimators and the generalized kernel density estimator.
* The connection to Low Density Separation is well-established, and the authors provide a clear explanation of how their framework relates to this criterion.
* The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, and the authors provide a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of their algorithm.
Weaknesses:
* The paper assumes that the data is i.i.d., which may not be the case in practice. It would be interesting to see how the authors' framework can be extended to handle non-i.i.d. data.
* The authors use a specific type of kernel (Gaussian kernel) in their analysis, and it would be interesting to see how their results can be generalized to other types of kernels.
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with existing pairwise clustering methods, including a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of each method.
