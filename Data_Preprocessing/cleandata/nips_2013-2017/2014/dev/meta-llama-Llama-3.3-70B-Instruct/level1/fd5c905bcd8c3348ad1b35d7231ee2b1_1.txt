This paper proposes a novel approach to modeling brain states using local field potential (LFP) data recorded from multiple brain regions. The authors introduce an infinite hidden Markov model (iHMM) to capture the evolution of brain states over time, and a state-dependent tensor factorization to characterize the spectral properties of the LFP signals. The model is able to estimate the number of brain states and the number of mixture components in the mixture of Gaussian processes.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of the proposed model and its components. The use of variational inference with split-merge moves is a notable contribution, as it allows for efficient and flexible modeling of the complex relationships between brain regions and states.
The results on the toy data demonstrate the ability of the model to recover the ground truth, and the comparison to simpler models shows the advantages of considering multiple brain states and using an iHMM. The application to real datasets, including sleep and novel environment data, shows promising results, with the model able to infer distinct brain states and network properties.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel and flexible model for brain state analysis
* The use of variational inference with split-merge moves, which allows for efficient and flexible modeling
* The application to real datasets, which demonstrates the potential of the model for neuroscience research
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The complexity of the model, which may make it difficult to interpret and understand for non-experts
* The reliance on a number of hyperparameters, which may require careful tuning for optimal performance
* The lack of comparison to other state-of-the-art models for brain state analysis
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel and flexible model for brain state analysis, which has the potential to advance the field of neuroscience research
* The use of variational inference with split-merge moves is a notable contribution, which allows for efficient and flexible modeling
* The results on real datasets demonstrate the potential of the model for inferring distinct brain states and network properties
Arguments against acceptance:
* The complexity of the model may make it difficult to interpret and understand for non-experts
* The reliance on a number of hyperparameters may require careful tuning for optimal performance
* The lack of comparison to other state-of-the-art models for brain state analysis may limit the impact of the paper.
Overall, I believe that the paper is well-written and makes a significant contribution to the field of neuroscience research. While there are some weaknesses, the strengths of the paper outweigh them, and I recommend acceptance.
