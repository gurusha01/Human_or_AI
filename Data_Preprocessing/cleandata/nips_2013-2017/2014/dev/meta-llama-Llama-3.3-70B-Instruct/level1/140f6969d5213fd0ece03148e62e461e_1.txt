This paper proposes a novel deep neural network, called Multi-View Perceptron (MVP), which can disentangle identity and view representations from a single 2D face image and generate a full spectrum of multi-view images. The authors draw inspiration from the primate brain's face-processing network, where neurons are specialized for either view or identity processing. The MVP network consists of deterministic and random hidden neurons, which learn identity and view features, respectively. The network is trained using a variational lower bound of the complete data log-likelihood, and the parameters are updated using back-propagation.
The paper has several strengths. Firstly, the proposed MVP network achieves superior performance on the MultiPIE dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art methods, including 3D face models and deep learning-based approaches. Secondly, the network can generate high-quality multi-view images, which can be used for face recognition, viewpoint estimation, and other applications. Thirdly, the authors demonstrate that MVP can interpolate and predict images under unseen viewpoints, imitating the reasoning capacity of humans.
However, there are some weaknesses and limitations. Firstly, the network requires a large amount of training data, which can be time-consuming and computationally expensive to collect and process. Secondly, the authors assume that the view factor can be modeled as a continuous variable, which may not always be the case in real-world applications. Thirdly, the network's performance may degrade when dealing with large pose variations or occlusions.
