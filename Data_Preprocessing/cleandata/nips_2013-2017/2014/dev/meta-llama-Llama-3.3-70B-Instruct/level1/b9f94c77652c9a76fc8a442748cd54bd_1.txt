This paper introduces a novel framework for unsupervised learning of structured predictors with overlapping, global features, leveraging the power and flexibility of conditional random fields (CRFs) in unsupervised learning. The proposed CRF autoencoder model consists of two layers: a CRF encoding model that predicts latent structure conditional on observed data, and a generative model that reconstructs a transformation of the input conditional on the predicted latent structure. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on two canonical tasks in natural language processing: part-of-speech induction and bitext word alignment, achieving competitive results with state-of-the-art models.
The paper is well-written, clearly organized, and provides a thorough overview of the proposed framework, including its connections to previous work in unsupervised learning. The authors provide a detailed analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of their approach, discussing its advantages in terms of scalability, modeling flexibility, and feature engineering. The experimental evaluation is comprehensive, including comparisons with baseline models and an analysis of the impact of feature engineering on performance.
The paper's main strengths are:
* The proposed CRF autoencoder framework is novel and well-motivated, addressing the limitations of existing approaches to unsupervised structured prediction.
* The paper provides a thorough analysis of the connections to previous work, including undirected and directed models, autoencoders, and posterior regularization.
* The experimental evaluation is comprehensive and well-designed, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach on two challenging tasks.
The paper's main weaknesses are:
* The notation and terminology may be unfamiliar to some readers, requiring careful attention to understand the technical details.
* The paper assumes a significant amount of background knowledge in unsupervised learning, structured prediction, and natural language processing, which may limit its accessibility to a broader audience.
* Some of the experimental results, such as the comparison with the MRF model, are not fully fleshed out, and additional details would be helpful to fully understand the implications of the results.
