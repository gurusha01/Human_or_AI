This paper addresses the problem of community detection in sparse networks with a large number of nodes, where the network size can be extremely large, making the adjacency matrix difficult to manipulate and store. The authors consider two problems: clustering with partial information and clustering in the streaming model under memory constraints. 
The paper starts by introducing the stochastic block model (SBM) as a benchmark to assess the performance of clustering algorithms. The authors then derive necessary conditions for the existence of asymptotically accurate clustering algorithms, showing that if the proportion of observed columns is too small, no algorithm can perform better than a random guess. They also propose a new spectral algorithm that can classify green nodes (i.e., nodes with observed connections) asymptotically accurately whenever this is possible.
The authors then address the problem of clustering in the streaming model under memory constraints, where each column of the adjacency matrix is observed only once, and the memory available to the algorithm is limited. They propose two algorithms: an offline algorithm that requires a memory scaling linearly with the network size and an online algorithm that requires a memory scaling sublinearly with the network size. The offline algorithm uses a block size that depends on the density of the graph and the number of observed columns, while the online algorithm outputs the partition of the graph in an online fashion after a group of columns arrives.
The strengths of the paper include its thorough analysis of the problem of community detection in sparse networks, its derivation of necessary conditions for the existence of asymptotically accurate clustering algorithms, and its proposal of new spectral algorithms that can classify nodes asymptotically accurately. The paper also provides a detailed analysis of the memory requirements of the proposed algorithms and shows that they can be asymptotically accurate with a memory requirement that is non-increasing in the density of the graph.
The weaknesses of the paper include its assumption that the number of communities is known, which may not be the case in practice. Additionally, the paper does not provide a comparison with other existing algorithms for community detection, which would be useful to assess the performance of the proposed algorithms.
