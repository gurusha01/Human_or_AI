This paper proposes a spectral algorithm for inferring latent parameters in the Indian Buffet Process (IBP), a nonparametric Bayesian model. The authors derive tensorial moments for the IBP and its applications, and provide an efficient iterative inference algorithm, concentration of measure bounds, and reconstruction guarantees. The algorithm is shown to be superior to comparable variational Bayesian approaches in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency.
The paper is well-written and clearly organized, with a good balance between theoretical derivations and experimental results. The authors provide a thorough review of related work and clearly explain the contributions of their paper. The experimental results are impressive, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm on a range of problems, including image and gene expression data.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The derivation of tensorial moments for the IBP, which provides a new perspective on the model and enables the development of efficient spectral algorithms.
* The proposal of an efficient iterative inference algorithm, which is shown to be superior to variational Bayesian approaches in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency.
* The provision of concentration of measure bounds and reconstruction guarantees, which provide a theoretical foundation for the algorithm and demonstrate its robustness.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes a certain level of familiarity with nonparametric Bayesian models and spectral algorithms, which may make it difficult for readers without a strong background in these areas to follow.
* Some of the derivations and proofs are relegated to the appendix, which may make it difficult for readers to fully appreciate the technical contributions of the paper.
* The experimental results are largely based on synthetic data, which may not fully reflect the complexities of real-world problems.
Overall, I believe that this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of nonparametric Bayesian modeling and spectral algorithms. The proposed algorithm has the potential to be widely applicable and to improve the state-of-the-art in a range of areas, including image and gene expression analysis.

Rating: 8/10
Recommendation: Accept with minor revisions. The authors should consider adding more background material to make the paper more accessible to a broader audience, and should provide more detailed derivations and proofs in the main body of the paper. Additionally, the authors should consider including more experimental results on real-world data to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm in practice.
