This paper presents a novel approach to unsupervised feature learning using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The authors propose a discriminative objective, where the network is trained to discriminate between surrogate classes formed by applying various transformations to randomly sampled image patches. This approach is surprisingly successful, achieving state-of-the-art results on several popular datasets, including STL-10, CIFAR-10, and Caltech-101.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of their method, including a formal analysis of the objective function. The experiments are thorough, and the results are impressive, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The novelty of the approach, which combines the power of discriminative objectives with the advantage of unsupervised feature learning.
* The thorough experimental evaluation, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method on several datasets.
* The clear and detailed explanation of the method, including a formal analysis of the objective function.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The scalability of the method, which may not be suitable for very large datasets.
* The simplicity of the surrogate task, which may not allow the network to learn invariance to complex variations.
* The lack of comparison to other unsupervised feature learning methods, which would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the proposed approach.
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The paper presents a novel and effective approach to unsupervised feature learning.
* The experimental results are impressive, demonstrating the state-of-the-art performance on several datasets.

Overall, I believe that the paper is a strong contribution to the field of unsupervised feature learning, and I recommend acceptance. The authors have presented a novel and effective approach, and the experimental results are impressive. While there are some limitations to the method, these can be addressed in future work, and the paper provides a solid foundation for further research in this area.
