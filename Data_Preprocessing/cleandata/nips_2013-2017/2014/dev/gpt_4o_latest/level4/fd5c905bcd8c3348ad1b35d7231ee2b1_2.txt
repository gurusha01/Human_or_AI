In this paper, the authors present an HMM-based model designed for analyzing local field potential (LFP) data. The generative framework posits that, within any given short time window, the brain operates in one of a finite set of discrete states. Given the state, individual brain regions are assigned to specific LFP clusters, and conditioned on the cluster, the observed data are modeled using a Gaussian Process (GP). Variational Inference is employed to fit the model, and its performance is evaluated on three datasets: synthetic (toy) data, mouse sleep data, and mouse novel environment data. While the model performs exceptionally well on the toy data (as expected, since the data are generated by the model), assessing its performance on the real datasets is more challenging due to the inherent complexity of the problem.
Quality: This is a high-quality paper. It addresses an intriguing technical problem and provides a well-executed solution. The proposed model is clearly described, and its performance appears strong (to the extent that it can be evaluated). I do not have any significant criticisms of the work.
Clarity: The paper is exceptionally well-written and easy to follow.
Originality and significance: The paper addresses an important and relevant problem. In my view, the primary originality lies in the application of this class of algorithm to the problem of LFP data analysis, rather than in the technical contributions themselves. The authors introduce an HMM-based hierarchical model for analyzing LFP data and validate it using real mouse data. The model assumes that the observed data for each brain region are generated from a region-specific cluster, which is conditioned on a global brain state. The results on the datasets considered are promising.
