SUMMARY:  
This paper integrates game-theoretic dynamics with active learning methods to address the challenge of determining a decision boundary from noisy sensor data. Assuming noise independence, the authors demonstrate that simple simultaneous or asynchronous game dynamics can effectively denoise the system with high probability, provided a sufficient number of sensors. To validate the utility of this denoising in conjunction with active learning—which typically struggles in high-noise scenarios—the authors present experiments in a two-dimensional plane. These experiments highlight superior performance compared to learning without denoising and passive learning with denoising.
CRITIQUE:  
The results are compelling, the methodology is innovative, and the presentation is clear. However, my primary concern lies with the practical significance of the approach. While the authors convincingly argue that denoising a sensor network using simple distributed computations can enable active learning and reduce sensor query loads, the bounds in their analysis raise questions about real-world applicability. For instance, in the experiments, is it realistic to assume N = 10,000 for r = 0.1? A clearer sense of reasonable parameter settings is essential to assess the practical utility of this method. For example, if r = 0.8, a more advanced denoising algorithm would likely be necessary, as the theoretical guarantees would no longer hold, and nodes would face impractical communication demands. Conversely, if r = 0.001, the communication graph might become disconnected unless N is significantly larger. What ranges of r, N, eta, and other parameters are realistic? Similarly, is assuming a uniform distribution of sensors reasonable?
On a broader level, I was surprised by the lack of discussion regarding the 2r band around the decision boundary, where predictions are inherently unreliable. Are the authors assuming that r is sufficiently small for this region to be negligible? For larger values of r, a more sophisticated distance-weighted approach would likely outperform the simple majority rule, particularly near the boundary. Although the authors briefly mention such an approach in a footnote, a more detailed analysis or comparison near the boundary would be valuable. Intuitively, while both methods may perform similarly far from the boundary, distance weighting should yield significant improvements closer to it, even for smaller r.
SPECIFIC COMMENTS:  
- Page 1: The paper would be more accessible if terms like "active learning" and "agnostic active learning" were defined in simple terms upon first mention (e.g., "active learning, a subfield of machine learning focused on...").  
- Page 2: The statement "sensors within distance r are connected by an edge" could benefit from additional discussion about the relationship between r, d (dimensionality), and N. Beyond practical parameter expectations, it might be helpful to reference theoretical computer science or graph theory results on the connectedness of such communication graphs.  
- Page 3: Providing an overview of Section 3 at the beginning would improve readability, as this was not outlined earlier in the paper.  
- Page 7: The observation that "Pockets of noise appear to be more difficult to denoise" is unsurprising, as the algorithm was not designed for this scenario. It might be worth noting that such noise pockets are likely less problematic in higher-dimensional settings.  
- Page 8: The phrase "A synchronous round" could be revised to "One synchronous round" to avoid potential confusion with "asynchronous" rounds.  
SUMMARY OF REVIEW:  
This paper combines consensus dynamics and active learning techniques to address the problem of determining a decision boundary from noisy sensor data. While the work is clear, novel, and interesting, it requires stronger justification regarding its practical significance.
