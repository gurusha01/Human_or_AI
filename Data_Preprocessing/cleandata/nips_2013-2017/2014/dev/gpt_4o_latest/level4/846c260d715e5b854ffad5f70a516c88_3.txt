The paper introduces spectral algorithms for the models proposed in [18] and [24] by developing a general theoretical framework for the Indian Buffet Process (IBP) and applying it. Algorithm 1 provides a clear and precise description of the proposed approach, which is highly commendable.
Theorem 3, while addressing a challenging problem, offers limited practical implications beyond the assertion that "eventually it works." This highlights the necessity for experimental validation. Could you provide more insights into the nature of the polynomial involved?
The experimental evaluation includes toy data from [18] and a single gene expression dataset. While these experiments are indicative, they are not sufficiently convincing. A broader set of comparisons is required to strengthen the empirical claims.
Currently, the experimental work appears to align with the standards of the original papers, such as [24], where experiments are primarily "illustrative" due to the novelty of the model. However, your work needs to go beyond this and provide more comprehensive comparisons with the original models. The reliance on a few toy examples is limiting. Notably, the result in Fig. 4 is intriguing but does not include MCMC. Was MCMC excluded due to scalability issues? If so, this should be clarified.
For reference, consider the work of Reed and Ghahramani (ICML 2013), which presents a variety of algorithms evaluated on realistic datasets, along with an analysis of computational complexity. This sets a benchmark for experimental rigor that your work should aim to meet.
Regarding the introductory statement: "the issue of spectral inference in Dirichlet Processes is largely settled [6,7]," this claim is not substantiated by the references provided and should be revised or supported with appropriate evidence.
Equations (2) and (3): Are you referring to IBP(Î±)? Please clarify. 
Overall, the spectral algorithm and its convergence result are impressive, but the experimental comparisons are limited to toy datasets. The standard for evaluating new algorithms, as exemplified by Reed and Ghahramani (ICML 2013), involves more realistic datasets and thorough comparisons. Improved experimental work is necessary, especially given the vague theoretical implications regarding performance.
