The paper employs spike frequency adaptation (SFA) to achieve anticipative tracking within a Continuous Attractor Neural Network (CANN).  
Anticipative tracking is a compelling concept, as neural delays in perceiving a moving object inherently cause our perceptions to lag behind reality.  
In this work, the authors demonstrate that SFA enables anticipative tracking across a broad range of velocities.  
The manuscript is well-written, and to the best of my knowledge, the findings are novel, engaging, and exhibit strong performance.  
I recommend accepting the paper for inclusion in the proceedings.
