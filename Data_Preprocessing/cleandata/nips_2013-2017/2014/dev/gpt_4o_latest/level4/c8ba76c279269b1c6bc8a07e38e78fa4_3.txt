Review - Summary:
The authors investigate the olfactory circuit in locusts, proposing that KC neurons reconstruct odor vector estimates through antennal lobe dynamics. Specifically, they suggest that LN-PN connections are updated via ICA, while PN dynamics follow a gradient descent approach derived from the dual of a compressed-sensing optimization problem.
They demonstrate that the "reduced dual" circuit achieves reasonable performance when compared to a simple feedforward circuit.
Quality:
The reduced dual circuit presents a compelling hypothesis. If validated, this would represent an outstanding contribution. The mathematical progression is structured elegantly, moving from 1) basic MAP inference for odor identification to 2) low-dimensional dynamics of the dual problem, then to 3) the reduced dual circuit, and finally to 4) learning LN representations via ICA. This stepwise development is both rigorous and appealing.
However, the plausibility of the hypothesis is insufficiently explored. The paper lacks strong comparisons to biological data. For instance, PN neurons are known to exhibit transient dynamics in response to odors—do the dynamics of equation 12 produce realistic trajectories? Additionally, can the physiological or behavioral adaptations of locusts to novel odor environments be linked to the predictions of equation 16? If relevant experimental data are unavailable, the authors should discuss which aspects of the reduced dual circuit can be tested with existing data and which remain hypothetical. These issues are not adequately addressed in the current manuscript.
Furthermore, the rationale for focusing on the locust is unclear. It seems that the choice of M and N is the primary constraint imposed by this system.
Lastly, the paper includes an incomplete figure (line 294).
Clarity:
Some notational choices in section 4 are confusing. For instance, the symbol x is used to represent both the odor vector and the KC estimate of the odor. While this may stem from the decision to present the general mathematical framework first and introduce biological mappings later, it creates some ambiguity. Similarly, A is used to denote both the ORN→glomerulus map and the PN→KC map.
Aside from these issues, the paper is clear and well-written.
Originality:
To the best of my knowledge, this work is highly original.
Significance:
The significance of this study hinges on experimental validation. If the model's predictions are supported by data, this could become a high-impact paper. The study offers an elegant reformulation of a standard optimization problem (compressed sensing) in the context of locust olfaction, motivated by biological constraints. However, the paper would benefit greatly from verifying the model's predictions using existing experimental data.
