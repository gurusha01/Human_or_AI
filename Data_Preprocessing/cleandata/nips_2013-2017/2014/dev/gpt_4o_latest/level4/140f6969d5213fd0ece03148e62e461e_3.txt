The paper investigates multi-view face recognition in controlled settings and introduces a multi-layer multi-view perceptron (MVP) network designed to disentangle identity and view angle representations using deterministic and random neurons from a single 2D image. The MVP can generate novel face views from a single 2D face image by leveraging a sequence of view representations. To train the MVP, the authors derive a Monte Carlo Expectation Maximization (MCEM) procedure, assuming the output face adheres to a conditional diagonal Gaussian distribution. The model is trained on data from 200 individuals in the MultiPIE dataset, and the identity features extracted by the MVP are used with LDA to classify the remaining 137 individuals, achieving performance comparable to recent convolutional neural network-based methods.
The paper introduces an innovative MVP network to separate face identity and view angle representations, utilizing the identity features in LDA for multi-view face recognition. By varying the view angle representation, the MVP can synthesize novel face views. Overall, the proposed approach is technically sound, though it has certain limitations, and its performance on the MultiPIE dataset is competitive. However, several technical concerns are noted.
The method appears to rely on well-aligned, normalized 32Ã—32 face images, raising questions about its scalability. The experiments conducted on 137 individuals in MultiPIE leave doubts about the method's applicability to larger datasets. It is also unclear whether the approach can benefit from additional training samples and how it might be extended to handle unconstrained face recognition in real-world scenarios.
How critical is the assumption of a conditional diagonal Gaussian distribution for the output y? How many training pairs from the 200 individuals in MultiPIE were used to train the MVP? Additionally, why must the synthesis of new face views occur "sequentially"?
The claim that the MVP "simulates/mimics how the human brain encodes view representations" is unsubstantiated. The paper does not provide compelling evidence or discussion to support this assertion, nor does it explain how the human brain encodes view representations or why the proposed mechanism is analogous. As such, this claim should not be considered a primary contribution of the work.
In summary, this is a solid piece of work on multi-view perceptron (MVP) learning for multi-view face recognition, with competitive performance on the MultiPIE dataset. However, concerns remain regarding the scalability of the method and its potential application to real-world face recognition systems.
