This paper introduces a calibrated multivariate regression approach for modeling high-dimensional data and subsequently presents a computational method to address the associated optimization problem. The primary comments regarding the paper's details are as follows:
1. The key advancement of the proposed model lies in replacing the Frobenius norm with the L_{2,1} norm. Additionally, the calibration involves substituting variance with standard deviation. While numerical experiments are provided to demonstrate the impact of this substitution, could the authors offer a theoretical or intuitive justification for why standard deviation outperforms variance in this context?  
   
2. In the numerical experiments, matrix DI is incorporated to reflect varying noise variances. However, the range of DI in the current setup is relatively narrow. How would the results change if the range of D_I were significantly broader? Additionally, in Table 4.1, when lambda varies across a wide range, do the results exhibit a similar trend?  
3. There are minor typographical errors, such as a missing lambda in equation (1.2).  
While the manuscript is clearly written, it lacks sufficient novelty and comprehensive experimental validation.
