This paper introduces an efficient algorithm for clustering networks, leveraging the stochastic blockmodel. The authors demonstrate that their model can be fitted effectively even under partial data availability and memory limitations.
Specific Comments:
The version of the stochastic blockmodel employed in this work is a simplified variant of the model. In most practical applications, the stochastic blockmodel typically assumes distinct intra-cluster probabilities for each cluster and distinct inter-cluster probabilities for each pair of clusters. Can the blockmodel used in this paper approximate the more general form of the stochastic blockmodel?
The results seem to be confined to scenarios where \(p\) and \(q\) exhibit a similar structural dependence on \(n\), specifically when \(p = a f(n)\) and \(q = b f(n)\). Is it possible to extend these results to other cases? For instance, could they hold in situations where \(p\) increasingly dominates \(q\) as \(n\) grows large?
The paper could be strengthened by including one or both of the following:
(a) A moderately large example that compares the performance of a standard stochastic blockmodel fitting method with the proposed fast algorithm.  
(b) An application of the proposed method to a very large-scale example, even if only briefly discussed.
