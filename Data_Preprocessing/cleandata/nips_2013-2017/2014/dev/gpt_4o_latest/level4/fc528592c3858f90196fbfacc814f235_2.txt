This paper investigates community detection for stochastic block models in a streaming context. To address the challenge of reducing input data size when the number of nodes is large, the author(s) propose a subsampling approach, where community detection is performed on a random subset of columns from the adjacency matrix. The key contribution is the derivation of a sharp threshold for the sampling rate. The paper demonstrates that below this critical threshold, no method can achieve community recovery with a vanishing error rate, while a modified spectral method is shown to be consistent when the sampling rate exceeds the threshold. Building on this result, the author(s) develop a sub-linear memory streaming algorithm that is also proven to be consistent.
This work tackles a significant problem and is presented in a clear and concise manner. The theoretical contributions are rigorous and well-founded. However, the proposed algorithms are adaptations of existing spectral methods, and their practical utility is not immediately evident, as no empirical demonstrations using data are provided. Overall, this paper explores network community detection in the context of subsampling and streaming, representing an early effort in this area with the potential to make a meaningful impact.
