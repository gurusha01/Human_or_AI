The manuscript presents a compelling model for analyzing brain states from multi-region LFP time-series. The time-series are divided into distinct time-windows, and an infinite mixture of Gaussian Processes is employed to model the observations within each window. Brain states are assigned to observations via an underlying HDP, while brain regions are grouped into clusters through another HDP. The paper is innovative and generally well-written, though the interpretation of the results requires further refinement. Specific comments are provided below:
a) The algorithm used to segment the time-windows needs to be clarified, as it is a critical factor that could significantly influence the results.
Line 41: A clearer distinction between brain connectivity and brain states is necessary.
Line 100: The statement "each window is considered a single observation" is ambiguous. Since no summary statistic is being computed for observations within each window, the meaning of this statement is unclear.
Line 098 and subsequent lines: There is some confusion in the notation. Are the time-windows distinct for each region, as implied by "For each region, the time-series is split..."? Or are the windows shared across regions, as suggested by the model's formulation?
Line 107: What does L represent, and how is it determined?
Line 113: In equation (1), \(\lambda_g^{(a)}\) should be explicitly defined. Is it a vector across states or animals? This only becomes apparent later on line 124.
Line 183: After equation (6) is introduced, the induced joint distribution across all windows is no longer block diagonal. More concerningly, the joint distribution is not well-defined because the joint covariance matrix is no longer positive semi-definite. Consequently, the infinite mixture of Gaussian Processes cannot be considered a proper process, which is problematic. This limitation should be explicitly acknowledged.
Section 2.2: Gaussian Processes may not be the most suitable choice for modeling brain connectivity within a given state. The covariance function is parameterized by only a few variables and cannot adequately capture the sparsity patterns characteristic of brain connectivity (even when coupled across regions). This limitation should also be acknowledged.
Section 2.3: The necessity of this section is unclear. Decomposing a matrix of latent probabilities at such a low level in the hierarchy makes the tensor characterization seem unnecessary and overly complex.
Line 414: The statement here is redundant (see line 410). Furthermore, the explanation is weak. The results appear to depend on the choice of the clustering mechanism. It is well-documented that the DP should not be used for clustering in an absolute sense (Antoniak, 1974; Miller and Harrison, 2013). Additionally, the parameters of the DPs are fixed (see line 333), which undermines the robustness of the conclusions.
Line 418: What is the significance of this "network" in the context of existing literature? 
In summary, the paper is innovative, original, and generally well-written, but the interpretation of the results requires further improvement.
