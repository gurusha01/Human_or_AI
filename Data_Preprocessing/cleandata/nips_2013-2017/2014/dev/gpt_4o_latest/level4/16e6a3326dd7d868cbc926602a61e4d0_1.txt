The paper investigates a sensor network (or agents) operating in a noisy environment, where local communication is possible. The authors demonstrate that theoretical bounds on the number of active queries can be achieved using straightforward best response dynamics.
The manuscript is well-written, technically sound, and supported by clear synthetic experiments that effectively illustrate the results. The theoretical contributions are original, and I believe the paper merits acceptance for publication at NIPS.
To enhance the paper's value for readers, it would be beneficial to cite and connect the work to recent NIPS papers that provide theoretical guarantees for active learning in noisy settings:
1. "Near-optimal Bayesian active learning with noisy observations" by Golovin et al., NIPS 2010.
2. "Extensions of generalized binary search to group identification and exponential costs" by Bellala et al., NIPS 2010.  
This paper presents innovative and significant theoretical findings for a sensor network in equilibrium of a consensus game, achieved through simple best response dynamics in a noisy environment.
