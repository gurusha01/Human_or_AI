This paper presents a scene-centric database named PLACES, comprising over 6 million labeled images designed for scene recognition. The primary aim of creating this database is to complement ImageNet, an object-centric database, and enhance scene recognition performance by leveraging deep features learned from PLACES. The authors constructed the database by scraping search engines using composite queries and employed Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) for validation. To evaluate the density and diversity of PLACES in comparison to existing databases like SUN and ImageNet, the authors proposed two metrics and again utilized AMT to obtain measurements, demonstrating the advantages of PLACES. Additionally, they compared features learned from PLACES with those learned from ImageNet, highlighting the complementary nature of the two databases. Specifically, PLACES yields superior performance in scene recognition, while ImageNet excels in object recognition.
Strengths of this work:
1. A robust contribution to dataset creation.
2. Comprehensive and persuasive results demonstrating improvements over existing scene databases, underscoring the importance of data.
Minor concerns and suggestions:
1. Limited contribution in terms of algorithmic innovation.
2. For the density metric, nearest neighbors are determined based on the GIST feature. While this approach is consistent across all databases, I am curious whether relying on a specific feature might introduce bias into the density metric.
3. Regarding diversity, it may be challenging for judges to assess similarity when presented with two random images, as comparing unrelated images might not yield meaningful judgments. I wonder if the authors encountered similar challenges during their AMT experiment.
4. Since PLACES and ImageNet are complementary, would it be possible to combine them to train a unified model capable of excelling at both object and scene recognition?
This is a well-executed study on database construction. The paper is clearly written and provides compelling evidence of the database's effectiveness. The reviewer assumes that the database will be made publicly available and believes it will have a significant positive impact on scene image parsing and scene recognition.
