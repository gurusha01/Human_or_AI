This paper introduces an algorithm to identify the optimal chordal Markov network for a decomposable scoring function. Unlike prior approaches that rely on constraint satisfaction or linear programming, the authors demonstrate that the score of a set of junction trees can be recursively factorized. Building on this insight, they propose a dynamic programming algorithm, analyze its complexity, and present results from simulation experiments.
Compared to existing methods, this approach to structure learning for Markov networks is notably distinct, and the authors' ability to reformulate the problem to leverage dynamic programming is commendable. The experimental results clearly indicate that this method is significantly faster than GOBNILP. However, due to its exponential complexity with respect to the number of vertices, scalability remains a concern. Additionally, it is unclear whether the authors directly tested the constraint satisfaction method (Corander et al.) on the same instances as their approach for speed comparisons or simply asserted that their method is faster.
The proofs in the paper could benefit from better organization and clearer explanations, as they were challenging to follow. Furthermore, the axes in Figure 2 should be labeled for clarity. While the paper could be written more clearly overall, it presents a novel and intriguing approach to exact structure learning of chordal Markov networks, achieving a significant improvement in speed over the state of the art.
