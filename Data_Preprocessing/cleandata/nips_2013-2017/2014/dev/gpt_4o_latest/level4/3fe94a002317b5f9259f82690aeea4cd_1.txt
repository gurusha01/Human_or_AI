The authors introduce a novel large-scale scene image dataset that is 60 times larger than the widely used SUN dataset. They demonstrate that deep networks trained on object-centric datasets such as ImageNet are suboptimal for scene recognition tasks, and that training similar networks on extensive scene-centric datasets significantly enhances their performance.
- The comparative analysis of dataset diversity and density is particularly intriguing.
- The proposed dataset contains a significantly larger number of images compared to existing scene image classification benchmark datasets, making it a valuable resource for the community.
- The paper provides compelling evidence that CNN features learned from scene-centric images, specifically using the proposed dataset, outperform those learned from object-centric datasets like ImageNet for scene recognition tasks. Conversely, it is also empirically shown that features from object-centric datasets perform better on object classification tasks.
- Through visualizations, the authors effectively demonstrate that CNNs trained on scene-centric images capture landscape and spatial structures in the deeper layers of the network.
In summary, the paper is well-written and tackles a critical problem in computer vision. The dataset analysis and cross-dataset performance evaluations are insightful, and the proposed dataset represents a significant contribution to the field. I recommend accepting this paper. As computer vision progresses into an era where data may hold greater value than algorithms, this work stands out as a pioneering effort in this direction.
