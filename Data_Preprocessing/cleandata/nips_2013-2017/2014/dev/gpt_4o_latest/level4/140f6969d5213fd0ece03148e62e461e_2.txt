This paper introduces an Autoencoder that incorporates both deterministic and stochastic units to reconstruct faces of the same individual across varying 3D viewpoints. The manuscript is well-written, and the experimental results are robust.
The model depicted in Fig. 2 bears some similarity to the one presented in [25]. The primary distinction lies in the inclusion of v, which is predicted jointly by y and h3. This modification enables feedforward prediction of v, circumventing the need to rely on Bayes' rule. It would be beneficial to elaborate on these differences within the text.
Minor comments:  
- In the abstract, the term 'instinct' could be replaced with 'intuition' or 'insight' for better clarity.  
- In Figures 1 and 6, it would be helpful to clarify whether the examples shown are from the test or training set.  
To further strengthen the paper, the authors could consider implementing the state-of-the-art Siamese CNN approach from [24] and comparing its performance with the proposed method. Overall, this paper presents an autoencoder-based approach for pose representation learning on facial data. The research questions are compelling, and the experimental results appear to support the effectiveness of the proposed method.
