Spectral methods rely on the decomposition of moment tensors. When data are generated from latent variable models, their empirical moment tensors exhibit an approximate low-rank structure, attributable to both noisy observations and finite sample estimation errors. These decompositions can be computed, for instance, using power iteration methods on symmetrized tensors. The foundational principles of spectral methods are well-established, with numerous examples explored in prior work, particularly in [6].
This paper extends spectral fitting methods to data generated under an IBP framework, incorporating two widely used emission models: a linear Gaussian model and a sparse factor analysis model (described in Section 2). The approach involves calculating the relevant moment tensors and their symmetrized forms (Section 3), employing a standard tensor power decomposition method (Section 4), and providing concentration bounds to guarantee recovery when data conform to the model (Section 5). Experimental results are also presented (Section 6).
The work essentially applies established methodology to the IBP context, which, while potentially valuable to the community, might be better suited as an illustrative example in a broader paper like [6] rather than as a standalone NIPS submission. Consequently, the technical novelty and originality appear limited.
There may be contributions here that are not immediately evident. For instance, the authors might have introduced significant deviations from standard techniques, either in the algorithm or in the analysis presented in Section 5. The use of fourth-order moments in Section 3.1 is noted, but this does not appear to represent a major conceptual leap. Similarly, the authors suggest (around line 281) that their concentration bounds methodology is more general, but it remains unclear whether this constitutes a meaningful contribution beyond the scope of this paper. If such contributions exist, the authors should emphasize them in their response and clarify their significance in the manuscript.
The paper is reasonably well-written, but some important points are underexplored. For example, Section 5 feels truncated and somewhat disconnected from the rest of the paper. Strengthening the links between this section and the IBP framework would enhance coherence. Additionally, the interaction between concentration of measure and the nonparametric generative model could be elaborated upon. Specifically, does the number of latent factors \( K \) grow with the sample size \( m \)? Furthermore, references [6,7] do not explicitly address the Dirichlet process, so it is unclear if the nonparametric aspect is adequately contextualized without a more direct reference. Lastly, there appears to be inconsistency in the notation for the sample size, which alternates between \( m \) and \( n \) in Sections 5.1 and 5.2.
The experiments in Section 6 are relatively weak. The first two experiments rely on data generated directly from the model (synthetic data and the classic IBP objects-in-images example), offering limited insight into the method's robustness when data deviate from model assumptionsâ€”a critical consideration for spectral methods. The brief discussion of the third experiment fails to provide a clear comparison of the proposed spectral algorithm's strengths and weaknesses relative to alternative approaches. If the paper's primary contribution is the application of existing techniques to the IBP, the experiments could play a pivotal role in demonstrating when spectral methods are effective and when they fall short. Unfortunately, the current experimental section does not address this.
Additional comments:
- Since [6,7] do not explicitly mention the Dirichlet process (based on a text search), the reference on line 38 seems misplaced.
- Line 113 states that all proofs are deferred to the appendix, but one proof remains in the main text.
- The notation {0;1} on line 134 should likely be {0,1}, and the sentence could be rephrased for clarity.
- The remark on line 142 regarding the undesirability of a property for the power method could be more explicit.
- The plots in Figure 1 appear to be saved in a raster format, making them difficult to read. Text and line sizes should be adjusted for clarity.
- In Figure 3, it is unclear whether the MCMC algorithm was prematurely terminated at 1.72 seconds or if it was genuinely stuck in a suboptimal mode.
While the topic is of interest, the paper primarily presents a standard application of spectral methods to IBP models and does not provide sufficient insight into when spectral methods should be preferred over traditional approaches.
