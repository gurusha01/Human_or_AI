"Zeta Hull Pursuits: Learning Non-convex Data Hulls" tackles the issue of column sampling in datasets by identifying points that minimally impact the Ihara zeta function of a graph (likely constructed using a kernel). The authors establish some foundational properties of the zeta function and analyze the impact of vertex removal on it. These insights are leveraged to propose a fast greedy algorithm for selecting 'outlier' vertices, along with an accelerated version utilizing anchors. Experimental results on standard datasets demonstrate that these selected points can enhance classification accuracy.
The paper is generally well-written, with clear organization and only minor typographical errors. Upon reviewing the proofs, I did not find any errors. However, while the approach is novel, I am uncertain whether the method is sufficiently motivated to warrant acceptance.
The authors suggest that their method enables data summarization without relying on convex hull preservation or inscribing ellipsoids. This, in my view, is the paper's main strength: its ability to identify representative points through a combinatorial approach. That said, the rationale for employing the zeta function remains unclear. A stronger argument for minimizing their epsilon objective, potentially through a more explicit definition of non-convex hulls, would have strengthened the paper's motivation.
Additionally, the technical contributions of the theorems appear limited. Theorem 1 restates a known result about the determinant form of the zeta function (generalized to weighted graphs). Theorems 2 and 3, meanwhile, are relatively straightforward applications of matrix algebra and the SVD.
In summary, while the paper is well-written, organized, and presents a novel method, I find the justification and motivation for the approach insufficiently developed.
