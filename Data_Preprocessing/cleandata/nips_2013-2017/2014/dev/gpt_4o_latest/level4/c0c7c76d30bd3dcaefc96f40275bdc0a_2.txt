This paper introduces a method for non-convex hull learning aimed at selecting a small subset of representative instances from a dataset (column sampling). The main approach involves selecting points on the hull by leveraging structural complexity scores of the graph, computed using zeta functions. To address the computational challenge posed by matrix inversion in the naive implementation, the authors propose an extension utilizing anchor graphs. The paper is reasonably well-written, and the proposed method appears to be novel. Experimental results on several real-world datasets highlight the effectiveness of the approach.
However, I am curious about the robustness of the algorithm in the presence of noise or outliers. It seems plausible that the algorithm might select such points, even though they may not be ideal for column sampling. Additionally, I would like to understand how the proposed method compares to Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs) (http://www.nowpublishers.com/articles/foundations-and-trends-in-machine-learning/MAL-044), which also address subset selection but emphasize diversity. Exploring any potential connections between the two approaches would be highly informative.
This paper proposes a column sampling technique grounded in non-convex hull learning with zeta functions. It should be of interest to the NIPS community, but the inclusion of a discussion on the relationship to other subset selection methods, such as DPPs, would further strengthen the work.
