The authors propose a theoretical framework for modeling neural population dynamics. Their approach involves a noise-driven linear dynamical system that is designed to sample from a specified distribution using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, building on the methodology of (Boerlin et al., 2011). At each timestep, the system's state determines the membrane potentials of a neural population through a linear projection. Through simulations, the authors demonstrate that their model replicates key summary statistics associated with neural populations in simplified scenarios and explore its implications for neural variability and decoding.
The manuscript is generally well-written and maintains a high standard of presentation. However, the discussion can be somewhat dense, and greater clarity in the description of methods would enhance the paper. Specifically, it would be helpful to detail how the method from (Boerlin et al., 2011) was modified. Additionally, questions remain regarding the simulations: Was the decoding matrix learned? What were the time constants used?
The model's structure—low-dimensional dynamics projected linearly to drive population responses—bears resemblance to recent statistical modeling and data analysis efforts (e.g., (Pfau et al., 2013), (Turaga et al., 2013), (Yu et al., 2009), (Ecker et al., 2014)). Several themes in the paper, such as the statistical benefits of redundancy achieved by projecting low-dimensional dynamics into a high-dimensional population and the emphasis on population-level modeling, align with motivations in this body of literature. The success of these statistical models underscores the timeliness of this more theoretical and "biophysically plausible" approach but also highlights the absence of real neural data in this work.
In summary, the proposed approach is intriguing, and the simulated experiments reveal compelling and interesting features. Nonetheless, it is challenging to generalize from the toy examples presented to larger-scale models of population activity. The authors introduce a sampling-based model of latent, low-dimensional population dynamics and demonstrate its ability to approximate neural population characteristics in a simplified setting. While polished and well-articulated, the paper is somewhat limited by the lack of real neural data and the simplified nature of the simulations.
