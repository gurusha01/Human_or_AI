The paper develops and evaluates SBM estimation algorithms for two distinct scenarios: partial information (where only a subset of the adjacency matrix columns is observable) and streaming (where columns are observed sequentially over time). It establishes information-theoretic lower bounds and conducts an asymptotic analysis of the proposed algorithms. However, the absence of a simulation study is concerning, particularly because some algorithms involve tuning parameters that may be challenging to configure.
Quality:  
While I am not an expert in SBM theory and thus cannot rigorously assess the proofs, I found the presentation accessible for someone with my level of expertise. The theoretical contributions appear comprehensive, with the information-theoretic lower bounds aligning well with the algorithmic upper bounds. I also appreciated how Algorithms 3 and 4 are natural extensions of Algorithms 1 and 2, creating a clear connection between the streaming and partial-information settings.
My primary concern is the lack of a simulation study, especially given that Algorithms 3 and 4 rely on tuning parameters, which may significantly impact their performance. While I am confident that Algorithms 1 and 2 are practical, I cannot make the same assertion for Algorithms 3 and 4 without empirical evidence.
Clarity:  
The paper is well-written overall, though some sections are noticeably less polished and appear to have been written by a different author.  
The distinction between Algorithms 3 (offline streaming) and 4 (online streaming) is not clearly articulated. While the necessary information seems to be present in Section 4, it is scattered. A summary paragraph explicitly outlining the differences between these algorithms would improve clarity.
Originality:  
Although my familiarity with the theoretical SBM literature is limited, the paper addresses scenarios (partial information and streaming) that are uncommon in my experience. I would consider the work to be original.
Significance:  
To the best of my knowledge, SBM estimation algorithms for the partial information and streaming settings are not well-explored in the literature. This paper could be highly significant if the authors demonstrated, through simulations, that the proposed algorithms are practical to implement and tune.
Minor comments:  
- On page 8, the authors mention that the supplementary material contains a precise statement comparing their methods to streaming PCA. However, I was unable to locate this statement in the supplementary material.  
- The abstract does not clearly indicate that the paper's contributions are entirely theoretical and lack a simulation study. If accepted in its current form, the abstract should explicitly reflect the paper's scope.  
In summary, the paper provides valuable theoretical insights into network clustering under the SBM model in both the partial-information and streaming settings. However, the absence of even a basic simulation study, combined with the reliance on tuning parameters in Algorithms 3 and 4, raises concerns about the practical applicability of the proposed methods.
