Review - SUMMARY
This paper presents an engaging exploration of tracking dynamics through continuous attractor neural networks. The authors demonstrate that spike frequency adaptation serves as a sufficient condition to generate traveling waves (moving bump attractors). These waves offer a plausible mechanism for anticipatory dynamics when driven by exogenous input. The central idea is that such dynamics could address sensorimotor delay challenges in the brain.
COMMENTS TO AUTHORS
I found this paper to be a clear, well-articulated, and thoughtfully motivated study of continuous attractor networks and wave equations, particularly in the context of anticipatory dynamics in neuronal systems. Below, I provide a few minor suggestions that could enhance the clarity and impact of your presentation.
1) It might be worthwhile to reference predictive coding as a widely recognized framework for understanding active vision and inference, which inherently relies on prediction and anticipation to address oculomotor delays. Within this framework, your work offers a biologically plausible approach to resolving the oculomotor delay problem, which could, in principle, be integrated into an inference scheme based on Bayesian filtering.
2) On line 53, consider replacing "these supporting evidence" with "this supporting evidence."
3) On line 101, I suggest rephrasing as follows: "which is generally assumed to take the following form."
4) It would be helpful to augment Figure 1 by illustrating the difference between the symmetric and asymmetric interaction kernels (Equations 4 and 5). This addition would provide readers with a more intuitive understanding of the asymmetry.
5) In section 2.3, there seems to be a key distinction between the asymmetric neural networks and the "symmetry breaking" introduced by spike frequency adaptation. Specifically, the direction of the traveling wave in the asymmetric formulation appears to be predetermined by the asymmetry in the spatial interaction kernel. If this interpretation is correct, you might consider adding a clarification such as:
"Note that both SFA and asymmetric coupling destabilize stationary bump attractors; however, SFA allows for moving solutions in either direction. This contrasts with the asymmetric coupling implementation, where the direction of motion is dictated by the nature of the asymmetry. This distinction could have important implications for tracking behavior, where targets may move in either direction."
6) I recommend repositioning Figure 2 to follow the introduction of Equation 13 and the definition of intrinsic velocity.
7) In Equation 12, you might want to either replace u with phi or phi with u in the subsequent line to clarify that these represent the principal eigenmodes.
8) On line 305, replace "gives to" with "gives."
I hope these suggestions prove useful should you decide to revise the manuscript. This work provides a compelling demonstration of how spike frequency adaptation can be leveraged in neural field models to produce traveling waves, which may play a critical role in anticipation and tracking.
