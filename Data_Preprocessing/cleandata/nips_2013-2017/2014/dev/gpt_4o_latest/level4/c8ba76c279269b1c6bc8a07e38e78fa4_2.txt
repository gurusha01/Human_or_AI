Here is the paraphrased review:

Firstly, I appreciate the effort to develop a theoretical model for a specific neural circuit. It is refreshing to see a departure from the usual focus on general neural networks or abstractly characterized systems with limited biological grounding. Instead, this paper takes a more targeted approach, which is likely to yield deeper insights into nervous system function.
This work presents a mathematical model of the locust olfactory system. The input is represented as a binary vector encoding the presence or absence of specific molecules. Due to the convergence of multiple ORNs with the same OR onto a single glomerulus, the input is assumed to be noise-free. Within the low-dimensional glomerular layer, the mixed signals from the ORNs are processed through interactions involving local interneurons and PNs. The PNs then project into the higher-dimensional space of KCs, where each KC is hypothesized to encode specific molecules from the input.
The authors begin by framing the problem of recovering the sparse, high-dimensional input via the KCs as a MAP optimization problem, which is subsequently reformulated within the framework of compressed sensing. The dual formulation of the compressed sensing problem is then adopted as a model, as it lends itself more readily to interpretation in the context of the locust nervous system. The model is further refined to incorporate biological constraints, ensuring that the dynamics occur within the M-dimensional signal space. This refinement is achieved through the application of ICA, which enables the circuit to learn an M-dimensional subspace within the full N-dimensional space.
This paper stands out for its originality in integrating concepts from compressed sensing, ICA, and a specific neural circuit. The model's presentation is clear and accessible. However, I would like to see a more detailed explanation of the biological circuit and its correspondence to the model. For instance, does each OR bind to multiple molecules, resulting in glomeruli that represent molecular mixtures? Do the PNs read out these glomerular mixtures while also participating in the dynamics that ultimately allow the KCs to sample mixtures of PNs? The key question is: at what stage does the mixing occur? After reviewing the paper and its references, this remains unclear. I am particularly uncertain about whether each OR binds to one or multiple molecules. Clarifying how the biological circuit maps to the model would strengthen the paper, especially since its primary strength lies in modeling a specific circuit. To make room for these clarifications, the authors might consider condensing sections that describe models ultimately not used.
As it stands, the model is compelling and appears biologically motivated, but its impact would be significantly enhanced by demonstrating that the model's dynamics align with those of the biological circuit. For example, does the gradient descent or ICA dynamics in the model resemble the dynamics observed in the actual circuit? Including a figure that compares model simulations to physiological data—such as individual neuron responses—would be highly valuable. Alternatively, is there evidence of ICA-like processing in the locust olfactory system? Do the ICA dynamics align with any behavioral or physiological measurements in locusts? Another possibility is to show that odor discrimination performance in the reduced dual model mirrors that of the biological circuit. Addressing these points in a revised version or future work would elevate the significance of this study. 
In conclusion, this paper introduces a novel model of the locust olfactory circuit that integrates concepts from compressed sensing and ICA. While stronger evidence linking the model to the physiology of the biological circuit would enhance its impact, the work remains of interest to the NIPS community in its current form.
