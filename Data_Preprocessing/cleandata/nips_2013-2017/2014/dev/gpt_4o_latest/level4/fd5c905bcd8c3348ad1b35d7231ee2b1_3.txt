SUMMARY
This paper presents a tailored variational approach for inverting state-space models of spectral density derived from LFP time-series data. Specifically, the paper introduces a custom variational inversion framework employing a hidden Markov model to represent discrete brain states that generate activity, with spectral responses modeled as a Gaussian process for the time-series. I found this to be an intriguing, albeit somewhat informal, application of variational Bayes that could benefit from being situated within the broader context of dynamical causal modeling and its relevance to neurobiological time-series analysis.
COMMENTS TO AUTHORS
I appreciated the opportunity to review this detailed and innovative work on variational state-space model inversion for time-series data. The technical aspects were impressive, and the methodology was well-articulated. Below, I provide some suggestions to help contextualize your work within the broader field of dynamic causal modeling and to emphasize the potential utility of your approach. Consider the following points:
1) Contextualization within Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM):  
   In neuroscience, the variational inversion of state-space models for electrophysiological time-series is often framed within the paradigm of dynamic causal modeling. There is an established body of work on the dynamic causal modeling of cross-spectral density, which has been applied to multi-region LFP and MEG time-series. It would enhance the scholarly impact of your paper to reference this literature. A useful starting point is the overview provided at:  
   [http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Dynamiccausalmodeling](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Dynamiccausalmodeling)  
   Your unique contribution lies in formulating a state-space model using a hidden Markov model, as opposed to the differential equation-based approach typical of DCMs. Highlighting this distinction would underscore the utility of your method, particularly for applications involving steep transitions or endogenous shifts between brain states.
2) Clarification of Terminology:  
   Your description of the generative model is tailored for a machine learning audience, with terms like "spectral mixture kernel" and "Gaussian processes." However, this terminology might be less accessible to readers from engineering, signal processing, or neurobiology backgrounds. Linking your terminology to standard concepts in these fields would improve accessibility. For example:  
   - The Fourier transform of your spectral mixture corresponds to the auto-covariance function.  
   - The term "kernel" is used colloquially in your paper but might be misinterpreted in other fields, where it often refers to the impulse response function or first-order Volterra kernel (whose Fourier transform is the transfer function). Clarifying these terms, perhaps in a glossary, would be helpful.
3) Connection to Variational Free Energy:  
   When introducing the bound on model evidence or marginal likelihood, consider explicitly referring to this as the variational free energy. This would help readers draw connections between your work and the established use of variational free energy in dynamic causal modeling.
4) Illustrating Practical Utility:  
   To demonstrate the practical value of your approach, you could further explore the clusters identified in the sleep data. For instance, you might elaborate on how these clusters relate to classical sleep staging schemes (e.g., four distinct states). A potential example:  
   "To illustrate the potential relevance of our (Bayes-optimal) state-space model inversion, we can relate the clusters identified during sleep to classical sleep staging schemes. By examining the similarity between our clusters (spectral mixtures) and traditional spectral profiles, we observe that stage four can be decomposed into three sub-stages..."  
   Providing such a proof of principle would highlight how your approach advances beyond existing knowledge.
MINOR POINTS
1) Abstract:  
   In the abstract, consider rephrasing to: "The model is able to estimate the number of brain states..."
2) Clarification on Page 2:  
   On page 2, clarify which of "the above two methods" you are referring to. For instance:  
   "More recently, new methods for tensor factorization have been developed: in reference 7, tensor factorization was applied to short-term FFT..."  
   This would make it clear that the tensor factorization is not related to the current paper.
3) Below Equation 6:  
   Rephrase to: "The parameters describe the auto-correlation content associated with each y." While your intent is clear, the data is being characterized in the time domain, not the spectral domain. In essence, spectral mixtures are used to constrain the Gaussian process.
4) Table 1 Clarification:  
   At the top of page 8, clarify what is being predicted in Table 1. When discussing the "held-out log predictive probability for different priors," specify what this probability distribution is over.
5) Generative Model Assumptions:  
   Address a key limitation of your generative model. Typically, state-space models of spectral density (or auto-covariance functions) account for cross-spectra or cross-covariance functions. That is, they predict not only the spectral density at each node or region but also the coupling between regions based on their connectivity. Make it explicit that your generative model does not currently consider complex cross-spectra (cross-covariance functions) and discuss the potential for extending the model in this direction.
6) Supplementary Material:  
   When discussing updates for global probability vectors in the supplementary material, mention that using point estimates obviates the need to consider the entropy of the posterior distribution in the variational free energy. Instead, the log posterior can be used directly.
CONCLUSION
This paper presents an intriguing variational scheme for state-space models based on a hidden Markov model and a spectral mixture model for electrophysiological time-series. While it may lack biological plausibility, it holds promise for applications such as sleep staging and the classification of epileptic discharges. I hope these comments are helpful should revisions be necessary.
