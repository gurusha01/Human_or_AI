The paper presents a method to accelerate the representation of probability distributions using spiking neurons by leveraging linear probabilistic population codes (PPCs). Initially, the authors demonstrate how an appropriate choice of integrate-and-fire model can enable sampling from target distributions through a linear mapping of spikes. They then argue that any product of exponentials distribution can be accommodated within the dynamics of a PPC, allowing sampling akin to multi-chain MCMC. The key conclusion is that a single population of K neurons can sample K chains, as opposed to requiring K separate networks to achieve the same.
The majority of the paper is devoted to exploring the neural implications of this scheme for encoding probability distributions, using metrics commonly employed in neuroscience.
While the results are intriguing, I find the paper somewhat misaligned with the NIPS audience. The PPC method is described only briefly and is primarily illustrated in Figure 1f with minimal elaboration. Conversely, the focus on neural implications (pages 5, 6, and 7) feels excessive and somewhat arbitrary, as it primarily demonstrates that the proposed encoding scheme, with its specific network topology, is not inconsistent with existing observations. In my view, the paper would have been stronger with a more detailed exposition of the results in Section 1, including more comprehensive demonstrations and visualizations of the method.
Additionally, I am concerned that, based on my reading of the PPC framework in Ma et al. (2006), there is no inherent limitation in their model that prevents multiple neurons from independently computing posterior Gaussian distributions. It seems the distinction in the presented model arises from the use of spike-coding rather than the rate-coding employed in Ma et al.'s work. This distinction warrants further elaboration in the paper.
I would also note that several papers in this domain (e.g., [6]) suffer from a similar issue, where extracting the technical details is challenging (e.g., the coding scheme in [6] as referenced in equation (1)). To my relief, other respected NIPS reviewers have independently expressed similar concerns.
Minor question: The firing rates shown in Figure 2a are quite high for many biological neurons. To what extent does the proposed scheme depend on such elevated firing rates?
Typos:
- p3 l142: "each neurons" → "each neuron"
- p3 l153: "we can encoding" → "we can encode"
- p3 l160: Q: Should "x" in the equation (from line 159) be "y"?
- p4 l188: "the s sampling" → ?
- p8 l386: "in central question" → "is a central question"
Overall, this is an interesting approach with clear relevance to NIPS. However, the presentation is unbalanced, and the computational contribution (Section 1) deserves greater emphasis and elaboration.
