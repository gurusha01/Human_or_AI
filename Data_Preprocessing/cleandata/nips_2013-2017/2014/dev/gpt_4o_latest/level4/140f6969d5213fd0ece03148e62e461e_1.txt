This paper introduces a novel approach for multi-view face representation using a neural network-like model that incorporates both deterministic and probabilistic units. The proposed network is trained to recover both the identity and the view of the input, with the additional capability of synthesizing new views. Overall, the paper effectively disentangles the key factors contributing to the method's success, and the reported results appear to be strong.
However, the paper would benefit from more justification for the design choices made in the model. For instance, it is unclear whether a non-deterministic approach is strictly necessary in this case. Could a fully feed-forward model with deterministic neurons have been sufficient? Such a design would have avoided the need for variational or importance sampling-based inference.
Quality: This is generally a strong paper, presenting an interesting and well-founded model that is evaluated effectively on a competitive benchmark.
Clarity: The paper is well-written and mostly easy to follow.
Originality: The approach bears some similarity to prior work by Geoff Hinton and collaborators, who employed stacks of Restricted Boltzmann Machines, with the top RBM incorporating labels as side information.
Significance: The paper is likely to be of interest to the facial recognition community and to researchers tackling problems where a hybrid deterministic and generative approach could be advantageous.
Comments and questions:
- What motivated the specific structure shown in Figure 2? Additional insights into the design choices would be helpful.
- The definition of \( q(h) \) on line 165 should be explicitly provided.
- Is the use of the MCEM method critical to the proposed model? More analysis is needed to justify this choice, as MCEM is not a widely adopted optimization method in the community.
- For inference: What is the size of \( S \) on line 235? How computationally expensive is the inference process overall? Providing numerical results or \( O() \)-notation complexity would strengthen the paper.
- Is LDA essential for achieving the best results? How do the results compare when LDA is omitted?
- The references to how the brain works should be minimized unless strongly justified. There is limited evidence that the proposed method closely aligns with human facial recognition or viewpoint interpolation mechanisms.
- Did the authors evaluate their approach on the Labeled Faces in the Wild benchmark? If so, are there results available for comparison?
In summary, this paper presents an interesting and novel approach to face recognition using a graphical neural network-like model trained to recover both identity and viewpoint. The method achieves competitive results on the MultiPIE benchmark and is supported by solid experimental evaluations.
