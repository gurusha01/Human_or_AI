Review - Summary:
The authors introduce a continuous attractor neural model capable of implementing (anticipatory) tracking. They demonstrate that spike frequency adaptation (SFA) can generate traveling waves under specific conditions. Notably, the authors highlight that the effects induced by SFA resemble those achieved through asymmetric coupling between neurons, as shown in [14], but with the advantage that this approach does not rely on hard-wired connections. The majority of the paper focuses on a theoretical analysis of a simplified model, complemented by simulations of the full model for validation. The proposed model is shown to sustain traveling waves and replicate both perfect tracking and anticipatory tracking.
Comments to the authors:
This paper is well-written and engaging, particularly the connection drawn between the model in [14] and the demonstration that SFA can produce a similar effect. 
As I am not a specialist in this domain, I find it challenging to assess the novelty of this work. For example, you reference [12] to indicate that it is already known that a continuous attractor network with SFA can exhibit traveling waves, yet in the abstract, you claim to propose the SFA mechanism for tracking. It would be helpful to clearly distinguish your novel contributions in the introduction.
Are the time constants used in the model (e.g., in Figure 2B) biologically realistic? Could you provide a discussion on this? A factor of 60 difference between \(\tau\) and \(\tau_v\) seems significant.
To what extent does the model align with experimental data? Including such comparisons would enhance the paper's appeal and relevance.
Minor issues:
- Line 53: "unpredictable flash" – This does not seem related to the predictability of the flash, as it could occur at regular intervals. The key point is that the flashing stimulus is stationary.  
- Lines 53-55: "Despite ..." – Rephrase, e.g., "Although it is clear that the brain ..., it remains unclear ... ."  
- Lines 59-60: "moving speed of an object" – Change to "speed of a moving object."  
- Line 81: "anticipative time" – Change to "anticipative times."  
- Line 100: "2 ~ 5 ms \(\rho\) is" – Rephrase to "2 ~ 5 ms, \(\rho\) is the neural density, and."  
- Line 150: "dynamical property" – Change to "dynamical properties."  
- Line 151: "of adding the" – Change to "of adding."  
- Figure 2B: What are the units of \(v_{\text{int}}\)?  
- Line 208: "traveling wave" – Change to "traveling waves."  
- Line 215: "the simulation" – Change to "simulation."  
- Line 215: "that at" – Change to "that in."  
- Line 216: "the Gaussian shape" – Change to "Gaussian shape."  
- Line 232: "is dominated" – Change to "are dominated."  
- Line 258: "effect on" – Change to "effect of."  
- Lines 304-306: "which gives to (twice)" – Rephrase to "gives rise to."  
- Lines 320-321: "SFA holds these appealing" – Change to "SFA exhibits these properties."  
- Line 354: "Prefect" – Correct to "Perfect."  
- Line 360: "the condition that ..." – Rephrase to "the approximation."  
- Line 361: "We carry" – Change to "We carried."  
- Line 265: "of stimulus speed" – Change to "of stimulus speeds."  
- Throughout the manuscript: Replace "holding a traveling wave" with "contains a traveling wave" or "can exhibit traveling waves."  
Overall, the paper is well-written and intriguing, though I find it difficult to evaluate the novelty of the work. Including a comparison with experimental data would significantly enhance the paper's impact and relevance.
