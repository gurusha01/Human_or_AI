The authors have extended the findings of [11] and [12] to more general scenarios. The proposed computational framework is applicable to:  
(a) Strongly convex and twice differentiable loss functions.  
(b) Decomposable regularization functions.  
The theoretical analysis appears sound, and the numerical results are convincing. While (b) aligns naturally with sparse learning problems, (a) seems somewhat restrictive, as many sparse learning problems are formulated as non-strongly convex problems.  
Here are my two main concerns:  
(1) Eq.(16) appears to be a strong assumption. Could the authors provide concrete examples to clarify?  
(2) Block coordinate descent algorithms are a competitive alternative for solving the optimization problem discussed in Section 5.2. Could the authors include a more detailed comparison?  
Response to the rebuttal:  
When considering the statistical error, achieving an overly "accurate" solution is often unnecessary. To provide a more comprehensive comparison between the proposed algorithm and first-order block coordinate descent algorithms, the authors may need to conduct additional experiments, such as evaluating timing versus classification error in multi-task learning. My hypothesis is that the local quadratic convergence of the proposed method might not offer significant advantages in terms of statistical error. However, I agree that achieving a "very accurate" solution is beneficial if computational resources permit.  
Overall, I find this paper to be of high quality and would like to see it accepted for presentation at NIPS.
