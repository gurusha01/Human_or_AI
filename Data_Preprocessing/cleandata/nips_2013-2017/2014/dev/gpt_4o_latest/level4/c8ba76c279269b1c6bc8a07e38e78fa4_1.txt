Review - Summary:
This paper explores the connection between sparse optimization techniques and the anatomical structure of the locust's early olfactory system. The study is inspired by the observation that odorant molecules are sparsely represented by the population of Kenyon cells. Initially, the authors mathematically model the olfactory system as a MAP decoder and present the standard solution to the problem without incorporating biological constraints. Subsequently, to enhance biological plausibility, they reformulate the model as a decoder for a compressive sensing problem and propose two standard solutions to the dual problem. The authors then attempt to map components of the mathematical solution to units of the biological structure in the olfactory system. However, these mappings lack strong justification, and there are conceptual issues in connecting the mathematical framework to the biological system.
Further clarification on the following points would provide readers with deeper insights:
- While the use of a Heaviside function to model LNs and KCs is consistent with existing literature, the modeling of PNs as Lagrange multipliers is less intuitive and requires justification. Specifically, under this modeling, PN outputs are computed using the gradient descent method in Eq. (10) for the full dual algorithm and in Eq. (16) for the reduced dual algorithm, which necessitates iterative optimization. However, it is unclear how PNs biologically implement gradient descent or the iterative mechanism. A significant issue arises with Eq. (10), as its solution may yield negative values, whereas the PN output rate (lambda) must remain positive.
- The B matrix is introduced to replace the A matrix, ostensibly to account for the role of LNs in the solution. However, it is unclear why the solution to Eq. (12) (with the B matrix) is equivalent to the solution to Eq. (10) (with the A matrix). The authors need to demonstrate that the lambda computed from Eq. (12) converges to the lambda from Eq. (10). Additionally, the B matrix is square, which implies an equal number of PNs and LNs, a condition that does not hold biologically since there are more PNs than LNs. How would the reduced dual circuit perform if the B matrix were rectangular, with dimensions reflecting the actual ratio of LNs to PNs?
- Further concerns about the B matrix. The B matrix is not fixed and must be relearned for each new input. As shown in Fig. 3, the proposed method does not always learn the B matrix accurately. What is the performance of the reduced dual circuit when the B matrix is poorly learned? Moreover, the B matrix must be learned before being used for Kenyon cell readout. While the authors propose a procedure to combine learning and readout, they neither justify this approach nor provide simulations to validate it, making it difficult to assess its correctness.
Finally, the authors suggest that the connectivity between PNs and KCs is structurally related to the A matrix. However, in a recent study (Caron, S.J.C., Ruta, V., Abbott, L.F., and Axel, R. (2013) Random Convergence of Afferent Olfactory Inputs in the Drosophila Mushroom Body. Nature 497:113-117), it is argued that this connectivity is random. Is there a reason to believe that this randomness does not apply to the locust as well?
Originality:
The paper attempts to bridge an optimization framework with the neural circuitry of the insect olfactory system.
Clarity:
The manuscript appears to have been prepared hastily, making the main message difficult to discern at first glance.
Quality:
The authors need to convincingly demonstrate that the mapping between the sparse optimization solution and the neural circuit is valid and that the proposed methods effectively solve the decoding problem.

Overall, the paper falls short both mathematically and in its attempt to link the mathematical framework to the biological system.
