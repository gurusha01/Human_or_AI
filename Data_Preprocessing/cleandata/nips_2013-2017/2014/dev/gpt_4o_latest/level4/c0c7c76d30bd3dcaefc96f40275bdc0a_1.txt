The paper introduces an innovative method for column sampling in scenarios where data point clusters form non-convex hulls. Column sampling plays a critical role in selecting a representative subset of data that retains the characteristics of the original dataset. The proposed method leverages the computation of Zeta hulls. The authors utilize the sum-product rule to model graph cycles and incorporate these cycles through the Zeta function. They formulate the optimization problem as identifying the subset of points with the highest point extremeness. Additionally, the authors propose a scalable algorithm to address the problem, employing the anchor graph method to reconstruct the original weighted graph from a reduced set of anchors. To enhance scalability, they perform a low-rank approximation of the anchor graph. The paper also includes an analysis of the time and space complexity of the proposed approach.
The authors validate their methodology on both synthetic datasets and real-world datasets from text and image classification tasks. They benchmark their approach against several state-of-the-art baseline methods, demonstrating that their method achieves superior performance. Overall, the paper presents a novel framework for column sampling based on Zeta hull pursuits, with experimental results indicating significant performance gains over baseline methods on real-world data.
