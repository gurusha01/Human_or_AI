This paper presents an application of the method-of-moments technique to perform inference in the Indian Buffet Process (IBP). The IBP is a significant nonparametric Bayesian model with numerous applications. Existing sampling-based inference methods are computationally intensive. The method-of-moments approach proposed in this paper leverages the tensor decomposition framework from [6]. The primary contributions of the paper include: a moment analysis tailored to the IBP that underpins the proposed method, an analysis of the computational and sample complexity of the inference method, and experimental results demonstrating the method's performance on synthetic data and image recovery tasks, where it compares favorably to the "infinite variational approach."
The paper is well-written and well-motivated. A key takeaway is the perspective of treating nonparametric models as "effectively parametric," which enables a "parameter estimation" approach to inference. This perspective aligns closely with the approach in [7] for inference in the mixed-membership block model. This is an appealing idea, and the paper does a commendable job of promoting it.
As noted earlier, the main technical contribution lies in the moment analysis for the IBP. A notable feature of the IBP is that certain components of the third- and fourth-order moments may be absent due to specific "dish probabilities," but collectively, these moments capture all components.
The concentration inequalities used are fairly standard, with a minor improvement over the less precise analysis in [23]. The error analysis largely follows the frameworks in [23,8]. Much of the discussion in Section 4 regarding the use of random projections and the efficient implementation of the "projected" tensor power method is derived from [6] and should be properly cited.
Specific comments:
- Line 91: "z ~ IBP(z)" — Could you clarify the meaning here?
- Line 223: "(...)_epsilon" — What does epsilon represent in this context?
- Line 283: "average-median theorem" — Where is this theorem applied in the paper?
- Line 582: "convexity of expectations" — Do you mean Jensen's inequality and the convexity of the Euclidean norm?
[Having reviewed the author rebuttal,] in conclusion, this paper provides a clear and well-articulated account of using a method-of-moments approach based on tensor decompositions for inference in a specific nonparametric Bayesian model (IBP). While the algorithmic and technical novelty is somewhat incremental, the paper offers an interesting contribution that is likely to be of value to the machine learning community.
