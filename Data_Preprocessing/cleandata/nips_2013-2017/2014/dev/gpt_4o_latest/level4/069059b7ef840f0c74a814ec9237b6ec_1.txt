This paper introduces a novel pairwise clustering framework in which nonparametric pairwise similarity is obtained by minimizing the generalization error of an unsupervised nonparametric classifier. The framework effectively bridges the gap between clustering and multi-class classification, offering a theoretical explanation for the widely adopted kernel similarity in clustering. The authors further establish that the generalization error bound for the unsupervised plug-in classifier asymptotically corresponds to the weighted volume of the cluster boundary under the low-density separation assumption. Utilizing the derived nonparametric pairwise similarity from the plug-in classifier, the paper proposes a new nonparametric exemplar-based clustering method with improved discriminative power compared to existing exemplar-based clustering approaches.
Here are some comments:
1. In equation (6), which provides an estimate for the regression function, shouldn't there be a \pi^{(i)} in the numerator, as mentioned in line 123?
2. In Lemma 2, the kernel bandwidth h should be denoted as h_n.
3. Typo: line 63, remove the repeated word "the."
4. The theoretical results are compelling and particularly noteworthy for their connection to the low-density separation principle.
5. While the theoretical contributions are strong, the application of these results to develop a new nonparametric exemplar-based clustering algorithm appears somewhat complex.
Overall, this is an engaging and thought-provoking paper.
