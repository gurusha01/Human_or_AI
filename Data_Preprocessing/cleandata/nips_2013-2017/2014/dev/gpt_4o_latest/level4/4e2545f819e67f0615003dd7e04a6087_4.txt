The authors propose a recurrent spiking neural network model designed to sample from multivariate probability distributions using MCMC. A notable strength of their approach lies in the separation of computation and representation: samples from the target distribution are extracted from the network's response via a linear decoder, meaning that neurons do not need to directly correspond to individual random variables. This enables a rich distributed spatio-temporal code to represent the underlying distribution. Additionally, this separation introduces architectural flexibility, allowing the network to execute multiple MCMC chains in parallel, thereby approximating the target distribution almost instantaneously.
The theoretical framework is supported by computer simulations that (a) confirm the general feasibility of the approach, (b) demonstrate how the network performs inference within a simple generative model, and (c) compare the network's response characteristics to findings from experimental neuroscience. The authors also investigate how the method can be applied to infer properties of the underlying distribution when the linear decoder is unknown—an important step for applications involving experimental data.
Overall, this is a strong manuscript that introduces several novel ideas of interest to a broad research audience. The manuscript is generally well-written, particularly the introduction and discussion sections, and the computer simulations and figures effectively illustrate the network's properties. Furthermore, the work aligns well with the scope of the conference.
However, I have several critical comments that detract from the otherwise positive impression.
(A) The manuscript contains instances of missing or extraneous words, which occasionally affect the clarity of the content. Examples can be found in lines 46, 47, 142, 153, 188, 223, and 386.
(B) Certain definitions and mechanisms are not clearly introduced. For instance, the spike trains \( o_i \) are not defined in line 80, and the reset mechanism (described in [6]) is not mentioned around line 140.
(C) The derivation is highly condensed and requires familiarity with references [6-8]. Additionally, relevant information, such as the definition of the generative model, is relegated to the supplementary information (SI). Key simulation parameters, such as the number of neurons, the decoding matrix in Fig. 1, \(\lambda\), and \(\tau_{\text{slow}}\), are also missing, making it difficult to verify the results. Some of these details should be included in the SI.
(D) While the network architecture allows for significant flexibility in the recurrent weight matrices, the connections remain symmetric (at least in the Gaussian case). This limitation should be explicitly acknowledged in the manuscript.
(E) I am uncertain whether all equations are entirely correct. Although I did not examine the details exhaustively, I noted a few potential issues that the authors may wish to verify. For example, in line 141, should the summation run over the first index of the decoder? The sparseness parameter \(\lambda\) influences the spike response but does not appear in other equations to account for this effect—is this intentional? Similarly, the time constant \(\tau{\text{slow}}\), which scales the recurrent weights and drift, is not further specified. Is it arbitrary, or does it correspond to \(\tauv\)?
In summary, the manuscript attempts to address a wide range of research questions within its nine pages, which somewhat compromises the clarity of individual sections. For instance, since the derivation relies on approximations, it would be helpful to explore their range of validity. Additionally, the intriguing multi-chain sampler warrants a more detailed presentation. Nevertheless, I view this manuscript as an important and valuable contribution to the conference, provided the authors address some of the aforementioned issues. I also hope that follow-up papers will further investigate the presented ideas in greater depth.
In conclusion, this is a strong manuscript that introduces highly interesting concepts. While it has some presentation deficiencies, I am confident that these can be resolved in the final version.
