The paper presents a novel approach to modeling brain states using an infinite hidden Markov model (iHMM) combined with Gaussian processes (GPs) to analyze the spectral content of local field potential (LFP) time-series data. The main contribution lies in replacing traditional differential equation-based state-space models with HMMs, enabling exploratory analysis of brain state transitions without requiring a priori hypotheses. This is particularly significant for studying arousal states and sleep staging, where the model identifies brain states and their spectral characteristics directly from raw data.
The paper is well-motivated, addressing limitations of existing methods such as their inability to capture time dependencies, reliance on predefined frequency bins, and lack of flexibility in modeling individual brain regions within global states. The proposed variational Bayesian inference scheme, augmented with split-merge moves, is a technically sound and innovative solution to handle the complexity of the model. The authors validate their approach on synthetic and real-world datasets, including sleep and novel environment experiments, demonstrating its ability to uncover biologically relevant brain states and spectral patterns.
However, several areas require improvement. First, the paper should better contextualize its contributions within the broader framework of dynamic causal modeling (DCM), particularly by explicitly linking the variational free energy bound to model evidence, as is standard in DCM literature. The use of machine learning terminology (e.g., spectral mixture kernel, tensor factorization) could be clarified by drawing parallels to concepts familiar in signal processing and neurobiology. Additionally, the abstract should explicitly highlight the model's ability to estimate the number of brain states, which is a key feature.
The application to sleep data is promising but could be strengthened by relating the identified states to classical sleep staging schemes (e.g., NREM, REM) and providing a more detailed biological interpretation. The limitations of the model, such as its inability to account for cross-spectra or cross-covariance functions, should be acknowledged explicitly, with suggestions for future work. Furthermore, the predictive probability results in Table 1 require clearer explanation, particularly regarding the distribution being predicted.
In terms of clarity, the paper is dense and could benefit from improved organization, particularly in the methods and inference sections. The supplementary material should be better integrated into the main text to ensure accessibility for readers unfamiliar with the technical details.
Strengths:
1. Novel use of HMMs and GPs for exploratory analysis of brain states.
2. Technically sound variational inference with split-merge moves.
3. Demonstrated biological relevance in sleep and arousal studies.
4. Potential for broad applications in neuroscience.
Weaknesses:
1. Insufficient contextualization within DCM and related literature.
2. Lack of clarity in terminology and results presentation.
3. Limited biological interpretation of identified states.
4. Does not account for cross-spectra or cross-covariance functions.
Recommendation:
While the paper has significant strengths and introduces a promising framework, it requires revisions to improve clarity, contextualization, and biological interpretation. With these improvements, it would make a valuable contribution to the field. Accept with major revisions.
