This paper addresses a critical challenge in high-dimensional non-convex optimization, particularly in deep neural networks, by identifying saddle points, rather than local minima, as the primary impediment to effective optimization. Drawing from statistical physics, random matrix theory, and neural network theory, the authors argue that saddle points proliferate in high-dimensional spaces, creating plateaus that slow learning. They propose the Saddle-Free Newton (SFN) method, a novel approach leveraging second-order curvature information to escape saddle points efficiently. The paper provides both theoretical insights and empirical validation using MNIST and CIFAR datasets, demonstrating SFN's superior performance over traditional methods like SGD and Newton's method.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Significance: The paper challenges conventional wisdom by shifting the focus from local minima to saddle points in high-dimensional optimization, a perspective that could significantly impact the field. The proposed SFN method is a theoretically grounded and practically effective solution to this problem.
2. Theoretical Rigor: The authors synthesize insights from diverse disciplines and provide a compelling theoretical framework for understanding the prevalence of saddle points and their impact on optimization dynamics.
3. Empirical Validation: The experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and a deep autoencoder convincingly demonstrate SFN's ability to escape saddle points and improve training performance. The results are consistent with the theoretical predictions, adding credibility to the claims.
4. Clarity and Organization: The paper is well-written and logically structured, making complex concepts accessible. The inclusion of visualizations, such as eigenvalue distributions and error curves, enhances understanding.
Weaknesses:
1. Krylov Subspace Approximation: While the use of Krylov subspaces makes SFN computationally feasible, the reliance on only the k largest eigenvectors of the Hessian raises concerns. This approach might overlook critical negative curvature directions, potentially limiting the method's effectiveness near certain saddle points.
2. Baseline Comparisons: The comparison with Hessian-Free optimization could be more robust. The lack of carefully tuned MSGD initialization in the baseline might unfairly disadvantage competing methods.
3. Visualization of Dynamics: The paper would benefit from additional visualizations, such as weight changes after switching from MSGD to SFN, to provide deeper insights into the optimization dynamics.
4. Minor Suggestions: Adding a vertical line in Fig. 4b to indicate the switch to SFN would improve clarity.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:
Pros:
- Addresses a fundamental and underexplored issue in high-dimensional optimization.
- Proposes a novel and theoretically justified method with strong empirical results.
- Well-written and accessible to a broad audience.
Cons:
- Potential limitations in the Krylov subspace approximation.
- Comparisons with baselines could be more rigorous.
Recommendation:
This paper makes a significant contribution to the field of non-convex optimization and deep learning by reframing the optimization challenge and proposing an innovative solution. While there are some concerns about the Krylov subspace method and baseline comparisons, these do not overshadow the paper's strengths. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the noted weaknesses.
