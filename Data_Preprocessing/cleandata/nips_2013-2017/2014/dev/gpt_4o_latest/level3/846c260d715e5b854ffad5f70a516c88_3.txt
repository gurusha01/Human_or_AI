This paper presents a novel spectral algorithm for inference in Indian Buffet Process (IBP) models, offering an efficient alternative to Variational Bayes and sampling-based methods. The authors derive tensorial moments for IBP and its applications, propose a computationally efficient iterative inference algorithm, and provide theoretical guarantees for recovery and stability. Algorithm 1 is well-detailed and demonstrates the practical implementation of their method. The paper claims superior accuracy and computational efficiency compared to variational methods, supported by experiments on synthetic data, image recovery, and gene expression datasets.
Strengths:
1. Theoretical Contributions: The paper makes significant strides in extending spectral methods to IBP models. The tensorial characterization of moments and the robust tensor power method are technically sound and well-explained. The derivation of concentration of measure bounds and reconstruction guarantees adds rigor to the proposed approach.
2. Algorithmic Clarity: Algorithm 1 is clearly presented, making the method reproducible. The use of Excess Correlation Analysis (ECA) to whiten tensors and reduce dimensionality is innovative and practical.
3. Efficiency: The proposed spectral algorithm demonstrates faster runtime compared to MCMC and variational methods, as evidenced by the experiments.
4. Novelty: Extending spectral methods to IBP is a novel contribution, addressing a gap in nonparametric Bayesian inference.
Weaknesses:
1. Theorem 3: While theoretically interesting, Theorem 3 lacks practical implications. The statement that the method "eventually works" is vague, and further clarification on the polynomial's nature and its impact on real-world applications is needed.
2. Experimental Limitations: The experiments are limited to toy data and a single gene expression dataset. While the results are promising, they are not sufficiently convincing. Comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, such as those in Reed and Ghahramani (ICML 2013), are missing. The lack of experiments on larger, more realistic datasets limits the paper's significance.
3. Scalability Concerns: Figure 4 raises questions about the scalability of the method. The absence of MCMC analysis for comparison further weakens the experimental evaluation.
4. Introductory Claim: The claim that spectral inference in Dirichlet Processes is "settled" is unsupported by the cited references, which undermines the credibility of the introduction.
5. Clarity Issues: Equations (2) and (3) require clarification regarding their connection to IBP(Î±). Additionally, some derivations are relegated to the appendix, which might hinder understanding for readers unfamiliar with the topic.
Recommendation:
While the paper makes a strong theoretical contribution and proposes an impressive spectral algorithm, its experimental evaluation falls short of the standards expected for NIPS. To strengthen the paper, the authors should:
1. Provide more extensive experiments on realistic datasets.
2. Include comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, particularly those from Reed and Ghahramani (ICML 2013).
3. Clarify the practical implications of Theorem 3 and address scalability concerns.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Novel extension of spectral methods to IBP models.
- Strong theoretical foundation and algorithmic clarity.
- Promising preliminary results on synthetic and real-world datasets.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Limited experimental validation and lack of comparisons with state-of-the-art methods.
- Scalability concerns and insufficient exploration of practical implications.
- Unsupported claims in the introduction and minor clarity issues.
Overall, this paper is a valuable contribution to the field but requires additional experimental rigor to meet the standards of a top-tier conference like NIPS.
