The paper introduces a novel pairwise clustering framework that derives nonparametric pairwise similarity by minimizing the generalization error of unsupervised nonparametric classifiers. This approach bridges the gap between clustering and multi-class classification, offering a theoretical foundation for the widely used kernel similarity in clustering. The authors prove that the generalization error bound for the plug-in classifier is asymptotically equivalent to the weighted volume of the cluster boundary under the Low Density Separation criterion. Furthermore, the paper proposes a new exemplar-based clustering method leveraging the derived similarity measure, demonstrating enhanced discriminative capability.
Strengths:
1. Theoretical Contribution: The connection between generalization error bounds and the weighted volume of the cluster boundary is a significant theoretical insight. This bridges clustering and semi-supervised learning, advancing the understanding of clustering mechanisms.
2. Novelty: The framework introduces a fresh perspective on clustering by treating it as a multi-class classification problem, which is both innovative and well-motivated.
3. Practical Relevance: The proposed Plug-In Exemplar Clustering (PIEC) algorithm demonstrates improved clustering accuracy and robustness compared to existing exemplar-based methods, as evidenced by experiments on real-world datasets.
4. Clarity of Theoretical Results: The derivation of generalization error bounds for both the plug-in and nearest neighbor classifiers is rigorous and well-supported by kernel density estimation theory.
5. Experimental Validation: The empirical results on UCI datasets substantiate the claims of the paper, particularly the superior performance of PIEC in producing correct cluster numbers.
Weaknesses:
1. Complexity of Application: While the theoretical results are compelling, the practical implementation of the clustering algorithm appears complex, particularly the reliance on kernel density estimators and pairwise Markov Random Fields. This may limit its accessibility to practitioners.
2. Clarity Issues: Some parts of the paper, particularly the derivations of the generalization bounds, are dense and may be challenging for readers unfamiliar with kernel density estimation or VC theory. Simplifying these sections or providing more intuition could improve clarity.
3. Typographical Errors: Minor issues such as the double "the" in line 63 and the potential missing term \(\pi^{(i)}\) in Equation (6) detract from the overall polish of the manuscript. Additionally, kernel bandwidth \(h\) should be corrected to \(h_n\) in Lemma 2.
4. Limited Dataset Diversity: The experimental evaluation is restricted to three UCI datasets. A broader range of datasets, particularly high-dimensional or large-scale ones, would better demonstrate the scalability and generalizability of the proposed method.
Recommendation:
Overall, this paper makes a valuable contribution to the clustering literature by providing a novel theoretical framework and a practical algorithm with enhanced capabilities. The strengths outweigh the weaknesses, and the identified issues are relatively minor and addressable. I recommend acceptance, with the suggestion that the authors address the noted clarity and typographical issues in the final version.
