The paper addresses the problem of clustering in sparse networks, particularly under partial information and streaming settings, using the Stochastic Block Model (SBM) as a benchmark. It introduces novel algorithms for clustering with limited memory and sequential data access, supported by rigorous theoretical analysis. The authors provide information-theoretic lower bounds and asymptotic guarantees, demonstrating the optimality of their methods in specific parameter regimes. The work is notable for extending SBM clustering to atypical settings, such as streaming and memory-constrained environments, which are increasingly relevant in large-scale network analysis.
Strengths
The paper makes significant theoretical contributions by developing algorithms whose upper bounds match the derived lower bounds, ensuring optimality. Algorithms 3 and 4 are natural extensions of Algorithms 1 and 2, creating a cohesive framework that bridges partial information and streaming scenarios. The theoretical results are comprehensive, covering both necessary and sufficient conditions for accurate clustering under various constraints. The originality of the work lies in addressing streaming and memory-limited clustering, a relatively unexplored area in SBM literature. This makes the paper a valuable addition to the field, with potential implications for large-scale network applications.
Weaknesses
The paper's primary shortcoming is the lack of a simulation study to validate the practical feasibility of the proposed algorithms, especially Algorithms 3 and 4. These algorithms are sensitive to tuning parameters, and without empirical results, it is difficult to assess their robustness and applicability in real-world scenarios. Additionally, the distinction between Algorithms 3 (offline streaming) and 4 (online streaming) is not clearly articulated in Section 4, leading to potential confusion for readers. The writing quality is inconsistent, with key details scattered across sections, making the paper harder to follow. Furthermore, the abstract does not clearly state that the work is purely theoretical, which could mislead readers about the scope of the contributions.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Simulation Study: Incorporating empirical results would significantly enhance the paper's impact by demonstrating the practical utility of the algorithms and addressing concerns about parameter sensitivity.
2. Clarity in Presentation: Improve the organization of Section 4 to clearly differentiate between Algorithms 3 and 4. A comparative summary table could help clarify their differences and use cases.
3. Writing Quality: Streamline the narrative to improve readability and ensure that key points are not buried in technical details. A clearer abstract emphasizing the theoretical nature of the work is also recommended.
4. Supplementary Material: Address the missing performance guarantees on page 8 of the supplementary material to provide a complete theoretical foundation.
Overall Impression
The paper provides valuable theoretical insights into clustering under challenging constraints, making it a significant contribution to the field. However, the absence of practical validation limits its immediate applicability. While the theoretical rigor is commendable, the paper would benefit from clearer exposition and empirical support. Acceptance is recommended conditional on addressing the clarity issues and, ideally, including a simulation study. 
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Novel and rigorous theoretical contributions.
- Extends SBM clustering to streaming and memory-limited settings.
- Provides a foundation for future work in practical implementations.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Lack of empirical validation undermines practical relevance.
- Writing and organization issues hinder accessibility.
- Sensitivity to tuning parameters is unaddressed.
