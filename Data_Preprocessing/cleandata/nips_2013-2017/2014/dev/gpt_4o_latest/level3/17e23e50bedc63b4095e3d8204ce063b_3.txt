Review
This paper addresses a critical challenge in high-dimensional non-convex optimization: the proliferation of saddle points, which impede the progress of first-order methods like SGD and certain second-order methods like Newton's method. The authors argue that saddle points, rather than local minima, are the primary bottleneck in optimization, particularly in high-dimensional spaces. They propose the Saddle-Free Newton (SFN) method, a novel second-order optimization algorithm that leverages the absolute value of Hessian eigenvalues to escape saddle points effectively. Their method outperforms SGD and traditional Newton-based methods in experiments on neural networks, including deep feedforward and recurrent architectures.
The paper is technically sound and well-supported by both theoretical analysis and empirical results. The authors draw from statistical physics, random matrix theory, and neural network theory to provide a compelling argument for the prevalence of saddle points in high dimensions. They validate their claims with experiments on small-scale and large-scale neural networks, demonstrating that SFN achieves faster convergence and avoids saddle points more effectively than competing methods. The use of Krylov subspaces to approximate the Hessian in high-dimensional settings is a practical and scalable approach. However, the implementation complexity of SFN, particularly in large-scale problems, raises concerns, and the authors should clarify whether they plan to release code or detailed instructions.
The paper is clearly written and well-organized, with a logical progression from theoretical insights to algorithm design and experimental validation. However, some aspects could benefit from further clarification. For example, the definition of "k biggest eigenvectors" in the Krylov subspace approximation is ambiguous and should explicitly address how negative curvature is captured. Additionally, while the authors demonstrate SFN's superiority over SGD, it would be helpful to include standard metrics (e.g., perplexity) for comparison, particularly on benchmarks like PTB, to contextualize the results.
The originality of the paper is significant. The authors propose a novel generalization of trust-region methods and provide a new perspective on leveraging curvature information. While the idea of using the absolute value of Hessian eigenvalues has been heuristically suggested before, this work offers a theoretical justification and empirical validation, advancing the state of the art in optimization for neural networks.
The significance of the results is high. The SFN method has the potential to impact a wide range of applications in machine learning and beyond, given the ubiquity of non-convex optimization problems. The paper also opens new avenues for research, such as scaling SFN to even larger problems and further analyzing the statistical properties of high-dimensional error surfaces.
Strengths:
1. Addresses a fundamental problem in optimization with strong theoretical and empirical support.
2. Proposes a novel and well-justified algorithm (SFN) that outperforms existing methods.
3. Demonstrates improved optimization on both feedforward and recurrent neural networks.
4. Clear and well-structured presentation of ideas.
Weaknesses:
1. Ambiguity in the definition of "k biggest eigenvectors" and its role in capturing negative curvature.
2. Lack of standard metrics (e.g., perplexity) for comparison with tuned SGD on datasets like PTB.
3. Concerns about the complexity of implementation and scalability to very high-dimensional problems.
4. Limited discussion on the impact of regularization techniques (e.g., dropout) and network architectures (e.g., ReLU nets) on saddle points.
Recommendation:
I recommend acceptance of this paper, conditional on addressing the concerns about clarity, standard metrics, and implementation complexity. The paper makes a significant contribution to the field and provides a promising direction for future research in non-convex optimization.
