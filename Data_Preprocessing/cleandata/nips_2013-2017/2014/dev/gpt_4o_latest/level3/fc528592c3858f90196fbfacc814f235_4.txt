The paper introduces two algorithms for clustering under the stochastic block model (SBM) in scenarios with partial information or data streaming constraints. The first algorithm is an offline method requiring linear memory, while the second is an online streaming algorithm with sublinear memory requirements. The authors address the problem of clustering with partial information and propose a spectral algorithm that leverages indirect edges, which is then extended to the streaming setting. They claim asymptotically accurate clustering under specific conditions and highlight the memory efficiency of their methods.
Strengths:  
The paper tackles an important problem in the context of large-scale networks where memory and computational constraints are critical. The two-step approach—first addressing clustering with partial information and then extending it to the streaming model—is well-suited to the problem's structure. The trimming step in the spectral algorithm ensures that sampling does not overly concentrate quantities, which is a thoughtful design choice. The proposed online algorithm with sublinear memory is a novel contribution to the streaming and community detection literature, particularly for sparse graphs. The theoretical results are rigorous, and the authors provide clear conditions under which their algorithms achieve asymptotic accuracy.
Weaknesses:  
The paper relies on overly strong assumptions, such as non-overlapping clusters and column-by-column data revelation, which limit its applicability to realistic networks. These assumptions simplify the problem significantly and may not hold in practical scenarios, especially for extremely sparse or dense graphs. Furthermore, the problem setup assumes that intra- and inter-cluster edge densities vanish as the graph size grows, which is not representative of many real-world networks. The authors also overstate the novelty of their contributions, as the trimming step and spectral methods are similar to prior work by Feige, Montanari, and others. Additionally, the paper lacks empirical evaluation, which is critical for validating the practical utility of the proposed algorithms. Without experiments, the results remain theoretical and may not translate well to real-world datasets. The related work section is incomplete, as it overlooks relevant prior research on streaming graph partitioning and community detection.
Recommendation:  
While the paper offers some novel contributions, particularly in the streaming setting, its strong assumptions, lack of empirical validation, and overstated claims reduce its impact. To improve, the authors should moderate their claims, provide experimental results to demonstrate the algorithms' practical utility, and more thoroughly discuss related work. The paper is a valuable theoretical contribution but requires significant revisions to address its limitations and better position itself within the existing literature.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:  
Pro:  
- Novel streaming algorithm with sublinear memory requirements.  
- Rigorous theoretical analysis of clustering under memory constraints.
