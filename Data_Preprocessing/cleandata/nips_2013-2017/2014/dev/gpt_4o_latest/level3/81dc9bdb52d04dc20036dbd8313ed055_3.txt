The paper presents a novel algorithm for finding a chordal Markov network that maximizes a decomposable scoring function. The proposed algorithm leverages a recursive characterization of clique trees and employs a dynamic programming approach, achieving a time complexity of \(O(4^n)\) for \(n\) vertices. The authors demonstrate that their algorithm significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, such as the constraint satisfaction approach by Corander et al. (NIPS 2013) and the integer linear programming (ILP) approach by Bartlett and Cussens (UAI 2013). The experimental results are compelling, showing orders-of-magnitude improvements in runtime, particularly for larger problem instances.
Strengths:
1. Technical Soundness: The paper is technically rigorous, with a clear derivation of the dynamic programming algorithm and a detailed complexity analysis. The recursive characterization of clique trees is well-motivated and aligns naturally with the structure of decomposable scoring functions.
2. Clarity: The paper is well-written and well-organized. The authors provide sufficient background, detailed proofs, and clear explanations of their algorithm. The experimental setup is described comprehensively, making the results reproducible.
3. Originality: The recursive characterization of clique trees and its application to dynamic programming for chordal Markov networks is novel. The work builds on prior research but introduces a fundamentally different approach that advances the state of the art.
4. Significance: The results are highly significant. The algorithm's ability to solve instances with up to 18 vertices within hours (compared to days for prior methods) represents a substantial improvement. This advancement is likely to inspire further research and practical applications in structure learning for Markov networks.
Weaknesses:
1. Scalability: While the algorithm is efficient for moderate-sized instances, the \(O(4^n)\) complexity remains a limitation for very large networks. The authors partially address this by bounding the clique size, but scalability to real-world datasets with hundreds of variables remains an open challenge.
2. Comparison Scope: The experimental evaluation primarily focuses on synthetic datasets and a limited number of UCI benchmarks. A broader evaluation on more diverse real-world datasets would strengthen the claims of general applicability.
3. Practical Constraints: The algorithm assumes that local scores for subsets of variables can be efficiently computed, which may not always hold in practice, especially for high-dimensional data.
Pro Acceptance Arguments:
- The paper addresses a challenging and important problem in structure learning.
- It introduces a novel and well-justified algorithm that significantly outperforms existing methods.

In conclusion, the paper makes a strong scientific contribution to the field of structure learning in chordal Markov networks. Despite some limitations in scalability and evaluation breadth, the novelty, rigor, and significance of the work warrant its acceptance at the conference.
