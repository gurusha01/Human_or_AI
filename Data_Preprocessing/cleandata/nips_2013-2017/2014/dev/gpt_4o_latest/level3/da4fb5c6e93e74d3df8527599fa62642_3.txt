The paper presents a novel approach, Calibrated Multivariate Regression (CMR), for high-dimensional multivariate regression problems, addressing key limitations of existing methods. CMR introduces task-specific calibration by leveraging a penalized weighted least square formulation, which adjusts regularization based on noise levels across tasks. This innovation improves finite-sample performance and reduces sensitivity to tuning parameters. The authors also propose an efficient smoothed proximal gradient (SPG) algorithm with a worst-case iteration complexity of \(O(1/\epsilon)\), making the method computationally feasible. Theoretical results demonstrate that CMR achieves optimal convergence rates, and empirical studies on both simulated and real datasets validate its superiority over standard methods.
Strengths:
1. Technical Soundness: The CMR formulation is well-grounded in theory, with rigorous proofs of its statistical properties and convergence rates. The use of the SPG algorithm is computationally efficient and well-justified.
2. Novelty: The task-specific calibration and tuning insensitivity of CMR represent a significant advancement over traditional multivariate regression methods, such as Ordinary Multivariate Regression (OMR).
3. Empirical Validation: The paper includes extensive simulations and a real-world application to brain activity prediction, demonstrating that CMR consistently outperforms OMR and achieves results comparable to handcrafted models.
4. Clarity and Structure: The paper is clearly written and well-organized, with detailed technical appendices that enhance reproducibility. The inclusion of mathematical derivations and algorithmic details is commendable.
Weaknesses:
1. Comparison with Simpler Methods: While the paper compares CMR with OMR, it lacks a direct comparison with simpler baseline methods, such as running separate regressions for each response variable. Including such comparisons would provide a clearer benchmark for CMR's performance.
2. Terminology Clarification: The term "weighted least square program" (Line 129) may be a typographical error and should likely read "weighted least square problem." Clarifying this would improve precision.
3. Real-World Application Details: Although the brain activity prediction task is compelling, the details of this experiment are relegated to a technical report. Including more information in the main paper would strengthen its practical relevance.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:
Pro:
- The method is novel and addresses a significant problem in multivariate regression.
- Theoretical and empirical results are robust and demonstrate clear advantages over existing methods.
- The paper is well-written and technically rigorous.
Con:
- Lack of comparison with simpler baseline methods limits the scope of empirical evaluation.
- Some details of the real-world application are omitted, reducing the practical impact.
Recommendation:
I recommend acceptance of this paper, as it makes a strong scientific contribution to the field of multivariate regression, both theoretically and empirically. Addressing the noted weaknesses in a revision would further enhance its impact.
