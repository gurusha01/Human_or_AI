The paper addresses the problem of learning from noisy sensor networks by leveraging local communication among sensors and game-theoretic best-response dynamics to denoise the system. It demonstrates how this denoising process, combined with agnostic active learning algorithms, enables efficient learning from a small number of queries. The authors provide both theoretical guarantees and experimental validation, making a compelling case for their approach.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Significance: The paper introduces a novel framework that combines game-theoretic dynamics with active learning to address high-noise environments in sensor networks. This is a significant contribution to the field, as it extends active learning to a challenging setting that has been underexplored.
2. Technical Soundness: The theoretical analysis is rigorous, with clear proofs supporting the denoising power of best-response dynamics under synchronous and random-order asynchronous updates. The negative result for adversarial-order dynamics is a valuable addition, highlighting the limitations of the approach.
3. Experimental Validation: The synthetic experiments are well-designed and convincingly demonstrate the practical effectiveness of the proposed method. The comparison between pre- and post-denoising performance, as well as active versus passive learning, underscores the utility of the approach.
4. Clarity: The paper is well-written and organized, with a clear exposition of the problem, methodology, theoretical results, and experimental findings. The inclusion of supplementary material for detailed proofs and additional experiments is commendable.
Weaknesses:
1. Related Work: While the paper references relevant prior work, it does not adequately cite or relate its contributions to recent NIPS papers on active learning with noise, such as Golovin et al. (2010) and Bellala et al. (2010). Explicitly discussing how this work builds upon or differs from these studies would strengthen the paper.
2. Practical Limitations: The authors acknowledge that their approach struggles with "pockets of noise" and regions near the decision boundary. While this is a known challenge, further discussion or exploration of alternative dynamics to address these limitations would enhance the paper.
3. Scope of Experiments: The experiments are limited to synthetic data. While this is a reasonable starting point, demonstrating the method's applicability to real-world sensor networks would make the results more compelling.
Recommendation:
I recommend acceptance of this paper at NIPS. The theoretical results are novel and significant, and the experimental validation supports the claims made. However, the authors should address the omission of recent related work and consider expanding the discussion on practical limitations in the final version.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Novel theoretical contributions with rigorous analysis.
- Practical utility demonstrated through experiments.
- Clear writing and organization.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Insufficient citation of recent related work.
- Limited exploration of real-world applicability.
Overall, the paper makes a strong scientific contribution and is well-suited for publication at NIPS.
