This paper investigates the computational function of the locust olfactory system, proposing that Kenyon cells (KCs) reconstruct sparse odor vectors through antennal lobe (AL) dynamics. The authors introduce a dual formulation of the sparse recovery problem, leading to a biologically inspired reduced dual circuit where lateral neuron (LN)-projection neuron (PN) connections are updated using independent component analysis (ICA), and PN dynamics are guided by compressed-sensing optimization. The study offers a novel perspective on the locust olfactory system, with potential implications for understanding sensory processing across species.
Strengths
The paper exhibits strong theoretical rigor, with an elegant step-by-step mathematical development. The transition from maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference to dual circuit dynamics and ICA-based learning is particularly compelling. The reduced dual circuit aligns better with known biological constraints than the full dual circuit, and the authors provide a clear comparison of its performance against a simple feedforward circuit. The originality of the approach is noteworthy, as it combines compressed sensing, ICA, and biological plausibility in a novel framework. Additionally, the writing is generally clear and well-organized, making the complex ideas accessible to the reader.
Weaknesses
Despite its strengths, the paper has several limitations. The biological plausibility of the proposed model is not sufficiently explored. For instance, the transient dynamics of PNs and the locust's adaptation to odors are not adequately addressed or tested against experimental data. The motivation for focusing specifically on locusts is unclear, as the study does not convincingly justify why this species was chosen beyond parameter constraints. Furthermore, the lack of experimental validation weakens the significance of the claims, as the model's predictions remain untested. One figure (line 294) is incomplete, and some notations in Section 4 are confusing due to overloading of symbols like "x" and "A." These issues detract from the clarity and reproducibility of the work.
Significance and Impact
The study is highly original and addresses a challenging problem in sensory processing. If experimentally validated, the proposed framework could significantly advance our understanding of olfactory circuits and inspire new approaches in computational neuroscience. However, the lack of experimental comparisons limits its immediate impact.
Recommendation
Pros for acceptance: Rigorous mathematical framework, originality, and potential impact on neuroscience and AI.  
Cons for acceptance: Insufficient biological validation, unclear motivation for locust-specific focus, and minor clarity issues.  
Overall, the paper is a valuable contribution but would benefit from experimental validation and a stronger emphasis on biological plausibility. I recommend acceptance with revisions to address these concerns.
