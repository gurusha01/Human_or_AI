This paper presents an innovative model for analyzing brain states using multi-region LFP time-series, leveraging an infinite mixture of Gaussian Processes (GPs) and Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes (HDPs). The authors propose a novel framework that integrates time-dependency via an infinite Hidden Markov Model (iHMM) and employs a spectral mixture kernel to characterize the spectral content of LFP signals. The model is validated on both synthetic and real electrophysiological datasets, demonstrating its ability to infer brain states and spectral properties while addressing limitations of prior approaches. The work is original, combining advanced probabilistic modeling with neuroscience applications, and offers significant potential for advancing the understanding of brain states.
Strengths:  
The paper introduces a technically sophisticated and novel approach to brain state modeling, addressing key limitations of previous methods, such as their inability to capture time-dependencies or leverage raw data without preprocessing. The use of GPs with spectral mixture kernels is particularly innovative, providing interpretable spectral representations. The incorporation of split-merge variational inference for the iHMM and ITM models is a notable contribution, as these inference schemes have not been previously developed. The application to real-world neuroscience data is compelling, with results suggesting the discovery of previously unobserved brain states, which could have significant implications for neuroscience research. The paper is well-written and demonstrates a clear understanding of both the technical and domain-specific challenges.
Weaknesses:  
Several aspects of the paper require clarification or improvement. The separation of time-series into time-windows (Line 098) and the algorithm used for this process are not well-explained, which is critical as this step significantly impacts the results. The statement "each window is considered a single observation" (Line 100) is unclear and should be rephrased. Additionally, the distinction between brain connectivity and brain states (Line 41) is not explicitly clarified, which could lead to confusion for readers. The parameter "L" (Line 107) is not defined, and its selection process is not explained. The notation for \(\lambda_g^{(a)}\) (Line 113) should be introduced earlier for better readability. Importantly, the joint distribution induced by the model is not well-defined or semi-definite positive (Line 183), raising concerns about the validity of the infinite mixture of GPs. Furthermore, the inability of GPs to capture sparsity patterns in brain connectivity (Section 2.2) is not adequately acknowledged. Section 2.3, which introduces tensor characterization, appears unnecessarily complex and may not contribute significantly to the overall model. Finally, the clustering mechanisms and the significance of the "network" in the context of existing literature (Line 418) are weakly explained, and repeated statements (Line 414) detract from the paper's clarity.
Pro vs. Con Arguments for Acceptance:  
Pro: The paper is highly original, technically sound, and addresses an important problem in neuroscience. It introduces novel methodologies and demonstrates their applicability to real-world data, with promising results that could inspire further research.  
Con: The paper has several areas requiring clarification, particularly regarding the validity of the model, the interpretation of results, and the acknowledgment of limitations. Some sections (e.g., 2.3) appear overly complex without clear justification.  
Conclusion:  
While the paper is a strong contribution in terms of originality and potential impact, it requires significant revisions to address clarity, technical validity, and interpretation of results. I recommend acceptance contingent on major revisions.
