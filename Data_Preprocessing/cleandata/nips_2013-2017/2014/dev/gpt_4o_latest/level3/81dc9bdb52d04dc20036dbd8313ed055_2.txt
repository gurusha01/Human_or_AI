The paper introduces a dynamic programming algorithm for finding the optimal chordal Markov network for a decomposable scoring function, presenting a novel approach to a challenging problem in structure learning. The authors cleverly reformulate the problem by leveraging recursive factorization, enabling the development of an efficient dynamic programming algorithm. This reformulation is a significant contribution, as it aligns with the structure of common scoring functions and allows for a more systematic exploration of the solution space.
The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is significantly faster than GOBNILP, particularly for larger instances. For example, the authors report that their algorithm solves an eight-vertex instance in milliseconds, compared to days required by Corander et al.'s constraint satisfaction approach. This speed improvement is a notable advancement in the field and highlights the practical utility of the proposed method for exact structure learning of chordal Markov networks. However, the paper also acknowledges the exponential complexity of the algorithm with respect to the number of vertices, which limits its scalability to very large networks. This trade-off between exactness and scalability is well-documented but remains a limitation of the approach.
Despite its strengths, the paper has several weaknesses. The proofs presented are difficult to follow and could benefit from better organization and clarity. This issue may hinder accessibility for readers unfamiliar with the technical details of recursive partition trees and junction trees. Additionally, Figure 2 lacks labeled axes, which detracts from the clarity of the experimental results. Another concern is the lack of a direct comparison of the proposed method's speed with Corander et al.'s constraint satisfaction approach, which would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of its relative performance.
In terms of originality, the recursive characterization of clique trees and its application to dynamic programming is novel and well-motivated. The paper also situates its contributions within the broader context of related work, referencing recent advances in Bayesian network structure learning and constraint programming.
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field by advancing the state of the art in exact structure learning for chordal Markov networks. However, its limitations in scalability, clarity of presentation, and incomplete comparisons should be addressed to strengthen its impact. Arguments for acceptance include the novelty of the approach, substantial speed improvements, and relevance to the community. Arguments against acceptance include scalability concerns, unclear proofs, and incomplete experimental comparisons.
