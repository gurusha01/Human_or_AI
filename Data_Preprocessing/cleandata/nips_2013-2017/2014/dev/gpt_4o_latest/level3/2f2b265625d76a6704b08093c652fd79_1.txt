The paper presents a novel mechanism for anticipative tracking in neural systems, leveraging spike-frequency adaptation (SFA) within continuous attractor neural networks (CANNs). The core contribution lies in demonstrating that SFA can induce self-sustained traveling waves in CANNs, enabling anticipative tracking without requiring hard-wired asymmetric connections. This approach provides a biologically plausible alternative to previously proposed mechanisms, such as asymmetric coupling, and offers flexibility in compensating for neural delays.
The paper is well-written and provides a clear theoretical analysis of the simplified model, complemented by simulations of the complete model. The results convincingly show that SFA-induced traveling waves can achieve both perfect tracking (zero-lag) and anticipative tracking (constant leading time) under specific conditions. The authors also highlight the broader implications of their findings, suggesting that other negative feedback mechanisms, such as short-term synaptic depression or network-level feedback, could similarly enable anticipative tracking.
However, there are several areas where the paper could be improved. First, while the authors emphasize the novelty of their approach, the connection to prior work (e.g., [12]) raises concerns about the originality of the findings. Continuous attractor networks with SFA have previously been shown to exhibit traveling waves, and the paper does not sufficiently delineate its unique contributions beyond linking this phenomenon to tracking performance. A more explicit comparison with prior studies, particularly in the introduction, would help clarify the novelty.
Second, the realism of the model parameters warrants further discussion. For instance, the large difference in time constants (\(\tau\) and \(\tau_v\)) should be justified in the context of biological plausibility. Additionally, while the theoretical and simulation results are compelling, experimental validation or a comparison with empirical data would significantly strengthen the paper's impact and relevance.
Finally, the manuscript contains minor grammatical and formatting issues that should be addressed for clarity. For example, some equations and figures could benefit from more detailed annotations to enhance readability.
Strengths:
1. Proposes a biologically plausible mechanism for anticipative tracking using SFA.
2. Demonstrates theoretical and simulation-based evidence for traveling waves and tracking performance.
3. Highlights the flexibility of SFA in compensating for neural delays across different time scales.
Weaknesses:
1. Insufficient clarity on the novelty of contributions relative to prior work.
2. Limited discussion on the biological realism of model parameters.
3. Lack of experimental validation or comparison with empirical data.
4. Minor grammatical and formatting issues.
Recommendation:
While the paper provides an interesting and potentially impactful contribution, the concerns about novelty and parameter realism, as well as the absence of experimental validation, must be addressed. I recommend acceptance conditional on revisions that clarify the unique contributions, justify the parameter choices, and improve the manuscript's overall clarity.
