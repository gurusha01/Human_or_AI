The paper presents a spectral inference method for the Indian Buffet Process (IBP), leveraging tensor decomposition and the method-of-moments framework. This approach addresses the computational inefficiencies of traditional sampling-based and variational inference methods, offering a faster and theoretically grounded alternative. The authors' main contributions include a detailed moment analysis for IBP, computational and sample complexity analysis, and experimental validation on synthetic and real-world tasks such as image recovery and gene expression data. The work also promotes an intriguing perspective of treating nonparametric Bayesian models as "effectively parametric," enabling parameter estimation techniques to be applied to inference.
Strengths
1. Efficiency and Scalability: The proposed spectral algorithm is computationally efficient, as demonstrated by its faster runtime compared to variational methods. This makes it a practical alternative for large-scale applications.
2. Theoretical Rigor: The paper provides a robust theoretical foundation, including moment derivations up to the fourth order, concentration of measure bounds, and reconstruction guarantees. These results are well-supported by standard techniques and slightly improve upon prior work.
3. Empirical Validation: The experiments on synthetic data, image recovery, and gene expression tasks convincingly demonstrate the method's accuracy and runtime advantages. The comparison with variational and MCMC methods highlights its practical utility.
4. Novel Perspective: The framing of nonparametric models as "effectively parametric" is conceptually interesting and could inspire further research in spectral methods for Bayesian nonparametrics.
Weaknesses
1. Limited Algorithmic Novelty: While the paper adapts tensor power methods and random projections for IBP, much of the methodology builds on prior work. The novelty lies more in the application to IBP rather than in the development of fundamentally new algorithms.
2. Clarity Issues: Some notations and terminologies are unclear, particularly in the derivation of moments and the description of the robust tensor power method. The paper would benefit from additional explanations and examples to improve accessibility.
3. Missed Components in Moments: The authors acknowledge that third and fourth-order moments may miss some components individually, which could limit the robustness of the method in certain scenarios.
4. Experimental Scope: While the experiments are compelling, they are somewhat limited in scope. The paper could explore more diverse datasets or real-world applications to better demonstrate the method's generalizability.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance

Recommendation
Overall, the paper is a solid contribution to the field of spectral methods and nonparametric Bayesian inference. While the algorithmic novelty is limited, the efficiency, theoretical rigor, and practical validation make it a valuable addition to the literature. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions, focusing on improving clarity and addressing the limitations of the experimental scope.
