The paper introduces the Multi-View Perceptron (MVP), a novel deep neural network that disentangles identity and view representations in face images while generating a full spectrum of multi-view outputs. Inspired by the primate brain's face-processing network, MVP employs deterministic neurons for identity features and stochastic neurons for view representation. The authors demonstrate the model's ability to reconstruct faces under unseen viewpoints, interpolate views, and improve face recognition performance on the challenging MultiPIE dataset.
Strengths:
1. Technical Soundness: The paper is technically robust, with a well-defined probabilistic framework and a clear derivation of the learning procedure. The use of deterministic and stochastic neurons is a novel approach that aligns with biological insights, and the experiments effectively validate the proposed methodology.
2. Clarity: The writing is clear and well-organized, with sufficient details for reproducibility. The architecture and training procedure are explained comprehensively, and the figures (e.g., Fig. 2) aid understanding.
3. Originality: The paper presents a novel combination of deterministic and stochastic units for disentangling identity and view representations, which is distinct from prior work. The ability to interpolate and predict unseen views is particularly innovative.
4. Significance: The results are significant, as MVP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in face recognition across views and illuminations. The ability to model continuous viewpoints and generate unseen views is a meaningful contribution to pose representation learning and generative modeling.
Weaknesses:
1. Comparison with Related Work: While the paper references prior work, the distinction between MVP and [25] is not sufficiently discussed. Specifically, the difference in using feedforward prediction instead of Bayes rule (via the addition of \(v\), predicted by \(y\) and \(h_3\)) should be elaborated to clarify the novelty.
2. Experiments: The paper would benefit from a direct comparison with the state-of-the-art Siamese CNN approach from [24] to strengthen its claims of superiority.
3. Figures: It is unclear whether the images in Figures 1 and 6 are from the training or test set. Clarifying this would help assess the generalization ability of MVP.
4. Minor Writing Issues: The use of "instinct" in the abstract is slightly misleading. Replacing it with "intuition" or "insight" would improve clarity.
Suggestions for Improvement:
- Elaborate on the differences between MVP and [25], particularly the role of \(v\) in enabling feedforward prediction.
- Include a comparison with the Siamese CNN approach from [24] to provide a more comprehensive evaluation.
- Clarify the source of images in Figures 1 and 6 (training or test set).
- Replace "instinct" with "intuition" or "insight" in the abstract for better readability.
Recommendation:
This paper addresses an important problem in face recognition and proposes a biologically inspired, technically sound, and innovative solution. While there are minor issues regarding comparisons and clarity, these do not detract significantly from the paper's contributions. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the aforementioned points.
