The paper presents an ambitious attempt to model the locust olfactory system using sparse optimization techniques, drawing inspiration from the sparse representation of odorants by Kenyon cells (KCs). The authors propose a Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) inference framework for decoding olfactory signals, reformulating it as a compressive sensing problem to align with biological plausibility. While the paper is original in its effort to bridge optimization methods with insect neural circuits, it suffers from significant conceptual and methodological shortcomings.
Strengths:
1. Originality: The paper tackles an underexplored intersection of sparse optimization and biological neural circuits, offering a novel perspective on the locust olfactory system.
2. Biological Relevance: The authors attempt to map mathematical components to biological structures, providing testable predictions about circuit connectivity.
3. Reduced Dual Circuit: The reduced dual formulation is an interesting step toward reconciling computational models with biological constraints, such as the absence of feedback from KCs to projection neurons (PNs).
4. Learning via ICA: The inclusion of Independent Component Analysis (ICA) for adapting to environmental changes is a promising idea, though underdeveloped.
Weaknesses:
1. Biological Mapping: The mapping of mathematical components to biological structures is tenuous and poorly justified. For example, the use of Lagrange multipliers to model PNs is unintuitive and biologically implausible, requiring further explanation.
2. PN Modeling Issues: The gradient descent formulation for PNs raises concerns about negative outputs, which are inconsistent with biological firing rates. This issue is not adequately addressed.
3. B Matrix Ambiguity: The replacement of the A matrix with the B matrix in the reduced dual circuit is unclear. The equivalence of solutions and the mismatch in PN-LN ratios are not convincingly demonstrated.
4. Learning Procedure: The ICA-based learning of the B matrix is poorly justified and lacks sufficient simulations to validate its effectiveness. The convergence issues and reliance on specific parameter tuning further weaken the approach.
5. Connectivity Debate: The claim of structured PN-KC connectivity conflicts with recent findings suggesting random connectivity in Drosophila. The authors' argument for animal-specific permutations is speculative and unconvincing.
6. Clarity and Writing: The paper is poorly written, with numerous typographical errors and a lack of clear organization. The main message is difficult to discern, and the technical details are often overwhelming.
7. Mathematical Rigor: The assumption of strong duality in a non-convex problem is questionable, and the theoretical underpinnings of the reduced dual circuit are inadequately explored.
8. Noise Sensitivity: The model's sensitivity to noise, particularly in the reduced dual circuit, is a critical flaw that undermines its biological plausibility.
Overall Assessment:
While the paper is commendable for its originality, it falls short in terms of both mathematical rigor and biological plausibility. The mapping between the optimization solution and the neural circuit is inadequately demonstrated, and the proposed methods lack robust justification and empirical validation. The clarity of the writing further detracts from the paper's impact. 
Recommendation:
I recommend rejection at this stage. However, with significant revisions addressing the biological mapping, mathematical formulation, and clarity, the work could potentially make a valuable contribution to the field.
