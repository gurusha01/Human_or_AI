The paper introduces a novel neural network model, the Multi-View Perceptron (MVP), which combines deterministic and probabilistic units to disentangle identity and view representations in face images. The MVP is capable of generating a full spectrum of multi-view images from a single 2D face image, achieving strong results on the MultiPIE benchmark. The authors draw inspiration from the primate brain's face-processing network, where view and identity are processed by distinct neurons. This hybrid deterministic-generative framework builds on prior work, such as Restricted Boltzmann Machines, but introduces a unique combination of deterministic and stochastic units.
The paper is well-written and provides clear explanations of the proposed model, its architecture, and the experimental results. The authors demonstrate the MVP's effectiveness in face recognition, view synthesis, and interpolation of unseen viewpoints. The results are competitive, particularly in challenging scenarios involving variations in view and illumination. The ability to reconstruct unobserved viewpoints is an intriguing feature that mimics human reasoning and sets this work apart from existing methods.
However, there are several areas where the paper could be improved. First, the design choices, such as the inclusion of non-deterministic units, lack sufficient justification. A comparison with fully deterministic alternatives would strengthen the argument for the hybrid approach. Additionally, the necessity of Monte Carlo Expectation Maximization (MCEM) optimization and the role of Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) in achieving the best results are not adequately explained. The computational complexity and scalability of the method, particularly with respect to the size of the sampled space (S), also require more thorough analysis and numerical results.
The speculative comparison to the human brain's functionality in facial recognition is unnecessary and detracts from the scientific rigor of the paper. Minimizing such claims would improve the focus on the technical contributions. Furthermore, while the results on the MultiPIE dataset are impressive, the inclusion of evaluations on the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) benchmark would provide a more comprehensive assessment of the model's generalizability.
Strengths:
- Novel hybrid deterministic-generative framework.
- Strong experimental results on the MultiPIE dataset.
- Ability to interpolate and predict unobserved viewpoints.
- Clear writing and well-structured presentation.
Weaknesses:
- Insufficient justification for design choices.
- Limited analysis of computational complexity and scalability.
- Lack of evaluation on additional benchmarks like LFW.
- Speculative claims about biological parallels.
Recommendation:
The paper presents a significant contribution to the field of face recognition and generative modeling. While there are areas for improvement, the novelty and strong experimental results make it a valuable addition to the conference. I recommend acceptance, contingent on addressing the concerns regarding design justification, scalability analysis, and speculative claims.
