This paper presents a novel clustering framework that bridges clustering and multi-class classification by leveraging pairwise similarity functions and nonparametric classifiers. The authors propose minimizing the generalization error of classifiers tied to data partitions to achieve optimal clustering. Two nonparametric classifiers, the plug-in and nearest-neighbor classifiers, are analyzed, with theoretical results linking the generalization error of the plug-in classifier to the weighted volume of cluster boundaries under the Low Density Separation criterion. The paper also introduces a new exemplar-based clustering method, Plug-In Exemplar Clustering (PIEC), which is claimed to outperform existing methods in certain scenarios.
Strengths:
1. Theoretical Contribution: The paper provides a strong theoretical foundation connecting clustering and multi-class classification. The derivation of generalization error bounds for nonparametric classifiers and their connection to Low Density Separation is a significant contribution.
2. Novelty: The proposed framework is innovative, offering a new perspective on clustering by incorporating nonparametric classification techniques.
3. Potential Impact: The connection between generalization error bounds and pairwise similarity functions could inspire further research and practical applications in clustering and classification.
4. Algorithmic Development: The introduction of PIEC demonstrates the practical utility of the theoretical framework, albeit with limited experimental validation.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity and Organization: The paper is poorly written, with technical details overshadowing clarity. Sections 2 and 3 are particularly dense and require substantial rewriting to improve readability. Lemma statements and proofs are overly technical, lack intuition, and are grammatically flawed.
2. Experimental Validation: The experimental section is minimal and fails to provide a robust evaluation of the proposed method. There is no comparison with state-of-the-art clustering methods beyond exemplar-based approaches, and the analysis is limited to three small datasets.
3. Practical Applicability: The lack of source code and extension to other classifiers limits the practical impact of the work. Additionally, the paper does not address computational complexity or algorithm performance under varying data settings, which are critical for real-world applications.
4. Incomplete Related Work: While the paper references relevant literature, it does not adequately compare its contributions to recent advances in clustering and classification, particularly from recent NIPS proceedings.
Recommendations:
- Clarity Improvements: Rewrite Sections 2 and 3 to improve organization and accessibility. Provide intuitive explanations for theoretical results and simplify lemma statements.
- Experimental Expansion: Conduct a more comprehensive experimental evaluation, including comparisons with state-of-the-art clustering methods on diverse datasets and an analysis of computational complexity.
- Practical Enhancements: Release source code and explore the extension of the framework to other classifiers to enhance usability and impact.
- Contextualization: Strengthen the discussion of related work to better contextualize the contributions within the broader literature.
Pro/Con Arguments for Acceptance:
Pros:
- Strong theoretical contributions with novel insights into clustering and classification.
- Innovative framework with potential for significant impact in clustering research.
Cons:
- Poor writing and organization hinder comprehension.
- Incomplete experimental validation and lack of practical applicability reduce the paper's immediate utility.
Recommendation: Weak Reject  
While the paper is innovative and theoretically sound, its poor presentation, limited experimental validation, and lack of practical applicability make it unsuitable for acceptance in its current form. Substantial revisions are needed to improve clarity, expand experiments, and address practical concerns.
