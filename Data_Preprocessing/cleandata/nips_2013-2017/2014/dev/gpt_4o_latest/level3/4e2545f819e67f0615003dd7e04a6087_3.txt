The paper presents a novel theoretical model for neural population dynamics, leveraging a noise-driven linear dynamical system to implement Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) sampling. The authors propose a spatio-temporal coding scheme that represents multidimensional real-valued probability distributions through distributed MCMC sampling, encoded in the spiking activity of neurons. The model is positioned as a hybrid approach, combining the computational advantages of spatial and temporal probabilistic codes. Simulations demonstrate the model's ability to reproduce neural population statistics, including variability and covariability, in toy examples. The authors also explore the implications of their model for interpreting neural variability and decoding population-level representations of uncertainty.
The paper is technically sound and well-written, with a clear exposition of the mathematical framework and simulation results. The proposed model builds on prior work, particularly Boerlin et al. (2011), and extends it by introducing distributed sampling dynamics that separate computation from representation. This separation allows for faster sampling and robustness to neural damage, which are significant contributions to the field. The results align with experimental observations, such as Poisson-like variability, stimulus-dependent synchrony, and spike-count correlations, reinforcing the biological plausibility of the model. Furthermore, the authors highlight the importance of population-level decoding for understanding probabilistic neural computation, offering a potential tool for analyzing multiunit neural data.
However, the paper has notable limitations. First, while the simulations are compelling, they are restricted to toy examples, limiting the model's applicability to real-world neural systems. The absence of real neural data weakens the paper's relevance and its ability to validate the proposed framework experimentally. Second, methodological details, such as modifications to Boerlin et al. (2011) and simulation parameters, are insufficiently described, making it challenging for readers to reproduce the results. Finally, while the model is related to statistical modeling literature, the authors do not adequately situate their work within the broader context of recent advances in neural sampling and probabilistic coding.
Strengths:
1. Innovative combination of spatial and temporal coding schemes.
2. Biological plausibility demonstrated through alignment with experimental data.
3. Clear theoretical contributions with potential implications for multiunit data analysis.
Weaknesses:
1. Reliance on toy examples limits generalizability to real neural systems.
2. Lack of real neural data to validate the model.
3. Insufficient methodological clarity in some areas.
Recommendation:
The paper presents a promising theoretical contribution to the field of neural coding and probabilistic computation. However, its reliance on toy examples and lack of real data reduce its immediate impact. I recommend acceptance with revisions to improve methodological clarity and encourage the authors to incorporate real neural data in future work.
