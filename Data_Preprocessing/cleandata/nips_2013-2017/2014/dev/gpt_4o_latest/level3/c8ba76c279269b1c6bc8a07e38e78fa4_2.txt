The paper presents a computational model of the locust olfactory system, proposing that it performs sparse signal recovery using a dual formulation of a compressed sensing problem. The authors argue that the system adapts to its olfactory environment through independent component analysis (ICA)-like plasticity, enabling efficient and biologically plausible sparse recovery. The model is grounded in the anatomy and dynamics of the locust olfactory circuit, with a focus on projection neurons (PNs), local interneurons (LNs), and Kenyon cells (KCs). The authors also discuss the challenges of mapping biological constraints to computational models and provide predictions for future experimental validation.
Strengths
The paper addresses an important and biologically relevant problem, offering a novel combination of compressed sensing, ICA, and neural circuit modeling. The dual formulation provides a biologically plausible alternative to traditional MAP inference, and the reduced dual circuit aligns better with known locust anatomy. The inclusion of ICA for learning adds depth to the model, and the predictions about connectivity and dynamics are testable, making the work potentially impactful for both computational neuroscience and experimental biology. The analysis of noise sensitivity and learning-readout integration demonstrates a thoughtful consideration of practical challenges.
Weaknesses
1. Physiological Mapping: The mapping of firing rates to variables \( y \) and \( \lambda \) requires clarification, particularly given \( \lambda \)'s unbounded nature. This ambiguity affects the biological interpretability of the model.
2. Symmetry and Connectivity: The requirement for "negative reciprocal" connectivity between PNs and LNs (via \( B \) and \( B^T \)) and symmetry in sparse vector \( x \) and KC projections lacks sufficient anatomical or physiological evidence. The authors should assess whether the model can function without these assumptions.
3. Biological Validation: While the model is inspired by locust olfactory anatomy, stronger evidence linking the model to biological data is needed. Comparisons between model simulations and experimental results (e.g., neuron responses, ICA dynamics, or odor discrimination performance) would significantly enhance the paper's credibility.
4. Biological Circuit Mapping: The explanation of how the biological circuit maps to the model is unclear, particularly regarding the role of odorant receptors (ORs) in binding molecules and where mixing occurs.
5. Unused Models: Sections discussing unused models could be condensed to provide more space for detailed biological mapping and validation.
Suggestions for Improvement
- Provide a clearer explanation of how physiological measures (e.g., firing rates) map to model variables and address the implications of \( \lambda \)'s unbounded nature.
- Justify the assumptions of symmetry and reciprocal connectivity with anatomical evidence or explore alternative formulations that do not rely on these assumptions.
- Strengthen the connection between the model and biological data by including comparisons with experimental results, such as neuron activity patterns or odor discrimination performance.
- Condense discussions of unused models to focus on the biological plausibility and validation of the proposed model.
- Emphasize the originality of combining compressed sensing, ICA, and neural circuit modeling while addressing the need for stronger physiological validation.
Recommendation
The paper presents a novel and promising approach to understanding the locust olfactory system, but it requires significant improvements in biological validation and clarity. With revisions addressing the above weaknesses, the work could make a valuable contribution to the field.
