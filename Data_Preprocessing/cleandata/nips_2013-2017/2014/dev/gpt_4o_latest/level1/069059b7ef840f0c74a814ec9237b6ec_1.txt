This paper proposes a novel pairwise clustering framework that bridges clustering and multi-class classification by leveraging unsupervised nonparametric classifiers. The authors derive pairwise similarity measures based on the generalization error bounds of two classifiers: the nearest neighbor (NN) and the plug-in classifier. These measures are shown to align with kernel similarity under uniform data distribution, providing a theoretical explanation for the widespread use of kernel similarity in clustering. The paper also introduces a new exemplar-based clustering method, Plug-In Exemplar Clustering (PIEC), which demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods on several datasets. The authors further establish a connection between the generalization error bound of the plug-in classifier and the weighted volume of cluster boundaries, a key criterion for Low Density Separation.
Strengths
1. Theoretical Contribution: The paper provides a rigorous theoretical foundation for deriving pairwise similarity measures from generalization error bounds. This is a significant contribution to the clustering literature, as it offers a principled explanation for kernel similarity.
2. Novelty: The proposed framework is innovative in its approach to unify clustering and classification, and the use of unsupervised nonparametric classifiers is a fresh perspective.
3. Connection to Low Density Separation: The proof that the generalization error bound for the plug-in classifier asymptotically equals the weighted volume of cluster boundaries is a compelling result that ties the work to established clustering principles.
4. Practical Application: The PIEC algorithm demonstrates improved clustering accuracy and robustness compared to existing exemplar-based methods, as evidenced by experimental results on real-world datasets.
5. Clarity of Theoretical Analysis: The derivation of generalization bounds and their connection to pairwise similarity is detailed and mathematically sound.
Weaknesses
1. Clarity of Presentation: While the theoretical analysis is thorough, the paper is dense and challenging to follow, particularly for readers unfamiliar with kernel density estimation or generalization bounds. Simplifying some sections or providing more intuitive explanations would improve accessibility.
2. Experimental Evaluation: The experimental results, though promising, are limited to three datasets. A broader evaluation on more diverse datasets, including high-dimensional and large-scale data, would strengthen the empirical claims.
3. Computational Complexity: The computational complexity of the PIEC algorithm is discussed, but no comparison is provided with other methods in terms of runtime or scalability. This omission leaves questions about its practicality for large datasets.
4. Parameter Sensitivity: The performance of PIEC depends on parameters such as the kernel bandwidth and balancing parameter. While the authors explore a range of values, a more systematic analysis of parameter sensitivity would be helpful.
