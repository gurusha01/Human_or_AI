This paper introduces a novel family of second-order optimization algorithms for high-dimensional statistical estimators with superposition-structured regularization, addressing a critical gap in the literature dominated by first-order methods like proximal gradient descent and ADMM. The authors propose a proximal Newton framework that leverages quadratic approximations of the loss function and incorporates an active subspace selection approach to reduce computational complexity. Theoretical contributions include convergence guarantees for the proposed algorithm, even in the challenging setting of non-positive-definite Hessians and varying subspaces. Empirical results demonstrate that the method is over 10 times faster than state-of-the-art first-order methods on tasks such as latent variable Gaussian graphical model selection and multi-task learning.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Originality: The paper makes a significant contribution by extending proximal Newton methods to handle multiple regularizers in superposition-structured models, a problem that has not been addressed in prior work. The active subspace selection framework is a particularly innovative addition.
2. Theoretical Rigor: The authors provide strong theoretical guarantees, including global convergence and asymptotic quadratic convergence rates, which are non-trivial given the complexity of the problem.
3. Empirical Validation: The proposed method is convincingly validated on real-world applications, including Gaussian Markov random fields and multi-task learning. The results clearly demonstrate the algorithm's efficiency and scalability.
4. Clarity of Presentation: The paper is well-organized, with a logical flow from problem formulation to algorithm design, theoretical analysis, and experimental results. The inclusion of detailed examples (e.g., decomposable norms) aids understanding.
5. Broader Impact: The proposed framework has the potential to advance the state of the art in high-dimensional optimization, with applications in machine learning, statistics, and computational biology.
Weaknesses:
1. Complexity of Notation: While the paper is well-written overall, the notation is dense and may be challenging for readers unfamiliar with proximal Newton methods or decomposable norms. A more accessible exposition in some sections could broaden the paper's impact.
2. Limited Comparison: Although the paper compares its method to state-of-the-art first-order approaches, it does not benchmark against other second-order methods (if applicable) or hybrid approaches. This omission leaves open questions about the relative advantages of the proposed method.
3. Scalability to Extremely Large Datasets: While the method is shown to scale well to moderately large datasets, the scalability to extremely large datasets (e.g., with millions of features) is not fully explored. This could be a limitation in practical applications.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper addresses a timely and important problem in high-dimensional optimization.
- The proposed method is both theoretically sound and empirically effective, with significant speedups over existing methods.
- The contributions are novel and advance the state of the art in a meaningful way.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The paper's dense notation and technical depth may limit accessibility to a broader audience.
- The lack of comparison to other second-order methods leaves some gaps in the evaluation.
Recommendation:
I recommend acceptance of this paper. Its contributions are substantial, and it is likely to stimulate further research in optimization for structured high-dimensional models. However, the authors are encouraged to simplify the presentation where possible and expand comparisons in future work.
