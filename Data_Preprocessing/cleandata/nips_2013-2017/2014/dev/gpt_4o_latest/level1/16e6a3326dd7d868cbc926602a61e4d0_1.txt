The paper addresses the problem of learning a target function in engineered systems with highly noisy, low-power distributed sensors by leveraging local communication and game-theoretic dynamics for denoising. The authors propose a novel approach where sensors engage in local consensus games to reduce noise, followed by the application of agnostic active learning algorithms to efficiently learn the target function with a small number of queries. The paper combines theoretical guarantees on the denoising power of the proposed dynamics with experimental results, demonstrating significant improvements over traditional active and passive learning methods, both with and without denoising.
The work builds on prior research in active learning, particularly in low-noise settings (e.g., [1, 5, 9]), and consensus games (e.g., [6, 8, 14]). However, it extends these areas by addressing the high-noise, multi-agent setting and focusing on achieving a specific desired configuration rather than equilibria of low social cost. The authors also integrate recent advances in agnostic active learning [1], showcasing the synergy between denoising dynamics and efficient learning.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Originality: The paper introduces a new setting for active learning with noisy, distributed agents and demonstrates how game-theoretic dynamics can effectively denoise such systems. This is a significant departure from prior work focused on single-agent, low-noise scenarios.
2. Theoretical Contributions: The authors provide rigorous theoretical guarantees for the denoising power of their dynamics under both synchronous and random-order asynchronous updates. The negative result for adversarial-order updates is a valuable insight, highlighting the limitations of the approach.
3. Experimental Validation: The experiments on synthetic data convincingly demonstrate the practical utility of the proposed method, showing substantial improvements in generalization error and query efficiency compared to baseline methods.
4. Clarity and Organization: The paper is well-structured, with clear explanations of the problem setup, theoretical results, and experimental methodology.
Weaknesses:
1. Scope of Experiments: While the experiments are thorough, they are limited to synthetic data. Real-world validation on sensor networks or other engineered systems would strengthen the practical relevance of the work.
2. Boundary Region Performance: The authors acknowledge that their method struggles near the decision boundary, and while they propose alternative dynamics in supplementary material, these are less practical. Addressing this limitation in the main text would improve the paper.
3. Assumptions: The theoretical analysis relies on assumptions such as uniform sensor distribution and linear decision boundaries, which may not hold in all real-world scenarios. The impact of deviations from these assumptions is not thoroughly explored.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper addresses a challenging and underexplored problem with significant theoretical and practical implications.
- The combination of game-theoretic dynamics and active learning is innovative and well-supported by both theory and experiments.
- The results demonstrate clear improvements over existing methods, making the work a valuable contribution to the field.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The lack of real-world experiments limits the demonstrated applicability of the approach.
- The method's performance near decision boundaries and under non-uniform sensor distributions remains an open question.
Recommendation:
I recommend acceptance of this paper, as it makes a strong theoretical and experimental contribution to the field of active learning and distributed systems. Addressing the noted weaknesses in future work would further enhance its impact.
