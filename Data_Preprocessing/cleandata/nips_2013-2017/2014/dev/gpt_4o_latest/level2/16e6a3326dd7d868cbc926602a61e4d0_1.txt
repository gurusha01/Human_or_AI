Review of the Paper
This paper addresses the challenging problem of learning a target function from highly noisy measurements in a distributed sensor network. The authors propose a novel approach that combines local communication among sensors, modeled as a consensus game with best-response dynamics, to denoise the system. This denoising step is then integrated with agnostic active learning algorithms to achieve efficient learning with a small number of queries. The paper provides both theoretical guarantees and experimental validation, demonstrating significant improvements over existing active and passive learning methods.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Significance: The paper introduces a new setting for active learning in distributed systems with high noise, which has practical relevance for engineered systems like sensor networks. The combination of game-theoretic dynamics for denoising with active learning is innovative and addresses a critical gap in the literature.
2. Theoretical Rigor: The authors provide strong theoretical guarantees for their approach, including proofs of denoising effectiveness under synchronous and random-order asynchronous updates. The results are well-supported by concentration bounds and probabilistic arguments.
3. Experimental Validation: The experiments on synthetic data convincingly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that the denoising step significantly reduces noise and improves the performance of active learning algorithms, especially in low-label-budget scenarios.
4. Clarity of Motivation: The authors clearly articulate the limitations of existing active learning methods in high-noise settings and justify the need for their proposed approach. The discussion of related work is thorough and situates the contribution within the broader literature.
Weaknesses:
1. Limited Practicality of Dynamics: While the proposed best-response dynamics are simple and effective, the paper acknowledges that they are not robust to adversarial update orders. Although an alternative robust dynamics is mentioned in the supplementary material, its practicality is limited due to computational overhead. This raises concerns about the applicability of the method in real-world scenarios with unpredictable update orders.
2. Focus on Synthetic Data: The experiments are conducted exclusively on synthetic data, which limits the generalizability of the results. It would be valuable to test the approach on real-world datasets, such as those from environmental monitoring or robotics, to validate its practical utility.
3. Boundary Region Performance: The paper notes that the denoising dynamics struggle near the decision boundary. While this is acknowledged as an open question, it represents a limitation of the current approach that could impact its effectiveness in certain applications.
Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Explore more practical dynamics that are robust to adversarial update orders without requiring significant computational resources.
2. Extend the experimental evaluation to real-world datasets to demonstrate the method's applicability in practical settings.
3. Investigate alternative strategies to improve denoising near the decision boundary, which is critical for accurate learning in high-noise environments.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper presents a novel and significant contribution to the field of active learning and distributed systems, addressing a challenging and underexplored problem.
- The theoretical analysis is rigorous and well-supported, and the experimental results demonstrate clear improvements over baseline methods.
- The combination of game-theoretic dynamics with active learning is innovative and has the potential to inspire further research in this area.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The reliance on synthetic data and the lack of robustness to adversarial update orders limit the immediate practical impact of the work.
- The performance near the decision boundary remains a notable limitation that could affect the method's utility in real-world applications.
Recommendation:
Overall, this paper makes a strong scientific contribution and addresses an important problem with a novel approach. While there are some limitations, the strengths outweigh the weaknesses. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions, focusing on addressing practical concerns and extending the experimental evaluation.
