This paper presents a computational model of the locust olfactory system, proposing that its function is to recover high-dimensional sparse olfactory signals from a small number of measurements. The authors introduce a dual formulation of the sparse signal recovery problem, which aligns with biological constraints, and further propose a reduced dual model where the system adapts to its environment using independent component analysis (ICA). The work is grounded in detailed biological data and offers predictions that could be tested experimentally. The authors also discuss the challenges of combining learning and readout mechanisms and address the system's sensitivity to noise.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Biological Relevance: The dual formulation and reduced dual circuit are innovative approaches to modeling the locust olfactory system. The work bridges computational neuroscience and sparse signal recovery, offering a biologically plausible explanation for the system's dynamics.
2. Theoretical Rigor: The derivation of the dual and reduced dual formulations is mathematically rigorous, and the authors provide clear justifications for their assumptions.
3. Biological Predictions: The model makes testable predictions about circuit connectivity and dynamics, such as the structure of PN-to-KC connectivity and the role of LNs in feedback. These predictions could guide future experimental studies.
4. Learning Mechanism: The use of ICA for learning environmental odor patterns is a compelling addition, demonstrating how the system could adapt to changing environments.
5. Clarity: The paper is well-organized, with a logical progression from biological background to computational modeling and experimental validation.
Weaknesses:
1. Experimental Validation: While the model is consistent with known biological data, it lacks direct experimental validation. For example, the predicted PN dynamics and LN-mediated feedback have not been tested in locusts.
2. Noise Sensitivity: The reduced dual circuit's sensitivity to noise is a significant limitation, as real-world sensory systems must operate robustly in noisy environments. The authors acknowledge this issue but do not provide a concrete solution.
3. Learning and Readout Integration: The proposed mechanism for combining learning and readout is speculative and lacks detailed implementation. This is a critical aspect of the model that requires further exploration.
4. Generality: While the authors claim the model could generalize to other olfactory systems, this is not demonstrated. The focus on the locust system limits the broader applicability of the findings.
Recommendation:
This paper makes a significant contribution to understanding the computational function of the locust olfactory system and offers a novel framework for sparse signal recovery in biological systems. However, the lack of experimental validation and the unresolved issues with noise sensitivity and learning-readout integration weaken its impact. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions, focusing on addressing the noise sensitivity and providing more detailed plans for experimental validation. 
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper introduces a novel and biologically plausible computational model.
- It is well-grounded in biological data and makes testable predictions.
- The work advances the state of the art in modeling sensory systems.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The model's sensitivity to noise raises concerns about its robustness.
- The integration of learning and readout mechanisms is underdeveloped.
- Experimental validation is lacking, limiting the model's credibility.
Overall, the paper is a strong candidate for acceptance, provided the authors address the identified weaknesses.
