This paper presents an approach to modeling latent state linear dynamical systems, with a focus on discovering hierarchical structure in the dynamics. To achieve this end, the authors propose an optimization approach where the link between the latent (global) and local dynamic dynamics are encouraged to have a certain group sparsity pattern. The authors show that this procedure is able recover the underlying connectivity structure of a fluid flow PDE.
Overall, I believe this to be a good paper, and one that that should be accepted to NIPS. However, there are a also a few points that I believe could strengthen the paper. The underlying model here seems to be fairly simple and one that most of the NIPS audience will understand, but the presentation here is tied heavily to the convection-diffusion equations, which are likely to be much less understandable to many in the audience. Ultimately, this connection seems to boil down to how we penalize the latent state dynamics (the "D(gamma) A" term in the regularization function g), but this connection was still a bit tenuous to me. Since this appears to be one of the key elements of the paper (the other penalty function were just the normal group LASSO or LASSO penalty, from relaxations of the sparse structure), I wish this particular element had been explained more fully. Given that this seems to be the chief algorithmic contribution of the paper over normal group-lasso time series modeling, the current paragraph surrounding eq (3) is a little bit dense, and I think will be hard to understand for the majority of the NIPS audience as well.
Given this, I think highlighting further one of the overall "big ideas" of the paper, that learned dynamical systems can perform substantially better using regularization derived from the underlying physical process, is very important to stress further, and could ultimately be the biggest take-home message of the paper for most of the NIPS audience. The paper proposes a new optimization approach for developing hierarchical systems based upon convection-diffusion dynamics. The key elements here a little bit hard to parse, but I believe there is a good idea here, which is worth publishing.
