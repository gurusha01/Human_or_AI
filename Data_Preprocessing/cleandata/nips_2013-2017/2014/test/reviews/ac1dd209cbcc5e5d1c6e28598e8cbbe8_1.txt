This paper proposes a model of spatio-temporal dynamics that models
a global latent process that governs the interactions between
high level clusters of points together with a local observed process
in which interactions are decoupled from points outside of one's cluster.
Both levels can be thought of as vector autoregressive models.
The authors apply their method to modeling data from a numerical
simulation of a geologic model of fluid flow under the earth's subsurface.
In general, this was a technically strong paper and shows off some state of the art
optimization techniques. On the other hand it was also a difficult paper to get through as
it was notation heavy and quite dense. In particular, there are topics
that are not typically ``NIPS'' topics, for which I think the authors should spend
more time providing intuition for.
As an example, I do not have a good grasp
what it means to approximate the latent
process with a 1-dimensional convection diffusion system --- the authors talk about
the computational benefits --- but what kind of behavior can we not capture
when we make this approximation?
The experimental setting seemed interesting but I would have liked to see some more
discussion about the task --- how was the training/test split performed in
this setting? And how are errors measured? (The authors report errors in percentage,
but it is unclear what the denominator here is).
I would have also like to see more extensive experiments, particularly with more than one dataset,
as it is difficult to understand if the proposed model is generally applicable or if it
is specifically good for this fluid-flow setting. Though spatio-temporal processes
that have interesting things happening at multiple scales are ubiquitous, the paper
does make assumptions (such as the 1-dimensional convection-diffusion assumption again)
that make the specific optimization approach tractable --- but the authors do not
discuss other settings in which these assumptions might also apply.

Next in Section 3, relaxations to simply the problem along with with efficient algorithm
for parameter estimation are developed.

 This is a technically strong paper that proposes a multiscale spatiotemporal model offlow through porous media. The optimization algorithm is quite interesting as wellas the results.
