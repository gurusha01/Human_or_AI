This paper proposes a new nonparametric volatility model.
The contribution of the paper relies on the application of Gaussian process prior to stochastic volatility models. The inference approach is based on SMC and is a straightforward application of the Liu and West's APF algorithm.
The literature review lacks of some important references and the empirical comparison is not complete. My major concerns are the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The authors proposed a new stochastic volatility (SV) model, but in the introduction and in the paper there is no reference (e.g., Taylor (1987), Jacquier, Polson, Rossi (1994, 2004) to this class of models.
\item A comparison is proposed between GP-Vol and GARCH models, but the increased flexibility of a SV over the GARCH family has already been proved in the literature by many parts. See e.g. Fridman and Harris (1998). Thus I would strongly suggest the inclusion of a comparison between a standard SV model and the proposed GP-Vol model.
\item The author proposed a new nonparametric model, but no references is give to the recent advances in Bayesian nonparametric which make use of flexible prior processes such as Dirichlet processes (e.g., see Bassetti, Casarin, Leisen (2014), Griffin (2011), Griffin and Steel (2011)). 
\end{enumerate}
