This paper proposes a new approach to derive the bound of the average causal effect (ACE) from a variable X to another Y. Its main principles is the use of Entner's Rule 1 in its inverse direction, the relaxation of the faithfulness assumption to introduce possibility of the path-cancellation at some degree, and the introduction of assumptions represented by some inequality constraints. A computation scheme of the ACE bound are formulated by using linear programing under these principles. Though the authors have not optimized the algorithm to derive the bounds yet, the resulted bounds seem very narrow and accurate in comparison with the other approaches in state of the art.
Quality
The authors tried to establish a novel method to derive more accurate bound of ACE than the state of the art. They combined several feasible principles and succeeded to provide the tighter bounds. In this regard, the content of the paper is very interesting. 
However, some criteria to define the bounds are not comprehensively explained. Particularly, the validity of the use of Entner's Rule 1 in the inverse direction is not clearly discussed. For its use in the inverse direction, the authors should explicitly assume the structure depicted in Fig.2. This should be clearly explained and discussed.
In addition, the generic criteria to choose appropriate parameters for relaxation are not provided. Since these affect the result of the bounds significantly, the principle to determine the parameters should be more investigated and included in the work.
Clarity
The explanation of the paper on the theoretical part seems basically comprehensive except the essential discussion I pointed out above. 
However, the demonstration of the experimental results are not well described. As I pointed out above, the actual implementation of the algorithm is not comprehensively explained. The definition of the parameters shown in Table 1 (Table 5?) are not clearly given.
In addition, I see some typos. For example;
"The full algorithm is shown in Table 1." on page 6=> I do not see any table of algorithm.
"Results are summarized in Table 5." on page 8=> I do not see Table 5 (maybe Table 1).
Originality
The problem setting of this paper has been addressed by some earlier work as the authors pointed out. In this regard, the scope of this paper does not have very string originality. 
The idea to combine the three ideas in a unified shape contains some originality. But, as I pointed out above, the validity of the combination is not very clearly discussed.
Significance
In terms of deriving the tighter bounds of ACE, this method shows some significance. However, its performance has been check by quite limited experiments. It generality in both theory and wide experiments has not been strictly assessed. The paper addresses an important problem which is to evaluate the bound of the strength of causal relations. However, the validity of the presented idea should be more well described in both theory and experiments.
