The paper introduces a GP-Vol model to flexibly capture the time-dependent changes in variance, and develops a new online algorithm for fully Bayesian inference under the model. 
The paper is clearly written, the developed inference method seems technically sound, and the presented results look promising. My opinion on the model itself, using a non-parametric approach such as using the GP prior on the transition function (as in the paper), seems, though, a bit an obvious way of extending the prior work developed in the finance area. So, I wouldn't put too high grade on the paper in terms of its originality. However, overall the paper is nicely presented and convincing. 
Here are a few questions to the authors:
(1) the savings in computation time compared the other methods looks very impressive, and results all look very promising. Have authors also tested higher order dependency on variances and returns, i.e., higher p and q than just 1? How is it different from the order-1 dependency in terms of computation time and algorithmic efficiency? can authors learn the optimal values for p and q from the data, maybe by computing test likelihood? 
(2) authors mentions bias introduced from the sampling from artificial dynamics in kernel. Have the authors quantify the bias? It would be more convincing to know when/how RAPCF fails, rather than just saying "the issues have limited impacts in practice". 
(3) I am not sure how authors can choose the shrinkage parameter, lambda, in practice. 
 In this paper, the evolution of the time-varying variance is modeled by GP and the associated fully Bayesian inference method is presented. Overall, it is a well-written and technically sound paper.
