The work shows how the energy of a continuous Markov Random Field that consists
of polynomial pairwise energies can be decomposed into a sum of a convex and
concave polynomial. This leverages the use of the concave-convex procedure
(CCCP) to do fast MAP inference.
Quality: The paper states valid proofs for the used methodology and it seems
reproducible. The diverse set of experiments further show that the proposed
method performs well. In comparison to other optimization techniques the
polynomial decomposition usually finds better solutions. Nevertheless, the
paper could be more clear about the weaknesses. E.g. the trade-off between
wall-clock time for solving the optimization problem and sometimes only
marginally better solution could be discussed.
Clarity: The paper is well written and the presentation is clear. I liked the
pace at which the work introduces the splitting of the polynomial into the two
parts of interest.
Originality: Using the decomposition of a polynomial to drive inference of a
MRF seems to be new.
Significance: MRFs with polynomial energies are certainly of interest, e.g. in
Computer Vision.
Strengths:
+ This is certainly an important problem in e.g. Computer Vision and worth
 studying.
+ Nice presentation; clear proofs.
+ Diverse experiments.
Weaknesses:
- The authors could be a bit more clear about the weaknesses of their work: The
 method seems to yield better solutions for the resulting optimization problem
 but seems to needs more wall-clock time than the competing direct
 optimization with L-BFGS.
Questions to the authors:
- Do the reported running times include the solving time for the decomposition
 into convex and concave functions?
 The work addresses a relevant problem and proposes an interesting solution.Proofs and exposition are clear. The paper could state the weaknesses moreclearly: The method seems to be slower for `real-world' problems than thecompetitors but yields better solutions.
