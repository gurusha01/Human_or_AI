This paper is concerned with the problem of estimating the average causal effect (ACE) between two (binary) variables when the causal structure over the covariates is not fully given. It considers a rule proposed in Entner et al. (2013) that aims to select a set of observed covariates that is sufficient to block all back-door paths. For Entner et al.'s purpose, however, the rule is justified only under the faithfulness assumption. This paper proposes to use the rule to provide bounds rather than point estimates of the ACE, and develops a method following Ramsahai (2012). 
I have to admit that I haven't digested all the technical details, but the main idea makes sense to me and seems interesting and useful. What puzzled me, however, was that I didn't really see the role of the conditions in Entner et al.'s rule in this approach. Without the faithfulness assumption, those conditions do not have obvious implications for the causal structure. My best guess is that the conditions, if verified, are relevant to the choice of the relaxation parameters, but the paper explicitly puts that matter aside. It seems to me that the machinery does not crucially depend on the conditions in Entner et al.'s rule, and I wonder if the apparent robustness of the method in the experiments has anything to do with this. I would appreciate a clarification on this issue.
Some minor comments:
1. First paragraph of Section 3, "… express violations of faithfulness as bounded violations of local independence …" This sounds strange. Isn't unfaithfulness a matter of allowing extra independence rather than violating independence? It seems to me that the proposed framework is actually intended to allow/express "almost violations" of faithfulness by constraining the magnitude of dependence.
2. In the experiments, it may be helpful to also report the performance of Entner et al.'s method when their stringent thresholds are used, taking the answer of "don't know" as reporting uninformative bounds. 
3. In the second paragraph on p. 8, if "X=1 means the patient got a flu shot, Y=1 indicates the patient was not hospitalized", why does a negative ACE suggest a desirable vaccine?
4. "Table 1" on top of p. 8 is cited as "Table 5" in the text. 
 This is an interesting paper, though the details are not easy to follow.
