The paper deals with time-data tradeoffs that appear in noiseless (convex) regularized linear inverse problems (RLIP) (e.g. compressed sensing). The authors show that when an excess data is available to solve a RLIP, the regularizer can be smoothed and the RLIP can be relaxed to a simpler problem that can be solved more efficiently in terms of computational complexity. To establish this tradeoff the authors use a standard iterative dual smoothing optimization algorithm and show that in the presence of excess data, minimizing the smoothed regularizer can achieve the same level accuracy with less iterations. On the other hand the authors explicitly characterize when the smoothed RLIP problem will yield the same (true) solution as the original problem by using the notion of the statistical dimension that precisely characterizes the phase transition curve of RLIPs with random Gaussian sensing matrices. The authors present their results for the problems of sparse signal estimation via the l-1 norm, and low rank matrix estimation via the nuclear norm. They also point to other examples and noisy signal estimation in subsequent work.
Quality: The authors use modern convex analysis tools (e.g. statistical dimension of convex cones) to approach the problem of time-data tradeoffs in statistical estimation in a principled and well structured way. 
Clarity: The paper is written in a very clear way and is self-contained.
Originality and significance: The authors cite the innovative work of Chandrasekaran and Jordan as another example of time-data tradeoffs in RLIP. However, they propose a different approach (smoothing the regularizer instead of enlarging the constraint set) which appears to be more flexible and applicable to problems that appear often in practice. 
My only concern is the dependance of the method on the choice of the optimization algorithm. Are these results also applicable to other more specialized algorithms (e.g. approximate message passing for l-1 minimization) that offer strong performance guarantees? The paper addresses the problem of time data tradeoffs in regularized linear inverse problems in a novel way, that is theoretically sound, and practically applicable.
