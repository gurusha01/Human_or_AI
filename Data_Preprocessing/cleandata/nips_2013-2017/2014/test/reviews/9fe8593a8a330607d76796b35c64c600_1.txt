The authors model the interactions of a microfinance market as a game between the banks and the villages [typo lenders]. They show that such interactions have a market-clearing equilibrium. They apply this model by looking at microfinance data and fitting the data to a nearby equilibrium solution. The learned parameters are then utilized in predicting how the market would perform under perturbations.
Equilibrium analysis for microfinance appears to be the main contribution of the paper (such analysis is known in other situations like paid search auctions) [edit for clarity: inference from the computed equilibrium is what I mean by analysis here]. The main problem, however, is that the paper is not in a publishable state and needs a re-write to make it readable. For instance, the entire introduction section only talks about microfinance in general. The sections abruptly ends with a justification for a few assumptions that leave the reader bewildered as to the connection with the work. The results seem interesting but the paper needs a lot of work in flow and readability.
