This paper introduces a new graphical model for multi-scale analysis of spatio-temporal dynamic systems.
The contribution of the paper relies on a new prior distribution for the parameters of the multi-scale process.
The paper is generally well written and provides an original and significant contribution to the literature. My major concern is about the exposition in Introduction and Section 3. Since the main contribution regards the derivation of the penalization term, I would have expected a discussion on the relationships with the following penalization methods: LASSO, elastic net, and SCAD, and an illustration of the advantages of the proposed method over the other methods. I would expect the authors introduce a discussion on the advantages of their prior with respect to other penalization methods. I would strongly suggest to accept the paper.
