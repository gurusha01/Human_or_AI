This paper considers weighted majority algorithm and establishes consistency (error rate of the aggregator tending to zero) results under two settings: (1) when the competence level (risk of each expert) is known in advance and (2) when it is estimated. For case (2), frequentist and Bayesian methods for estimating the competence level are provided.
For case (1), consistency is established in terms of providing upper and lower bounds on the error rate of the aggregator, which involve standard calculations ( apart from the fact that upper bound is established by invoking a result by Kearns and Saul, instead of Hoeffding's inequality). For case (2) under the frequentist setting, an independent set of labeled inputs is used to estimate the competence level of each expert. Depending on the confidence level, two estimates (and corresponding analyses) are provided. Under Bayesian setting, the estimator proposed is more or less standard and the analysis is entirely left as an open problem.
The main problem with the paper is the novelty aspect of the work. The estimators provided and the analyses provided are based on standard tools and there is no 'novel theoretical contribution' as such. From a practical perspective, assuming access to labeled samples in order to estimate the competence level serves as a drawback compared to the Dawid-Skene method, using which both competence level and ground truth could be estimated without labels (apart from the references provided in the paper, two related references are [1] and [2] below). But still, the problem considered in the paper is very relevant (especially due to several crowd-sourcing applications). An advantage of weighted majority method over the Dawid-Skene model, is the former makes no modeling assumptions. Hence a theoretical analysis characterizing conditions when weighted majority performs better compared to the David-Skene method would make the paper much stronger.

Drawback of the paper is the novelty aspect - there is no novel theoretical contribution as such or particularly striking practical implications of the analysis provided.
