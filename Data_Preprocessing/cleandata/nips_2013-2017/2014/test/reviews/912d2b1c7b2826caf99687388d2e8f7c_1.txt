Summary: The paper describes an efficient optimization approach to find structured low-rank matrices.
The structure is encoded by a linear map and enforcing low rank is achieved by adding to the cost function the nuclear norm of the structured matrix.
The cost function is optimized with a generalized conditional gradient algorithm.
By using a factorization of the large structured matrix the optimization is accelerated further. This comes at the cost of having to solve a non-convex auxiliary problem, optimizing the two factor matrices. But this can be solved efficiently following ideas of Zhang et al. (NIPS2012). 
A theoretical analysis indicates that the whole algorithm has a remarkably low complexity and for several sample problems it is shown that this approach is at least an order of magnitude faster than the next best competitor. It also scales well to very large problems; speed comparisons are shown for matrix sizes up to over 300M elements. An advantage is that the factor matrices start from low ranks while alternative methods tend to start from full rank.
Quality: A thorough theoretical analysis is provided for computational complexity and convergence rate that show significant improvements over alternative methods. This is also confirmed in experimental results where the method outperforms consistently the competing methods.
Clarity: Overall the paper is well written, but the material is complex and the reader has to go through the supplementary file as well as through some of the cited papers to appreciate what is happening. 
Originality: The method described here combines in a creative way several ideas from previous algorithms to come up with a new solution that is surprisingly efficient.
Significance: The problem that is addressed here is of significance for various applications and the results show convincing improvements over state of the art. 
 The paper describes an efficient optimization approach to find structured low-rank matrices. A theoretical analysis indicates considerable improvements over alternative methods and experimental results show an order of magnitude improvement in speed over competing techniques.
