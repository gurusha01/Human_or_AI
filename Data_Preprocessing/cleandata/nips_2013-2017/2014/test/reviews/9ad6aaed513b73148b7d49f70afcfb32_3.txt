In this paper, the authors first show that the multivariate polynomial functions with even degree can be decomposed into convex and concave parts. They use this property to solve MAP inference problem in continuous Markov Random Fields. Finally they show experiments on three problems: 3D reconstruction, shape from shading and image denoising. 
--> The paper is well written and tackle very important problem of solving continuous MRF problems. They provide theoretical analysis of their algorithm. 
Minor comments:
--> The authors claim to significantly outperform existing techniques in terms of efficiency and accuracy. However, this is not completely reflected in their result section. For example in all the three cases, their algorithm takes longer time than L-BFGS approach. If this is the case then they should clearly mention in the text. 
--> Authors should explain why they observe up and down in their energy versus sample index curve in Fig. 2. 
--> I would suggest to properly explain the tables in their captions. 
 The paper provides a theoretically sound algorithm for decomposing an even degree polynomial into a convex and concave parts. They properly analyse the properties of the algorithm and use it to solve continuous MRF problems. The paper is well written.
