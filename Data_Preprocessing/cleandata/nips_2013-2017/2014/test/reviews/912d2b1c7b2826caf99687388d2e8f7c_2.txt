This work considers a seemingly new, and faster, way to deal
	with nuclear-norm regularised estimation of low-rank matrices.
	The work is well motivated. The authors take time to carefully
	explain the main contributions and how these fit in with the
	existing literature. 
	The authors perform a reasonably simple mathematical trick to
	manipulate the form of the problem. The main work appears to be
	in the exploitation of this trick using their knowledge of the
	conditional gradient algorithm. 
  A somewhat novel algrotihm is proposed to estimate low-rank matrices. The algorithm offers a speed-up compared to existing methods.
