The paper describes a Bayesian model of perception (mathematical equations for sensory noise, likelihood function, prior probability distribution, loss function, response distribution). A significant strength of this model is that it combines both robustness and mathematical convenience. That is, the model can handle many different types of situations (e.g., stimulus-dependent noise) and still be computationally convenient (e.g., inference is tractable). The paper places emphasis on the fact that the model is identifiable (i.e., two parameter estimates can be easily evaluated and distinguished). 
I like this paper and would like to see it accepted to the NIPS conference. The proposed model provides a mathematically elegant framework for formalising perceptual estimation in many experiments. At the same time, I have some reservations. I believe that the proposed model is very much in the same spirit and style as other models that have recently appeared in the literature (often in the journal PLoS Computational Biology), and thus the novel contribution of this paper is incremental. For example, the reader may consider the following papers:
Acerbi, L., Wolpert, D. M., & Vijayakumar, S. (2012). Internal representations of temporal statistics and feedback calibrate motor-sensory interval timing. PLoS Computational Biology, 8 (11), e1002771.
Acerbi, L., Vijayakumar, S., & Wolpert, D. M. (2014). On the origins of suboptimality in human probabilistic inference. PLoS Computational Biology, 10 (6), e1003661.
The current submission is not identical to these (or other) earlier articles but it is similar enough (to these and other earlier articles) that I think that it is fair to state that the contribution of the current submission is "incremental".
I suggest that the authors revise the manuscript by including a new section in which they review recently proposed Bayesian models of perception, and clearly state why the model proposed in the current submission is a significant advance over previously published models.
One more comment. The submission emphasizes the fact that the model is mathematically identifiable. That is true, but parameters are only identifiable due to the mathematical assumptions of the model. The term "identifiable" can be used in other ways. For example, the model could not be used to firmly distinguish whether an experimental subject's errors are due to sensory noise, decision noise, or response noise. As a result, it would be justified to say that the model does not help with the identifiability issue with which most perceptual scientists are concerned. Please comment on this in the revised manuscript.
 Mathematically elegant framework for formalising perceptual estimation. However, the novel contribution is incremental (closely related work already exists in the literature).
