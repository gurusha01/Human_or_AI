The authors present a novel application of statistical learning and optimization, by algorithmically computing an equilibrium point, to the problem of interventions in networked microfinance economies. 
The paper is very well written and presents the problem, as well the solution, very clearly. The authors present a simple algorithm for computing the market-clearing interest rates in equilibrium. The only issue is that from the paper, it is not clear whether the equilibrium has any social welfare properties, for e.g. are the interest rates reasonable?
I think this paper deserves to be presented at NIPS. The community would benefit from being introduced to this type of data, that the paper presents clearly, that can result in more people looking at the problem with other approaches. This is an application paper that is very well-written and easy to understand, that introduces an important problem of interventions in networked economies. The NIPS community would benefit from being introduced to this type of data.
