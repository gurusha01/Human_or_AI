This paper addresses the problem of action recognition in video. The authors encode actions based on two types of attributes that describe the actions as high-level concepts: 1) Human Labeled Attributes (HLA) and 2) Data Driven Attributes (DDA). The authors propose a method to select a subset of the attributes that are discriminative and compact by combining submodular objectives that promote discrimination through the entropy rate-based attribute selection and coverage through the weighted maximum coverage-based attribute selection. The authors present experiments on the Olympic Sports and UCF101 datasets, two difficult datasets for action recognition and compare to a set of baselines and state-of-the-art approaches.
The paper is mostly well written, except a few sections. The problem is of significance as it is a standard problem in computer vision, and the experiments are performed on relevant and difficult datasets. The overall formulation of the attribute selection problem as a weighted maximum coverage problem and entropy rate maximization for a random walk is novel and interesting.
The core problem tackled in this paper seems to be the feature selection problem, as the authors try to select a subset of attribute classifiers that perform well. However, this a standard problem and there are many simple approaches for doing this, such as approaches with L1 regularization like the lasso, L1 regularized hinge loss, elastic net. I would encourage the authors to make direct comparisons to these simple approaches, instead of focusing only on other submodular selection methods. 
State-of-the-art results reported in other works are significantly higher due to the use of better dense feature vectors (90.2% on Olympic dataset as reported in [34], also other numbers Jiang et al. (ECCV 12), Jain et al (CVPR 13), Gaidon et al. (BMVC 12)are close to 80%). It would be interesting to see if the proposed attribute selection method leads to an improved performance, when combined with these dense features.
Further, this work proposes a general method for feature selection, and is not specific to action classes. Hence, to truly justify the potential of this work, I would encourage the authors to run experiments in other domains in vision, which use attributes as well (refer to [11] for other datasets).
There are a few mistakes in the equations, which should be corrected if the paper is selected for publication:
- The equation for A{d,l} in L129 is not clear. What is $u^d$ and $uk^d$ in this equation? Are these supposed to be $\mu$. What does mean and standard deviation of a "class" refer to in L127?
- Similarly, Eq. 2, ui should perhaps be \mui
- L161: Define T
 The overall formulation of attribute selection through the use of submodular objective functions which encourages the selection of discriminative attributes is novel and interesting. The authors address a standard feature selection problem, but restrict the experiments only to video action datasets, and do not compare to state-of-the-art results which use better features than the ones used in the paper.
