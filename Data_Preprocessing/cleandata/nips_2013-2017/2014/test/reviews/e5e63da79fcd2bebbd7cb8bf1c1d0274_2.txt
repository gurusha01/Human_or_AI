This paper studies the face recognition problem by using a deep learning framework. The key idea is to learn features by using both face identification and verification signals as supervision. This will simultaneously enlarge inter-personal differences and reduce intra-personal variations. Such a motivation is simple and it has been widely studied before, e.g. LDA. Bringing such a technique into the deep learning framework is novel to me, and the obtained 99.15% verification accuracy on LFW is the best result compared with state-of-the-art. 
This paper is also very well written. They also provides several experiments to verifiy their idea from different perspectives.
 A novel deep learning frmework by using both face identification and verification signals as supervision is proposed. The best 99.15% verification accuracy on LFW is achived. The idea is simple and the performance is very well.
