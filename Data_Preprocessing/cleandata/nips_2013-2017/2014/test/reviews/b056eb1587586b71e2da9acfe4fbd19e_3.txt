The proposed paper would like to use attributes as a mid-level feature representation for doing action recognition (AR). Currently, the attributes used in AR are all human assigned without accounting for discriminative ability. This paper proposes a data-driven approach to "discover", or rather select a limited set of discriminative attributes from a larger set.
QUALITY:
The formulation of the attribute selection criteria seems correct. What is missing is the motivation for keeping the relationships only pairwise and not either higher-order or one-vs-all? 
The overall claims made in the introduction are very much grander than what the results can substantiate. In particular, the claims of human-labelled attributes (HLA) being "arbitrary", and have noise and or redundancy which may "lead to degradation in action recognition performance" does not give enough credit to HLAs. The attributes are typically selected their semantic meaning and plays a role once hierarchies of activities are taken into place, e.g. applying eye makeup and applying licpstick both have the same attributes as they both fall into the category of applying makeup. Furthermore, as the experimental results show in tables 2 & 3, with the exception of a few classes, the data-driven attributes (DDA) are actually much weaker than HLA, with some results being significantly worse. IT is only in the "mixed" case in which there are improvements to be found, suggesting that the DDA are at best complementary to the HLA, and alone are insufficient. As such, claims that one can find a more compact set of attributes are not substantiated. 
CLARITY:
line 102 - 103: while the application area is interesting, more relevant to know HOW they have been used or applied in such applications, e.g. for optimization, classification, etc.
line 129: what is u_k^d and u^d?
How is lambda in equation 4 determined and what impact does it have on the results?
ORIGINALITY: the paper states that they define a "novel submodular objective function for attribute selection", but how it is novel is not clear. Furthermore, please comment on what distinguishes this submodularity optimization from the other approaches listed in the related works section and especially [22] and [23] in which the method is compared. 
SIGNIFICANCE:
This paper would be of interest to those who work in action recognition and or attribute representations, both of which are sub-topics in computer vision.  An interesting approach for determining data-driven attribute representations. A good paper which needs only some refinement of writing in the introduction / motivation
