This paper considers the problem of combining experts' guesses in a
classification setting. Unlike the sequential, adversarial setting,
the problem is based on static guesses with known or estimated
accuracies (competencies). In particular, the authors show conditions
that guarantee when the Nitzan-Paroush weighted majority rule is
consistent.
The paper is well-written and very interesting. The results are very
clean and rigorous. The authors provide lots of intuition and even
point out interesting open problems along the way. Interestingly,
standard concentration of measure results like Hoeffding's inequality
and Bernstein's inequality are not adequate. Instead, less known but
sharper bounds are used.
 Clear, interesting analysis if the weighted majority rulein the non-sequential setting.
