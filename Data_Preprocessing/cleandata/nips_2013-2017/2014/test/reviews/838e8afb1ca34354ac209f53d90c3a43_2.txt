The paper investigates decomposing the structured output object into smaller objects in Structured Output prediction setting. Theoretical analysis is provided to show that the decomposition approach has better generalization then regular SO models. In case of CRF, convergence rates are shown to be faster for optimization with SGD. Experiments on sequence models with 4 different applications show superior/competitive (3/1) performance to the state-of-the art systems in the literature.
I find the theoretical analysis of the the decompositional approach refreshing, since there has been various proposal of this approach algorithmically without any theoretical analysis. One problem that I see is that the provided bounds are much looser than the existing analysis of SO prediction models for hinge-loss, 
[Taskar et al, Max-Margin Markov Networks, NIPS 2003,
McAllister, Generalization bounds and consistency for Structured Labeling, in Predicting Structured Data, 2006]
where the generalization bound is log(l) opposed to l4 in this paper with l being the size of the structured object. Given that, it is not clear to me how the analysis of the decompositional approach would translate in the more informative analysis. 
In the experimental side, the results look very impressive. In particular for segmentation tasks (NER and Word Segmentation), a consistent labeling of the segmentation is fairly important [in BIO terms, I(In) label does not mean anything if there is no B(Begin) term]. The figures seem to suggest that in Chinese word segmentation for CRFs, simply looking at the bigram labels yields the best performance (46.6/20) and similarly for NER (26.5/~10). [Can the authors pls comment whether this is a correct reading of the comparisons?]. I am assuming here, that during testing the same decomposition algorithm is applied. I have also notice that comparing Table 1, the performance of the model on the (test?) data, is very much aligned with the best values of the hyperparameter in Figure 2, which is stated to be set on development data. It would be great if the authors could provide some discussions on these two aspect.
The decomposition of the model is done randomly for each instance (Algorithm 1). Such decomposition naturally translates sequence models. Sequence modeling is still the most representative SO prediction problem. However, it would be great to provide the reader (some possibly informal discussion) what are the consequence of the random decomposition approach for models with clique size larger than 2. A decompositional approach to SO prediction supported with (rather uninformative) theoretical analysis and strong empirical analysis.
