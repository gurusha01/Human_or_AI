Summary
The paper proposes a face verification method using deep convolutional neural networks based on identification (e.g., softmax classifier) and verification objectives with landmark-based multi-scale approach. The approach in this paper is very closely related to the work of [18] except 1) the training objective is augmented with verification objectives and 2) the selection of patches (location and scale) proposed by facial landmarks. The model is trained on CelebFaces+ database and evaluated on LFW, achieving state-of-the-art performance on face verification.
Quality
The paper introduces few neat ideas to extend the previous state-of-the-art system on face verification and the experiments are well executed.
Clarity
The paper is clearly written. Here are some comments:
1) I think more head-to-head comparison to the work of [18] is necessary as both follow the almost identical verification pipeline except for details.
2) Details about training m (margin, Equation (1)) is required (e.g., training/updating m doesn't appear in Table 1.
3) The best verification accuracies in figures and tables (e.g., figure 3, 4, table 2, 3, and 4) do not match. Having more complete captions for tables and figures with details about experimental setting would be helpful.
Originality
Although the techniques are all existing, it doesn't seem to hurt the paper as it combined the ingredients well and executed to show state-of-the-art performance.
Significance
Face verification is an important problem and deep learning has shown recent success on this problem. This paper further pushes the bar and makes the paper significant. It could be more significant if authors can include the evaluation result on YouTube Face database, which is bit more challenging dataset.
 The paper extends the previous work by augmenting the CNN objective function with verification objectives and adopting better region selection algorithm. The paper demonstrates the state-of-the-art face verification performance on LFW database.
