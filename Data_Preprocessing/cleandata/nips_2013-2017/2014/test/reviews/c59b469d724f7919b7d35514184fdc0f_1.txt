Summary
This paper proposes a recommendation algorithm based on reinforcement learning, which pursues both exploration and exploitation in an online setting. Also, the authors introduce a theoretical framework analyzing the proposed algorithm.
Basic assumptions in this paper are 1) the users are (clearly) grouped into k typical user types, and 2) likable items are clearly separated.
Under these assumptions, this paper proved that the proposed algorithm performs well.
Contribution
As the authors claimed, there has been a lot of online recommendation systems in literature, but there was few theoretical analysis about them.
Although the proposed algorithm is quite simple, it is indeed meaningful to have a theoretical frame to anlayze a recommendation system in an online setting.
Some issues
1. It is well known that users (or items) are grouped into several categories. This paper makes use of this fact (or hypothesis) for analyzing the algorithm, not for the algorithm itself. How can we make use of this in recommendation task itself?
2. When users (or items) are clustered, we usually think of a top-down clustering, without allowing for each user or item to be a member of more than one clusters. A recent paper below finds a similar set of users or items in bottom-up fashion. How can we apply the proposed framework when clusters can overlap?

3. In algorithm 1, alpha is defined as some value in (0, 4/7]. How this particular value 4/7 was decided?
4. The definition of \epsilonR(n) and \epsilonJ(t) make sense as they are, but it seems no evidence that this actually works better than constants for those. Can you prove or show by experiment this? Also, did you try to find the best \alpha? The performance may be affected by the choice of \alpha, so including the experimental result varying \alpha would be useful.
5. (minor) Three lines in Figure 1(b) are not distinguishable when printed by black-and-white printers. Can you change the shape of each line?
