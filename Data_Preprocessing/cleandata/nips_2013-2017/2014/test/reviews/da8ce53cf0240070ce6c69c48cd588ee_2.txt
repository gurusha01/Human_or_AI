This paper proposes blending several methods for statistically modeling 
multivariable continuous data into a method called blossom tree. The different methods include forest models and the graphical lasso. The resulting type of model seems novel and quite flexible and the proposed algorithm may be able to efficiently estimate it from high-dimensional non-Gaussian data. The paper is mostly clear but not easy to follow, in part because the way the model is constructed seems a bit ad-hoc, in part because many results are left for the supplementary material. It will be helpful to make the paper more principled and self-contained. Experimental results are shown only for simulated data that are constructed with the proposed model in mind. It would be useful to see a stronger experimental section including a substantial result(s) on a real dataset with e.g. glasso benchmark.  Mostly clearly written paper presenting a new and potentially useful method to flexibly model non-Gaussian multidimensional continuous data. The experimental demonstration is lacking.
