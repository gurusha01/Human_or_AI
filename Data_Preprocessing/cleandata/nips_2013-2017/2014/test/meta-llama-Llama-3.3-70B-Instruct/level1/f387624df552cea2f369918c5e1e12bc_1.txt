This paper studies the best-arm identification problem in linear bandits, where the rewards of the arms depend linearly on an unknown parameter θ. The authors characterize the complexity of the problem and introduce sample allocation strategies that pull arms to identify the best arm with a fixed confidence, while minimizing the sample budget. The paper provides a thorough analysis of the problem, including a detailed description of the setting, the proposed strategies, and their theoretical guarantees.
The strengths of the paper include:
* A clear and concise introduction to the problem and the proposed approach
* A thorough analysis of the complexity of the problem and its connection to the multi-armed bandit setting
* The introduction of two novel allocation strategies, G-allocation and XY-allocation, which are shown to be efficient and effective
* A detailed analysis of the theoretical guarantees of the proposed strategies, including their sample complexity and performance bounds
* A comparison with other existing strategies, including the fully-adaptive version of XY, and a discussion of the limitations of fully-adaptive strategies in the linear bandit setting
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes a fixed confidence level δ, which may not be realistic in practice
* The analysis of the proposed strategies is mostly theoretical, and it would be beneficial to include more experimental results to validate the findings
* The paper does not provide a clear comparison with other existing strategies in the linear bandit setting, such as those proposed in [10]
* Some of the notation and terminology used in the paper may be unfamiliar to readers who are not experts in the field
Overall, the paper provides a significant contribution to the field of linear bandits and best-arm identification. The proposed strategies and analysis provide a thorough understanding of the problem and its complexity, and the paper opens up new avenues for research in this area.
