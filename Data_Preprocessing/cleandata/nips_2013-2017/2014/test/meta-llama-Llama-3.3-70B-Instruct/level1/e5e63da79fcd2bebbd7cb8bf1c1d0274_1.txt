This paper proposes a novel approach to face recognition by learning deep features using both face identification and verification signals as supervision. The authors introduce Deep IDentification-verification features (DeepID2), which are learned through a carefully designed deep convolutional network. The face identification task increases inter-personal variations, while the face verification task reduces intra-personal variations, making it easier to recognize faces.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear explanation of their approach, including the architecture of the deep convolutional network and the loss functions used for training. The experiments are thorough, and the results are impressive, with a face verification accuracy of 99.15% on the challenging LFW dataset.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The authors propose a novel approach to face recognition that combines face identification and verification signals, which leads to significantly better features than using either signal alone.
* The paper provides a clear explanation of the architecture and training process of the deep convolutional network.
* The experiments are thorough, and the results are impressive, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes that the face identification and verification signals are available, which may not always be the case in real-world applications.
* The authors do not provide a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of their approach, which could be a limitation in real-time applications.
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel and effective approach to face recognition, which is a significant contribution to the field.
* The experiments are thorough, and the results are impressive, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Overall, I believe that the paper is a significant contribution to the field of face recognition and should be accepted. The authors propose a novel and effective approach, and the experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. However, the authors should address the limitations of their approach, including the assumption of available face identification and verification signals and the computational complexity of their approach.
