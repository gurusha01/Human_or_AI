This paper revisits the classical decision-theoretic problem of weighted expert voting from a statistical learning perspective. The authors examine the consistency of the optimal Nitzan-Paroush weighted majority rule, both asymptotically and finitely, and provide sharp error estimates for the optimal rule when the expert competence levels are known. When the competence levels are unknown, they provide frequentist and Bayesian analyses, including bounds on the probability of error.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, including the necessary background and related work. The main results are presented in a logical and easy-to-follow manner, with proofs and derivations provided in the appendix.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The authors provide a thorough analysis of the consistency of the optimal Nitzan-Paroush weighted majority rule, including both asymptotic and finite-sample results.
* The paper provides a clear and concise introduction to the problem, including the necessary background and related work.
* The authors provide frequentist and Bayesian analyses, including bounds on the probability of error, which is a significant contribution to the field.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes that the expert competence levels are independent and identically distributed, which may not be realistic in practice.
* The authors do not provide a clear comparison of the performance of the frequentist and Bayesian approaches, which would be useful for practitioners.
* Some of the proofs and derivations are quite technical and may be difficult to follow for non-experts.
Overall, the paper is well-written and provides a significant contribution to the field of statistical learning and decision theory. The authors have clearly demonstrated the consistency of the optimal Nitzan-Paroush weighted majority rule and provided bounds on the probability of error, which is a significant achievement.

In terms of quality, the paper is well-written and provides a significant contribution to the field. The authors have clearly demonstrated the consistency of the optimal Nitzan-Paroush weighted majority rule and provided bounds on the probability of error. However, the paper could be improved by providing a clear comparison of the performance of the frequentist and Bayesian approaches and by relaxing the assumption of independence and identical distribution of the expert competence levels.
