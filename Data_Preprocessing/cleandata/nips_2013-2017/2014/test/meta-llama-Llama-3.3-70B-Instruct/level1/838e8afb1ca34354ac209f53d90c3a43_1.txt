This paper proposes a novel structure regularization framework for structured prediction, which aims to control the overfitting risk caused by complex structures in the model. The authors argue that increasing the level of structural dependencies within the model can actually harm the generalization ability, and propose a method to decompose training samples into mini-samples with simpler structures. The paper provides both theoretical and empirical evidence to support the effectiveness of the proposed method in reducing the overfitting risk and improving the convergence rate in training.
The paper is well-written and clearly organized, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments and understand the proposed method. The theoretical analysis is thorough and provides a solid foundation for the proposed method. The experimental results are also impressive, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method in achieving better results than state-of-the-art systems on several highly-competitive tasks, while also substantially improving the training speed.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel structure regularization framework that can effectively reduce the overfitting risk and improve the convergence rate in training.
* The provision of both theoretical and empirical evidence to support the effectiveness of the proposed method.
* The demonstration of the proposed method's ability to achieve better results than state-of-the-art systems on several highly-competitive tasks.
* The improvement of the training speed, which is a significant advantage in practice.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The assumption that the structure complexity of the training samples is the main cause of overfitting, which may not always be the case.
* The lack of comparison with other regularization methods, such as dropout and early stopping, which are commonly used in practice.
* The limited number of tasks and datasets used in the experiments, which may not be representative of all possible scenarios.
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel and effective method for structure regularization, which can be useful in a wide range of applications.
* The theoretical analysis is thorough and provides a solid foundation for the proposed method.
* The experimental results are impressive and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in achieving better results than state-of-the-art systems.
Arguments con acceptance:
* The assumption that the structure complexity of the training samples is the main cause of overfitting may not always be the case.
* The lack of comparison with other regularization methods may limit the paper's impact and relevance.
* The limited number of tasks and datasets used in the experiments may not be representative of all possible scenarios.
Overall, I believe that the paper is well-written and provides a significant contribution to the field of structured prediction. The proposed method is novel and effective, and the theoretical analysis and experimental results provide strong evidence to support its effectiveness. While there are some weaknesses and limitations, I believe that the paper is worthy of acceptance.
