This paper proposes a novel approach to solving the structured matrix rank minimization problem using the generalized conditional gradient (GCG) method. The authors reformulate the problem in a way that allows for the application of GCG, resulting in a significant reduction in computational cost per iteration. The paper provides a thorough analysis of the convergence properties of the algorithm and demonstrates its efficiency and effectiveness through empirical studies on stochastic system realization and spectral compressed sensing problems.
