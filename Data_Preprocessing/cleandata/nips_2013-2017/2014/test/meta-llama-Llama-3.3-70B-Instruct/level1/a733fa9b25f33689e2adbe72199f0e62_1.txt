This paper introduces a novel Gaussian Process Volatility model (GP-Vol) for time-varying variances in financial time series, which is an instance of a Gaussian Process State-Space model (GP-SSM). The model is highly flexible and can capture nonlinear functional relationships and asymmetric effects of positive and negative returns on time-varying variances. The authors also present an online inference method based on particle filtering for GP-Vol, called the Regularized Auxiliary Particle Chain Filter (RAPCF), which is significantly faster than existing batch Particle Gibbs methods.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of the model and the inference method. The experiments on 50 financial time series show significant improvements in predictive performance over existing models such as GARCH, EGARCH, and GJR-GARCH. The authors also provide a comparison between RAPCF and PGAS, which shows that RAPCF is competitive in terms of predictive accuracy and is much faster.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The introduction of a novel and flexible model for time-varying variances in financial time series
* The development of an efficient online inference method for the model
* The thorough evaluation of the model and the inference method on a large number of financial time series
* The comparison with existing models and methods, which shows the advantages of the proposed approach
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The model and the inference method are complex and may be difficult to understand for readers without a strong background in Gaussian processes and particle filtering
* The paper could benefit from more discussion on the interpretation of the results and the implications for financial applications
* The authors could provide more details on the computational resources required for the experiments and the potential for scalability to larger datasets
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper introduces a novel and flexible model for time-varying variances in financial time series
* The model and the inference method are thoroughly evaluated on a large number of financial time series
* The results show significant improvements in predictive performance over existing models
* The paper provides a comparison with existing methods, which shows the advantages of the proposed approach
Arguments against acceptance:
* The model and the inference method are complex and may be difficult to understand for some readers
* The paper could benefit from more discussion on the interpretation of the results and the implications for financial applications
* The authors could provide more details on the computational resources required for the experiments and the potential for scalability to larger datasets
Overall, I recommend accepting the paper, as it introduces a novel and flexible model for time-varying variances in financial time series, and the results show significant improvements in predictive performance over existing models. However, I suggest that the authors provide more discussion on the interpretation of the results and the implications for financial applications, and provide more details on the computational resources required for the experiments and the potential for scalability to larger datasets.
