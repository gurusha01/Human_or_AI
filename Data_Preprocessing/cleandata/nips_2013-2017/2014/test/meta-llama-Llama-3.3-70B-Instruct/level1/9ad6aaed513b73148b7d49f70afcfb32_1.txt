This paper presents a novel approach to perform inference on continuous Markov random fields (MRFs) with polynomial potentials. The authors prove that every multivariate polynomial with even degree can be decomposed into a sum of convex and concave polynomials, and exploit this property to apply the concave-convex procedure (CCCP) to solve the inference problem. The CCCP is a majorization-minimization framework that optimizes non-convex functions by iteratively computing a linearization of the concave part and solving the resulting convex problem.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem of inference on continuous MRFs with polynomial potentials. They also provide a thorough review of previous work on the topic, including message passing algorithms, graph-cuts, and polynomial equation system solvers. The authors' approach is novel and interesting, and they provide a detailed description of their algorithm, including the construction of the concave-convex decomposition of polynomials.
The experimental evaluation of the approach is thorough and convincing, with results on three different applications: non-rigid 3D reconstruction, shape from shading, and image denoising. The authors compare their approach to several baselines, including ADMM-Poly, L-BFGS, and particle convex belief propagation (PCBP), and demonstrate that their approach outperforms these methods in terms of energy, running time, and root mean square error (RMSE).
The strengths of the paper include:
* The novel approach to inference on continuous MRFs with polynomial potentials, which is based on the concave-convex decomposition of polynomials.
* The thorough experimental evaluation of the approach, which demonstrates its effectiveness on several different applications.
* The clear and concise writing style, which makes the paper easy to follow and understand.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The complexity of the algorithm, which may make it difficult to implement and debug.
* The limited scalability of the approach, which may not be suitable for very large-scale problems.
* The lack of theoretical guarantees on the convergence of the algorithm, which may make it difficult to predict its behavior in practice.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication, as it presents a novel and interesting approach to inference on continuous MRFs with polynomial potentials, and demonstrates its effectiveness on several different applications.
