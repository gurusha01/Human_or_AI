This paper proposes a novel approach to learning the graphical structure of multi-scale spatio-temporal systems, which is a crucial problem in various fields such as geology, geophysics, atmospheric sciences, and oceanography. The authors introduce a hierarchical graphical model that combines vector auto-regressive (VAR) models with physically derived priors to capture the multi-scale dynamics of these systems.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, related work, and their proposed approach. The technical sections are detailed and well-organized, making it easy to follow the development of the model and algorithms. The authors also provide a thorough evaluation of their approach using a synthetic dataset and compare it to alternative methods, demonstrating the advantages of their proposed method.
The strengths of this paper include:
* The proposal of a novel hierarchical graphical model that combines machine learning and physically derived priors to capture multi-scale dynamics.
* The development of efficient algorithms for estimating the model parameters using relaxations and regularization techniques.
* A thorough evaluation of the approach using a synthetic dataset and comparison to alternative methods.
* The potential applications of this technique to various domains, including brain networks, traffic networks, and biological and social networks.
The weaknesses of this paper include:
