This paper introduces a novel approach for estimating causal effects in observational studies by exploiting observational conditional independencies to suggest "weak" paths in an unknown causal graph. The authors relax the faithfulness condition of Spirtes et al. to allow for varying degrees of "path cancellations" that imply conditional independencies but do not rule out the existence of confounding causal paths. The outcome is a posterior distribution over bounds on the average causal effect via a linear programming approach and Bayesian inference.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the background and methodology. The use of Entner's Rule 1 to identify admissible sets and witnesses is a key contribution, and the authors provide a thorough explanation of how this rule can be used to estimate the average causal effect. The introduction of relaxation parameters to allow for violations of faithfulness is also a significant contribution, as it provides a way to quantify the uncertainty in the estimates.
The paper has several strengths. Firstly, the authors provide a thorough review of the existing literature on causal inference and instrumental variables, and they clearly explain how their approach differs from and builds upon existing methods. Secondly, the authors provide a detailed explanation of their methodology, including the use of linear programming and Bayesian inference. Thirdly, the authors provide a range of experiments and simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach, including a real-world example using flu vaccine data.
However, the paper also has some weaknesses. Firstly, the authors assume that the dimensionality of the covariate set Z is modest, which may not always be the case in practice. Secondly, the authors use a brute-force approach to search for admissible sets, which may not be efficient for large datasets. Thirdly, the authors do not provide a clear explanation of how to choose the relaxation parameters, which may require significant expertise and experimentation.
In terms of the review criteria, the paper scores well on quality, clarity, and originality. The paper is technically sound, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their methodology. The paper is also well-organized, and the authors provide a range of examples and simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach. The paper is original, as it introduces a new approach for estimating causal effects in observational studies.
However, the paper could be improved in terms of significance. While the authors provide a range of experiments and simulations, they do not provide a clear explanation of how their approach will be used in practice, or how it will impact the field of causal inference. Additionally, the authors do not provide a clear comparison with existing methods, which makes it difficult to evaluate the significance of their contribution.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, as it provides a significant contribution to the field of causal inference. However, I would suggest that the authors address the weaknesses mentioned above, particularly in terms of providing a clear explanation of how to choose the relaxation parameters and how their approach will be used in practice.
