This paper proposes a novel framework for systematically testing the identifiability of Bayesian observer models in psychophysical tasks. The authors introduce a general class of observer models that can be used to model various sensorimotor estimation tasks and provide a method to efficiently explore the identifiability of these models. The framework is applied to two case studies: a time interval estimation task and a speed perception task.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of their framework and its application to the two case studies. The use of Bayesian observer models to describe human performance in perceptual tasks is well-established, and the authors' work builds on this foundation. The paper's main contribution is the development of a systematic approach to investigating the identifiability of these models, which is a crucial aspect of understanding the reliability of the conclusions drawn from fitting these models to data.
The strengths of the paper include its clear and well-organized structure, the detailed explanation of the framework and its application, and the use of two case studies to demonstrate the framework's utility. The authors also provide a thorough discussion of the results and their implications for experimental design and the interpretation of data.
The weaknesses of the paper include the complexity of the framework and the notation used, which may make it challenging for some readers to follow. Additionally, the paper assumes a high level of familiarity with Bayesian decision theory and psychophysics, which may limit its accessibility to readers from other fields.
In terms of the criteria for evaluation, the paper scores well on quality, as the framework is technically sound and well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The paper is also clear and well-organized, making it easy to follow and understand. The originality of the paper is high, as it proposes a novel framework for investigating the identifiability of Bayesian observer models. The significance of the paper is also high, as it has the potential to impact the design of experiments and the interpretation of data in psychophysics and related fields.
