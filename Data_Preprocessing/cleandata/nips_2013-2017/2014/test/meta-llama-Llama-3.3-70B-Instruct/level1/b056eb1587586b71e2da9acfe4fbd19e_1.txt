This paper proposes a novel approach to action recognition by leveraging attribute-based representations. The authors introduce two types of attributes: human-labeled attributes and data-driven attributes, which are learned from data using dictionary learning methods. To address the issue of noisy and redundant attributes, the authors propose a discriminative and compact attribute-based representation by selecting a subset of discriminative attributes from a large attribute set. The selection procedure is formulated as a submodular optimization problem, which is solved using a greedy algorithm.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise overview of the proposed approach. The related work section is thorough, and the authors provide a good discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of existing approaches. The experimental results are impressive, and the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on two challenging datasets: Olympic Sports and UCF101.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel attribute-based representation that combines human-labeled and data-driven attributes.
* The formulation of the attribute selection procedure as a submodular optimization problem, which allows for efficient and effective selection of discriminative attributes.
* The demonstration of the effectiveness of the proposed approach on two challenging datasets.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The reliance on a large number of parameters, which may require careful tuning for optimal performance.
* The lack of a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed approach.
* The limited discussion of the potential applications of the proposed approach beyond action recognition.
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel and effective approach to action recognition that leverages attribute-based representations.
* The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on two challenging datasets.
* The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise overview of the proposed approach.
Arguments con acceptance:
* The paper relies on a large number of parameters, which may require careful tuning for optimal performance.
* The computational complexity of the proposed approach is not thoroughly analyzed.
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the potential applications of the proposed approach beyond action recognition.
Overall, I believe that the paper is well-written, and the authors propose a novel and effective approach to action recognition. The experimental results are impressive, and the paper demonstrates the potential of attribute-based representations for action recognition. However, the paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the computational complexity and a discussion of the potential applications beyond action recognition. I would recommend accepting the paper with minor revisions.
