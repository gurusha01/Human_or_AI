This paper proposes a novel approach to face recognition by learning deep features using both face identification and verification signals as supervision. The authors introduce Deep IDentification-verification features (DeepID2), which are learned through a deep convolutional neural network (ConvNet) with a carefully designed architecture. The face identification signal increases inter-personal variations, while the face verification signal reduces intra-personal variations, resulting in effective features for face recognition.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear explanation of their approach, including the architecture of the ConvNet and the loss functions used for training. The experiments are thorough, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, achieving a face verification accuracy of 99.15% on the LFW dataset.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel approach to face recognition that combines face identification and verification signals as supervision.
* The use of a deep ConvNet to learn effective features for face recognition.
* The thorough experimentation and evaluation of the proposed approach on a challenging dataset.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The complexity of the proposed approach, which may make it difficult to implement and reproduce.
* The requirement for a large amount of training data, which may not be available for all applications.
* The lack of comparison with other state-of-the-art face recognition approaches that use different architectures or loss functions.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the proposed approach is novel and effective. The results demonstrate the potential of the approach for face recognition, and the paper provides a valuable contribution to the field.
