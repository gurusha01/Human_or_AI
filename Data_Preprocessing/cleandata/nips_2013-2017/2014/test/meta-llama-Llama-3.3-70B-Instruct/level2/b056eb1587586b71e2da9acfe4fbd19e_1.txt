This paper proposes a novel approach to action recognition by encoding actions based on attributes that describe high-level concepts, such as "jump forward" or "motion in the air". The authors introduce two types of action attributes: human-labeled attributes and data-driven attributes learned from data using dictionary learning methods. To address the issue of noisy and redundant attributes, the authors propose a discriminative and compact attribute-based representation by selecting a subset of discriminative attributes from a large attribute set. The selection procedure is formulated as a submodular optimization problem, which is solved using a greedy algorithm.
The paper's main claims are that the proposed attribute-based representation can significantly boost the performance of action recognition algorithms and outperform most recently proposed recognition approaches. The authors support these claims through extensive experiments on two challenging datasets, Olympic Sports and UCF101, demonstrating the effectiveness of their method in selecting a subset of discriminative attributes and removing noisy and redundant attributes.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their approach. The experimental results are thorough and demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over other state-of-the-art approaches. The use of submodular optimization is a novel contribution to the field of action recognition, and the authors provide a detailed analysis of the optimization problem and its solution.
The paper's strengths include its ability to handle large variations in viewpoints, complicated backgrounds, and people performing actions differently, which is a common challenge in action recognition. The authors also provide a comprehensive review of related work, highlighting the limitations of existing approaches and the advantages of their proposed method.
However, there are some limitations to the paper. The authors assume that the human-labeled attributes are available, which may not always be the case. Additionally, the dictionary learning method used to learn data-driven attributes may not always produce meaningful attributes. The authors could have provided more analysis on the interpretability of the learned attributes and their relationship to the human-labeled attributes.
In terms of novelty, the paper presents a significant improvement over existing approaches by introducing a submodular optimization framework for attribute selection. The use of entropy rate and weighted maximum coverage functions is a novel contribution to the field, and the authors demonstrate its effectiveness in selecting a subset of discriminative attributes.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their approach. The experimental results are thorough, and the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of action recognition. I would recommend accepting this paper for publication.
