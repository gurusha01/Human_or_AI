This paper introduces a novel Gaussian Process Volatility model (GP-Vol) for time-varying variances in financial time series, which is an instance of a Gaussian Process State-Space model (GP-SSM). The main claims of the paper are that GP-Vol can capture highly flexible functional relationships for the variances and that it outperforms existing models such as GARCH, EGARCH, and GJR-GARCH in terms of predictive performance. The authors also introduce a new online algorithm for fast inference in GP-Vol, called the Regularized Auxiliary Particle Chain Filter (RAPCF), which is shown to be up to two orders of magnitude faster than existing batch Particle Gibbs methods.
The support for these claims is provided through a series of experiments on synthetic and real financial data. The results show that GP-Vol obtains the highest predictive log-likelihood in 29 out of 50 analyzed datasets, and that RAPCF is competitive with GARCH, EGARCH, and GJR-GARCH in terms of predictive accuracy, while being significantly faster. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the transition function learned by GP-Vol, which shows that it can capture nonlinear and asymmetric effects of positive and negative returns on time-varying variances.
The usefulness of the ideas presented in the paper is evident, as GP-Vol can be used to improve the prediction of financial time series, which is a crucial task in finance. The paper also provides a new online inference method that can be applied to other GP-SSMs, making it a valuable contribution to the field.
The paper reflects common knowledge in the field, as it provides a clear overview of existing models and methods for volatility modeling, and it correctly uses terms and concepts from the field. The authors also provide a comprehensive list of references to relevant literature.
The novelty of the paper lies in the introduction of GP-Vol and RAPCF, which provide a new and flexible approach to volatility modeling and online inference. The paper also provides a detailed analysis of the transition function learned by GP-Vol, which is a unique contribution to the field.
The completeness of the paper is good, as it provides a clear and detailed description of the methods and experiments. However, some of the mathematical derivations and proofs are not provided, which might make it difficult for some readers to fully understand the paper.
The limitations of the paper are acknowledged by the authors, who mention that RAPCF introduces bias and does not smooth backward, which can lead to particle impoverishment. However, the authors also provide a discussion of these limitations and potential solutions, which shows that they are aware of the potential issues with their method.
Overall, this is a well-written and well-structured paper that provides a significant contribution to the field of volatility modeling and online inference. The ideas presented in the paper are novel and useful, and the experiments provide strong support for the claims made by the authors.
