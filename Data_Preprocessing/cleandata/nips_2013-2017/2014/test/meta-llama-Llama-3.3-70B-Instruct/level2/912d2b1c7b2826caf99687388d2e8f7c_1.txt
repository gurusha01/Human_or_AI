This paper presents a novel approach to solving the structured matrix rank minimization problem, which is a crucial task in various applications such as machine learning, control theory, and signal processing. The authors propose a reformulation of the problem that enables the use of the generalized conditional gradient (GCG) method, resulting in a significant reduction in computational cost per iteration.
The main claims of the paper are:
1. The proposed reformulation of the structured matrix rank minimization problem allows for the use of the GCG method, which has a lower computational cost per iteration compared to existing approaches.
2. The GCG method achieves a convergence rate of O(1/ε) and an overall complexity of O(MN/ε), which is the lowest among state-of-the-art methods for structured matrix rank minimization problems.
3. The proposed approach is empirically shown to outperform existing methods in terms of running time and effectiveness in recovering low-rank solutions in stochastic system realization and spectral compressed sensing problems.
The support for these claims is provided through:
1. A detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed approach, which shows that it has a lower cost per iteration compared to existing methods.
2. A convergence analysis of the GCG method, which establishes a convergence rate of O(1/ε) and an overall complexity of O(MN/ε).
3. Empirical results on stochastic system realization and spectral compressed sensing problems, which demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach.
The usefulness of the ideas presented in the paper is evident from the fact that they can be applied to various applications, including machine learning, control theory, and signal processing. The proposed approach has the potential to improve the efficiency and scalability of existing methods for structured matrix rank minimization problems.
