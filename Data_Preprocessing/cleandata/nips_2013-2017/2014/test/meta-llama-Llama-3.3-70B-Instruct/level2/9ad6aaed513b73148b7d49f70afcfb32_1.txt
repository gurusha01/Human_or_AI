This paper presents a novel approach to perform inference on continuous Markov random fields with polynomial potentials. The authors prove that every multivariate polynomial with even degree can be decomposed into a sum of convex and concave polynomials, and exploit this property to apply the concave-convex procedure (CCCP) to solve the inference problem. The CCCP is a majorization-minimization framework that optimizes non-convex functions by iteratively computing a linearization of the concave part and solving the resulting convex problem.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, as well as a thorough explanation of the theoretical background and the proposed algorithm. The experimental evaluation is also comprehensive, with three different applications (non-rigid 3D reconstruction, shape from shading, and image denoising) demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach.
The strengths of the paper include:
* Theoretical contribution: The authors provide a novel proof that every multivariate polynomial with even degree can be decomposed into a sum of convex and concave polynomials, which is a significant contribution to the field.
* Algorithmic contribution: The proposed algorithm is efficient and scalable, and the authors demonstrate its effectiveness on large-scale problems.
* Experimental evaluation: The authors provide a comprehensive experimental evaluation, with multiple applications and comparisons to state-of-the-art methods.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* Limited scope: The paper focuses on polynomial potentials, which may not be the most general case. The authors mention that the approach can be extended to non-polynomial cases, but this is not fully explored.
* Computational cost: While the algorithm is efficient, the computational cost may still be high for very large-scale problems.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the authors provide a significant contribution to the field. The proposed algorithm is efficient and scalable, and the experimental evaluation is comprehensive. However, the limited scope and computational cost may be limitations of the approach.
Arguments for acceptance:
