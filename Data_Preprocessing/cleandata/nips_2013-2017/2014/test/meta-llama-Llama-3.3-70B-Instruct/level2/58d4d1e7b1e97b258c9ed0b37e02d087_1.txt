This paper proposes a novel framework for systematically testing the identifiability of Bayesian observer models in psychophysical tasks. The authors introduce a general class of observer models that can be used to model various sensorimotor estimation tasks and provide a method to efficiently explore the identifiability landscape of these models. The framework is applied to two case studies: a time interval estimation task and a speed perception task.
The main claim of the paper is that the proposed framework can be used to improve experimental design by identifying the most informative experimental setups for recovering internal representations of interest. The authors demonstrate this by showing how different experimental designs can affect the reconstruction error of the recovered priors in the time interval estimation task. They also show that the inference of internal representations in speed perception is relatively robust and not prone to major degeneracies.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of their framework and its application to the two case studies. The use of Bayesian observer models to study perception is well-established, and the authors provide a thorough review of the relevant literature. The paper's contribution is significant, as it provides a systematic approach to studying the identifiability of Bayesian models of perception, which is a crucial aspect of understanding human perception.
The strengths of the paper include its clear and concise writing style, the thorough review of the literature, and the detailed explanation of the framework and its application. The paper also provides a significant contribution to the field by proposing a novel framework for studying the identifiability of Bayesian models of perception.
The weaknesses of the paper include the complexity of the mathematical derivations, which may make it difficult for non-experts to follow. Additionally, the paper assumes a high level of familiarity with Bayesian decision theory and psychophysics, which may limit its accessibility to a broader audience.
