This paper introduces a novel approach for estimating causal effects in observational studies, leveraging observational conditional independencies to identify "weak" paths in an unknown causal graph. The authors relax the faithfulness condition of Spirtes et al. to allow for varying degrees of "path cancellations" that imply conditional independencies but do not rule out the existence of confounding causal paths. The outcome is a posterior distribution over bounds on the average causal effect via a linear programming approach and Bayesian inference.
The paper's main claim is that this approach should be used in regular practice to complement other default tools in observational studies. The authors provide a new methodology to bound the average causal effect (ACE) of a variable X on a variable Y, which is not identifiable from observational data in general. They modify the results of Entner et al. to generate candidate instrumental variables and use a linear programming approach to obtain bounds on the ACE.
The paper's strengths include its ability to provide a compromise between point estimators given by faithfulness assumptions and bounds based on instrumental variables. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through synthetic studies and a real-world example, showing that their method is more stable and robust than other approaches. The paper also provides a clear and detailed explanation of the methodology, including the use of a constrained Dirichlet prior to avoid sensitivity to hyperparameter choice.
However, the paper also has some limitations. The authors acknowledge that the choice of relaxation parameters is crucial, but they do not provide a clear guideline for selecting these parameters. Additionally, the paper's focus on binary variables and modest dimensionality may limit its applicability to more complex scenarios.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of causal inference, providing a novel approach for estimating causal effects in observational studies. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach and provide a clear explanation of the methodology, making it a valuable resource for researchers in the field.
