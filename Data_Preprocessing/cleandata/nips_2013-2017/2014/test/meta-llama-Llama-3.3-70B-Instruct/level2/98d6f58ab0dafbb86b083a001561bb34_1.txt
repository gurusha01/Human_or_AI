This paper proposes a tradeoff between sample complexity and computation time for statistical estimators based on convex optimization. The authors argue that as the amount of data increases, optimization problems can be smoothed more aggressively to achieve accurate estimates more quickly. The paper provides theoretical and experimental evidence of this tradeoff for a class of regularized linear inverse problems.
The main claim of the paper is that by smoothing the dual problem, the authors can solve the regularized linear inverse problem faster without increasing the statistical risk. The paper supports this claim with theoretical analysis and numerical experiments on sparse vector recovery and low-rank matrix recovery problems.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the proposed method and its theoretical foundations. The numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in achieving a time-data tradeoff.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The paper proposes a novel approach to exploiting the tradeoff between sample complexity and computation time.
* The authors provide a thorough theoretical analysis of the proposed method, including bounds on the statistical dimension of the descent cones of the regularizer.
* The numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in achieving a time-data tradeoff.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes that the measurement matrix is sufficiently random, which may not always be the case in practice.
* The authors do not provide a comprehensive comparison with existing methods, which makes it difficult to evaluate the significance of the proposed approach.
* The paper could benefit from more discussion on the potential applications and limitations of the proposed approach.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the proposed approach is novel and interesting. However, the paper could benefit from more comprehensive comparisons with existing methods and more discussion on the potential applications and limitations of the proposed approach.
