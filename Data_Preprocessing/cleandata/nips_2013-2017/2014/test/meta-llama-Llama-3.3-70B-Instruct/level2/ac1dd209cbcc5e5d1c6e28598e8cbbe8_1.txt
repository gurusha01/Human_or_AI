This paper proposes a novel approach to learning the graphical structure of multi-scale spatio-temporal systems using a hierarchy of vector auto-regressive (VAR) models with physically derived priors. The main claim of the paper is that the proposed method can efficiently estimate the interaction structure of such systems, which is a crucial problem in various fields, including exploration geophysics, atmospheric and ocean sciences.
The paper provides a clear and well-structured presentation of the proposed method, including the mathematical formulation, optimization algorithms, and experimental results. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on a synthetic dataset generated from a geologic model, showing that the estimated graphical structure is physically meaningful and robust to initialization.
The support for the claims is strong, with a combination of theoretical analysis, numerical experiments, and comparisons with alternative approaches. The paper provides a thorough evaluation of the proposed method, including a discussion of its advantages and limitations.
The usefulness of the proposed method is significant, as it can be applied to various domains, including brain networks, traffic networks, and biological and social networks. The paper provides a clear motivation for the research, highlighting the importance of understanding the connectivity structure of complex systems.
The paper demonstrates a good understanding of the field, with a thorough review of related work and a clear explanation of the key concepts and techniques. The authors provide a comprehensive list of references, including recent papers on related topics.
The originality of the paper is high, as it proposes a novel approach that combines machine learning and physically derived priors to reconstruct the connectivity structure of multi-scale spatio-temporal systems. The paper provides a significant improvement over existing methods, including VAR models and group LASSO, in terms of estimating the graphical structure and replicating the dynamical properties of the original system.
The completeness of the paper is good, with a clear presentation of the proposed method, experimental results, and discussions of the advantages and limitations. The paper provides sufficient details for reproducibility, including the optimization algorithms and hyper-parameter selection.
