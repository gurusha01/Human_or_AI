This paper revisits the classical decision-theoretic problem of weighted expert voting from a statistical learning perspective. The authors examine the consistency of the optimal Nitzan-Paroush weighted majority rule and provide sharp error estimates for the optimal rule when the expert competence levels are known. They also analyze the case where the competence levels are unknown and must be empirically estimated, providing both frequentist and Bayesian approaches.
The paper's main contributions are:
1. The authors derive nearly optimal bounds for the probability of error of the Nitzan-Paroush optimal decision rule when the expert competence levels are known.
2. They provide a frequentist analysis for the case where the competence levels are unknown, including a low-confidence regime and a high-confidence regime with nonadaptive and adaptive approaches.
3. They also present a Bayesian approach, which admits a simple, provably optimal empirical decision rule, although they are unable to compute or estimate the probability of error induced by this rule.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of their results. The proofs are technical but seem correct. The authors also discuss related work and provide a clear overview of the current state of research in this area.
The paper's strengths are:
1. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the consistency of the Nitzan-Paroush weighted majority rule, including both known and unknown competence levels.
2. They present a clear and detailed explanation of their results, making it easy to follow their arguments.
3. The paper is well-organized, and the authors provide a clear overview of the current state of research in this area.
The paper's weaknesses are:
1. The authors are unable to compute or estimate the probability of error induced by the Bayesian optimal empirical decision rule, which is a significant limitation.
2. The frequentist analysis is complex and may be difficult to follow for readers without a strong background in statistical learning theory.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the consistency of the Nitzan-Paroush weighted majority rule, and their results are significant contributions to the field. While there are some limitations, the paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of their results.
