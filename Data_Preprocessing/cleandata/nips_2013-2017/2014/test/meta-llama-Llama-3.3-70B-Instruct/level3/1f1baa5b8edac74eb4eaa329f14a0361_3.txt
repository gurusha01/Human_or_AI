This paper proposes a method for attribute-based zero-shot learning using random forests, with an extension to few-shot learning, by training attribute classifiers and estimating attribute reliability. The paper is clear and well-written, doing a good job summarizing related work. However, its clarity does not compensate for its limited originality. The novelty of the paper is somewhat low, as it builds upon existing methods for handling attribute uncertainty, such as direct attribute prediction, with the proposed approach using a more complex model for modeling attribute noise.
The paper's technical choices and descriptions are sound, with appropriate experiments, but the level of quantitative improvement is not high enough to accept the paper solely on empirical results. The extension to few-shot learning feels less polished, with a brief explanation and a potentially questionable method for combining class-attribute priors and image attribute estimates. The paper's main selling point as a new way of handling unreliable attributes is somewhat questionable, with the proposed approach being more of a better way to model attribute correlation rather than a fundamentally new approach.
Here are the arguments for and against acceptance:
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper is well-written and easy to follow.
* The proposed method is technically sound and has been experimentally evaluated.
* The paper provides a good summary of related work.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The paper's originality is limited, building upon existing methods.
* The level of quantitative improvement is not high enough to justify acceptance solely on empirical results.
* The extension to few-shot learning feels less polished and may require further development.
Overall, while the paper is well-written and technically sound, its limited originality and lack of significant quantitative improvement make it a borderline acceptance. I would recommend acceptance if the authors can address the concerns regarding the extension to few-shot learning and provide more convincing empirical results.
