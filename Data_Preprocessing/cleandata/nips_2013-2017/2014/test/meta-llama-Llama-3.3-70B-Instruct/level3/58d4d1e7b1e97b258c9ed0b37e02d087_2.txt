This paper tackles the important issue of model identifiability in cognitive modeling, but relies on a long list of assumptions that may be difficult to understand. The methodology is interesting and innovative, making the work worthy of presentation at NIPS, despite the results being less than overwhelming.
The key results in section 4.1 were not surprising, and I question the incorporation of both sensory and motor noise into the model. The model should be able to recover the fact that the reference observer did not have a slow-speed prior in section 4.2. The stimulus is drawn from a discrete distribution, which may not accurately represent the continuous variable it is meant to model.
The log-stimulus transform imposes strong constraints on inference, which may be the primary reason for the success of the work. The constraints in Eq 4 may not ensure that Eqn 3 is fit to be a unimodal distribution, and could potentially yield a bimodal distribution. The observer's prior favors the lattice representation over a uniform representation, but it is unclear why this is the case.
Figure 1 is confusing and could be improved by integrating Figure 1b into Figure 1a and removing p_est(s^*|x). The conditions under which Equation 14 is approximately correct are unclear, and I question the use of Stirling's approximation and the assumption that E[xlogx] ~= E[x]logE[x]. I am unsure which density is being referred to in line 262, and suggest that the dataset distribution may be the intended density.
The learning of priors does not matter in 2AFC, which is an innovative approach to an important problem. However, the paper could benefit from more discussion on the implications of this result and its potential applications.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, but the claims could be better supported by theoretical analysis or experimental results. The paper is well-organized, but could be improved with more explanations and justifications for the assumptions made. The originality of the paper is high, as it tackles a new problem in cognitive modeling and presents innovative solutions. The significance of the paper is also high, as it has the potential to contribute to our understanding of human perception and decision-making.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper for presentation at NIPS, but with revisions to address the issues mentioned above. The paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field, but requires more work to ensure that the results are robust and well-supported.
