This paper proposes a novel approach to action recognition in video using two types of attributes: Human Labeled Attributes (HLA) and Data Driven Attributes (DDA). The authors introduce a weighted maximum coverage problem and entropy rate maximization for a random walk to select discriminative and compact attributes. The paper is well-written, and the problem addressed is significant as it is a standard problem in computer vision.
The core problem tackled is the feature selection problem, and the authors are encouraged to compare their approach to simple methods like L1 regularization and Lasso. The state-of-the-art results reported in other works are significantly higher due to the use of better dense feature vectors, and it would be interesting to see if the proposed method leads to improved performance when combined with these features.
The authors are also encouraged to run experiments in other domains in vision that use attributes to truly justify the potential of their work. There are a few mistakes in the equations that need to be corrected, including unclear notations and undefined variables. The overall formulation of attribute selection using submodular objective functions is novel and interesting, but the experiments are restricted to video action datasets and do not compare to state-of-the-art results.
The paper has several strengths, including the novelty of the approach, the clarity of the writing, and the significance of the problem addressed. However, there are also some weaknesses, including the lack of comparison to simple methods, the restriction of experiments to video action datasets, and the presence of mistakes in the equations.
Arguments for acceptance include the novelty of the approach, the clarity of the writing, and the significance of the problem addressed. Arguments against acceptance include the lack of comparison to simple methods, the restriction of experiments to video action datasets, and the presence of mistakes in the equations.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the approach is novel and interesting. However, the authors need to address the weaknesses mentioned above to strengthen the paper. With some revisions, the paper has the potential to be a strong contribution to the field of computer vision.
