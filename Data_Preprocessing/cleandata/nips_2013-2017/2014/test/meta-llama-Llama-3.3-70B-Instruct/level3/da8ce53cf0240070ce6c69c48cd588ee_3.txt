This paper proposes a novel framework for causal strategic inference in networked microfinance economies, which is a significant contribution to the field of microfinance and econometrics. The authors model a microfinance market as a two-sided market consisting of microfinance institutions (MFIs) and villages, and develop an algorithm for computing equilibria and learning model parameters.
The paper's strengths include its originality and novelty, as it combines concepts from game theory, econometrics, and machine learning to address a complex problem in microfinance. The authors provide a clear and well-organized presentation of their framework, and the empirical study based on microfinance data from Bolivia and Bangladesh demonstrates the practical applicability of their approach.
However, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement. The paper's statistical-consistency result may not be directly useful to machine learning without more information on the properties of the constant N and the number of samples required for the result to hold. Additionally, the paper could benefit from more experimental evaluations, including varying the class of underlying ground-truth density and graphs, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
The paper's relation to previous work is well-discussed, but it could be improved by referencing the Chow-Liu algorithm, which is a foundational work in the field. The authors' assumption of complete repayment of loans may be idealistic, but it is supported by empirical evidence, and the paper provides a clear justification for this assumption.
The empirical study is a significant strength of the paper, as it demonstrates the practical applicability of the proposed framework. The results show that the learned model matches each MFI's total loan allocations and captures the variation among villages with respect to the revenue generation function. The paper also discusses issues of bias and variance, and the results suggest that the learning scheme does not overfit the real-world data.
In terms of significance, the paper addresses a difficult problem in microfinance and provides a novel framework for causal strategic inference. The results have important implications for policy-makers, as they can be used to evaluate the outcomes of various types of interventions, such as removing a loss-making bank from the market or imposing an interest rate cap.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, as it makes a significant contribution to the field of microfinance and econometrics. However, I would suggest that the authors address the weaknesses and areas for improvement mentioned above, including providing more experimental evaluations and referencing the Chow-Liu algorithm.
