This paper proposes a novel approach to learning the graphical structure of multi-scale spatio-temporal systems by combining machine learning techniques with physically derived priors. The authors introduce a hierarchical graphical model that captures both local and global interactions, and demonstrate its effectiveness in estimating the connectivity structure of a medium from data of flow through it under a potential/pressure field.
The paper's main strengths lie in its ability to model complex systems with multiple scales of space and time, and its use of physically derived priors to regularize the model. The authors provide a thorough theoretical analysis of the model, including a proof of its equivalence to a vector auto-regressive moving-average (VARMA) process. The experimental results demonstrate the model's ability to estimate the graphical structure of a system with high accuracy, outperforming alternative approaches such as non-hierarchical VAR models with group LASSO.
However, there are some weaknesses in the paper. The theoretical analysis, while thorough, is somewhat uninformative, and the bounds provided are looser than existing analyses. Additionally, the consequences of the decomposition approach for models with clique size larger than 2 are unclear and require further discussion. The paper could also benefit from more discussion on the experimental results and hyperparameter settings.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of the work. The paper is clearly written, well-organized, and provides enough information for the expert reader to reproduce the results.
In terms of originality, the paper proposes a novel combination of machine learning techniques and physically derived priors to learn the graphical structure of multi-scale spatio-temporal systems. The approach is significantly different from previous contributions, and the authors provide a clear discussion of how their work differs from existing research.
In terms of significance, the paper addresses a difficult problem in a better way than previous research, and the results have the potential to impact a wide range of fields, including exploration geophysics, atmospheric and ocean sciences, and brain networks. The paper provides unique conclusions on existing data and demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach in estimating the graphical structure of complex systems.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, as it provides a significant contribution to the field of machine learning and graphical models, and has the potential to impact a wide range of applications. However, the authors should address the weaknesses mentioned above, and provide more discussion on the experimental results and hyperparameter settings.
