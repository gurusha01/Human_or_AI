This paper proposes a novel approach to learning the graphical structure of multi-scale spatio-temporal systems, which is a crucial problem in various fields such as exploration geophysics, atmospheric and ocean sciences. The authors introduce a hierarchical graphical model that combines a global system with local interactions, and derive a regularization term based on the physics of convection-diffusion processes. The model is shown to be more parsimonious and efficient than existing vector auto-regressive (VAR) models, and the authors provide a detailed optimization procedure to estimate the model parameters.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the proposed approach. The mathematical derivations are sound, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in learning the connectivity structure of a medium from data of flow through it under a potential/pressure field. The comparison with alternative approaches, such as group LASSO and non-hierarchical VAR models, highlights the advantages of the proposed method in terms of interpretability and generalization performance.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel and efficient approach to learning the graphical structure of multi-scale spatio-temporal systems
* The derivation of a regularization term based on the physics of convection-diffusion processes, which is a key contribution of the paper
* The provision of a detailed optimization procedure to estimate the model parameters
* The demonstration of the effectiveness of the proposed method through experimental results
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The lack of discussion on potential applications of the proposed method to other domains, such as brain networks, traffic networks, and biological and social networks
* The limited comparison with existing methods, which could be extended to include other state-of-the-art approaches
* The need for further investigation on the choice of hyper-parameters and the sensitivity of the proposed method to different settings
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the proposed approach is novel and efficient. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, and the comparison with alternative approaches highlights its advantages. However, further investigation is needed to fully explore the potential of the proposed method and its applications to other domains.
