This paper proposes a novel approach to learning the graphical structure of multi-scale spatio-temporal systems using a hierarchy of vector auto-regressive (VAR) models. The introduction of a bidirectional extension of recursive neural networks (RNNs) allows information to be propagated down the tree from larger to smaller contexts, enabling the capture of complex dynamics at multiple scales. The proposed extension is simple, elegant, and effective, with a high-level idea similar to another approach, but with different computations and superior performance.
The method is well-motivated and clearly presented, with excellent experimental results demonstrating its advantages over alternative approaches. The use of physically derived priors, such as the convection-diffusion (C-D) process, allows for the estimation of meaningful multi-scale graphical structures. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the model, including a discussion of the advantages of the hierarchical structure and the importance of the C-D prior in replicating the large-scale dynamics of the system.
However, I have some concerns regarding the experimental setup and comparability to alternative models. Specifically, I question the use of dropout, additional training data, and hybrid vectors in the alternative bidirectional RNN model. It is unclear how these modifications affect the performance of the model and whether they provide a fair comparison to the proposed approach.
The paper is well-executed, based on a simple and elegant idea, and provides a significant contribution to the field. However, some clarifications and improvements are suggested, such as explaining the "widely used mix of both" in Section 4.4. Additionally, the authors may want to consider providing more details on the optimization procedure and the selection of hyperparameters.
Overall, the strengths of the paper include its novel approach, clear presentation, and excellent experimental results. The weaknesses include some concerns regarding the experimental setup and comparability to alternative models.
