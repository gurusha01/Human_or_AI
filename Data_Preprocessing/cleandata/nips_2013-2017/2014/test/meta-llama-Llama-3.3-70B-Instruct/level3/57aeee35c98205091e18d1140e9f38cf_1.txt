This paper proposes a novel approach to estimate the average causal effect (ACE) between two binary variables when the causal structure over covariates is not fully given. The method, called the Witness Protection Program (WPP), uses a rule from Entner et al. (2013) to provide bounds rather than point estimates. The WPP framework allows for "almost violations" of faithfulness by constraining the magnitude of dependence, rather than expressing violations of faithfulness as bounded violations of local independence.
The paper is well-structured, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the background, methodology, and experiments. The use of a linear programming approach and Bayesian inference to generate bounds on the ACE is innovative and provides a useful compromise between point estimators and bounds based on instrumental variables.
However, I have some concerns regarding the role of conditions in Entner et al.'s rule in this approach. It is not entirely clear how crucial these conditions are to the method's machinery, and further clarification on their implications would be beneficial. Additionally, the paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison of the WPP method with other existing methods, such as the point estimate of Entner et al. (2013), to provide a clearer understanding of its strengths and weaknesses.
The experiments presented in the paper are interesting, and the results suggest that the WPP method is stable and provides robust bounds on the ACE. However, I would like to see more experiments with different datasets and scenarios to further evaluate the method's performance.
In terms of the conference guidelines, I would rate this paper as follows:
* Quality: 8/10 (the paper is well-structured, and the methodology is sound, but some minor errors and inconsistencies were found)
* Clarity: 7/10 (the paper is generally well-written, but some sections are difficult to follow, and additional explanations or examples would be helpful)
* Originality: 9/10 (the WPP method is innovative and provides a useful compromise between point estimators and bounds based on instrumental variables)
* Significance: 8/10 (the paper addresses an important problem in causal inference, and the results have the potential to impact the field)
Overall, I think this paper is a good contribution to the field of causal inference, and with some revisions to address the concerns mentioned above, it has the potential to be a strong paper.
