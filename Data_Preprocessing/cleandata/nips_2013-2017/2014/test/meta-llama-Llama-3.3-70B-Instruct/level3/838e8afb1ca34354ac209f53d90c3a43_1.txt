This paper proposes a novel approach to learning the graphical structure of multi-scale spatio-temporal systems by combining machine learning techniques with physically derived priors. The method introduces a hierarchical model that captures both local and global interactions, and uses a convection-diffusion process prior to regularize the model. The paper provides a thorough theoretical foundation, including proofs and derivations, and demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach through an application to a problem in exploration geophysics.
The strengths of the paper include its originality, technical soundness, and clarity of presentation. The authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, and motivate the need for a new approach. The theoretical developments are rigorous and well-supported by proofs and derivations. The application to exploration geophysics is well-chosen and demonstrates the potential of the method to address real-world problems.
However, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement. The paper assumes a linear chain model, which may be a limitation of the method. The notation could be improved, and some variables, such as $N_\lambda$, are not clearly defined. The paper could benefit from more context and comparison to related work, such as piecewise training and approximating structure at training time.
The results presented in the paper are promising, with the proposed method outperforming alternative approaches in terms of cross-validation error. The comparison to the ground truth model and the analysis of the impulse response functions provide additional evidence of the method's effectiveness.
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of machine learning and spatio-temporal modeling. With some revisions to address the weaknesses and areas for improvement, the paper has the potential to be a strong contribution to the conference.
