This paper presents a novel approach to learning the graphical structure of multi-scale spatio-temporal systems, which is a crucial problem in various fields such as exploration geophysics, atmospheric and ocean sciences. The authors propose a hierarchical graphical model that combines machine learning techniques with physically derived priors to capture the complex dynamics of these systems.
The paper's main strengths lie in its solid theoretical foundation, innovative use of physically derived priors, and efficient algorithms for estimating the model parameters. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the model's properties and demonstrate its advantages over alternative approaches, such as non-hierarchical VAR models and group LASSO. The experimental results on a synthetic dataset show that the proposed method can accurately recover the underlying graphical structure and replicate the dynamical properties of the original system.
However, the paper has some weaknesses, particularly in terms of the experimental evaluation. The authors only present results on a single synthetic dataset, which may not be representative of real-world scenarios. Additionally, the comparison with alternative methods is limited, and it would be beneficial to include more baselines and evaluate the proposed method on a wider range of datasets.
Furthermore, there are several typos and minor errors throughout the paper, such as errors in equations, propositions, and lemmas. While these do not affect the overall quality of the paper, they should be corrected to improve the clarity and presentation.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, originality, and significance. The authors provide a clear and well-organized presentation of their work, and the paper is well-written and easy to follow. The proposed method is novel and significant, and it has the potential to make a substantial impact in the field.
Overall, I recommend accepting this paper, despite some minor weaknesses. The authors' contributions are substantial, and their work has the potential to advance the state of the art in learning graphical structures for multi-scale spatio-temporal systems. With some revisions to address the minor errors and limitations, this paper can become an even stronger contribution to the field.
