This paper proposes a novel approach to action recognition by introducing a data-driven method for selecting discriminative attributes. However, the motivation for limiting relationships to pairwise is not clearly explained, which raises questions about the approach's validity. 
The introduction claims that human-labelled attributes are arbitrary and noisy, but the experimental results show that data-driven attributes are weaker than human-labelled attributes, contradicting this claim. This inconsistency undermines the paper's argument and requires further clarification.
The paper lacks clarity in explaining how the attributes have been used in applications and defining certain variables and equations, such as u_k^d, u^d, and lambda in equation 4. This lack of transparency makes it difficult to understand the methodology and replicate the results.
The originality of the proposed submodular objective function for attribute selection is unclear, and its distinction from other approaches, particularly [22] and [23], is not adequately discussed. This raises concerns about the paper's contribution to the field.
Despite these weaknesses, the paper is significant and of interest to those working in action recognition and attribute representations. The topic is relevant, and the approach has potential, but the paper needs refinement in writing and motivation to strengthen its argument.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper addresses a relevant and important topic in action recognition
* The proposed approach has potential for improving attribute selection
* The paper is well-structured and easy to follow
Arguments against acceptance:
* Lack of motivation for limiting relationships to pairwise
* Inconsistency between introduction and experimental results
* Lack of clarity in explaining methodology and defining variables
* Unclear originality of the proposed submodular objective function
Overall, while the paper has some strengths, its weaknesses outweigh its contributions, and it requires significant revisions to address the concerns mentioned above. With refinement in writing and motivation, this paper has the potential to make a more substantial contribution to the field.
