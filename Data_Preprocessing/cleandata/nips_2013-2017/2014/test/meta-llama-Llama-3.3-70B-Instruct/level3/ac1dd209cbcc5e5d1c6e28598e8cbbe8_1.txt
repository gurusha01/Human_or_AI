This paper proposes a novel approach to learning the graphical structure of multi-scale spatio-temporal systems, which is a crucial problem in various fields such as geology, geophysics, atmospheric sciences, and oceanography. The authors introduce a hierarchical graphical model that combines a global latent process and a local observed process, both of which are modeled as vector autoregressive (VAR) systems. The key innovation of this work is the incorporation of physically derived priors, specifically a convection-diffusion (C-D) process prior, to regularize the estimation of the graphical structure.
The paper is technically strong, showcasing state-of-the-art optimization techniques, including block coordinate descent and proximal splitting with Nesterov acceleration. The experimental setting is interesting, and the results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach over alternative methods, such as non-hierarchical VAR models and group LASSO. The authors also provide a thorough analysis of the estimated graphical structure and its robustness to initialization.
However, the paper is dense and notation-heavy, making it challenging to understand for non-experts. The experimental setting lacks discussion on the task, training/test split, and error measurement, which makes it unclear how the results were obtained. Additionally, the paper could benefit from more extensive experiments with multiple datasets to demonstrate the general applicability of the proposed model beyond the fluid-flow setting.
The proposed model makes assumptions, such as the 1-dimensional convection-diffusion assumption, which may not be applicable to all settings. The authors should discuss the limitations and potential applications of these assumptions. Furthermore, the paper has some technical issues, including typos, unbalanced brackets, and incorrect parentheses, which need to be corrected for clarity and readability.
In terms of quality, the paper is well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of the work. The paper is original, and the approach is novel, combining machine learning and physically derived priors to reconstruct the connectivity structure of multi-scale spatio-temporal systems.
The significance of the paper lies in its potential to advance the state of the art in learning graphical structures for complex systems. The results demonstrate the importance of incorporating physically derived priors in the estimation process, which can lead to more accurate and interpretable models. The paper has the potential to impact various fields, including geology, geophysics, atmospheric sciences, and oceanography, and could be used to inform decision-making in these areas.
