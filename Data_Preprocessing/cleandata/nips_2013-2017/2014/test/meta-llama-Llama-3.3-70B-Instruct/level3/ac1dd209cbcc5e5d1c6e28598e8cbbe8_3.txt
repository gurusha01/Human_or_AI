This paper proposes a novel approach to estimating causal effects in observational studies by exploiting observational conditional independencies to suggest "weak" paths in an unknown causal graph. The authors introduce a methodology to bound the average causal effect (ACE) of a variable X on a variable Y, which is a significant contribution to the field of causal inference. The paper is well-structured, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the background, methodology, and experiments.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a new methodology to bound the ACE, which is a significant contribution to the field of causal inference.
* The use of a linear programming approach to generate bounds on the ACE, which is a novel and efficient method.
* The introduction of a Bayesian framework to learn the parameters of the model, which allows for uncertainty quantification.
* The provision of a clear and detailed explanation of the methodology and experiments.
However, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement:
* The paper assumes that the reader is familiar with the concept of causal graphs, the basics of the do operator, and the basics of causal discovery algorithms, which may not be the case for all readers.
* The presentation of the underlying model is tied heavily to convection-diffusion equations, which may be difficult for some readers to understand.
* The paper could benefit from more intuitive explanations and examples to illustrate the methodology and its applications.
* The choice of relaxation parameters is not fully discussed, and the authors mention that they will look into ways to suggest plausible values for these parameters in future work.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, originality, and significance. The paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The paper is clearly written, and the authors provide enough information for the expert reader to reproduce the results. The methodology is novel and original, and it addresses a significant problem in the field of causal inference. The results are important and have the potential to impact the field of causal inference and observational studies.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel and significant contribution to the field of causal inference.
* The methodology is efficient and scalable.
* The paper provides a clear and detailed explanation of the methodology and experiments.
* The results are important and have the potential to impact the field of causal inference and observational studies.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The paper assumes a high level of background knowledge in causal graphs and causal discovery algorithms.
* The presentation of the underlying model is tied heavily to convection-diffusion equations, which may be difficult for some readers to understand.
* The choice of relaxation parameters is not fully discussed.
Overall, I recommend accepting the paper, as it makes a significant contribution to the field of causal inference and provides a novel and efficient methodology for estimating causal effects in observational studies. However, the authors should consider revising the paper to provide more intuitive explanations and examples, as well as discussing the choice of relaxation parameters in more detail.
