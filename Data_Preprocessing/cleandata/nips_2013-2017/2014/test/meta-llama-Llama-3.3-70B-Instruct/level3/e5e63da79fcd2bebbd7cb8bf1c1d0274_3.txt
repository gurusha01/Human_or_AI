This paper proposes a novel approach to face verification using deep convolutional neural networks with a landmark-based multi-scale approach. The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the LFW database, outperforming previous work. The approach builds upon existing techniques, with key differences including the use of verification objectives and selection of patches based on facial landmarks.
The paper is well-written and clearly explains the methodology and experiments. The authors introduce new ideas to extend the previous state-of-the-art system on face verification, with well-executed experiments. The use of a landmark-based multi-scale approach allows for more accurate and robust face verification.
The paper's strengths include its ability to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a challenging dataset, its clear and concise writing style, and its well-organized structure. The authors also provide a thorough analysis of their results and discuss the limitations of their approach.
However, the paper could benefit from more head-to-head comparisons to previous work and additional details on training and experimental settings. The authors could also provide more insight into the selection of patches based on facial landmarks and how this affects the performance of the system.
In terms of originality, the paper combines existing techniques to achieve state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating originality in its execution rather than its components. The paper is significant due to its contribution to the important problem of face verification, and could be further improved with evaluation on more challenging datasets like the YouTube Face database.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication. The paper's strengths outweigh its weaknesses, and it makes a significant contribution to the field of face verification.
