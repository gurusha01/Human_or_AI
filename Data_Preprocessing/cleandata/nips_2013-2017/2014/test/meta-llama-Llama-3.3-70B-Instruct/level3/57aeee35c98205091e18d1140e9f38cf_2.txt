This paper proposes a novel approach to estimate the average causal effect (ACE) in observational studies by relaxing the faithfulness assumption and using Entner's Rule 1 to identify instrumental variables. The method, called the Witness Protection Program (WPP), provides bounds on the ACE by introducing constraints on some causal paths and using a linear programming formulation. The authors also develop a Bayesian learning approach to handle uncertainty in the estimation of the bounds.
The paper is well-structured and clearly written, with a good introduction to the problem and a thorough explanation of the methodology. The use of Entner's Rule 1 to identify instrumental variables is a novel contribution, and the relaxation of the faithfulness assumption is a significant improvement over previous methods. The Bayesian learning approach is also a nice addition, as it allows for the handling of uncertainty in the estimation of the bounds.
However, there are some limitations to the paper. The experimental results are limited to synthetic data and a single real-world example, and it is not clear how well the method will perform on more complex datasets. Additionally, the choice of relaxation parameters is not well-motivated, and it is not clear how sensitive the results are to these parameters. The paper could also benefit from a more detailed comparison to other methods, such as those based on instrumental variables or regression discontinuity designs.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper scores well on quality, as the methodology is sound and the results are well-presented. The paper also scores well on significance, as the problem of estimating the ACE is an important one in many fields, and the method has the potential to be widely applicable. However, the paper could be improved in terms of clarity, as some of the notation and terminology may be unfamiliar to non-experts. The paper could also be improved in terms of originality, as some of the ideas and techniques are not entirely new.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, as it makes a significant contribution to the field of causal inference and has the potential to be widely applicable. However, I would suggest that the authors address some of the limitations mentioned above, such as providing more experimental results and comparing their method to other approaches.
