This paper presents a novel application of statistical learning and optimization to compute an equilibrium point in networked microfinance economies. The authors propose a framework for conducting interventions and apply it to large, networked microfinance economies. The paper is well-written, clearly presenting the problem and solution, including a simple algorithm for computing market-clearing interest rates in equilibrium.
The strengths of the paper include its originality, as it introduces a new problem and type of data that can benefit the community and inspire new approaches. The paper also provides a thorough analysis of the microfinance market, including the modeling of the market as a two-sided economy, the learning of parameters from real-world data, and the design of algorithms for computing equilibria.
However, the paper lacks clarity on the social welfare properties of the equilibrium, such as the reasonableness of the interest rates. The authors assume that the villages completely repay their loans, which may not be realistic in practice. Additionally, the paper could benefit from more discussion on the potential biases and limitations of the model, as well as the implications of the results for policy-making.
The paper deserves to be presented at NIPS as it introduces an important problem and type of data that can benefit the community and inspire new approaches. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the microfinance market and propose a framework for conducting interventions, which can be useful for policy-makers.
