This paper presents a novel algorithm for attribute selection using a combination of random walk, set-cover, and greedy optimization approaches, which is applied to activity recognition and shows improvements over existing methods and baselines in experimental results. The paper is well-written and provides a thorough related work section, although it could be improved by including the work of Fu et al. on multi-modal latent attribute learning.
The algorithm's motivation for one of the criteria used in the approach is unclear, specifically the requirement for similarity in discrimination over all pairs of classes. Additionally, the use of submodular optimization and the second criterion may complicate the optimization process and necessitate the use of the proposed techniques.
The experimental results are solid, but some details are missing, such as how hyperparameters are set and the source of some numbers in the tables. However, the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in improving activity recognition performance.
The paper's strengths include its novel combination of techniques, thorough experimental evaluation, and well-written presentation. However, its weaknesses include the unclear motivation for one of the criteria and the potential complexity of the optimization process.
Arguments for acceptance include:
* The paper presents a novel and effective approach to attribute selection for activity recognition
* The experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods and baselines
* The paper is well-written and provides a thorough related work section
Arguments against acceptance include:
* The motivation for one of the criteria used in the approach is unclear
* The use of submodular optimization and the second criterion may complicate the optimization process
* Some details are missing from the experimental results, such as hyperparameter settings and data sources.
Overall, I recommend accepting the paper, as its strengths outweigh its weaknesses and it presents a significant contribution to the field of activity recognition. However, the authors should be encouraged to clarify the motivation for the unclear criterion and provide more details about the experimental results. 
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The paper is a complete piece of work, and the authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of the work.
The clarity of the paper is good, and it is well-organized. The paper adequately informs the reader, and a superbly written paper provides enough information for the expert reader to reproduce its results.
The originality of the paper is high, as it presents a novel combination of techniques for attribute selection. The paper is significantly different from previous contributions, and it advances the state of the art in a demonstrable way.
The significance of the paper is also high, as it addresses a difficult problem in activity recognition and provides a unique solution. The paper provides unique data, unique conclusions on existing data, or a unique theoretical or pragmatic approach. Overall, the paper is a significant contribution to the field, and its results are likely to be used by practitioners or researchers in the future.
