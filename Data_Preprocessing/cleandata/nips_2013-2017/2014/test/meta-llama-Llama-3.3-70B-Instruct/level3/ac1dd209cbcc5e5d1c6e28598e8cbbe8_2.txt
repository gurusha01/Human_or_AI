This paper introduces a novel approach to analyzing spatio-temporal dynamic systems at multiple scales, providing a significant contribution to the field. The proposed graphical model, which combines a hierarchy of VAR models with a physically derived prior, offers a unique perspective on modeling dynamic systems. The paper is well-written, and the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through an application to a class of problems in exploration geophysics.
The strengths of the paper include its original contribution to the literature, the clarity of the writing, and the thorough evaluation of the proposed method. The authors provide a detailed explanation of the model, its components, and the algorithms used for estimation. The results presented in the paper demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach over alternative methods, such as non-hierarchical VAR models and group LASSO.
However, there are some weaknesses that need to be addressed. One of the main limitations of the paper is the lack of a clear discussion on the relationships between the proposed penalization term and existing methods like LASSO, elastic net, and SCAD. The authors should provide a more detailed comparison of their approach with other regularization techniques to strengthen the paper's impact and significance.
Another area for improvement is the evaluation of the proposed method. While the authors provide a thorough evaluation of their approach, they could benefit from a more comprehensive comparison with other methods, including a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of each approach.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets most of the criteria. The paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The paper is also well-organized, and the writing is clear and concise. However, the authors could improve the paper by providing a more detailed discussion of the relationships between their approach and existing methods.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, but with some revisions to address the weaknesses mentioned above. The paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field, and with some improvements, it could be even stronger.
