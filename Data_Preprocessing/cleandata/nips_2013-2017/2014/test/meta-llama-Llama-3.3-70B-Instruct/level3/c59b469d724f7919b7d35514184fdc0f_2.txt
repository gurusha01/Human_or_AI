This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the consistency of weighted majority votes in the context of expert voting. The authors revisit the classical decision-theoretic problem from a statistical learning perspective, examining the consistency of the optimal Nitzan-Paroush weighted majority rule. The paper is well-structured, and the writing is clear and concise.
The main results of the paper are twofold. First, the authors provide sharp error estimates for the optimal rule when the expert competences are known. They show that the probability of error is controlled by the committee potential, which is a function of the expert competences. Second, the authors analyze the case where the expert competences are unknown and must be estimated empirically. They provide frequentist and Bayesian analyses, showing that the Bayesian approach admits a simple, provably optimal empirical decision rule.
The paper has several strengths. The analysis is rigorous and technically sound, with careful attention to detail. The authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the main results, making the paper accessible to a broad audience. The paper also raises several interesting open problems, which will likely stimulate future research in the area.
However, the paper also has some weaknesses. The assumption that the expert competences are independent and identically distributed may not be realistic in practice. The authors acknowledge this limitation but do not provide a clear direction for how to relax this assumption. Additionally, the paper could benefit from more numerical experiments to illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithms.
In terms of originality and significance, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of expert voting. The analysis of the consistency of weighted majority votes is novel and provides new insights into the problem. The paper also raises important questions about the limitations of current approaches and the need for more realistic models of expert competence.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication. The paper is well-written, and the analysis is rigorous and technically sound. The main results are significant and provide new insights into the problem of expert voting. While the paper has some limitations, it raises important questions and provides a clear direction for future research.
