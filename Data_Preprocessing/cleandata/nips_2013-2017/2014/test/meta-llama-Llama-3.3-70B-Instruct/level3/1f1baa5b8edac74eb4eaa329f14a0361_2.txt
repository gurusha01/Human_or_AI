This paper proposes a novel approach to the problem of weighted expert voting, revisiting the classical decision-theoretic problem from a statistical learning perspective. The authors examine the consistency of the optimal Nitzan-Paroush weighted majority rule, providing sharp error estimates for the optimal rule when the expert competence levels are known. They also address the case where the competence levels are unknown, presenting both frequentist and Bayesian analyses.
The paper is well-written and easy to read, making it clear and understandable. The work is novel in its explicit handling of attribute unreliability, exploring a lesser-studied problem in the field. The proposed method, although not new, introduces an interesting idea of modeling unreliability to improve zero-shot learning performance, making it significant and thought-provoking for researchers.
The quality of the proposed ideas is supported by empirical analysis, but lacks qualitative analysis and clarity on parameter selection. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the problem, including a discussion of related work and the presentation of several theorems and lemmas. However, the paper could benefit from a more detailed explanation of the parameter selection process and a more in-depth qualitative analysis of the results.
The significance of the paper lies in its ability to address a difficult problem in a better way than previous research. The authors provide a unique approach to handling unknown expert competences, using both frequentist and Bayesian methods. The paper also raises several challenging open problems, including the computation of the probability of error induced by the Bayesian empirical decision rule.
In terms of originality, the paper presents a novel combination of familiar techniques, applying statistical learning principles to the problem of weighted expert voting. The authors also provide a thorough review of related work, highlighting the differences between their approach and previous research.
Overall, the paper is a valuable contribution to the field, providing a new perspective on the problem of weighted expert voting and introducing several interesting ideas and open problems. While there are some areas for improvement, the paper is well-written and easy to follow, making it a worthwhile read for researchers in the field.
