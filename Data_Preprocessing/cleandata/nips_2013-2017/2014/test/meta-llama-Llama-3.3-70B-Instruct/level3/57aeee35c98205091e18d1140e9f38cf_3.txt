This paper introduces the Witness Protection Program (WPP) algorithm, a novel approach to estimating causal effects in the presence of potential confounding variables. The WPP algorithm relaxes the standard faithfulness assumption in causal inference, allowing for possible violations and providing bounds on the average causal effect (ACE) instead of point estimates. The algorithm uses a linear programming framework and Bayesian inference to generate these bounds.
The paper is technically sound, and the approach is a novel combination of familiar techniques. The use of relaxation parameters to constrain unfaithful interactions and the linear programming framework to solve for the resulting bounds is a significant contribution. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the methodology and the underlying assumptions.
However, the experimental evaluation is poor, and the relevance and proper interpretation of the output distribution over bounds remain unclear. The comparison of the WPP method with its competitors using the 'bias' evaluation metric is meaningless, and the practical performance on the influenza data set is worryingly weak. The authors claim that the WPP approach should be used in regular practice to complement other default tools in observational studies, but the current implementation seems unlikely to represent the finished article for practitioners.
The significance of the paper lies in the ideas and direction it brings to the problem, but the practical efficacy of the back-substitution process in refining bounds is doubted. The algorithmic steps and subsequent modifications are hard to follow due to a lack of explanation of certain details. The paper could be improved with more detailed explanations and a more thorough experimental evaluation.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper introduces a novel approach to estimating causal effects in the presence of potential confounding variables.
* The WPP algorithm relaxes the standard faithfulness assumption, allowing for possible violations and providing bounds on the ACE.
* The approach is a novel combination of familiar techniques, and the use of relaxation parameters and linear programming framework is a significant contribution.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The experimental evaluation is poor, and the relevance and proper interpretation of the output distribution over bounds remain unclear.
* The comparison of the WPP method with its competitors using the 'bias' evaluation metric is meaningless.
* The practical performance on the influenza data set is worryingly weak, and the current implementation seems unlikely to represent the finished article for practitioners.
Overall, the paper has some significant contributions, but the experimental evaluation and practical performance need to be improved before it can be considered a strong candidate for acceptance.
