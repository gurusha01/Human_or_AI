This paper proposes a framework for model comparison of Bayesian models on behavioral data, addressing issues of non-identifiability and outlining constraints to make each term identifiable. The article touches on a major issue in cognitive science and psychology, which is the identifiability of internal representations and processes, a problem that has hindered the widespread adoption of the Bayesian framework.
The paper's framework for model comparison is not significantly different from previous work, such as Pitt, Myung, and Zhang (2002) and Navarro, Pitt, and Myung (2004). The authors make arbitrary assumptions that are unclear and lack justification, such as the definition of $p_{meas}$ and the parameters in Equation 12. The paper should discuss and justify these assumptions to provide a clearer understanding of the framework.
The paper's strengths include its ability to address a major issue in cognitive science and psychology, and its attempt to provide a framework for model comparison. However, the paper's weaknesses, including its lack of originality and unclear assumptions, outweigh its strengths.
Here is a list of arguments pro and con acceptance:
Pro:
* The paper addresses a major issue in cognitive science and psychology.
* The paper attempts to provide a framework for model comparison.
Con:
* The paper's framework is not significantly different from previous work.
* The authors make arbitrary assumptions that are unclear and lack justification.
* The paper does not provide a clear understanding of the framework due to unclear assumptions.
Overall, I would not recommend accepting this paper in its current form. The authors need to address the issues mentioned above, particularly the lack of originality and unclear assumptions, to provide a clearer and more convincing framework for model comparison.
Quality: 6/10
The paper is technically sound, but the arbitrary assumptions made by the authors lack justification, which affects the overall quality of the paper.
Clarity: 7/10
The paper is well-organized, but the unclear assumptions and lack of discussion on these assumptions affect the clarity of the paper.
Originality: 4/10
The paper's framework is not significantly different from previous work, which affects its originality.
Significance: 8/10
The paper addresses a major issue in cognitive science and psychology, which makes it significant. However, the paper's lack of originality and unclear assumptions affect its overall significance.
