This paper proposes a novel approach to contextual sentiment analysis using Global Belief Recursive Neural Networks (GB-RNNs). The authors introduce a feedbackward step in the recursive neural network architecture, allowing the model to capture contextual information and improve performance on aspect-specific sentiment classification tasks. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear motivation for their approach, as well as a thorough explanation of the model and its components.
The strengths of the paper include the novelty of the approach, the thorough evaluation of the model on a benchmark dataset, and the comparison to state-of-the-art baselines. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the model's performance and the impact of different hyperparameters and training settings. The use of hybrid word vector representations, combining unsupervised and supervised learning, is also a notable contribution.
However, there are some weaknesses to the paper. One major concern is the lack of exploration of the discrepancy between the identified solution and the original formulation, as well as the lack of clear guidelines on when to terminate the algorithm. Additionally, the experimental results show some strange behavior in the rank of the solution as it converges, which is not fully discussed and requires further explanation. The paper would benefit from a more in-depth analysis of the impact of the modified objective function and the behavior of the algorithm.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of the work. The paper is clearly written, well-organized, and provides enough information for an expert reader to reproduce the results.
The originality of the paper is high, as it introduces a novel approach to contextual sentiment analysis. The paper is significantly different from previous contributions, and the authors provide a clear explanation of how their work differs from related research. The significance of the paper is also high, as it addresses a difficult problem in natural language processing and provides a novel solution that advances the state of the art.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, as it makes a significant contribution to the field of natural language processing and provides a novel solution to a challenging problem. However, I would suggest that the authors address the weaknesses mentioned above and provide a more detailed analysis of the model's behavior and the impact of the modified objective function.
