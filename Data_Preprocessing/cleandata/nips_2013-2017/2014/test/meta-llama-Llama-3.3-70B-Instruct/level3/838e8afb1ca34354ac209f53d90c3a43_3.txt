This paper proposes a novel approach to learning the graphical structure of multi-scale spatio-temporal systems using a hierarchy of vector auto-regressive (VAR) models. The authors introduce a physically derived prior based on convection-diffusion processes to regularize the model and improve its ability to capture large-scale dynamics. The paper presents a detailed analysis of the model, including its formulation, optimization, and application to a real-world problem in exploration geophysics.
The strengths of the paper include its originality, clarity, and significance. The proposed approach is novel and combines machine learning techniques with physically derived priors to address a challenging problem in multiple fields. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the model, its components, and the optimization algorithms used to estimate its parameters. The application of the model to a real-world problem demonstrates its potential to provide meaningful insights and improve our understanding of complex systems.
The weaknesses of the paper include some flaws in the theoretical analysis and the lack of comparison with other state-of-the-art methods. The authors provide a detailed analysis of the model, but some of the assumptions and derivations seem to be oversimplified or incorrect. Additionally, the paper could benefit from a more comprehensive comparison with other methods, such as independent process analysis and ARPCA, to demonstrate the advantages and limitations of the proposed approach.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the proposed approach is novel and significant. However, the authors should address the weaknesses in the theoretical analysis and provide a more comprehensive comparison with other methods to strengthen the paper.
