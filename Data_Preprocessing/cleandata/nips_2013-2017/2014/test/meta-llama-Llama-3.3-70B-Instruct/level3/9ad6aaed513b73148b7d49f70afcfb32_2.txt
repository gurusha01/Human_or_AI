This paper proposes a novel optimization method called SAGA, which improves upon existing incremental gradient algorithms such as SAG, SDCA, and SVRG. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the relationship between these methods and demonstrate the effectiveness of SAGA through a series of experiments.
The paper is well-written and clearly presents the concept of SAGA, making it easy to follow and understand. The methodology is validated through proofs and experiments, demonstrating its performance and reproducibility. The proposed method often finds better solutions than other optimization techniques, and its significance lies in its application to Markov Random Fields with polynomial energies, an important problem in fields like Computer Vision.
The strengths of the paper include its importance, clear presentation, and diverse experiments. However, one weakness is the need for more discussion on the trade-off between solution quality and computational time. The authors are encouraged to clarify the reported running times and address the potential weakness of the method being slower for real-world problems despite yielding better solutions.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of the work. The paper is a complete piece of work, and the methodology is thoroughly explained.
The originality of the paper lies in its novel combination of familiar techniques, and it is clear how this work differs from previous contributions. The related work is adequately referenced, and the authors provide a unified view of the relationship between SAGA and other fast incremental gradient methods.
The significance of the paper is evident, and the results are important for practitioners and researchers in the field. The paper addresses a difficult problem in a better way than previous research and advances the state of the art in a demonstrable way.
