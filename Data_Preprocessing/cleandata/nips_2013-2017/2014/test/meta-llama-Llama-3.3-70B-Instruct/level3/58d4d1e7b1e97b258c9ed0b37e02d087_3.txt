This paper proposes a Bayesian model of perception that combines robustness and mathematical convenience, handling various situations while being computationally tractable. The model is identifiable, allowing for easy evaluation and distinction of parameter estimates. However, its novelty is incremental due to similar existing work in the literature.
The paper's main contribution is the analysis of the consistency of the Nitzan-Paroush optimal decision rule, which is a weighted majority vote. The authors provide sharp error estimates for the optimal rule when the expert competence levels are known. They also present two solutions for the case where the competence levels are unknown: a frequentist and a Bayesian approach.
The frequentist approach does not admit an optimal empirical decision rule, but the authors analyze empirical decision rules in various settings, including high-confidence and low-confidence regimes. The Bayesian approach, on the other hand, admits a simple, provably optimal empirical decision rule, but the authors are unable to compute or estimate the probability of error induced by this rule.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of their results. The proofs are also well-organized and easy to follow. However, the paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the related work and the significance of the results.
One of the main strengths of the paper is its ability to provide a unified framework for analyzing the consistency of weighted majority votes. The authors also raise several interesting open problems, including the computation of the probability of error induced by the Bayesian optimal decision rule.
However, one of the limitations of the paper is that it assumes a simplistic model of expert competence, where each expert has a fixed probability of making a correct prediction. In practice, expert competence may be more complex and nuanced, and the model may not capture all the relevant factors.
Overall, the paper is a solid contribution to the field, and its results have the potential to be useful in a variety of applications, including machine learning and decision theory. However, the authors could improve the paper by providing more context and discussion of the related work, as well as by addressing some of the limitations of the model.
