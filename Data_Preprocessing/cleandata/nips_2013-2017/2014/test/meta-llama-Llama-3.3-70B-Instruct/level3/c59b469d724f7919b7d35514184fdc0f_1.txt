This paper proposes a recommendation algorithm based on reinforcement learning and introduces a theoretical framework to analyze the algorithm. The algorithm performs well under certain assumptions, and the paper's contribution is its theoretical analysis of online recommendation systems, which is a meaningful addition to the existing literature.
The paper's assumption that users are grouped into typical user types and likable items are clearly separated may not be realistic. The algorithm does not utilize this information effectively, and the proposed framework may not be applicable when user or item clusters overlap. Alternative approaches, such as bottom-up clustering, may be more effective in handling complex user-item relationships.
The choice of alpha value in the algorithm is unclear, and experimental results varying alpha would be useful to determine its impact on performance. Similarly, the definition of epsilon values in the algorithm may not be optimal, and experimental results comparing them to constant values would be helpful.
The paper has some minor issues, including distinguishability of lines in Figure 1(b) and grammatical errors in the text. However, these issues do not detract from the overall quality of the paper.
The strengths of the paper include its thorough theoretical analysis and the introduction of a new framework for analyzing online recommendation systems. The paper also raises important questions about the consistency of weighted majority votes and the challenges of handling unknown expert competences.
The weaknesses of the paper include its reliance on unrealistic assumptions and the lack of experimental results to support the algorithm's performance. Additionally, the paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the limitations of the proposed framework and potential avenues for future research.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication, as it makes a significant contribution to the field of online recommendation systems and raises important questions about the consistency of weighted majority votes. However, I would suggest that the authors address the minor issues mentioned above and provide more experimental results to support the algorithm's performance.
