This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the consistency of weighted majority votes in the context of attribute-based zero-shot learning. The authors propose a method using random forests to predict unseen classes from attribute vectors, taking into account the reliability of attribute detectors. The paper is well-written, elegant, and theoretically sound, with strong results on three standard datasets and thorough ablation studies.
The main strengths of the paper are:
* The authors effectively address a fundamental problem in zero-shot learning, making the paper strong, interesting, and sound.
* The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on several attribute datasets and can be extended to handle training with a few examples of test categories.
* The paper provides a thorough analysis of the consistency of the Nitzan-Paroush optimal decision rule, including sharp error estimates for the optimal rule.
* The authors present two solutions to the problem of unknown expert competences: a frequentist and a Bayesian approach.
The main weaknesses of the paper are:
* The paper assumes that the expert competences are known or can be estimated accurately, which may not always be the case in practice.
* The authors do not provide a non-trivial estimate for the probability of error induced by the Bayesian empirical decision rule, which is an important open problem.
* The paper could benefit from more discussion on the practical implications of the results and the potential applications of the proposed method.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise presentation of their results. The paper is suitable for publication in a top-tier conference like NIPS.

Significance: 9/10
Recommendation: Accept with minor revisions. The authors should address the minor issues mentioned above, including providing more discussion on the practical implications of the results and the potential applications of the proposed method. Additionally, the authors should consider providing a non-trivial estimate for the probability of error induced by the Bayesian empirical decision rule.
