This paper proposes a novel approach to learning the graphical structure of multi-scale spatio-temporal systems using a hierarchy of vector auto-regressive (VAR) models. The authors introduce a physically derived prior based on convection-diffusion processes to regularize the model and capture the large-scale dynamics of the system. The paper is well-motivated, and the proposed approach is original and significant.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a new and innovative approach to modeling multi-scale spatio-temporal systems, which combines machine learning and physically derived priors.
* The development of efficient algorithms for estimating the model parameters through a set of relaxations and regularization.
* The application of the method to a real-world problem in exploration geophysics, which demonstrates the advantages of the approach over alternative methods.
However, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement:
* The paper could benefit from a clearer and more concise introduction to the problem and the proposed approach. The current introduction is somewhat lengthy and dense.
* The evaluation of the paper is mostly based on a single application, and it would be beneficial to see more extensive experiments and comparisons with other methods.
* Some of the notation and terminology used in the paper may be unfamiliar to non-experts, and additional explanations or references would be helpful.
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the limitations and potential extensions of the proposed approach.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper addresses the criteria of quality, clarity, originality, and significance. The paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The paper is clearly written, although some improvements could be made to the introduction and notation. The approach is novel and significant, and it has the potential to make a substantial impact in the field.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel and innovative approach to modeling multi-scale spatio-temporal systems.
* The approach combines machine learning and physically derived priors, which is a unique and promising direction.
* The paper demonstrates the advantages of the approach over alternative methods in a real-world application.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The paper could benefit from a clearer and more concise introduction.
* The evaluation of the paper is mostly based on a single application, and more extensive experiments and comparisons would be beneficial.
* Some of the notation and terminology used in the paper may be unfamiliar to non-experts, and additional explanations or references would be helpful.
Overall, I recommend accepting the paper, but with some revisions to address the areas for improvement mentioned above.
