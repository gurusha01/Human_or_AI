This paper revisits the classical decision-theoretic problem of weighted expert voting from a statistical learning perspective, examining the consistency of the optimal Nitzan-Paroush weighted majority rule. The authors provide sharp error estimates for the optimal rule when the expert competence levels are known and analyze the case when these levels are unknown, presenting both frequentist and Bayesian approaches.
The paper's main strengths lie in its thorough analysis of the weighted majority algorithm under different settings. The authors establish consistency results for both known and unknown competence levels, providing upper and lower bounds on the error rate of the aggregator. The use of non-standard proof techniques, such as the Kearns-Saul inequality, adds to the paper's technical soundness.
However, the paper's novelty in terms of theoretical contribution is limited, as it relies on standard tools for estimators and analyses. A significant practical drawback is the assumption of access to labeled samples for estimating competence levels, which is not required in other methods like the Dawid-Skene method.
The weighted majority method has an advantage over the Dawid-Skene model in making no modeling assumptions, and a theoretical analysis comparing the two methods could strengthen the paper. The authors pose several challenging open problems, including the computation of the probability of error induced by the Bayesian empirical decision rule.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis. The authors are careful in evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of their work. The paper is clearly written, well-organized, and adequately informs the reader.
The originality of the paper lies in its combination of familiar techniques to address a classic problem from a new perspective. While the problems and approaches are not entirely new, the paper's contribution to the field is significant, and its results are likely to be useful to practitioners and researchers.
The significance of the paper lies in its ability to advance the state of the art in a demonstrable way. The authors address a difficult problem in a better way than previous research, providing unique insights and conclusions on existing data.
