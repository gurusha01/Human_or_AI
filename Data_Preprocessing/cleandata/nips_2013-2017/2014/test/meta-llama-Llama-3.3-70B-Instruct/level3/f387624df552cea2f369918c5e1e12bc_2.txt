This paper proposes a novel approach to learning the graphical structure of multi-scale spatio-temporal systems, which is a crucial problem in various fields such as exploration geophysics, atmospheric and ocean sciences. The authors introduce a hierarchical graphical model that combines a global system with local interactions, and derive a physically motivated prior based on convection-diffusion processes. The model is estimated using a combination of relaxations and regularization techniques, including a novel penalty term that promotes sparsity and physically meaningful solutions.
The paper has several strengths. Firstly, the proposed approach is innovative and addresses a significant problem in the field. The use of physically derived priors is a key aspect of the method, and the authors demonstrate its importance in reconstructing the graphical structure of the system. The experimental results are also impressive, showing that the proposed method outperforms alternative approaches in terms of cross-validation error and impulse response functions.
However, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement. The paper is not well-organized, and the notation is sometimes imprecise and confusing. The authors could benefit from a clearer and more concise presentation of their ideas. Additionally, the numerical experiments section is limited, and it would be beneficial to include more comparisons with benchmark algorithms and a more detailed analysis of the results.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper addresses the criteria of quality, clarity, originality, and significance. The proposed approach is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The paper is clearly written, although some improvements are needed in terms of organization and notation. The approach is novel and combines familiar techniques in a new way, and the authors provide a clear explanation of how their work differs from previous contributions. The results are significant, and the paper demonstrates the potential of the proposed method in various applications.
