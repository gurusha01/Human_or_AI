This paper presents a novel model for capturing spatio-temporal dynamics, comprising a global latent process that governs interactions between high-level clusters of points, as well as a local observed process where interactions are isolated within each cluster. Both processes can be viewed as vector autoregressive models. The authors demonstrate the application of their method to modeling data from a numerical simulation of a geologic model of fluid flow beneath the earth's surface.
Overall, the paper exhibits technical strength and showcases state-of-the-art optimization techniques. However, the dense and notation-heavy presentation made it challenging to follow. Certain topics, unconventional for the NIPS conference, would benefit from more intuitive explanations. For instance, the approximation of the latent process using a 1-dimensional convection-diffusion system is not clearly motivated, and the implications of this approximation on the captured behavior are unclear.
The experimental setup appears intriguing, but additional details on the task would be beneficial, such as the methodology used for the training/test split and error measurement. The reported errors are given as percentages, but the denominator is not specified.
More comprehensive experiments, including multiple datasets, would be valuable to assess the general applicability of the proposed model beyond the specific fluid-flow setting. Although spatio-temporal processes with multiscale phenomena are common, the model relies on assumptions like the 1-dimensional convection-diffusion assumption, which facilitates optimization but may not be universally applicable. A discussion on the potential applicability of these assumptions to other settings would be welcome.
Additionally, several minor errors were noted, including typos in Section 3, an unbalanced bracket on line 184, and incorrect parentheses on page 5, line 268. Furthermore, the terms "nonhierarchal" and "hierarchal" should be replaced with "nonhierarchical" and "hierarchical", respectively.
In summary, this is a technically sound paper that proposes a multiscale spatiotemporal model for flow through porous media, featuring an interesting optimization algorithm and results.
