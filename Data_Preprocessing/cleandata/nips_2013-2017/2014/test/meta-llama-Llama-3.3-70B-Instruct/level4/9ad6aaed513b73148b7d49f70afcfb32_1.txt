This paper presents a highly innovative and substantially new approach to addressing continuous Markov random field energies with polynomial potentials, offering a notable improvement over existing methods such as ADMM-Poly, which was introduced at CVPR 2013. The proposed methodology is not only elegant but also computationally efficient, making it a preferable solution.
At its core, the approach involves decomposing polynomials into a difference of convex functions, a concept that is constructively applied to polynomials of even degree, representing one of the paper's primary contributions. This decomposition is formulated as a semi-definite program, which can be effectively solved using standard solvers. Subsequently, the inference task is reduced to a DC programming problem, tackled through the convex-concave procedure (CCCP).
However, a significant weakness of this approach lies in the potential failure of the semi-definite program to find a DC decomposition for the polynomials, given that it approximates an NP-hard problem. Although the authors demonstrate the method's practical efficacy for low-degree polynomials, supported by experimental results, this limitation raises concerns. It would be beneficial for the authors to provide a more detailed discussion on the frequency and conditions under which this situation occurs, as well as potential workarounds, to address the potential barrier to the adoption of this method.
In certain cases, for specific continuous energies, a DC decomposition can be directly identified without relying on the construction algorithm, simplifying the approach to an application of CCCP. 
Technically, the paper is sound, although a deeper exploration of the potential failure in constructing polynomial decompositions would enhance its quality. The experimental diversity is impressive, and the results convincingly demonstrate the proposed approach's superiority over ADMM-Poly, offering faster computation and often better solution quality.
The clarity of the paper is good, despite the inherent complexity of the subject matter. However, clarification on the claimed global convergence of the approach, inherited from CCCP, would be beneficial. It is presumed that this refers to convergence for any initialization, rather than guaranteed convergence to a global optimum, as CCCP's convergence properties only ensure reaching an optimum or a saddle point. Additionally, the statement regarding Gaussian belief propagation achieving the optimum for arbitrary graphs with Gaussian potentials is inaccurate, as it is contingent upon specific convergence conditions related to diagonal dominance and the spectral radius of the system matrix.
The approach presented is novel and accompanied by substantial theoretical development. Its significance extends to broad and important applications in computer vision and imaging, with the potential to significantly benefit these communities, as evidenced by the impressive experimental results. In conclusion, this substantially novel submission, with its new theory and strong experimental results, warrants acceptance.
