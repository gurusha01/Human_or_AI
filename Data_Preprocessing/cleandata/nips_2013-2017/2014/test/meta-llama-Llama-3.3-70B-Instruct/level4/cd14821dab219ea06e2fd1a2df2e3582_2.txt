This manuscript explores the challenge of aggregating expert predictions in a classification context, deviating from the traditional sequential and adversarial framework by focusing on static predictions with established or estimated competencies. Specifically, the authors derive conditions under which the Nitzan-Paroush weighted majority rule exhibits consistency.
The manuscript is both well-structured and engaging, presenting rigorous and elegant results. The authors offer substantial intuitive insights and highlight intriguing open questions throughout their discussion. Notably, they demonstrate that conventional concentration of measure techniques, such as Hoeffding's and Bernstein's inequalities, are insufficient for their purposes, instead leveraging sharper, albeit less commonly used, bounds.
The analysis provides a clear and compelling examination of the weighted majority rule in a non-sequential setting, yielding interesting and well-substantiated conclusions.
