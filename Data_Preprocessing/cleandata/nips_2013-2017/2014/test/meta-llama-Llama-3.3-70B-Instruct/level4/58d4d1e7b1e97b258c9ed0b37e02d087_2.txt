This manuscript addresses a crucial issue in cognitive modeling, namely model identifiability, and presents its ideas in a clear and well-written manner. However, the research relies on a lengthy list of assumptions that the reader must accept and understand, which somewhat diminishes the impact of the key findings. Despite this, the methodology is innovative and interesting, making the work worthy of presentation at NIPS.
Regarding the key results, the interchangeability of sensory and motor noise in section 4.1 is not entirely surprising, and it would be beneficial to indicate which condition differences are statistically reliable. Additionally, in section 4.2, it is essential to demonstrate that the model can recover the fact that the reference observer did not have a slow-speed prior.
Several specific points require clarification. On line 106, the stimulus is drawn from a discrete distribution despite being a continuous variable, which may be due to typical experimental design but should be explained. The log-stimulus transform in Equation 2, motivated by psychophysical laws, imposes strong constraints on inference, suggesting that the success of the work may be largely due to this transform. The constraints in Equation 4 and the maximization of differential entropy do not guarantee that Equation 3 will yield a unimodal distribution, as the fit could potentially result in a bimodal distribution.
Furthermore, it is unclear why the observer's prior should favor the lattice representation over a uniform representation, especially given the prior's width relative to the true range. Figure 1 is confusing and could be improved by integrating Figure 1b into Figure 1a and removing p_est(s^*|x). The conditions under which Equation 14 is approximately correct, including the applicability of Stirling's approximation and the equality of E[xlogx] and E[x]logE[x], require comment. The derivation of Equation 15, following the abandonment of priors on Î¸ and several questionable approximations, seems justified primarily by its intuitive outcome.
Additionally, it is unclear which density is being referred to on line 262, and the statement on line 365 that learning of priors does not matter in 2AFC requires further explanation. Overall, while the approach is innovative and the problem is important, the results are not overwhelmingly convincing.
