This paper presents an intriguing approach to leveraging excess observations in regularized linear inverse problems to reduce computational costs. By carefully smoothing the original nonsmooth regularizer, such as the ell_1 norm, the authors demonstrate that it is possible to decrease computational iterations without compromising the sample complexity bound for recovery. The paper is well-structured and clearly written, making the idea accessible to readers.
However, upon closer examination, several practical concerns arise. The proposed method of utilizing excess observations to facilitate smoothing may come at the cost of potentially compromising the recovery probability, as evident in the success recovery bound (eta in Fact 2.3). Notably, the experiments conducted by the authors do not assess the probability of "exact" recovery, instead relying on a predefined measure of "closeness" to the true signal to evaluate the algorithm's performance. Although the authors attempt to mitigate potential failures by decreasing the smoothing parameter, this approach seems ad hoc and insufficient.
A more comprehensive analysis of the impact of aggressive smoothing on the recovery probability would be beneficial. As suggested by the bound in Fact 2.3, there may be an inherent tradeoff that warrants further investigation. Furthermore, the experimental design could be improved by comparing the proposed method to a conventional constant smoothing algorithm, where the number of samples required for high-probability recovery is computed and redundant data is randomly discarded. This would provide a more nuanced understanding of the relative strengths and weaknesses of the two approaches.
Another critical issue that requires attention is the practicality of the proposed method. The analysis and experiments assume prior knowledge of the true signal, which is not typically available in practice. It is essential to develop strategies for applying aggressive smoothing without being overly aggressive, particularly when the true signal is unknown. The need to tune the smoothing parameter, which is a common practice, raises questions about the novelty and significance of the proposed approach. If the key takeaway is that the smoothing parameter should depend on the sample size, then it is crucial to provide guidance on how to implement this without relying on extensive prior knowledge of the true signal.
In conclusion, while the paper presents an interesting idea and is well-written, there are several critical issues that need to be addressed, both theoretically and experimentally. A more thorough examination of the recovery probability, improved experimental design, and consideration of practical concerns are necessary to fully appreciate the potential benefits and limitations of the proposed approach.
