This paper presents a novel approach to estimating the bound of the average causal effect (ACE) from variable X to variable Y, leveraging Entner's Rule 1 in its inverse direction, relaxing the faithfulness assumption to allow for path-cancellation, and introducing inequality constraints. The authors formulate a computational scheme for the ACE bound using linear programming based on these principles. Although the algorithm has not been optimized, the resulting bounds appear narrow and accurate compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.
Quality
The authors have made an effort to develop a new method for deriving more accurate ACE bounds, combining several feasible principles to achieve tighter bounds. The paper's content is interesting in this regard. However, some criteria for defining the bounds are not thoroughly explained, particularly the validity of applying Entner's Rule 1 in the inverse direction. The authors should explicitly assume the structure depicted in Fig.2 and provide a clear explanation and discussion. Additionally, the paper lacks generic criteria for choosing appropriate parameters for relaxation, which significantly impact the bound results. The principle for determining these parameters should be further investigated and included in the work.
Clarity
The paper's theoretical explanation is generally comprehensive, except for the essential discussion mentioned above. However, the experimental results are not well described, and the actual implementation of the algorithm is not comprehensively explained. The definition of parameters in Table 1 (possibly Table 5) is not clearly provided. Furthermore, there are some typos, such as the reference to an algorithm table on page 6, which is not present, and the summary of results in Table 5 on page 8, which is not found (possibly referring to Table 1).
Originality
The problem setting addressed in this paper has been explored in earlier work, as acknowledged by the authors. Consequently, the paper's scope does not exhibit strong originality. The idea of combining three concepts in a unified framework contains some originality, but the validity of this combination is not clearly discussed, as mentioned earlier.
Significance
The method shows some significance in deriving tighter ACE bounds. Nevertheless, its performance has been evaluated through limited experiments, and its generality has not been rigorously assessed in both theory and extensive experiments. The paper addresses an important problem of evaluating the bound of causal relation strength, but the validity of the presented idea should be more thoroughly described in both theoretical and experimental contexts.
