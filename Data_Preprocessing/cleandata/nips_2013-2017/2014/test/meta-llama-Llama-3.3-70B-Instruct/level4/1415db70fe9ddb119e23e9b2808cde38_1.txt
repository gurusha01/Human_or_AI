This manuscript presents "belief propagation recursive neural networks", a novel extension of traditional feedforward recursive networks that incorporates a backward step during inference, enabling phrase-level predictions and embeddings to inform word embeddings and labels.
The paper is generally well-structured and clearly written, with a well-motivated and described model that builds upon the concept of Bidirectional Recursive Neural Networks introduced by Irsoy and Cardie in 2008. Notably, the authors contribute to the field by introducing hybrid word vectors, which may be the most significant distinction from prior work.
However, the experimental comparisons raise some concerns regarding fairness, as it is unclear whether the RNN and B-RNN models also utilized hybrid vectors, and the methodology for tuning, selecting, and determining the "best" models is not transparent. Furthermore, the fact that other methods do not employ an ensemble approach should be acknowledged. These points require clarification to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the results.
The term "belief propagation" may be misleading, and the alternative term "forward-backward" could be more suitable.
Section 3.5, which discusses training, is somewhat concise and could benefit from additional details, such as the use of the back-propagation through structure algorithm, as described in Goller's 1996 paper. This algorithm implies that the recursive model is unfolded, resulting in a very deep network that updates the word embedding part. The authors should provide more insight into this crucial step.
Section 3.6 is somewhat confusing, and the distinction between the proposed model and the work of Irsoy and Cardie needs to be clarified.
Section 4.1 requires improvement to make it accessible to readers outside the NLP community. Specifically, the task 2 of Semeval 2013 comprises two subtasks: contextual and message polarity. It appears that the authors address the contextual polarity task, and a clearer presentation of the task would facilitate understanding of the parser constraints.
Consideration should be given to merging sections 4.3 and 4.4.
Overall, the paper is well-written and presents an intriguing variant of the Bidirectional recursive model, warranting further refinement to address the aforementioned concerns.
