This manuscript addresses the challenge of estimating the average causal effect (ACE) between two binary variables when the causal relationships among covariates are not fully specified. It builds upon a rule introduced by Entner et al. (2013) designed to select a subset of observed covariates capable of blocking all back-door paths, albeit under the faithfulness assumption. The authors propose utilizing this rule to derive bounds for the ACE rather than point estimates, drawing on the method developed by Ramsahai (2012).
Although the core concept appears sensible and intriguing, a thorough comprehension of the technical aspects proves elusive. A point of confusion arises regarding the role of conditions stipulated in Entner et al.'s rule within this framework. Without invoking the faithfulness assumption, the implications of these conditions for the causal structure are not immediately apparent. It is speculated that verified conditions might influence the selection of relaxation parameters, but the paper explicitly sets this consideration aside. The methodology seems not to depend critically on the conditions outlined in Entner et al.'s rule, prompting questions about whether the observed robustness in experimental results might be related to this aspect. Clarification on this matter would be appreciated.
Several minor observations are noted:
1. The first paragraph of Section 3 mentions expressing violations of faithfulness as bounded violations of local independence, which seems counterintuitive. Unfaithfulness typically implies additional independence rather than its violation. The proposed framework appears to accommodate "almost violations" of faithfulness by limiting the magnitude of dependence.
2. In experimental evaluations, it might be beneficial to include the performance of Entner et al.'s method using their stringent thresholds, treating "don't know" responses as uninformative bounds.
3. On page 8, the interpretation of a negative ACE suggesting a desirable vaccine outcome seems inconsistent with the provided definitions of X and Y.
4. There is a discrepancy in the citation of "Table 1" on page 8, which is referred to as "Table 5" in the text.
Overall, this paper presents an interesting approach, albeit one that is challenging to follow in its details.
