This paper presents a decomposition of multivariate polynomial functions with even degrees into convex and concave components, which is then utilized to address the MAP inference problem in continuous Markov Random Fields. The authors demonstrate the efficacy of their approach through experiments on 3D reconstruction, shape from shading, and image denoising.
The paper is well-structured and tackles the crucial problem of solving continuous MRF problems, providing a thorough theoretical analysis of the proposed algorithm.
Some minor suggestions for improvement include:
- The authors' claim of significantly outperforming existing techniques in terms of efficiency and accuracy is not entirely supported by the results, as their algorithm is shown to be slower than the L-BFGS approach in all three experimental cases. This discrepancy should be acknowledged and clarified in the text.
- The fluctuations observed in the energy versus sample index curve in Figure 2 warrant an explanation to provide a clearer understanding of the results.
- The captions for the tables could be improved by providing a more detailed explanation of the content, enhancing readability and comprehension.
Overall, the paper proposes a theoretically sound algorithm for decomposing even-degree polynomials into convex and concave parts, applying it effectively to continuous MRF problems, and is well-written, making it a valuable contribution.
