This manuscript presents a Gaussian process (GP) based approach as an alternative to traditional GARCH-related methods for modeling time-varying volatility in financial time series, offering increased flexibility. 
The submission demonstrates technical proficiency, although it lacks broad appeal and significant novelty, with the mathematical and Bayesian algorithmic components being highly specialized to the problem at hand.
The experimental design appears biased, as the synthetic datasets seem tailored to favor GPs while being misaligned with GARCH variants, making the GP's strong performance unsurprising. In the case of real data, the choice of GARCH(1,1), EGARCH(1,1), and GJR-GARCH(1,1,1) models, justified by their lower parameter count and reduced susceptibility to overfitting, does not account for regularization or optimal complexity selection for GARCH variants. Notably, the authors' method outperforms others in only 58% of the datasets.
As a seasoned professor and "data science" director with industry experience, my recommendation to the authors is to leverage their technical expertise towards more expansive problems or applications with less theoretical focus.
COMMENTS ON THE AUTHORS' RESPONSE
I find the authors' response to be technically sound, which has led me to revise my numerical assessment of the paper upward. Nevertheless, I still maintain that the paper may not resonate widely within the machine learning community. Having served on PhD committees for econometrics students, I suggest that if this work holds relevance for that field, publication in a specialized econometrics venue might be more suitable.
The authors' observation that higher-order GARCH models do not significantly outperform simpler GARCH models is noteworthy. While the GP method shows improvement, it is not dramatic. From my perspective as a practitioner in applied finance, these models, including the GP approach, often prioritize mathematical sophistication over real-world insight. The field would benefit from a shift towards more fact-driven research, addressing a broader range of problems rather than the narrow focus of the current work.
