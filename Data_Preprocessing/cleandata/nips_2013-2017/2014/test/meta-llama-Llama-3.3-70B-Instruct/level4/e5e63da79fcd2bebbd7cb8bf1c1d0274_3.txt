This paper presents a novel approach to face verification utilizing deep convolutional neural networks, which integrates identification objectives, such as softmax classification, and verification objectives, leveraging a landmark-based multi-scale method. The methodology bears a strong resemblance to the work outlined in [18], with two key distinctions: the incorporation of verification objectives into the training objective, and the selection of patches based on facial landmarks, which determines their location and scale. The model, trained on the CelebFaces+ database, yields state-of-the-art performance in face verification when evaluated on the LFW dataset.
In terms of quality, the paper contributes several innovative ideas that build upon and extend the previous state-of-the-art face verification system. The experiments conducted are thorough and well-executed, demonstrating a clear understanding of the subject matter.
The clarity of the paper is commendable, with the ideas and methods presented in a coherent and understandable manner. However, a few suggestions for improvement can be made:
1. A more direct comparison with the work in [18] would be beneficial, given the similarities in their verification pipelines, with the primary differences lying in the details.
2. Additional information regarding the training of the margin (m, as seen in Equation (1)) is necessary, as its updating process is not explicitly mentioned in Table 1.
3. There appears to be a discrepancy in the best verification accuracies reported in the figures and tables (e.g., Figures 3 and 4, and Tables 2, 3, and 4). Providing more comprehensive captions for these elements, including specifics about the experimental setup, would enhance the paper's clarity.
While the techniques employed in the paper are not novel, their effective combination and execution to achieve state-of-the-art performance mitigate this aspect. The paper's significance is underscored by the importance of face verification and the recent successes of deep learning in this area. Further significance could be added by including evaluation results on the YouTube Face database, a more challenging dataset.
The paper's contribution lies in its extension of previous work through the augmentation of the CNN objective function with verification objectives and the implementation of a more sophisticated region selection algorithm. This leads to the demonstration of state-of-the-art face verification performance on the LFW database, highlighting the paper's value in advancing the field.
