The paper presents the Witness Protection Program (WPP) algorithm, a novel approach to computing bounds on the average causal effect (ACE) while accounting for potential violations of the standard faithfulness assumption in causal inference. This is achieved by introducing relaxation parameters to constrain unfaithful interactions and utilizing a linear programming framework to solve for the resulting upper and lower bounds on the ACE. The algorithm adjusts for a set of covariates, subject to these constraints, making it a principled attempt to quantify the impact of weak unfaithful interaction patterns.
The problem addressed by the paper is timely and interesting, and the approach is technically sound. The ideas introduced are well-presented, although the overall context is occasionally lost. The use of relaxation parameters to constrain unfaithful interactions is a key aspect of the method, and the linear programming framework provides a robust means of solving for the bounds.
However, the interpretation of the output distribution over bounds remains unclear. The resulting bounds are often wide, which can make them less useful in practice. Furthermore, the method does not provide a preferred point estimate within the interval, which can lead to misinterpretation. The experimental evaluation is also poor, with the 'bias' evaluation metric being meaningless in comparing the WPP method to its competitors.
The quality of the paper is good, with many details explicated in the supplementary file. The approach is technically sound, and the ideas are well-introduced. However, important aspects, such as choosing the relaxation parameters, are relegated to a future article, making it difficult to assess potential issues with this part of the method. The experimental evaluation is not balanced or robust enough, and the practical performance on the influenza data set is worryingly weak.
The clarity of the paper is decent, although the algorithmic steps and subsequent modifications can be hard to follow due to a lack of explanation of certain details. The originality of the method lies in its novel combination of familiar techniques, which may stimulate a fruitful cross-fertilization of approaches on the subject. The significance of the paper mainly lies in the ideas and direction it brings to the problem, showing how to incorporate other techniques in solving this highly challenging problem.
In summary, the paper presents a relevant and highly topical problem, an interesting method that will undoubtedly find an audience, and a reasonably well-written presentation. However, the current application is limited, and the experimental evaluation is poor. The relevance and proper interpretation of the output distribution over bounds remain unclear, and the method's practical efficacy is uncertain.
Other comments include the need for clarification on certain aspects of the method, such as the choice of relaxation parameters and the interpretation of the output bounds. Additionally, the comparison to other methods is not straightforward, and the use of emotive language in the conclusion is unnecessary. The paper would benefit from a more balanced and robust experimental evaluation, as well as a clearer explanation of the method's limitations and potential applications.
