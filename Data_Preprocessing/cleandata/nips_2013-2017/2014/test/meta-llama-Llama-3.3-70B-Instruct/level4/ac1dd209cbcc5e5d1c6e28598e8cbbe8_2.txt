This manuscript presents a novel graphical model designed for the multi-scale analysis of complex spatio-temporal dynamic systems. 
The significance of this work stems from the introduction of a new prior distribution tailored for the parameters of the multi-scale process, offering a fresh perspective in this area.
Overall, the paper is well-structured and contributes meaningfully to the existing body of literature, presenting an original and substantial advancement. However, my primary critique pertains to the explanatory depth in the Introduction and Section 3. Given that the core contribution of the paper revolves around the derivation of the penalization term, a more comprehensive discussion comparing and contrasting the proposed method with established penalization techniques such as LASSO, elastic net, and SCAD would be beneficial. Specifically, an elaboration on how the proposed method surpasses these existing methods in terms of advantages would enhance the paper's clarity and impact. It would be advantageous for the authors to include a comparative analysis highlighting the superiority of their proposed prior distribution over other penalization methods. Despite this suggestion, I firmly recommend the acceptance of this paper.
