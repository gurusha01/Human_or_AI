Summary: This paper presents an efficient optimization methodology for obtaining structured low-rank matrices, where the structure is imposed through a linear mapping and low rank is enforced by incorporating the nuclear norm of the structured matrix into the cost function. The optimization is performed using a generalized conditional gradient algorithm, which is further accelerated by factorizing the large structured matrix. Although this factorization introduces a non-convex auxiliary problem involving the optimization of two factor matrices, it can be efficiently solved using approaches similar to those proposed by Zhang et al. (NIPS2012). Theoretical analysis reveals that the overall algorithm exhibits remarkably low complexity, and experimental results demonstrate that it outperforms competing methods by at least an order of magnitude for various sample problems, with scalability to extremely large matrices of over 300M elements. Notably, the factor matrices are initialized at low ranks, contrasting with alternative methods that typically start from full rank.
Quality: The paper provides a comprehensive theoretical analysis of computational complexity and convergence rates, showcasing significant advancements over existing methods. These improvements are consistently validated through experimental results, where the proposed method surpasses competing techniques.
Clarity: While the paper is generally well-written, its complex content necessitates that readers consult both the supplementary materials and referenced papers to fully appreciate the methodology and its implications.
Originality: The described method creatively integrates several concepts from prior algorithms to yield a novel, surprisingly efficient solution.
Significance: The addressed problem holds considerable importance for various applications, and the presented results convincingly demonstrate improvements over the current state of the art. Overall, the paper outlines an efficient optimization approach for finding structured low-rank matrices, supported by theoretical analyses and experimental evidence showing substantial speed enhancements over existing techniques.
