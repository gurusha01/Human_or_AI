SUMMARY: This manuscript proposes a framework for analyzing policy decisions in microfinance markets, particularly those requiring causal knowledge. The model, supported by several studies, demonstrates the existence of equilibrium prices. A computational approach is then introduced to calculate an equilibrium and estimate model parameters from actual microfinance data. Ultimately, the authors utilize this framework to address various policy-related questions.
CRITIQUE: Overall, this is a well-structured paper, characterized by clarity, strong motivation, robust analysis, and significant potential for impact. However, a few concerns are noted, including the assumption that microfinance institutions (MFIs) operate as non-profits, which is pivotal to the analysis. Additionally, the suitability of this paper for the NIPS conference is questionable, but this decision is left to more senior reviewers.
SUGGESTION: The non-profit assumption warrants further exploration, particularly in regards to its implications on social welfare when MFIs adopt a profit-seeking approach. Investigating how slight modifications to the model could address this question would be beneficial. For instance, could a minor shift towards profit-seeking behavior among MFIs lead to increased social welfare and reduced reliance on subsidies over time?
SPECIFIC COMMENTS:
page 2:
* The citation of [13] twice in the same sentence seems redundant and could be rephrased for clarity.
* The term "study of causality" lacks a clear definition and may be perceived as vague; providing a concise explanation or scope of "causality" in this context would be helpful.
* The reference to the "do operation [21, p. 23]" requires additional context to ensure understanding for readers unfamiliar with the reference.
page 3:
* The phrase "subset of the village" should be pluralized to "subsets of the villages" for accuracy.
* The phrase "interest rate at which MFI i gives loan" could be reworded for better clarity, potentially to "interest rate at which MFI i offers loans."
* The expression "max{ri} 1" appears abrupt and would benefit from an explicit confirmation that the intention is indeed to maximize to 1.
* The statement "each MFI i is optimizing (PM)" should be modified to "each MFI i is optimizing the left-hand side of (PM)" to clarify that an inequality is being optimized.
page 4:
* The modeling of the village side as non-corporate agents is not clearly connected to the rest of the model and warrants further explanation.
* Property 3.2 requires interpretation in plain language to facilitate understanding.
* The term "trivial allocations" should be accompanied by a brief reminder of what x represents and why such allocations would be considered trivial.
page 5:
* The sentence "that a more restricted case" contains an error and needs correction.
* The instruction "Change ri as described later" should include a specific equation number reference to avoid confusion and facilitate location of the relevant information.
page 6:
* The statement "Our model computes lower equilibrium interest rate" is clear and well-supported, reflecting the overall quality of the paper, which is well-motivated, clearly presented, and backed by robust analysis and data, introducing novel techniques with significant potential impact.
