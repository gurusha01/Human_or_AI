Quality and originality: The paper's emphasis on online recommendation settings is a timely and valuable contribution, as this poses significant challenges in domains such as movie, book, and music recommendations. The introductory section is well-crafted and of high quality. Although I am not an expert in the specific area of performance guarantees and proofs, they appear to be sound. However, I have some reservations regarding the Collaborative-Greedy model, primarily due to the small size of the datasets used for evaluation, which makes it difficult to extrapolate its performance to more realistic and larger datasets, such as the Netflix prize or Million Song dataset. The authors acknowledge this limitation, noting that a comprehensive validation would necessitate an actual interactive online recommendation system. It is worth noting that the paper's primary focus seems to be a theoretical exploration, and the datasets utilized are sufficient to support the authors' assertions. The paper's final claim, highlighting the utility of two types of exploration for learning mixed distributions in an active learning setting, is particularly insightful.
Clarity and Significance: As this paper falls outside my primary area of research, I found it to be clear in a localized sense, meaning that each paragraph was comprehensible on its own. Nevertheless, I am concerned that I may have missed the broader implications and context. The paper delves into the online setting of collaborative filtering, proposes a model and learning problem for online recommendation, provides performance guarantees along with proofs, and discusses experimental results, thereby contributing to the field of online recommendation systems.
