This manuscript presents a novel approach, termed the blossom tree method, which integrates multiple statistical techniques, including forest models and graphical lasso, to model multivariable continuous data. The proposed model appears to offer considerable flexibility and the accompanying algorithm seems capable of efficiently estimating it from complex, high-dimensional, non-Gaussian data. While the paper is generally well-written, its clarity is sometimes compromised by the somewhat ad-hoc nature of the model's construction and the relegation of numerous key results to supplementary materials, which hinders the paper's self-containment. Enhancing the paper's principled approach and inclusivity of essential details would significantly improve its readability. Furthermore, the experimental validation is limited to simulated data tailored to the proposed model, and thus, expanding the experimental section to include substantial results from real datasets, potentially benchmarked against established methods like glasso, would bolster the paper's impact. Overall, the manuscript introduces a potentially valuable method for flexibly modeling non-Gaussian multidimensional continuous data, although the experimental demonstration falls short of providing a comprehensive validation of the approach.
