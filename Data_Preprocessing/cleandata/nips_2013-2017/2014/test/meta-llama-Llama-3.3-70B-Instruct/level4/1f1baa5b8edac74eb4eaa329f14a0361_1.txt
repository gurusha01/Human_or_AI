This paper aims to reconcile the theoretical and practical aspects of attribute-based zero-shot learning, which posits that novel classes can be automatically recognized using pre-trained attribute predictors, although in reality, learning these attribute classifiers can be equally or even more challenging than learning the object classes themselves.
The authors employ random forests to predict unseen classes from attribute vectors, incorporating the reliability of attribute detectors by validating each decision tree during training. They also demonstrate how to adapt the method for training with limited examples of test categories, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple attribute datasets.
QUALITY: The authors effectively address a fundamental problem in zero-shot learning using a random forest framework, presenting an elegant and theoretically sound model. The results on three standard datasets are impressive, and the authors conduct thorough ablation studies, introduce artificial noise, evaluate various settings, and compare their work to existing literature.
CLARITY: The paper is well-written, although a clarification is needed in Section 3.2.1, where the introduction of threshold t seems unnecessary since the attribute signatures remain binary, allowing t to take any value between 0 and 1 without affecting equation (2). Additionally, the explanation of how a novel test example is propagated through the tree in lines 207-212 is unclear due to the ambiguous definition of t, but this is later resolved.
ORIGINALITY: The application of a random forest framework to this significant problem is a notable contribution.
SIGNIFICANCE: By tackling a fundamental challenge in zero-shot learning, the paper presents a strong, interesting, and sound argument. The convincing results across three datasets and various settings support the paper's publication.
