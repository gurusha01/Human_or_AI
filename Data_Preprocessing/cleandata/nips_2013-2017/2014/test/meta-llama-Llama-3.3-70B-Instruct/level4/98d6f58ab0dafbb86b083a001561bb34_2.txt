This manuscript explores the tradeoffs between time and data in noiseless, convex regularized linear inverse problems (RLIP), such as those encountered in compressed sensing. The authors demonstrate that when excess data is available for solving a RLIP, the regularizer can be smoothed, allowing the problem to be relaxed into a simpler form that can be solved more efficiently in terms of computational complexity. To demonstrate this tradeoff, the authors employ a standard iterative dual smoothing optimization algorithm, showing that with excess data, minimizing the smoothed regularizer can achieve the same level of accuracy with fewer iterations. Furthermore, they explicitly characterize the conditions under which the smoothed RLIP will yield the same solution as the original problem, utilizing the concept of statistical dimension to precisely define the phase transition curve of RLIPs with random Gaussian sensing matrices. The authors apply their findings to sparse signal estimation using the l-1 norm and low-rank matrix estimation via the nuclear norm, also hinting at extensions to other examples and noisy signal estimation in future work.
The quality of the manuscript is high, as the authors leverage modern convex analysis tools, such as the statistical dimension of convex cones, to address time-data tradeoffs in statistical estimation in a principled and well-structured manner. The paper is exceptionally clear and self-contained, making it accessible to readers. In terms of originality and significance, the authors build upon the innovative work of Chandrasekaran and Jordan, presenting a distinct approach that involves smoothing the regularizer rather than enlarging the constraint set. This method appears more flexible and applicable to a wide range of practical problems.
However, one potential concern is the method's dependence on the choice of optimization algorithm. It remains to be seen whether these results can be extended to more specialized algorithms, such as approximate message passing for l-1 minimization, which offer strong performance guarantees. Overall, the paper presents a novel, theoretically sound, and practically applicable approach to addressing time-data tradeoffs in regularized linear inverse problems.
