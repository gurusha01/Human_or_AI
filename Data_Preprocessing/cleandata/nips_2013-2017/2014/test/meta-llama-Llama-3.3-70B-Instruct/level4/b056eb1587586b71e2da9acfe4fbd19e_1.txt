This manuscript proposes a novel algorithm for attribute selection, specifically designed for activity recognition, which is based on three key criteria: high discrimination between pairwise classes, consistency in discrimination across all class pairs, and comprehensive coverage of all class pairs. The first two criteria are formulated using a random walk framework, while the third criterion utilizes a set-cover approach. A greedy optimization strategy is then employed to select a subset of attributes, starting from an empty set.
The research presented in this paper is intriguing, with the primary contribution being the development of this attribute selection algorithm. The algorithm appears to be innovative, combining random walk, set-cover, and greedy optimization techniques in a unique manner. The experimental results are also promising, demonstrating improvements over existing methods and baselines, including scenarios with no feature selection and alternative strategies. However, some experimental details are lacking, but the results seem robust.
A primary concern with the paper is the motivation and intuition behind the approach, which seems to be driven by the desire to utilize submodular optimization. The discussion around lines 133-145 outlines three criteria, but the rationale for the second criterion is unclear. It is not evident why attributes cannot be better suited for certain classes than others, or why a final classifier cannot select combinations of attributes. This second criterion appears to complicate the optimization process, necessitating the use of the proposed techniques.
The resulting submodular optimization essentially reduces to a greedy approach. It would be interesting to explore whether similar greedy optimization could be applied to other formulations, such as those without the second criterion. Empirical evaluation of the importance of this criterion would provide valuable insights.
While this concern is not fundamental, it is worth noting, and overall, the paper is considered to be of high quality and worthy of acceptance.
Additional comments include:
- The supplementary material has not been thoroughly reviewed, but the intuitive explanations provided in the paper seem reasonable.
- A typo "Combing" was noticed.
- The use of sparse coding (Eq. 5) in the paper is unclear, and its relevance to the experiments, which mention KSVD for the DDA set, is not evident. If sparse coding is indeed used, comparison with alternatives like k-means would be beneficial, although this may not be feasible within the confines of a conference paper.
- The method used to set hyperparameters in the experiments is not specified, and it is unclear whether they were tuned based on test (cross-validation) accuracies.
- The experimental results appear to surpass those of previous work. However, the numbers in Table 2 seem inconsistent with those reported in [20], which shows a higher mAP of 74.38% in Fig. 10(b) compared to the 71.6% listed in this paper.
- The related work section is comprehensive, but could be enhanced by including the work of Fu et al. on multi-modal latent attribute learning, as published in IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (PAMI 2013).
- The algorithm proposed for attribute or feature selection is novel, although the motivation for part of the approach is not entirely clear. Nonetheless, the method seems effective empirically.
