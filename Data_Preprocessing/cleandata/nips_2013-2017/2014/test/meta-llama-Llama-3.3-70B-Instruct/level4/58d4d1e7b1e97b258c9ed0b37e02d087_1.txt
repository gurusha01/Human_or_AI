This article presents a framework for comparing Bayesian models of behavioral data, building on the Bayesian Decision Theory framework to address issues of non-identifiability. The authors outline constraints that can be applied to make each term in the framework identifiable, and demonstrate their approach using two case studies: time interval estimation and motion perception.
The problem of identifiability of internal representations and processes has long been a challenge in cognitive science and psychology, with researchers such as Anderson (1978) highlighting the need for constraints to distinguish between equivalent representations. More recently, the limitations of the Bayesian framework in addressing these issues have been noted (e.g., Jones & Love, 2011; Bowers & Davis, 2012).
While the article tackles an important theoretical issue and is well-written, there are two major concerns. Firstly, the authors fail to engage with the existing literature on model comparison in cognitive science and psychology, making it difficult to assess the novelty of their contribution. The proposed framework bears similarities to previous work (e.g., Pitt, Myung, & Zhang, 2002; Navarro, Pitt, & Myung, 2004). Secondly, the authors' assumptions sometimes appear arbitrary, and it is unclear how crucial these assumptions are to the framework. For example, the definition of $p_{meas}$ in equation 3 and the parameter values in equation 12 seem to require further justification. Although the framework is robust and can capture a wide range of sensory models, the assumptions underlying it need to be more thoroughly discussed and justified.
Minor comments include:
Line 53: Rather than stating that a mathematical fact is trivial, it would be more helpful to provide an explanation.
Line 73: The second "nor" should be replaced with "or".
Figure 2: The caption does not clearly explain the meaning of the star and dashed lines, which appear to both represent the true value.
References remain the same.
Overall, the article addresses a critical issue, but its failure to engage with previous related work and justify its assumptions limits its impact.
