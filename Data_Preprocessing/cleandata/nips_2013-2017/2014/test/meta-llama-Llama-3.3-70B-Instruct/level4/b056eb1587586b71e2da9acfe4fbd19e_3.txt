The proposed paper explores the use of attributes as a mid-level feature representation for action recognition (AR), with a focus on developing a data-driven approach to select a subset of discriminative attributes from a larger set. Currently, attributes used in AR are typically human-assigned, without consideration for their discriminative ability.
QUALITY:
The formulation of the attribute selection criteria appears to be sound. However, it is unclear why the relationships between attributes are limited to pairwise interactions, rather than exploring higher-order or one-vs-all relationships. 
The introduction makes broad claims that are not fully supported by the results. Specifically, the assertion that human-labelled attributes (HLA) are "arbitrary" and prone to noise and redundancy, potentially leading to degraded action recognition performance, overlooks the semantic meaning and hierarchical role of these attributes. For instance, attributes like "applying makeup" are shared across related activities, such as applying eye makeup or lipstick. Moreover, the experimental results in tables 2 and 3 show that, with a few exceptions, data-driven attributes (DDA) are generally weaker than HLA, and in some cases, significantly so. Only in the "mixed" case do the results demonstrate improvements, suggesting that DDA are at best complementary to HLA, rather than a replacement. Therefore, the claim that a more compact set of attributes can be found is not substantiated.
CLARITY:
Lines 102-103: While the application area is intriguing, it would be more informative to know how the attributes have been applied in these contexts, such as optimization or classification.
Line 129: The notation u_k^d and u^d is unclear.
The determination of lambda in equation 4 and its impact on the results is not explicitly stated.
ORIGINALITY:
The paper claims to introduce a "novel submodular objective function for attribute selection", but the novelty of this approach is not clearly explained. Furthermore, it is unclear how this submodularity optimization differs from other approaches, particularly those listed in the related works section, such as [22] and [23], which are compared to the proposed method.
SIGNIFICANCE:
This paper will be of interest to researchers working in action recognition and attribute representations, both of which are subfields of computer vision. The proposed approach for determining data-driven attribute representations is intriguing, and with some refinement of the introduction and motivation, the paper has the potential to make a valuable contribution to the field.
