This paper extends the existing body of work on graphical models by moving beyond Gaussian modeling of real-valued attributes. The key innovation lies in the combination of a non-parametric forest density estimation algorithm, which generalizes the classical Chow-Liu algorithm for learning tree graphical models, with the standard graphical LASSO, yielding what the authors term a "blossom tree graphical model." The paper presents a statistical consistency result and several experiments.
Regarding Section 3, it would be beneficial for the authors to elaborate on the implications of their result for machine learning properties, such as PAC or large-deviation bounds, as opposed to asymptotic bounds. Specifically, can the authors provide insight into the properties of the constant N, including lower or upper bounds, even if not exact? Similar to asymptotic convergence, it is challenging to determine when the large-deviation bounds become valid without additional information on N and the sample size n. As a result, while the statistical result is interesting, its utility for machine learning is limited. I suggest relocating Section 3 to the supplementary material and replacing it with more comprehensive experimental evaluations, such as those presented in Supplementary Simulations 1 and 2. Furthermore, a more thorough assessment could involve experimenting with different underlying ground-truth densities, graph structures, sample sizes, and attribute/variable numbers.
Given the paper's context, a reference to the seminal Chow-Liu algorithm (1968) would be warranted, even if only in passing. The authors' approach, although distinct in its statistical setup and extension beyond simple trees/forests, undoubtedly builds upon the foundation laid by Chow-Liu's work.
It would be valuable to see experiments on real-world data, such as microarray data, similar to those conducted by Liu et al. (JMLR, 2011). Are there limitations to accessing such data, and could other datasets (e.g., fMRI) be explored?
I am curious about the core distinctions between the proposed approach and forest density estimation, as well as its relationship to prior work, including:
* Marwan Mattar and Erik Learned-Miller's "Improved generative models for continuous image features through tree-structured non-parametric distributions" (UMass Amherst Technical Report 06-57, 2006)
* Mihai Datcu et al.'s "Multisource Data Classification With Dependence Trees" (IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 2002)
I am interested in understanding the machine learning-relevant distinctions, as opposed to statistical ones.
While I was initially skeptical about the novelty of the approach, given the time elapsed since Chow and Liu's work, I must acknowledge the authors' originality and novelty. Even if prior work is discovered, it does not diminish the authors' contribution, as their approach has not been proposed in recent years despite significant attention to modeling continuous/real-valued attributes.
Overall, the paper presents a nice, clean, interesting, and surprisingly novel approach to modeling multiple real-valued attributes. Further experimental and empirical evaluations would be beneficial to strengthen the work.
