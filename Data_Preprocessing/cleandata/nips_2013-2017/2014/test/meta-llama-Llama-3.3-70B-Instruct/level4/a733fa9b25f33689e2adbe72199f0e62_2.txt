This manuscript presents a novel nonparametric volatility model, leveraging the application of Gaussian process priors to stochastic volatility models. The inference methodology employed is based on Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods, specifically a straightforward implementation of the Liu and West's Auxiliary Particle Filter (APF) algorithm.
However, the literature review appears to be incomplete, omitting key references, and the empirical comparison is lacking in comprehensiveness. My primary concerns with the manuscript are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The authors introduce a new stochastic volatility (SV) model without referencing foundational works in this area, such as Taylor (1987) and Jacquier, Polson, and Rossi (1994, 2004), which is a notable omission.
\item The comparison between the GP-Vol model and GARCH models is presented, but the literature has already established the superior flexibility of SV models over GARCH models (e.g., Fridman and Harris, 1998). Therefore, I strongly recommend that the authors include a comparison between a standard SV model and the proposed GP-Vol model to provide a more comprehensive evaluation.
\item The manuscript proposes a new nonparametric model without acknowledging recent advances in Bayesian nonparametrics, which utilize flexible prior processes such as Dirichlet processes (see, for example, Bassetti, Casarin, and Leisen, 2014; Griffin, 2011; Griffin and Steel, 2011).
\end{enumerate}

To strengthen the manuscript, I expect the authors to enhance the presentation of their contribution and provide a comparison with a standard SV model. With revisions addressing these concerns, I would recommend accepting the paper.
