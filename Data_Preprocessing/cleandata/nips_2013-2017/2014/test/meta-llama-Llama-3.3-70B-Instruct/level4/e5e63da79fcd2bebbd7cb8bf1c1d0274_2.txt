This manuscript explores the face recognition problem utilizing a deep learning approach, where the primary concept involves learning features through the simultaneous utilization of face identification and verification signals as supervisory mechanisms. This dual-supervision strategy aims to amplify inter-personal distinctions while minimizing intra-personal variability, a motivation that, although straightforward, has been extensively examined in previous studies, such as Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). The integration of this technique into a deep learning framework, however, presents a novel approach. The reported achievement of a 99.15% verification accuracy on the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset surpasses current state-of-the-art results, making it a noteworthy contribution.
The manuscript is also commendable for its clarity and organization. The authors provide a comprehensive set of experiments designed to validate their proposed method from multiple angles, offering a robust verification of their concept. By proposing a novel deep learning framework that leverages both face identification and verification signals for supervision, the authors achieve an unprecedented 99.15% verification accuracy on LFW. The simplicity of the idea, coupled with its exceptional performance, underscores the significance of this work.
