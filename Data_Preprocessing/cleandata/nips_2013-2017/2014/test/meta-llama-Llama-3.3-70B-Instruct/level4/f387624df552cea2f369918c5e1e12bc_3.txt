The paper explores the pure exploration variant of linear bandits, where the input comprises K vectors of d dimensions, and the player can query vectors to obtain a sample from a distribution with a mean that is a fixed linear function of the vector. The goal is to identify the arm with the maximum value with high probability using a minimal number of queries.
The authors propose a solution based on the experiment design framework, presenting two static allocation strategies that provide results analogous to the uniform strategy in the classic best arm identification problem. Additionally, they introduce a dynamic strategy that achieves a provable result, outperforming the static strategy in certain scenarios. A problem-dependent optimal strategy is also provided, matching the result of the classic best arm identification problem.
The paper is generally well-written, with some proofs in the appendix requiring more details but appearing to be correct. The studied problem is interesting, and the paper provides an extensive theoretical study. However, the experiments are somewhat lacking, with the result for the adaptive sampling technique being weak, only showing a separation from static methods in a specific case where finding the second-best arm is significantly easier than finding the best arm. It is unclear whether the adaptive setting truly outperforms the static setting only in this restricted scenario or in other scenarios as well.
The experiments are limited to an example carefully constructed to match the conditions where the adaptive algorithm is provably superior, rather than exploring more general scenarios. To strengthen the paper, additional experiments on real or synthetic data could be conducted to investigate the performance of the adaptive setting in various scenarios.
Several minor errors and suggestions for improvement were noted, including corrections to Proposition 1, Line 101, Equations 3-5, and Equation 30. Additionally, comments were made on the proof of Lemma 2, Theorem 1, and the use of matrix Chernoff bounds in Section B.
Overall, the paper is recommended for acceptance due to its interesting problem and solid analysis. However, adding more meaningful experiments could potentially increase the paper's quality, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the adaptive setting's performance in various scenarios.
