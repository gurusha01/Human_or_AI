This manuscript proposes a methodology for attribute-based zero-shot learning, leveraging random forests. The approach involves training attribute classifiers using Support Vector Machines (SVMs), followed by the training of a random forest on class-attribute signature vectors. The reliability of attributes is estimated at each node of the tree using a validation set of images with associated attribute labels. An extension of this methodology to few-shot learning is also presented.
In terms of clarity, the manuscript is well-structured and clearly written, providing a comprehensive summary of related works.
Regarding originality, while the manuscript does offer some novel elements, its overall novelty is somewhat limited. A key claim of the paper - that it uniquely addresses the issue of unreliable attribute predictions - may be somewhat exaggerated. For instance, direct attribute prediction (DAP), a baseline method used in this and other studies, also possesses mechanisms to handle attribute uncertainty. Both approaches share fundamental steps: 
a) Training attribute classifiers on image features, and 
b) Training a secondary class probability estimator based on attribute predictions, utilizing a validation set to assess attribute classifier reliability. The primary difference lies in the method used to model attribute noise, with the proposed approach employing an ROC-based estimate and effectively modeling joint statistics in attribute errors through tree propagation, unlike the independent attribute treatment in previous work.
However, a potential drawback of the proposed method, compared to those treating attributes independently, is the requirement for a large validation set to achieve valid probability estimates, especially as the set is subdivided during tree propagation. This issue is not thoroughly addressed in the manuscript, with the proposed solution appearing somewhat heuristic. Further experiments to evaluate the impact of training and validation set sizes would be beneficial.
The quality of the manuscript is generally good, with sound technical choices and descriptions. The experiments are appropriate and support the paper's claims, although the quantitative improvement is not substantial enough to warrant acceptance based solely on empirical results. The extension to few-shot learning, while interesting, feels less refined than the rest of the manuscript, with a brief presentation that lacks the clarity and detailed explanations found elsewhere. An alternative method combining class-attribute priors and image attribute estimates might offer a more intuitive approach. Overall, the manuscript is well-written, with sensible technical decisions and adequate experiments, but the central claim of introducing a novel method for handling unreliable attributes is somewhat debatable.
