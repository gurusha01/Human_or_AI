This paper presents a novel recommendation algorithm that leverages reinforcement learning to balance exploration and exploitation in an online environment, accompanied by a theoretical framework to analyze its performance. The algorithm's effectiveness is predicated on two primary assumptions: firstly, that users can be distinctly categorized into k typical user types, and secondly, that likable items are clearly discernible. Under these assumptions, the paper demonstrates the algorithm's robust performance.
The authors' contribution is noteworthy, as they address a significant gap in the literature by providing a theoretical analysis of online recommendation systems, which have been plentiful but lacked rigorous theoretical underpinnings. Although the proposed algorithm is straightforward, its simplicity belies the significance of establishing a theoretical foundation for analyzing recommendation systems in online settings.
However, several issues warrant further consideration:
1. The paper utilizes the fact that users or items can be grouped into categories for analytical purposes but does not integrate this insight into the recommendation algorithm itself. Exploring ways to leverage this categorization for enhancing the recommendation task would be beneficial.
2. Traditional clustering approaches often adopt a top-down methodology, assigning each user or item to a single cluster. Recent research, such as the work by J. Lee, S. Kim, G. Lebanon, and Y. Singer on Local Low-Rank Matrix Approximation (ICML 2013), has demonstrated the efficacy of bottom-up clustering methods that allow for overlapping clusters. Adapting the proposed framework to accommodate such overlapping clusters could enhance its versatility.
3. The algorithm defines alpha within the range (0, 4/7], but the rationale behind selecting 4/7 as the upper bound is not explicitly stated. Elucidating the reasoning or empirical process that led to this choice would provide valuable context.
4. The definitions of \epsilonR(n) and \epsilonJ(t) appear logical, but it remains unclear whether these formulations offer superior performance compared to using constant values. Empirical evidence or theoretical proofs confirming the efficacy of these definitions, as well as an exploration of how the choice of alpha influences performance, would strengthen the paper. Including experimental results that vary alpha could provide insightful perspectives on the algorithm's sensitivity to this parameter.
5. A minor suggestion pertains to Figure 1(b), where three lines may not be distinguishable when printed using black-and-white printers. Altering the line shapes could enhance the figure's readability across different printing formats.
6. Another minor correction involves Line 413, where "[4] study" should be revised to "[4] studies" or "[4] studied" to ensure grammatical accuracy.
7. Lastly, on Line 419, the phrase "Another related work is by [12], who study" could be rephrased as "Another related work is [12], which studied" for improved clarity.
In conclusion, this paper proposes a straightforward yet meaningful online recommendation algorithm, accompanied by a valuable theoretical analysis. Despite the identified areas for improvement, the paper's contributions make it a worthy candidate for publication in NIPS.
