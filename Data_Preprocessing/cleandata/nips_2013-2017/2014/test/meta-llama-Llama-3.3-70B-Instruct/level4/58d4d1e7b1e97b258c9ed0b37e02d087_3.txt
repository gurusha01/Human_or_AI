This paper presents a Bayesian perception model, encompassing mathematical formulations for sensory noise, likelihood functions, prior probability distributions, loss functions, and response distributions. A notable advantage of this model is its balance between robustness and computational convenience, allowing it to accommodate various scenarios, such as stimulus-dependent noise, while maintaining tractable inference. The model's identifiability is also highlighted, enabling straightforward evaluation and distinction between parameter estimates.
I support the acceptance of this paper to the NIPS conference, as it offers a mathematically refined framework for perceptual estimation in numerous experiments. However, I have some concerns regarding its novelty. The proposed model aligns closely with recent literature, such as publications in PLoS Computational Biology, including works by Acerbi et al. (2012, 2014), suggesting that its contribution, although valuable, is incremental. 
To strengthen the manuscript, I recommend adding a section that reviews recent Bayesian models of perception and clearly articulates the advancements of the proposed model over existing ones. Furthermore, while the model is mathematically identifiable, this identifiability is contingent upon the model's assumptions. It is essential to acknowledge that the model may not fully address the identifiability concerns pertinent to perceptual scientists, such as distinguishing between sensory, decision, and response noise in experimental subjects' errors. A discussion on this aspect would enhance the revised manuscript.
Overall, the paper provides a mathematically elegant framework for formalizing perceptual estimation, albeit with an incremental novel contribution due to its similarity to existing work in the field.
