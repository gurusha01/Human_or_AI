This manuscript presents a novel approach to sentiment classification by leveraging both encoding and decoding phase vectors from a recursive neural network auto-encoder, which the authors misleadingly refer to as "belief propagation". Although the paper is generally well-written, the underlying motivation for the proposed model is unclear and lacks a solid theoretical foundation.
A significant limitation of this work lies in its evaluation methodology. The inclusion of an ensemble result in the evaluation is unjustified, as none of the benchmark models are ensembles, thereby obscuring the results. Furthermore, the composition of the compared models is ambiguous, raising essential questions: What was the tuning process for the models, and how were the ensemble and best models selected? Were the benchmark models in Table 2 tuned using the same augmented data as the BP-RNN? Did the RNN and Bidirectional-RNN models also utilize hybrid word vectors? Without this crucial information, it is reasonable to assume that the second entry in Table 3 is the most comparable to the benchmarks in Tables 1 and 2 for assessing the BP-RNN architecture.
Some additional concerns include:
- The use of an off-the-shelf parser for tweet parsing is surprising, and its accuracy on this specific dataset would be worth investigating.
- The citation for Irsoy and Cardie, among others, is incomplete.
Overall, this paper proposes a recursive neural network model for phrasal sentiment classification, yielding reasonable results. However, the model's motivation is weak, and the experimental methodology requires clarification to fully assess its validity.
