This paper proposes a GP-Vol model that effectively captures time-dependent variance changes and presents a novel online algorithm for fully Bayesian inference. 
The manuscript is well-structured and clearly written, with the inference methodology appearing to be technically robust. The results presented are also encouraging. However, in my view, the model's utilization of a non-parametric approach, specifically applying a GP prior to the transition function, seems like a somewhat predictable extension of existing work in the finance domain. Consequently, I would not assign a high score to the paper in terms of novelty. Nonetheless, the paper is overall well-presented and persuasive.
I have several questions for the authors:
(1) The computational time savings compared to other methods are impressive, with promising results. Have the authors explored higher-order dependencies between variances and returns, i.e., values of p and q greater than 1? How do these higher-order dependencies compare to first-order dependencies in terms of computational time and algorithmic efficiency? Is it possible for the authors to determine optimal p and q values from the data, potentially by evaluating test likelihood?
(2) The authors mention bias introduced by sampling from artificial dynamics in the kernel. Have they quantified this bias? It would be more convincing to understand the specific scenarios in which RAPCF fails, rather than simply stating that the issues have limited practical impact.
(3) I am uncertain about the practical selection of the shrinkage parameter, lambda.
The paper models time-varying variance evolution using GP and presents an associated fully Bayesian inference method. Overall, it is a technically sound and well-written paper.
