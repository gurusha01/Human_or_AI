This manuscript introduces a methodology for modeling latent state linear dynamical systems, emphasizing the discovery of hierarchical structure in dynamics. The authors propose an optimization framework that encourages a specific group sparsity pattern in the link between latent and local dynamics. They demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in recovering the underlying connectivity structure of a fluid flow PDE.
In my opinion, this is a solid paper that warrants acceptance to NIPS. However, there are several aspects that could enhance its quality. The underlying model appears straightforward, but its presentation is heavily rooted in convection-diffusion equations, which may be unfamiliar to a significant portion of the NIPS audience. The connection between the latent state dynamics and the regularization term, specifically the "D(gamma) A" term in the function g, seems pivotal but remains somewhat obscure. As this element constitutes a key algorithmic contribution, distinct from standard group-lasso time series modeling, I believe a more detailed explanation is necessary. The paragraph surrounding equation (3) is dense and may be challenging for most NIPS attendees to comprehend.
To strengthen the paper, I suggest emphasizing the overarching concept that learned dynamical systems can substantially outperform others when using regularization derived from the underlying physical process. This could be the most significant takeaway for the NIPS audience. The paper presents a novel optimization approach for developing hierarchical systems based on convection-diffusion dynamics. While the key elements are somewhat difficult to discern, I believe the idea has merit and is worthy of publication.
