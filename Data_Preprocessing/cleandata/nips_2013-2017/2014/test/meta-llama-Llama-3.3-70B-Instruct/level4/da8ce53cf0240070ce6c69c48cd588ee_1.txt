The authors present a novel approach to estimating graphical models for continuous data by integrating three established concepts: assuming multivariate Gaussian data and using graphical lasso, employing a Gaussian copula for non-Gaussian data, or assuming a tree-structured factorization with arbitrary bivariate marginals. Their proposed method, termed the "blossom tree," involves factorizing the model into densely connected components linked by a tree structure, where each component is modeled as a sparse multivariate Gaussian or non-paranormal copula, and the tree edges represent arbitrary bivariate distributions.
The key idea of factorizing high-dimensional graphical models using the blossom tree structure appears innovative, and the flexibility to model non-Gaussian components is appealing. However, it is unclear whether the blossom tree factorization provides significant benefits over existing methods, such as non-paranormal models, sparse multivariate Gaussians, or forest-tree models. The authors' evaluation is limited to simulated data, which may favor their proposed approach.
Theorem 3.1's result on estimating negentropy is perplexing, as its relevance to the joint estimation problem is unclear. Furthermore, the method for learning the blossom tree structure seems inefficient, as it involves learning a sequence of models one non-blossom edge at a time, which may be impractical for moderately sized problems. A detailed comparison of the computational complexity of the proposed method with existing approaches, such as graphical lasso, non-paranormal, and forest-trees, is necessary.
The experiments section requires improvement, particularly with the inclusion of real-world data to demonstrate the practical value of the blossom tree factorization. Additional concerns include the potential confusion caused by the term "blossom tree," which has a different meaning in the context of the matching problem. The experiments should also clarify why the '0' trunks do not match the graphical lasso results and provide runtime comparisons for the different methods.
Specifically, the statement on maintaining tractable inference without limitations on the independence graph is misleading, as the approach encourages sparsity in the graph. While the article is well-written and introduces a novel factorization, the lack of real-world experimentation and the inefficient construction method raise concerns about the utility and practicality of the blossom tree factorization.
