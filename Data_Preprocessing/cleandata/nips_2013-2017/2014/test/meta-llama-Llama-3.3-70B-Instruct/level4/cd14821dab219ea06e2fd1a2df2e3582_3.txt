This manuscript examines the Nitzan-Paroush strategy, which optimally assigns weights to conditionally independent experts based on expected outcomes. The authors derive both upper and lower exponential concentration inequalities for the error associated with this optimal rule, with the upper bounds being particularly sharp and grounded in the Kearns-Saul inequality. Furthermore, they investigate scenarios where expert quality is unknown and must be inferred from data, proposing both frequentist and Bayesian methodologies, although the latter remains unanalyzed.
QUALITY
The findings presented are intriguing, substantial, and appear to be accurate upon review. Notably, the application of the Kearns-Saul inequality is striking, given its original purpose, and seems uniquely suited for this problem. The exponential bound in Theorem 1(i) is particularly robust, exhibiting linearity with respect to the number of experts who are correct with a probability exceeding 1/2 + epsilon, for any fixed epsilon > 0. However, several minor concerns and questions arise regarding the estimators, including both frequentist and Bayesian approaches.
Firstly, a minor suggestion is to replace the terms 'adaptive' and 'nonadaptive' with 'fully empirical' and 'oracle', respectively, to better reflect their distinctions.
Secondly, concerning Theorem 7, which addresses the adaptive, high-confidence, frequentist case, its utility hinges on demonstrating that event R occurs with high probability for sufficiently large sample sizes. Without such assurance, the theorem's applicability may be limited, as it might necessitate refraining from high-confidence decisions, thereby rendering the results less useful. The authors should provide additional insight into the sample sizes required for event R to hold with high probability, given the oracle, nonadaptive probabilities.
Regarding the Bayesian method, it appears to rely on the standard, unconditional Naive Bayes model, treating expert opinions as X-data and outcomes as Y. However, many Bayesians might instead condition on the X's and utilize conditional likelihood, effectively transforming Naive Bayes into logistic regression, which often yields superior performance. The authors should discuss this alternative approach and justify why it was not considered.
The choice of naive Bayes over a logistic regression approach also warrants clarification.
CLARITY
The manuscript is well-written, and despite not being an expert in probabilistic weighted-majority analysis, the content was easily followable.
ORIGINALITY
While the results exhibit some originality, the proof techniques employed are particularly innovative.
SIGNIFICANCE
The significance of this work is reasonably high, especially considering the novel application of the Kearns-Saul inequality. The authors provide concentration bounds on the error of weighted majority voting with optimal weights and demonstrate how to learn these weights from data. Both the results and the proof technique contribute to the manuscript's significance, with the latter being especially noteworthy.
