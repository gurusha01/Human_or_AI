This paper addresses an important challenge in Bayesian observer models: the issue of model identifiability. While Bayesian models are widely used to infer internal mental representations from behavioral data, their intrinsic degeneracy—where multiple combinations of priors, likelihoods, and loss functions yield indistinguishable results—raises concerns about the reliability of such inferences. The authors propose a novel framework for systematically testing the identifiability of Bayesian observer models, with a focus on improving experimental design. They demonstrate the utility of their framework through two case studies: (1) time interval estimation, where they evaluate the impact of experimental setups on recovering priors, and (2) speed perception under a slow-speed prior, where they validate the robustness of inferred internal representations.
Strengths
1. Novelty and Contribution: The paper provides a systematic framework for assessing identifiability in Bayesian observer models, a topic that has received limited attention despite its critical importance. This is a significant contribution to the field, as it addresses a foundational issue in the application of Bayesian models to psychophysics.
2. Theoretical Rigor: The authors present a well-structured mathematical framework, leveraging tools like Kullback-Leibler divergence to quantify identifiability. Their approach is both generalizable and computationally efficient, allowing for exploration of complex model spaces.
3. Practical Relevance: By linking identifiability to experimental design, the paper offers actionable insights for researchers designing psychophysical experiments. For instance, the findings about the detrimental effects of narrow loss functions in interval timing tasks are both surprising and valuable.
4. Case Studies: The application of the framework to two distinct tasks—time interval estimation and speed perception—demonstrates its versatility and practical utility. The validation of previous findings in speed perception adds credibility to the framework.
Weaknesses
1. Clarity: While the paper is mathematically rigorous, some sections (e.g., the derivation of the identifiability metric) are dense and may be challenging for readers unfamiliar with Bayesian modeling or information theory. Simplifying or summarizing key equations could improve accessibility.
2. Scope of Experimental Designs: The case studies focus on specific tasks and conditions, which, while illustrative, might limit the generalizability of the conclusions. For example, the framework's applicability to discrete-choice paradigms like 2AFC is mentioned but not explored.
3. Assumptions: The framework relies on several assumptions about the observer model (e.g., Gaussian priors, specific noise structures). While these are reasonable for the tasks considered, their validity in other contexts remains unclear.
Arguments for Acceptance
- The paper addresses a critical and underexplored problem in Bayesian modeling.
- It provides a novel, theoretically sound framework with practical implications for experimental design.
- The case studies demonstrate the framework's utility and align with prior empirical findings.
Arguments Against Acceptance
- The dense mathematical presentation may hinder accessibility for a broader audience.
- The framework's applicability to a wider range of tasks and paradigms is not fully demonstrated.
Recommendation
Overall, this paper makes a strong scientific contribution by addressing a fundamental issue in Bayesian observer models and offering a practical tool for researchers. While some clarity and scope limitations exist, these do not detract significantly from the paper's quality. I recommend acceptance, with minor revisions to improve clarity and discuss broader applicability.
