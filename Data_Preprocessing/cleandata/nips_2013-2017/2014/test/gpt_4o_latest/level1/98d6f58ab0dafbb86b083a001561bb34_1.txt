This paper introduces a novel perspective on the tradeoff between sample complexity and computation time in statistical estimators based on convex optimization. The authors propose that as the amount of data increases, optimization problems can be smoothed more aggressively, enabling faster computation without compromising statistical accuracy. This idea is developed in the context of regularized linear inverse problems (RLIPs) and supported by both theoretical analysis and experimental results. The paper builds on prior work, such as Shalev-Shwartz and Srebro's findings on faster algorithms with larger datasets [1], and extends the notion of time–data tradeoffs explored by Chandrasekaran and Jordan [6]. However, the authors distinguish their approach by introducing a continuous smoothing framework rather than discrete relaxations.
The paper's strengths lie in its technical rigor and clear contributions to the field. The theoretical results, such as the derivation of the statistical dimension for descent cones and the smoothing parameter's role in maintaining exact recovery, are well-supported and novel. The dual-smoothing algorithm is carefully described, and the experimental results for sparse vector and low-rank matrix recovery convincingly demonstrate the proposed time–data tradeoff. The authors also provide practical insights, such as the impact of matrix condition numbers on computational cost, which could guide future research and applications.
However, the paper has some weaknesses. First, while the theoretical framework is robust, the practical implementation of the smoothing parameter (e.g., setting it to µ(m)/4) appears heuristic and lacks a principled justification. This could limit the reproducibility and generalizability of the results. Second, the experiments, though compelling, are limited to Gaussian measurement matrices and specific problem settings (sparse vectors and low-rank matrices). It would be valuable to explore broader classes of problems and real-world datasets to validate the approach further. Additionally, the paper does not address the potential tradeoffs between smoothing and robustness in noisy settings, though the authors mention forthcoming work in this area.
Arguments for Acceptance:
1. Originality: The continuous smoothing framework and its application to time–data tradeoffs are novel and extend prior work meaningfully.
2. Significance: The results have implications for improving computational efficiency in large-scale optimization problems, a critical area in machine learning.
3. Technical Quality: The theoretical contributions are sound and well-supported by experiments.
4. Clarity: The paper is well-written and organized, making it accessible to both theoretical and applied audiences.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
1. Limited Scope: The experiments focus on specific problem settings and do not explore broader applicability or real-world datasets.
2. Heuristic Choices: The smoothing parameter lacks a principled derivation, which could affect reproducibility.
3. Incomplete Exploration: The paper does not address noisy settings, which are common in practical applications.
Overall, this paper makes a strong contribution to the understanding of time–data tradeoffs in convex optimization and provides a promising direction for future research. While there are areas for improvement, the strengths outweigh the weaknesses, and I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the heuristic nature of the smoothing parameter and to discuss potential extensions to noisy settings.
