The paper introduces SAGA, a novel incremental gradient optimization method, building on recent advancements in algorithms such as SAG, SVRG, and SDCA. SAGA improves upon these methods by offering better theoretical convergence rates, support for composite objectives with proximal operators, and applicability to non-strongly convex problems without modification. The authors provide a detailed theoretical analysis, proving linear convergence rates in the strongly convex case and establishing convergence guarantees for non-strongly convex problems. Experimental results validate SAGA's effectiveness across various datasets and problem settings, demonstrating competitive performance compared to existing methods.
Strengths:
1. Theoretical Contributions: The paper provides rigorous theoretical proofs for SAGA's convergence rates, which are better than those of SAG and SVRG in certain settings. The adaptivity to inherent strong convexity and support for composite objectives are significant advancements.
2. Unified Perspective: The authors present a comprehensive comparison of SAGA with related methods, offering a unified view of incremental gradient methods. This helps clarify the relationships and trade-offs between different approaches.
3. Practical Relevance: SAGA's ability to handle non-strongly convex problems without additional regularization is a practical advantage, reducing the need for parameter tuning. The algorithm's support for proximal operators broadens its applicability to real-world problems.
4. Experimental Validation: The experiments are well-designed and demonstrate SAGA's competitive performance across diverse datasets. The comparison with other methods, such as SVRG and SDCA, is thorough and informative.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity: While the theoretical analysis is robust, some sections of the paper, particularly the algorithm description and proofs, are dense and may be challenging for readers unfamiliar with the topic. Simplifying or summarizing key steps could improve accessibility.
2. Limited Scope of Experiments: The experiments focus primarily on standard datasets and do not explore SAGA's performance in more complex or large-scale settings, such as deep learning or distributed optimization.
3. Storage Requirements: Although the authors discuss storage optimizations, SAGA still requires maintaining a table of gradients, which may be prohibitive for very large datasets or high-dimensional problems.
4. Comparison with Recent Work: The paper does not sufficiently address how SAGA compares to more recent advancements in optimization methods beyond the cited works, potentially missing newer baselines.
