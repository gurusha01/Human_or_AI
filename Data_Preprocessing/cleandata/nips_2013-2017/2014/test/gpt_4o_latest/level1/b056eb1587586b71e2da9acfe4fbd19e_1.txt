This paper addresses the challenge of action recognition in real-world videos by proposing an attribute-based representation that bridges the gap between low-level features and class labels. The authors introduce two types of attributes: human-labeled and data-driven, and propose a novel method for selecting a compact and discriminative subset of attributes. The selection process is framed as a submodular optimization problem, combining entropy rate and weighted maximum coverage criteria. The proposed method is evaluated on the Olympic Sports and UCF101 datasets, demonstrating significant performance improvements over existing approaches.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Originality: The paper introduces a novel approach to attribute selection by combining entropy rate and maximum coverage criteria, which is a significant improvement over existing methods that do not explicitly consider discrimination capability. The use of submodular optimization ensures computational efficiency and theoretical guarantees.
2. Technical Soundness: The method is well-grounded in theory, with clear mathematical formulations and proofs of submodularity. The greedy optimization algorithm provides a (1-1/e)-approximation, which is a strong guarantee for NP-hard problems.
3. Experimental Validation: The authors provide extensive experiments on two challenging datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show clear improvements over baseline methods and state-of-the-art approaches.
4. Clarity: The paper is well-organized and clearly written, with detailed explanations of the methodology, experimental setup, and results. Figures and tables effectively support the claims made in the text.
5. Significance: The proposed method addresses a critical problem in action recognition and has the potential to impact related fields, such as multimedia retrieval and video surveillance.
Weaknesses:
1. Limited Scope of Evaluation: While the method is evaluated on two datasets, additional experiments on more diverse datasets (e.g., those with different types of actions or noise levels) would strengthen the generalizability of the approach.
2. Comparison with State-of-the-Art: Although the method outperforms many existing approaches, it does not achieve the best performance on UCF101. A discussion on why this might be the case and potential limitations of the method would be valuable.
3. Complexity of Implementation: While the theoretical contributions are strong, the practical implementation of the method, especially the extraction of data-driven attributes and the optimization process, may be challenging for practitioners. A discussion on computational complexity and runtime would be helpful.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper presents a novel and theoretically sound method for attribute selection in action recognition.
- The experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over baseline methods, highlighting the practical utility of the approach.
- The work addresses a critical gap in the field and has potential applications beyond action recognition.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The evaluation is limited to two datasets, which may not fully capture the robustness of the method across diverse scenarios.
- The method does not achieve state-of-the-art performance on all benchmarks, raising questions about its scalability and effectiveness in highly complex datasets.
Recommendation:
Overall, this paper makes a strong contribution to the field of action recognition by introducing a novel and effective attribute selection method. While there are some minor limitations, the strengths outweigh the weaknesses, and the work is a valuable addition to the conference. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the noted concerns.
