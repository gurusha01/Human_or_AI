This paper investigates the tradeoff between sample complexity and computation time in statistical estimators based on convex optimization, with a focus on regularized linear inverse problems (RLIP). The authors propose that as the amount of data increases, smoothing optimization problems more aggressively can yield faster computations without compromising statistical accuracy. They provide both theoretical and experimental evidence to support this claim, introducing a dual-smoothing algorithm to exploit this tradeoff. Two specific applications—sparse vector recovery and low-rank matrix recovery—are explored to demonstrate the practical implications of their approach.
Strengths:
1. Novel Contribution: The paper introduces a compelling perspective on leveraging excess data to reduce computational cost, which is a significant departure from traditional assumptions about algorithmic complexity scaling with input size. The proposed dual-smoothing approach is innovative and well-motivated.
2. Theoretical Rigor: The authors provide a solid theoretical foundation, including geometric insights into the time–data tradeoff and precise characterizations of statistical dimensions. The derivation of bounds for smoothing parameters and their connection to exact recovery conditions is particularly strong.
3. Practical Relevance: The paper addresses two widely studied problems—sparse vector recovery and low-rank matrix recovery—demonstrating the broad applicability of the proposed method. The experimental results convincingly show the computational benefits of aggressive smoothing.
4. Clarity of Results: The numerical experiments are well-designed and clearly presented, with meaningful comparisons to current practices. The observed speedups (e.g., 2.5× for sparse recovery and 5.4× for low-rank recovery) highlight the practical utility of the approach.
Weaknesses:
1. Limited Scope of Applications: While the examples of sparse vector and low-rank matrix recovery are compelling, the paper does not explore other potential applications in depth. This limits the generalizability of the proposed method.
2. Assumptions on Data and Matrices: The reliance on Gaussian measurement matrices and specific signal structures (e.g., sparsity or low rank) may restrict the applicability of the method to more general settings. The paper does not discuss how robust the approach is to deviations from these assumptions.
3. Lack of Discussion on Limitations: The paper does not explicitly acknowledge or discuss the limitations of the proposed method, such as potential challenges in selecting the smoothing parameter in practice or the impact of noisy data. While forthcoming work is mentioned, these aspects could have been briefly addressed here.
4. Reproducibility: Although the theoretical framework is detailed, the paper provides limited implementation details for the experiments, which may hinder reproducibility.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:
Pro:
- The paper presents a novel and well-supported contribution to the field of statistical computation.
- Theoretical insights are complemented by strong experimental validation.
- The proposed method has the potential to significantly impact practical applications in machine learning and optimization.
Con:
- The scope of applications is somewhat narrow, and the method's robustness to real-world deviations is unclear.
- The lack of explicit discussion on limitations and practical challenges detracts from the completeness of the work.
Recommendation:
Overall, this paper makes a significant contribution to the field by introducing a novel perspective on the time–data tradeoff in convex optimization. While there are some limitations, the strengths outweigh the weaknesses. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the discussion of limitations and provide more implementation details for reproducibility.
