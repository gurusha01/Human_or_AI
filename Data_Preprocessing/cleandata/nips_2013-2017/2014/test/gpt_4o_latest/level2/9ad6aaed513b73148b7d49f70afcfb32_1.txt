This paper presents a novel approach for inference on continuous Markov Random Fields (MRFs) with polynomial potentials by leveraging a concave-convex decomposition of multivariate polynomials. The authors prove that every even-degree polynomial can be decomposed into a sum of convex and concave polynomials, and they propose a method to compute this decomposition using sum-of-squares (SOS) optimization. This decomposition is then utilized within the Concave-Convex Procedure (CCCP) to iteratively solve the inference problem. The proposed method is evaluated on three applications—non-rigid 3D reconstruction, shape-from-shading, and image denoising—demonstrating superior performance in terms of computational efficiency and solution quality compared to existing techniques.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Theoretical Contribution: The paper makes a significant theoretical contribution by proving the existence of a concave-convex decomposition for even-degree polynomials and providing a constructive method to compute it. This is a valuable addition to the field of continuous graphical models.
2. Practical Relevance: The proposed method addresses a challenging problem in continuous MRFs, which are less explored compared to their discrete counterparts. The applications chosen—3D reconstruction, shape-from-shading, and image denoising—are highly relevant and demonstrate the practical utility of the approach.
3. Efficiency: The use of CCCP combined with SOS optimization allows the method to scale to large problems, as evidenced by the experiments on high-dimensional datasets. The reported computational gains over baseline methods are impressive.
4. Empirical Validation: The experimental results are comprehensive and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method across multiple domains. The comparisons with state-of-the-art methods are well-executed, and the performance improvements are clearly presented.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity: While the paper is technically sound, the presentation of the theoretical results could be improved. The proofs, while rigorous, are dense and may be difficult for readers unfamiliar with polynomial optimization or convex analysis to follow. Providing more intuition or visual examples for the decomposition would enhance accessibility.
2. Limitations and Generalization: The paper briefly mentions the limitations of SOS optimization (e.g., its gap with true convexity for higher-degree polynomials) but does not explore this in depth. Additionally, the extension to non-polynomial functions is only discussed briefly, and the practical feasibility of these extensions remains unclear.
3. Comparative Analysis: While the method is compared against strong baselines, some comparisons (e.g., with ADMM-Poly) are limited to smaller datasets due to computational constraints. It would be valuable to see how the method performs on other large-scale benchmarks or in real-world scenarios.
Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Enhance the clarity of the theoretical sections by including more intuitive explanations and illustrative examples.
2. Provide a more detailed discussion of the limitations of the approach, particularly regarding the scalability of SOS optimization for very high-degree polynomials or extremely large graphs.
3. Explore additional applications or benchmarks to further validate the generalizability of the method.
Recommendation:
This paper makes a strong theoretical and practical contribution to the field of continuous graphical models and polynomial optimization. While there are some areas where the clarity and scope could be improved, the novelty, technical rigor, and empirical validation make it a valuable addition to the conference. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the clarity and limitations discussed above.
