This paper revisits the classical problem of weighted expert voting from a statistical learning perspective, focusing on the consistency of the Nitzan-Paroush weighted majority rule under both known and unknown expert competence levels. The authors provide sharp error estimates for the optimal rule in the case of known competences and extend the analysis to scenarios where competences must be empirically estimated, offering both frequentist and Bayesian approaches. The paper also introduces non-standard proof techniques, derives nearly optimal bounds, and poses several open problems, making it a potentially valuable contribution to the field.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Originality: The paper addresses underexplored aspects of the Nitzan-Paroush rule, particularly its consistency and error bounds under varying assumptions. The frequentist and Bayesian analyses for unknown competence levels are insightful and represent a meaningful extension of prior work.
2. Technical Depth: The authors employ rigorous mathematical analysis, including the use of advanced tools like the Kearns-Saul inequality, to derive tight bounds. The results are asymptotically optimal and provide a strong theoretical foundation for the problem.
3. Clarity of Contributions: The paper clearly states its main contributions, including sharp error estimates for the optimal rule, a detailed analysis of empirical decision rules, and the introduction of a Bayesian approach. The open problems posed are well-motivated and could inspire further research.
4. Relation to Prior Work: The paper situates itself well within the broader literature, referencing foundational works in decision theory, machine learning, and crowdsourcing. It also highlights connections to related areas like boosting and PAC-Bayesian theory, which may help bridge gaps between communities.
Weaknesses:
1. Practical Usefulness: While the theoretical contributions are significant, the practical applicability of the results is less clear. For instance, the Bayesian approach, though elegant, lacks a computable or bounded error probability, limiting its immediate utility.
2. Empirical Validation: The paper is purely theoretical, with no experimental results to validate the derived bounds or compare the proposed methods with existing approaches in real-world settings.
3. Complexity of Presentation: The paper is mathematically dense, which may limit accessibility for a broader audience. While the proofs are rigorous, they could benefit from additional intuition or illustrative examples to enhance clarity.
4. Incomplete Analysis of Open Problems: The open problems, particularly in the Bayesian setting, are intriguing but leave significant gaps. For instance, the inability to estimate the probability of error for the Bayesian rule is a notable limitation.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper makes a strong theoretical contribution by addressing a classic problem with modern tools and perspectives.
- The results are novel, technically sound, and advance the state of the art in understanding weighted majority voting.
- The open problems posed could stimulate further research in both theory and applications.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The lack of empirical validation limits the paper's practical impact.
- The Bayesian approach, while promising, is incomplete without a computable error estimate.
- The dense mathematical presentation may hinder accessibility for a broader audience.
Recommendation:
I recommend acceptance with minor revisions. The paper's theoretical contributions are significant, and the open problems are compelling. However, the authors should consider adding illustrative examples or simulations to validate their results and improve accessibility. Addressing the computability of the Bayesian error probability, even partially, would also strengthen the paper.
