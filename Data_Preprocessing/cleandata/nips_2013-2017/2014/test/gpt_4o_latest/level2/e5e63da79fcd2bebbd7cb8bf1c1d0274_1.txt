The paper introduces DeepID2, a novel deep learning-based approach for face recognition that leverages both face identification and verification signals to learn effective feature representations. The authors argue that these dual supervisory signals address the core challenge of face recognition: reducing intra-personal variations while increasing inter-personal differences. The proposed method achieves a state-of-the-art face verification accuracy of 99.15% on the LFW dataset, significantly reducing the error rate by 67% compared to prior deep learning approaches.
Strengths:
1. Technical Soundness: The paper is technically robust, with a clear explanation of the dual supervisory signals. The identification signal enhances inter-personal variations, while the verification signal reduces intra-personal variations. The combination is well-justified through theoretical analysis and empirical results.
2. Experimental Validation: The authors provide extensive experiments, including ablation studies on the effects of the identification and verification signals, comparisons of different loss functions, and the impact of varying the number of identities during training. The results convincingly demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach.
3. Significance: Achieving 99.15% accuracy on the LFW dataset is a notable advancement in face recognition, bringing machine performance closer to human-level accuracy. The method is also computationally efficient, with a feature extraction time of 35 ms per image, making it practical for real-world applications.
4. Novelty: The integration of identification and verification signals into a unified framework is innovative. The paper also introduces a feature selection mechanism to reduce redundancy, further enhancing efficiency.
5. Clarity: The paper is well-written and organized, with detailed descriptions of the methodology, experiments, and results. Figures and tables effectively support the narrative.
Weaknesses:
1. Limited Discussion of Limitations: While the paper achieves impressive results, it does not adequately discuss potential limitations, such as performance on datasets with more diverse conditions or scalability to larger datasets.
2. Generalization to Other Tasks: Although the authors claim that DeepID2 features generalize well to new identities, additional experiments on tasks beyond face verification (e.g., face clustering or retrieval) would strengthen this claim.
3. Comparison with Non-Deep Learning Methods: The focus is primarily on comparisons with deep learning approaches. Including results from traditional methods could provide a broader context for the contributions.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:
Pros:
- Significant improvement in face verification accuracy.
- Innovative combination of identification and verification signals.

Recommendation:
I recommend accepting this paper for publication. The work is a substantial contribution to the field of face recognition, advancing the state of the art with a well-justified and rigorously evaluated approach. Addressing the identified weaknesses in a future revision would further enhance its impact.
