The paper proposes a novel approach for action recognition in videos by leveraging high-level action attributes, both human-labeled and data-driven, and introducing a discriminative and compact attribute-based representation. The authors address the limitations of existing methods, such as noisy or redundant attributes, by formulating the attribute selection process as a submodular optimization problem. They propose three selection criteria and combine them into an objective function that balances entropy rate and weighted maximum coverage. A greedy optimization algorithm is used to achieve a near-optimal solution with a (1-1/e)-approximation guarantee. Experimental results on the Olympic Sports and UCF101 datasets demonstrate significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Innovation: The paper introduces a novel submodular optimization framework for attribute selection, which is a significant improvement over prior methods that rely on either clustering-based or latent variable approaches. The combination of entropy rate and maximum coverage is well-motivated and effective.
2. Comprehensive Evaluation: The authors validate their method on two challenging datasets, Olympic Sports and UCF101, and compare it against several state-of-the-art approaches. The results convincingly demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method, particularly in terms of classification accuracy.
3. Theoretical Soundness: The submodularity of the proposed objective function is rigorously established, and the use of a greedy algorithm with a provable approximation guarantee ensures robustness.
4. Practical Utility: The method is shown to work well with both human-labeled and data-driven attributes, making it versatile and applicable to a wide range of action recognition tasks.
5. Clarity and Organization: The paper is well-written and logically structured. The mathematical formulations and algorithms are clearly presented, and the experimental results are thoroughly analyzed.
Weaknesses:
1. Limited Discussion of Limitations: While the method is effective, the paper does not sufficiently discuss potential limitations, such as scalability to larger datasets or the computational cost of the greedy optimization algorithm.
2. Dependence on Attribute Quality: The performance of the method heavily relies on the quality of the initial attribute sets. While the authors propose a dictionary learning method for data-driven attributes, the impact of poor-quality human-labeled attributes is not fully explored.
3. Comparisons with Non-Submodular Methods: The paper primarily compares its approach to other submodular selection methods. A broader comparison with non-submodular or deep learning-based attribute selection techniques could strengthen the evaluation.
4. Reproducibility: While the paper provides sufficient theoretical and experimental details, the lack of publicly available code or implementation details may hinder reproducibility.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper addresses a critical problem in action recognition and provides a novel, theoretically sound, and practically effective solution.
- The experimental results are compelling and demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods.
- The proposed approach has potential applications beyond action recognition, such as in other domains requiring attribute-based representations.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The lack of discussion on computational efficiency and scalability may limit the practical applicability of the method to very large datasets.
- The reliance on high-quality initial attributes could be a bottleneck in scenarios where such attributes are unavailable or noisy.
Recommendation:
Overall, this paper makes a strong contribution to the field of action recognition and submodular optimization. While there are minor areas for improvement, the strengths far outweigh the weaknesses. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions, particularly to address the discussion of limitations and reproducibility.
