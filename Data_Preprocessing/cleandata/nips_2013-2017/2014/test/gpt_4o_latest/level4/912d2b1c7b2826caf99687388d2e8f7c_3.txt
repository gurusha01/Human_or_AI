I have reviewed the authors' response and found their comments to be satisfactory in addressing my primary concerns. Below, I elaborate on some of these points (denoting additional comments with ). After reading the other reviews, my evaluation of the paper remains unchanged; I believe it is a strong submission and recommend its acceptance. However, I do not consider the theoretical or experimental contributions sufficient to elevate it to the oral/spotlight category.
The paper tackles the problem of identifying structured low-rank matrices where the structure is encoded using a linear map, and nuclear norm regularization is applied. The authors propose a modified formulation of this problem, which enables the use of the generalized conditional gradient method. They present an algorithm that integrates techniques to accelerate convergence and demonstrate its convergence properties. Empirical results indicate that the proposed algorithm is significantly faster than existing methods and can handle much larger problem instances.
Strengths:
1. The paper addresses a fundamental optimization problem relevant to numerous machine learning and signal processing tasks. The authors introduce a novel approach that identifies solutions more efficiently than state-of-the-art methods. The empirical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach across two practical application scenarios.
Weaknesses:
1. The authors achieve substantial computational efficiency by modifying the objective function, which no longer directly penalizes the rank of the structured matrix. While the authors provide three reasonable arguments for this modification shortly after introducing the objective function in (7), the paper does not empirically or theoretically explore two of the proposed approaches: satisfying the linear constraint asymptotically via a homotopy scheme or exactly through a projection. The theoretical results focus on the convergence of the algorithm with respect to the modified objective function but do not quantify the discrepancy between the obtained solution and the original formulation. Additionally, Figures 2(c) and 2(f) reveal some unusual behavior in the rank of the solution during convergence. This behavior is neither discussed nor clarified, leaving it unclear when the algorithm should be terminated to yield an appropriate solution.
    The authors argue that "any formulation that achieves this goal should be sufficient for the application." While I find this argument reasonable, the paper currently presents (7) as a relaxation or approximation of (5), implying that it seeks the same solution. It would be helpful to explicitly clarify that (7) represents an alternative utility function targeting the same overarching objective (a low-rank model).   
    Regarding the experimental results and the algorithm's behavior, it would strengthen the paper to include additional discussion, either in the main text or supplementary material, expanding on the points raised in the authors' response. 
Comments:
- Why does Theorem 1 reference [28]? While [28] contains a similar theorem and proof approach, the result does not appear to be directly taken from there. What does ([28]) signify in this context?  
   The authors have clarified that the citation should appear in the proof, following a statement acknowledging that the proof technique is inspired by the method in [28]. 
In summary, the paper addresses a critical optimization problem in machine learning and signal processing and introduces a novel procedure that significantly improves computational efficiency. This is achieved by modifying the objective function, but the paper would benefit from a more thorough discussion and analysis of the implications of this modification.
