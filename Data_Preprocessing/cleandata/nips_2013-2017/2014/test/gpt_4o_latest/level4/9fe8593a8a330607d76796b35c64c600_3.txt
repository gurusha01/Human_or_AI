SUMMARY:  
This paper introduces a model designed to analyze policy decisions in microfinance markets, particularly those requiring causal knowledge. The model is supported by several studies and is analyzed to demonstrate the existence of equilibrium prices. A computational framework is subsequently proposed to compute these equilibria and infer the model's parameters using real microfinance data. Finally, the authors apply this framework to address various policy questions.
CRITIQUE:  
This is a strong paper by all measures. It is clearly written, well-motivated, supported by both analysis and data, introduces innovative techniques, and has the potential for significant impact. I highlight a few specific issues below and question whether this paper is an ideal fit for NIPS, though I defer to more senior reviewers on this matter.
SUGGESTION:  
The assumption that microfinance institutions (MFIs) are non-profits is central to the analysis but also raises some intriguing questions. It would be valuable to explore how the results might change if MFIs were profit-seeking, either analytically or empirically. For instance, could social welfare improve if MFIs were slightly profit-oriented, potentially reducing their reliance on subsidies over time? Expanding the model to address this scenario could provide deeper insights.
SPECIFIC COMMENTS:  
Page 2:  
- "…[13] and joint-liability contracts would mitigate the risks of adverse selection [13]" — It is unusual to cite [13] twice in the same sentence.  
- "study of causality" — This term is vague and could be interpreted broadly (e.g., as all of science). While the appendix provides a thorough explanation, a brief clarification of "causality" within the paper's scope would be helpful.  
- "Put differently, what would be a game-theoretic analog of the do operation [21, p. 23] used for surgeries in probabilistic settings?" — This sentence lacks context and is unclear unless the reader is familiar with the reference. Please provide additional explanation.  
Page 3:  
- "subset of the village"[s] — Add the missing "s."  
- "interest rate at which MFI i gives loan" — The phrase "gives loan" feels awkward; consider rephrasing.  
- "max{ri} 1" — This is abrupt and could benefit from an explicit clarification that you indeed mean "max 1."  
- "each MFI i is optimizing (P_M)" — Add "the left-hand side of" for clarity, as one cannot directly optimize an inequality.  
Page 4:  
- "we model the village side as non-corporate agents." — Where does this assumption appear in the model?  
- Property 3.2 — Provide an interpretation of this property in plain language.  
- "trivial allocations" — Remind the reader what x represents and explain why these allocations are considered trivial.  
Page 5:  
- "that a more restricted case" — This sentence contains an error; please revise.  
- "Change ri as described later." — Reference a specific equation number to help the reader locate the explanation, as it is not immediately obvious.  
Page 6:  
- "Our model computes lower equilibrium interest rate" — This phrase is unclear; consider rephrasing for better readability.  
Overall, the paper is clear, well-motivated, supported by rigorous analysis and data, introduces novel techniques, and has the potential to make a meaningful impact.
