In this paper, the authors initially demonstrate that multivariate polynomial functions of even degree can be decomposed into convex and concave components. They leverage this property to address the MAP inference problem in continuous Markov Random Fields. Finally, they present experimental results on three applications: 3D reconstruction, shape from shading, and image denoising.
--> The paper is well-written and addresses the significant challenge of solving continuous MRF problems. The authors provide a thorough theoretical analysis of their proposed algorithm.
Minor comments:
--> The authors assert that their approach significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of both efficiency and accuracy. However, this claim is not fully substantiated in the results section. For instance, in all three experiments, their algorithm takes longer than the L-BFGS method. If this is indeed the case, it should be explicitly acknowledged in the text.
--> The authors should clarify the observed fluctuations in the energy versus sample index curve in Fig. 2.
--> I recommend providing more detailed explanations for the tables within their captions.
The paper introduces a theoretically robust algorithm for decomposing even-degree polynomials into convex and concave components. The authors thoroughly analyze the algorithm's properties and apply it to solve continuous MRF problems. Overall, the paper is well-written.
