Review - Summary:  
The authors introduce "tag structure regularization," a novel regularization technique for structured prediction models. During training, the model is penalized based on losses computed over sub-structures of the training data. The core idea is to enforce independent predictions for each sub-structure, thereby limiting the model's reliance on long-range dependencies across the graph. The authors provide a theoretical analysis suggesting that this regularization reduces generalization error bounds and accelerates the convergence of SGD. Empirical results on sequential prediction tasks demonstrate that tuning the regularization strength can achieve state-of-the-art accuracies while also speeding up training.

(+ Pros, - Cons)  
+ The central idea of this paper is compelling. The authors argue that breaking training samples into sub-samples during learning enhances the generalization of structured models. This is intuitively appealing: the regularization encourages the model to depend more on local information rather than messages from other parts of the graph, potentially reducing error propagation and yielding a "simpler" model. Viewed differently, if a model can make accurate predictions without relying on message passing, the proposed regularization will favor that simpler model, unlike standard approaches that lack such a preference.
- However, the theoretical analysis appears to make questionable assumptions and may not adopt the most appropriate framework for analysis. While increasing the regularization parameter α does tighten the bound, at its extreme setting (α = n), the bound remains significantly looser compared to other structured prediction generalization bounds. For instance, the original MMMN paper (Taskar et al.) achieved logarithmic complexity in both the multi-class label size and the number of variables (l in that work, n here). Similarly, London et al. used PAC-Bayes analysis to show that for templated models, increasing the example size can actually reduce generalization error. In the limit, an entire templated model could be learned from a single example. Thus, using n as the measure of structural complexity seems inconsistent, especially since most applications (including those in this paper) employ feature templates (e.g., bi-grams). While the analysis may be technically correct, the authors need to reconcile their approach with prior work to make their claims more coherent.
- The n^4 term in the generalization bound seems excessively large. From the supplemental material, this term appears to arise from the linear decomposition of loss in Lemma 6, combined with the need to multiply the norms of two examples (potentially O(n)) and the linear decomposition of the regularization term (O(n/α)). This suggests that the chosen approach to analysis may not be optimal.
- Prior work has employed more nuanced measures of graph complexity in generalization bounds, such as concentration inequalities that capture the maximum dependence of one variable on others in the graph. A more promising analytical approach might involve relating the proposed regularization to the resulting model complexity using such measures, particularly under the assumption of templating. Simply equating complexity with n seems overly simplistic.
+ Interestingly, the proposed tag structure regularization bears similarities to dropout, a trendy idea in the field. By removing edges in the graph for each example, the method effectively generates new examples. In the case of sequences, this results in disconnected components, but the approach could generalize to other graph structures. In this sense, the paper provides valuable insights into related ideas.
+ Despite the theoretical concerns, the experimental results are robust, and the proposed method is straightforward to implement and validate. While the analysis may not take the ideal approach, the simplicity and novelty of the idea, coupled with strong empirical evidence, make this work a valuable contribution to the community.
