Quality and Originality: The emphasis on addressing the online setting in recommendation systems is appreciated, as this represents a genuinely challenging problem in domains such as movies, books, and music. The introductory material is well-written and of high quality. While I am not an expert in the area, the performance guarantees and proofs appear to be correct. However, the Collaborative-Greedy model itself is less compelling. Although it demonstrates better performance compared to two other models, the datasets used in the experiments are quite small, making it difficult to gauge how the model would perform on more realistic datasets, such as the Netflix Prize or Million Song Dataset. The authors acknowledge this limitation, noting that a comprehensive validation would require deploying an actual interactive online recommendation system. That said, the primary focus of the paper seems to be a theoretical investigation of possibilities, and the datasets used appear sufficient to support the authors' claims. I found the paper's concluding observation particularly insightful: that two distinct forms of exploration are beneficial for learning mixed distributions in an active learning context.
Clarity and Significance: This paper lies outside my primary area of expertise. While I found the paper to be "locally clear" (i.e., I was able to understand the content of individual paragraphs), I struggled to fully grasp the broader context and overarching contributions. The paper investigates the online setting in collaborative filtering, introduces a model and learning framework for online recommendation, provides performance guarantees (accompanied by proofs), and discusses experimental findings.
