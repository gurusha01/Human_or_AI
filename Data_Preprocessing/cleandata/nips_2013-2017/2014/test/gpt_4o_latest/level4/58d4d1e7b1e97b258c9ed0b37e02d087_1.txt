In this paper, the authors introduce a framework for comparing Bayesian models applied to behavioral data. To achieve this, they provide an overview of the Bayesian Decision Theory framework, identify areas of non-identifiability, and describe the types of constraints needed to make each component of the Bayesian framework identifiable. They proceed by imposing assumptions to constrain each term in the framework, analyzing the distinguishability of parameter values in their model, and applying the method to two case studies that utilize Bayesian decision theory to explain behavioral responses: time interval estimation and motion perception.
The challenges of identifying internal representations and processes have been longstanding issues in cognitive science and psychology. For instance, Anderson (1978) examined conditions under which representational formats can mimic one another, demonstrating that they are indistinguishable without imposing constraints on processes (when the representations make equivalent distinctions of their inputs). In recent years, this issue has been a significant limitation of the Bayesian framework, hindering its broader adoption (e.g., Jones & Love, 2011; Bowers & Davis, 2012, with the latter specifically addressing speed perception as an example).
While the article addresses a topic of substantial theoretical significance, is well-written, and generally presents its arguments in a clear and effective manner, I have two primary concerns. First, it overlooks a substantial body of prior literature on model comparison in cognitive science and psychology, making it difficult to assess the novelty and contribution of the proposed framework. The general approach to model comparison outlined by the authors bears similarities to earlier work (e.g., Pitt, Myung, & Zhang, 2002; Navarro, Pitt, & Myung, 2004). Second, the assumptions made by the authors occasionally appear arbitrary, raising questions about the extent to which their framework relies on these choices. For instance, why is $p_{meas}$ defined as in Equation 3? Is specifying the parameter values in Equation 12 truly sufficient to fully characterize a cognitive or perceptual process? While I acknowledge that the framework is robust and capable of representing a wide range of sensory models, this alone does not seem to justify the assumptions made. At a minimum, the article should provide a more thorough discussion and justification of the assumptions used to constrain the Bayesian models for identifiability.
Minor comments:  
- Line 53: The phrase "It is a trivial mathematical factâ€¦" could be more helpful if the authors explained why it is true rather than simply stating it as trivial, as it may not be obvious to all readers.  
- Line 73: The second "nor" appears to be a typographical error and should likely be replaced with "or."  
- Figure 2: The caption is unclear regarding the meaning of the star and dashed lines. Both are described as representing the true value, which could confuse readers.
