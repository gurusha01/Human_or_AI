The paper builds upon prior work in graphical models by extending beyond Gaussian modeling for real-valued attributes. The key contribution appears to be the integration of a non-parametric forest density estimation algorithm—based on a non-parametric generalization of the classical Chow-Liu algorithm for learning tree graphical models—with the graphical LASSO (glasso). This combination results in what the authors term a "blossom tree graphical model." The paper presents a theoretical statistical-consistency result and provides a limited set of experiments.
 On Section 3: Could the authors elaborate on the implications of the stated result for machine learning* properties, such as PAC bounds or large-deviation guarantees, rather than solely asymptotic, data-size-dependent bounds? Additionally, can the authors provide insights into the behavior of the constant N? For example, could they offer an expression for a lower or upper bound, even if approximate? Similar to the asymptotic convergence seen in the Central Limit Theorem, it is unclear when the large-deviation bounds presented in the paper become practically relevant. Without clarity on N and the specific sample size n, the result, while statistically interesting, appears to have limited utility for machine learning applications.
As a result, I recommend moving Section 3 entirely to the supplementary material and replacing it with more experimental evaluations. For instance, the sections Supplementary Simulations 1 and 2 could be incorporated into the main body of the paper. Even then, a more comprehensive evaluation would strengthen the paper, such as experiments that vary the class or form of the underlying ground-truth density, the structure of the underlying graphs, the number of samples, and the number of attributes or variables.
* Given the context of the paper, a citation to the original Chow-Liu algorithm from 1968 seems appropriate, even if only briefly mentioned:
C. K. Chow, and C. N. Liu, "Approximating Discrete Probability Distributions with Dependence Trees," IEEE Transactions of Information Theory, vol. IT-14, no. 3, May 1968.
Although the statistical setups differ (discrete vs. continuous), and the current work extends beyond simple tree/forest/blossom representations, it is clear that the foundational approach is rooted in Chow-Liu's seminal work.
* It would have been valuable to see experiments conducted on real-world datasets, such as the microarray data used by Liu et al. (JMLR, 2011). If access to such data is restricted, could the authors explore alternative datasets, such as fMRI data?
* I am curious about the key distinctions between the proposed approach and prior work on forest density estimation, which forms the basis of this submission. Specifically, how does this work compare to the following studies in terms of machine learning relevance, as opposed to purely statistical distinctions?

* Considering the long history since Chow and Liu's 1968 work, I was initially skeptical that no similar approach had been attempted before. However, I have not been able to identify any prior work that closely resembles the authors' proposal. This is somewhat surprising, and I commend the authors for the originality and novelty of their approach. Of course, if a related reference were to surface, it would not significantly diminish the authors' contribution, as the technique has not been revisited in recent years despite the growing interest in modeling continuous/real-valued attributes over the past decade.
Overall, this is a clean, interesting, and unexpectedly novel approach to modeling multiple real-valued attributes or random variables. However, the paper would benefit from more extensive experimental and empirical evaluations.
