The paper presents a Bayesian model of perception, incorporating mathematical formulations for sensory noise, likelihood functions, prior probability distributions, loss functions, and response distributions. A notable strength of the model lies in its balance between robustness and mathematical convenience. Specifically, it is capable of addressing a wide range of scenarios (e.g., stimulus-dependent noise) while maintaining computational tractability (e.g., inference remains feasible). The authors also highlight the model's identifiability, meaning that parameter estimates can be readily evaluated and distinguished.
Overall, I appreciate this paper and support its acceptance to the NIPS conference. The proposed model offers a mathematically elegant framework for formalizing perceptual estimation across various experimental contexts. Nonetheless, I have some concerns. The model's contribution appears incremental, as it aligns closely with the style and scope of other Bayesian models recently published in the literature (notably in journals like PLoS Computational Biology). For instance, the following papers are relevant for comparison:
- Acerbi, L., Wolpert, D. M., & Vijayakumar, S. (2012). Internal representations of temporal statistics and feedback calibrate motor-sensory interval timing. PLoS Computational Biology, 8(11), e1002771.
- Acerbi, L., Vijayakumar, S., & Wolpert, D. M. (2014). On the origins of suboptimality in human probabilistic inference. PLoS Computational Biology, 10(6), e1003661.
While the current submission is not identical to these or other prior works, it is sufficiently similar that it would be fair to characterize its contribution as incremental.
I recommend that the authors revise the manuscript to include a new section that reviews recent Bayesian models of perception. This section should explicitly articulate how the proposed model represents a significant advancement over previously published models.
One additional comment concerns the emphasis on the model's mathematical identifiability. While it is true that the parameters are identifiable under the model's mathematical assumptions, the term "identifiable" can have broader interpretations. For instance, the model does not resolve the issue of distinguishing whether an experimental subject's errors arise from sensory noise, decision noise, or response noise. This limitation means the model does not address the identifiability challenges that are most pertinent to perceptual scientists. I suggest the authors address this point in the revised manuscript. 
In summary, the paper provides a mathematically elegant framework for perceptual estimation, but its novel contribution is incremental, given the existence of closely related prior work.
