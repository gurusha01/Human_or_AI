The paper proposes a GP-Vol model to flexibly account for time-dependent changes in variance and introduces a novel online algorithm for fully Bayesian inference under this framework.
The manuscript is well-written, the proposed inference method appears technically robust, and the results presented are promising. However, while the model employs a non-parametric approach by leveraging a GP prior on the transition function, this extension of prior work in the finance domain seems somewhat straightforward and lacks significant novelty. As such, I would not assign a high score to the paper in terms of originality. That said, the overall presentation is clear, and the work is convincing.
Here are a few questions for the authors:
(1) The reported computational savings compared to other methods are impressive, and the results are promising. Have the authors tested the model with higher-order dependencies on variances and returns, i.e., values of p and q greater than 1? How do these higher-order dependencies affect computational efficiency and algorithmic performance? Additionally, can the optimal values for p and q be learned from the data, perhaps by evaluating test likelihoods?
(2) The authors mention bias introduced by sampling from artificial dynamics in the kernel. Have the authors quantified this bias? It would strengthen the paper to provide a clearer understanding of when and how RAPCF might fail, rather than simply stating that "the issues have limited impacts in practice."
(3) It is unclear how the shrinkage parameter, lambda, can be selected in practical applications. Could the authors elaborate on this?
In this work, the evolution of time-varying variance is modeled using a GP, and a corresponding fully Bayesian inference method is developed. Overall, the paper is well-written and technically sound.
