The paper introduces the Witness Protection Program (WPP) algorithm, which calculates bounds on an inferred average causal effect (ACE) while accounting for potential violations of the standard faithfulness assumption in causal inference. This is achieved by defining a set of relaxation parameters to limit unfaithful interactions and employing a linear programming framework to compute the upper and lower bounds on the ACE for a specific link, adjusting for an appropriate set of covariates under these constraints.
The topic is timely and of considerable interest, making the paper both relevant and engaging. I appreciate the approach and the concepts presented: it is a systematic attempt to explicitly quantify the influence of weak unfaithful interaction patterns, combined with established mathematical tools to address the associated maximization and minimization problems.
However, whether the proposed method effectively captures this influence remains uncertain. The output—a distribution over bounds as a function of 'unfaithful relaxations' relative to a given model—is conceptually challenging to interpret. The likelihood of these unfaithful instances, and consequently the practical relevance of the derived bounds, is unclear. Many relaxations result in excessively wide bounds, rendering them potentially uninformative. Furthermore, the method does not provide a preferred point estimate within the interval, even though readers may interpret it as such.
The experimental evaluation is inadequate: the 'bias' metric used to compare WPP with competing methods is inappropriate, as it measures fundamentally different aspects. This raises doubts about whether WPP offers practical value to users or merely adds complexity. Additionally, the method's performance on the influenza dataset is concerning: an ACE interval of (-0.23, 0.64) offers little actionable insight, though it might reflect the inherent uncertainty in the problem.
Quality
The paper presents a technically sound approach, with many details provided in the supplementary material (which I did not review in depth). The ideas are well-motivated, though the broader context is occasionally unclear. Critical aspects, such as the selection of relaxation parameters, are deferred to future work, making it difficult to assess potential challenges with this part of the method. The experimental evaluation lacks balance and robustness.
Clarity
The paper is reasonably well-written, though the conclusion could be improved. The algorithmic steps and their modifications, involving multiple subtly different parameters, are difficult to follow, partly due to insufficient explanation of certain methodological details. While I believe I understand the process, I am uncertain whether I could fully implement it based solely on the description provided; the supplementary material may address this gap.
Originality
The method appears to be a novel combination of established techniques. It is closely related to, yet distinct from, recent work on the same problem. As such, it has the potential to inspire productive cross-pollination among various approaches in this domain.
Significance
The paper's significance lies primarily in the ideas and direction it introduces, demonstrating how to incorporate additional techniques to tackle this challenging problem. While the current implementation may not yet be practical for end-users, some of the concepts underlying the WPP algorithm could play a significant role in future advancements.
Summary
The paper addresses a relevant and topical problem with an interesting method that will likely attract attention. While the current application has limitations, the approach has the potential to generalize to broader cases. The paper is reasonably well-written but could benefit from improvements. The proposed solutions are technically intriguing, though the experimental evaluation is weak. The practical relevance and interpretation of the output distribution over bounds remain unclear.
