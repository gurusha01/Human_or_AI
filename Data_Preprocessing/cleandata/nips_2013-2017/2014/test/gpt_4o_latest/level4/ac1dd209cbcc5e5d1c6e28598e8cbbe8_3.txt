This paper introduces a method for modeling latent state linear dynamical systems, with an emphasis on uncovering hierarchical structures within the dynamics. To achieve this, the authors propose an optimization framework that enforces a specific group sparsity pattern in the relationship between the latent (global) and local dynamics. They demonstrate that this approach successfully recovers the underlying connectivity structure of a fluid flow partial differential equation (PDE).
Overall, I find this to be a strong paper that merits acceptance to NIPS. However, there are a few areas where the paper could be improved. While the underlying model is relatively simple and accessible to most of the NIPS audience, the presentation is heavily tied to convection-diffusion equations, which may be less familiar to many readers. Ultimately, this connection seems to hinge on the penalization of the latent state dynamics (specifically, the "D(Î³)A" term in the regularization function g), but this relationship felt somewhat unclear to me. Since this aspect appears to be a central contribution of the paper (as the other penalty functions are standard group LASSO or LASSO penalties derived from sparse structure relaxations), I would have appreciated a more thorough explanation of this element. The discussion surrounding equation (3), in particular, is somewhat dense and may be challenging for much of the NIPS audience to follow.
Given this, I believe it is important to further emphasize one of the paper's broader "big ideas": that learned dynamical systems can achieve significantly better performance when regularization is informed by the underlying physical process. This could be the most impactful takeaway for the NIPS audience. The paper presents a novel optimization approach for constructing hierarchical systems based on convection-diffusion dynamics. While some of the key elements are somewhat difficult to unpack, I believe the underlying idea is compelling and deserving of publication.
