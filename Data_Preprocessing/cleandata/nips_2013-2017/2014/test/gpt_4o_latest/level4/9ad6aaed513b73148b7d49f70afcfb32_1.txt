This paper presents a highly interesting and significantly novel approach to addressing continuous Markov random field energies with polynomial potentials. A well-motivated and insightful method in this domain (ADMM-Poly) was introduced at CVPR 2013 [20], making it the natural baseline for comparison. The proposed approach is convincingly demonstrated to be superior, as it is both elegant in design and computationally efficient.
The core idea of the method lies in decomposing polynomials into a difference of convex functions. To achieve this, the authors propose a constructive approach specifically for polynomials of even degree, which represents one of the paper's key contributions. They show that this decomposition task can be formulated as a semi-definite program, solvable using standard optimization tools. With this decomposition in hand, the overall inference problem is reformulated as a DC programming task, which the authors tackle using the convex-concave procedure (CCCP).
The primary limitation of the approach appears to be that the semi-definite program for obtaining a DC decomposition of the polynomials may not always yield a solution, as it is an approximation of an exact but NP-hard problem. While the authors note that their method performs well for low-degree polynomials in practice (as evidenced by experiments), this issue raises some concerns. It would be beneficial for the authors to expand on this point, as it could pose a challenge to the broader adoption of the method. Specifically, how frequently does this limitation arise in practice? For which types of polynomials? Are there any potential alternatives or workarounds? Addressing these questions would strengthen the paper, as a fallback strategy would be necessary in cases where the decomposition fails.
The authors also demonstrate that, in certain cases, for some continuous energies, a DC decomposition can be directly observed without relying on the aforementioned construction algorithm. In such scenarios, the method essentially reduces to applying CCCP to continuous energies.
Quality:  
The paper is technically robust, though a more detailed discussion of the potential failure to construct polynomial decompositions would be valuable. The experimental evaluation is diverse and the results are highly compelling. The proposed method clearly outperforms ADMM-Poly, the primary baseline, in terms of both speed and solution quality.
Clarity:  
The manuscript is well-written, though the technical depth of the material makes it somewhat challenging to follow at times. One area that could benefit from clarification is the claim regarding the global convergence of the proposed approach (inherited from CCCP). It seems likely that this refers to "convergence for any initialization" rather than "convergence to a global optimum." As far as this reviewer is aware, CCCP guarantees convergence to either an optimum or a saddle point, but not necessarily to the global optimum. The current phrasing may lead readers to misinterpret the claim as guaranteeing global optimality.  
Similarly, the authors state in lines 039ff that Gaussian belief propagation "retrieves the optimum for arbitrary graphs when the potentials are Gaussian." This is inaccurate, as there are two known convergence conditions—one based on diagonal dominance and the other on the spectral radius of the system matrix—that must be satisfied.
Originality:  
The approach is novel to this reviewer, and the paper develops substantial theoretical contributions.
Significance:  
The proposed method has wide-ranging and impactful applications in computer vision and imaging. The experimental results are impressive, and the approach has the potential to benefit many researchers and practitioners in these fields. In conclusion, this is a highly novel submission that introduces new theoretical insights and demonstrates strong empirical performance. For these reasons, I recommend the paper for acceptance.
