The authors formulate the interactions within a microfinance market as a game between banks and villages [typo: lenders]. They demonstrate that these interactions exhibit a market-clearing equilibrium. The proposed model is applied to microfinance data, where the authors fit the data to a nearby equilibrium solution. The resulting parameters are then used to predict market performance under various perturbations.
The primary contribution of the paper appears to be the equilibrium analysis for microfinance markets (similar analyses have been conducted in other domains, such as paid search auctions) [clarification: by "analysis," I am referring to the inferences drawn from the computed equilibrium]. However, the paper is not currently in a publishable state and requires significant revisions to improve its readability. For example, the introduction focuses solely on general aspects of microfinance and abruptly concludes with a justification for certain assumptions, leaving the reader unclear about their connection to the core work. While the results appear promising, the paper needs substantial improvements in terms of structure and clarity to enhance its overall flow and readability.
