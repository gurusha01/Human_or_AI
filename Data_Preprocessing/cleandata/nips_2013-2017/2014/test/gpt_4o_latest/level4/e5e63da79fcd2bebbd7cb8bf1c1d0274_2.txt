This paper addresses the face recognition problem using a deep learning framework. The central idea is to learn features by leveraging both face identification and verification signals as supervisory cues. This approach aims to simultaneously increase inter-personal differences and decrease intra-personal variations. While the motivation is straightforward and has been explored in prior works, such as LDA, integrating this technique into a deep learning framework appears novel. The reported 99.15% verification accuracy on LFW surpasses state-of-the-art results.
The paper is also well-written and includes multiple experiments to validate the proposed idea from various perspectives. A novel deep learning framework utilizing both face identification and verification signals as supervision is introduced, achieving an impressive 99.15% verification accuracy on LFW. The concept is simple, yet the performance is outstanding.
