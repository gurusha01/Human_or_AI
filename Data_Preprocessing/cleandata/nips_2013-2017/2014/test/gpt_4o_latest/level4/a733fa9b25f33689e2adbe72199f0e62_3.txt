This paper introduces an alternative approach using Gaussian Processes (GP) to replace standard GARCH-related methods for modeling the time-varying volatility of financial time series. The primary advantage of the GP framework lies in its enhanced flexibility.
While the submission demonstrates technical competence, it lacks broad appeal and significant novelty. The mathematical framework and the Bayesian algorithm are highly specialized for the specific problem addressed.
The experimental design appears somewhat biased. The synthetic datasets are tailored to favor GPs while being misaligned with the assumptions of GARCH variants, making the superior performance of GPs unsurprising. For real-world data, the authors state, "We used GARCH(1,1), EGARCH(1,1), and GJR-GARCH(1,1,1) models since these variants have the least number of parameters and are consequently less affected by overfitting." However, there seems to have been no effort to regularize the GARCH variants or to optimize their complexity. Even under these conditions, the proposed method outperforms only 58% of the datasets.
As an experienced professor at a research university and a "data science" director in industry, my recommendation to the authors is to leverage their strong technical expertise to tackle broader problems or explore less theoretical applications.
COMMENTS ON THE AUTHORS' RESPONSE
The authors' response appears technically sound, prompting me to revise my numerical evaluation of the paper upward. Nonetheless, I maintain that the paper does not hold broad interest within the machine learning community. Having served on PhD committees for students in econometrics, I suggest that if this work appeals to that field, it would be better suited for publication there.
The authors argue that higher-order GARCH models do not outperform simpler GARCH models. While the GP approach achieves better results, the improvement is not substantial. As someone with practical experience in applied finance, I contend that these models, while mathematically sophisticated, fall short as realistic representations of financial phenomena. The field would benefit from shifting focus away from mathematical complexity and towards uncovering actionable insights. The problem addressed here is too narrowly defined.
