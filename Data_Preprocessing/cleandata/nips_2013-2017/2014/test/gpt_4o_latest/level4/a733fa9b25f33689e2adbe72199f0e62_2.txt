This paper introduces a novel nonparametric volatility model.
The primary contribution of the work lies in the application of a Gaussian process prior to stochastic volatility models. The inference methodology employs sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) techniques, specifically leveraging a direct implementation of the Liu and West auxiliary particle filter (APF) algorithm.
However, the paper's literature review omits several key references, and the empirical comparison is incomplete. My main concerns are as follows:  
\begin{enumerate}  
\item While the authors propose a new stochastic volatility (SV) model, the introduction and the main text fail to cite foundational works in this domain, such as Taylor (1987) and Jacquier, Polson, and Rossi (1994, 2004).  
\item The comparison presented between the GP-Vol model and GARCH models overlooks a critical point: the enhanced flexibility of SV models over the GARCH family has already been well-documented in the literature (e.g., Fridman and Harris, 1998). I strongly recommend including a comparison between the proposed GP-Vol model and a standard SV model to better contextualize the contribution.  
\item Although the authors introduce a new nonparametric model, they do not reference recent advancements in Bayesian nonparametrics that utilize flexible prior processes, such as Dirichlet processes. Relevant works include Bassetti, Casarin, and Leisen (2014), Griffin (2011), and Griffin and Steel (2011).  
\end{enumerate}

I encourage the authors to enhance the presentation of their contribution and include a comparison with a standard SV model. I recommend accepting the paper after the necessary revisions.
