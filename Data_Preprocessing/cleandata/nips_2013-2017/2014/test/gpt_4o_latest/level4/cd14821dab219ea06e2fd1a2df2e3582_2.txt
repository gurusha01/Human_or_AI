This paper addresses the problem of aggregating experts' predictions in a classification context. Unlike the sequential and adversarial framework, the focus here is on static predictions with known or estimated accuracies (competencies). Specifically, the authors establish conditions under which the Nitzan-Paroush weighted majority rule remains consistent.
The paper is well-written and highly engaging. The results are presented with clarity and rigor. The authors offer substantial intuition and even highlight intriguing open questions throughout the work. Notably, standard concentration of measure tools such as Hoeffding's inequality and Bernstein's inequality prove insufficient in this context. Instead, the authors employ sharper but less commonly used bounds. Overall, this is a clear and compelling analysis of the weighted majority rule in the static, non-sequential setting.
