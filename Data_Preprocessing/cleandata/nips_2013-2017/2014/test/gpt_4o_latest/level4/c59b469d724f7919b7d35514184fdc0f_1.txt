Review - Summary
This paper introduces a recommendation algorithm grounded in reinforcement learning, designed to balance exploration and exploitation within an online setting. Additionally, the authors present a theoretical framework to analyze the proposed algorithm.  
The paper operates under two key assumptions: 1) users are distinctly grouped into k typical user types, and 2) likable items are distinctly separated.  
Based on these assumptions, the authors demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves strong performance.
Contribution
As the authors highlight, while numerous online recommendation systems have been proposed in the literature, theoretical analyses of such systems remain sparse.  
Although the proposed algorithm is relatively straightforward, the introduction of a theoretical framework to analyze an online recommendation system is a significant and meaningful contribution.
Some Issues
1. It is widely recognized that users (or items) can be categorized into distinct groups. This paper leverages this observation (or hypothesis) for the purpose of analyzing the algorithm, rather than for improving the algorithm itself. How could this insight be directly applied to enhance the recommendation task?
2. When clustering users (or items), a top-down approach is typically assumed, where each user or item belongs to only one cluster. However, a recent paper (referenced below) identifies similar sets of users or items using a bottom-up approach, allowing for overlapping clusters. How would the proposed framework adapt to scenarios where clusters overlap?

3. In Algorithm 1, the parameter α is defined within the range (0, 4/7]. What is the rationale behind selecting 4/7 as the upper bound for α?
4. While the definitions of \(\epsilonR(n)\) and \(\epsilonJ(t)\) are reasonable, there is no clear evidence that these choices outperform using constants for these terms. Could you provide proof or experimental validation to support this? Additionally, did you explore optimizing the choice of α? Since the performance of the algorithm may depend on the value of α, including experimental results that vary α would strengthen the paper.
5. (Minor) In Figure 1(b), the three lines are indistinguishable when printed in black-and-white. Could you modify the line styles to improve clarity?

7. (Minor) Line 419: Revise "Another related work is by [12], who study" to "Another related work is [12], which studied."
Conclusion
This paper presents a straightforward online recommendation algorithm alongside a theoretical analysis of its performance. I believe the paper is a valuable contribution and recommend it for publication at NIPS.
