Review - Summary  
This paper presents a face verification method leveraging deep convolutional neural networks, combining identification objectives (e.g., softmax classifier) with verification objectives in a landmark-based multi-scale framework. The proposed approach closely resembles the methodology in [18], with two key differences: 1) the training objective incorporates verification objectives, and 2) the patch selection process (in terms of location and scale) is guided by facial landmarks. The model is trained on the CelebFaces+ dataset and evaluated on the LFW dataset, achieving state-of-the-art performance in face verification.
Quality  
The paper introduces several innovative extensions to the prior state-of-the-art system for face verification, and the experiments are executed effectively.
Clarity  
The paper is well-written and clear. However, I have the following comments:  
1) A more detailed, head-to-head comparison with [18] is necessary, as the two methods share an almost identical verification pipeline, differing only in specific details.  
2) Additional details about the training margin parameter \(m\) (Equation (1)) are required, as the process for training/updating \(m\) is not evident in Table 1.  
3) The best verification accuracies reported in figures and tables (e.g., Figures 3 and 4, Tables 2, 3, and 4) are inconsistent. Including more comprehensive captions for tables and figures, along with details about the experimental settings, would improve clarity.
Originality  
While the techniques employed in this paper are not novel, this does not detract from its value, as the authors effectively combine existing methods and demonstrate their utility in achieving state-of-the-art performance.
Significance  
Face verification is a critical problem, and deep learning has recently achieved significant success in this domain. This paper advances the field by further improving performance, making it a noteworthy contribution. Its impact could be enhanced if the authors included evaluation results on the YouTube Face dataset, which is a more challenging benchmark.  
The paper builds on prior work by augmenting the CNN objective function with verification objectives and employing a more effective region selection algorithm. It demonstrates state-of-the-art face verification performance on the LFW dataset.
