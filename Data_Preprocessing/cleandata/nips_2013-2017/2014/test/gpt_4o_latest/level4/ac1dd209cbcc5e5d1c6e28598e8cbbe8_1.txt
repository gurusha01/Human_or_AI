This paper introduces a model for spatio-temporal dynamics that captures a global latent process governing interactions between high-level clusters of points, alongside a local observed process where interactions are decoupled from points outside a given cluster. Both levels of the model can be interpreted as vector autoregressive processes. The authors demonstrate their approach by applying it to data from a numerical simulation of fluid flow in the earth's subsurface, based on a geologic model.
Overall, this is a technically robust paper that showcases advanced optimization techniques. However, it is also challenging to read due to its dense, notation-heavy presentation. Certain topics, which are not typically associated with "NIPS" themes, would benefit from additional intuitive explanations. For instance, the concept of approximating the latent process with a 1-dimensional convection-diffusion system is not well-explained. While the authors highlight the computational advantages of this approximation, they do not clarify the types of behaviors that might be lost as a result.
The experimental setup is intriguing, but it would benefit from further elaboration. Specifically, details on how the training/test split was conducted and how errors were measured are missing. While errors are reported as percentages, it is unclear what the denominator represents in these calculations.
Additionally, the paper would be strengthened by more extensive experiments, particularly involving multiple datasets. This would help establish whether the proposed model is broadly applicable or tailored specifically to the fluid-flow scenario. While spatio-temporal processes with multiscale dynamics are common, the paper makes assumptions—such as the 1-dimensional convection-diffusion approximation—that facilitate the optimization approach. However, the authors do not discuss other contexts where these assumptions might hold.
Typos:
- In Section 3, the text mentions "relaxations to simply the problem" instead of "simplify the problem," and "with with efficient algorithm" should be corrected to "with an efficient algorithm."
- There is an unbalanced bracket on line 184.
- On page 5, second-to-last line (line 268), the parentheses for \( \alpha^{(n)} \) are at the wrong level.
- Replace "nonhierarchal" and "hierarchal" with "nonhierarchical" and "hierarchical."
In summary, this is a technically strong paper proposing a multiscale spatio-temporal model for fluid flow through porous media. The optimization algorithm and results are compelling, but the paper would benefit from clearer explanations, more extensive experiments, and additional discussion of the broader applicability of its assumptions.
