Authors present a method for estimating a graphical model for continuous data that integrates three established approaches: 1) assuming the data follows a multivariate Gaussian distribution and estimating the model using the graphical lasso; 2) relaxing the Gaussian assumption by employing a Gaussian copula (the nonparanormal) to accommodate arbitrary univariate marginals; and 3) assuming a tree-structured factorization and modeling arbitrary bivariate marginals along the tree structure.
The proposed method introduces the concept of a blossom tree, which factorizes the model into densely connected blossom components linked by a specific set of tree edges. Each blossom is connected to at most one tree edge through a pedicel node. The blossom components are modeled as sparse multivariate Gaussians (or using the nonparanormal copula), while the tree edges are modeled as arbitrary bivariate distributions with univariate marginals consistent with the marginal of any blossom pedicel to which they are attached.
The central idea of the paper—the factorization of a high-dimensional graphical model via the blossom tree structure—appears novel, and the flexibility to model components of a high-dimensional graphical model as non-Gaussian is intriguing. However, I remain unconvinced that the blossom-tree factorization offers significant advantages. Specifically, why should one adopt the blossom-tree model over existing approaches such as the nonparanormal model, sparse multivariate Gaussian, or forest-tree model? The authors only evaluated their method on simulated data, which was generated in a manner favorable to their proposed factorization.
I found Theorem 3.1 somewhat unclear. While it provides insights into the quality of negentropy estimation, its relevance to the joint estimation problem is not well-articulated. What implications does this result have for the estimates obtained using the blossom-tree factorization?
Additionally, the proposed method for learning the blossom-tree structure appears to have limitations. Constructing the model incrementally by adding one non-blossom edge at a time seems impractical for problems of moderate or large scale. The authors should also clarify the computational complexity of their method relative to graphical lasso, nonparanormal, and forest-tree approaches.
Finally, the experiments section requires significant improvement. Evaluating the method on at least one real-world dataset would strengthen the case for the practical utility of the blossom-tree factorization.
Detailed comments:
- The term "blossom tree" may not be ideal, as "blossom" was originally introduced by Edmonds in the context of the matching problem, where it refers to an odd-sized set of vertices.
- In the experiments, why are the results for '0' trunks not equivalent to those of the graphical lasso? Without any trunks, wouldn't there be a single blossom modeled as a multivariate Gaussian?
- Runtime comparisons between the proposed method and alternative approaches should be included.
- Line 60: The claim that the method "maintains tractable inference without placing limitations on the independence graph" is somewhat misleading. While the method does encourage sparsity in the graph, it does not impose structural constraints like those seen in graph Laplacians.
In summary, this is an interesting and well-written paper that introduces a novel factorization for graphical models of continuous data. However, the lack of real-world experimentation undermines the practical justification for the blossom-tree factorization, and the proposed greedy construction method appears too computationally expensive to be broadly applicable.
