This paper introduces a novel approach to derive bounds for the average causal effect (ACE) from a variable \( X \) to another \( Y \). The approach is built on three main principles: the inverse application of Entner's Rule 1, the relaxation of the faithfulness assumption to allow for partial path-cancellation, and the introduction of inequality constraints as additional assumptions. A computational framework for determining ACE bounds is formulated using linear programming based on these principles. Although the authors have not yet optimized the algorithm for deriving these bounds, the resulting bounds appear to be significantly narrower and more accurate compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.
Quality  
The authors have attempted to develop a novel method for deriving tighter ACE bounds than those offered by current approaches. By combining several feasible principles, they have succeeded in producing more precise bounds, making the paper's content highly interesting.  
However, the criteria for defining these bounds are not thoroughly explained. Specifically, the validity of applying Entner's Rule 1 in the inverse direction is not sufficiently discussed. For this inverse application, the authors should explicitly assume the structural conditions depicted in Fig. 2, and this assumption needs to be clearly articulated and justified.  
Furthermore, the paper does not provide general criteria for selecting appropriate parameters for the relaxation of the faithfulness assumption. Since these parameters significantly influence the resulting bounds, the methodology for determining them requires further investigation and should be included in the paper.
Clarity  
While the theoretical explanations in the paper are generally clear, they lack the essential discussions highlighted above.  
The presentation of experimental results, however, is less well-articulated. For instance, the implementation details of the algorithm are not adequately described, and the definitions of parameters in Table 1 (or potentially Table 5) are unclear.  
Additionally, there are some typographical errors. For example:  
- On page 6, the statement "The full algorithm is shown in Table 1" is misleading, as no such table is present.  
- On page 8, the statement "Results are summarized in Table 5" is also incorrect, as Table 5 does not appear (perhaps this refers to Table 1).  
Originality  
The problem addressed in this paper has been explored in prior work, as acknowledged by the authors. Consequently, the scope of the paper does not exhibit strong originality.  
However, the integration of the three principles into a unified framework does introduce some degree of novelty. That said, the validity of this combination is not sufficiently discussed, as noted earlier.
Significance  
This method demonstrates some significance in terms of deriving tighter ACE bounds. However, its performance has been evaluated through a limited set of experiments, and its generality—both in theoretical terms and across broader experimental settings—remains unassessed. The paper tackles an important problem, namely the evaluation of bounds on the strength of causal relationships. Nevertheless, the theoretical and experimental validity of the proposed approach requires more comprehensive elaboration.
