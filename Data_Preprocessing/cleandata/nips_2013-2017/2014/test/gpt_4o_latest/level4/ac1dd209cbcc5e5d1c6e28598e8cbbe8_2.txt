This paper presents a novel graphical model designed for multi-scale analysis of spatio-temporal dynamic systems.
The primary contribution of the work lies in the introduction of a new prior distribution for the parameters governing the multi-scale process.
Overall, the paper is well-written and makes an original and significant contribution to the field. However, my main concern pertains to the exposition in the Introduction and Section 3. Given that the core contribution involves the derivation of the penalization term, I would have anticipated a discussion on how it relates to existing penalization methods such as LASSO, elastic net, and SCAD, as well as a demonstration of the proposed method's advantages over these alternatives. I recommend that the authors include a discussion highlighting the benefits of their prior compared to other penalization approaches. I strongly recommend accepting the paper.
