This paper examines the Nitzan-Paroush strategy for assigning weights to conditionally independent experts (given the outcome), which is optimal in expectation. The authors derive exponential concentration inequalities (providing both upper and lower bounds on probabilities) for the error associated with this optimal rule. The upper bounds are particularly sharp and are derived using the Kearns-Saul inequality. The paper further explores scenarios where the quality of the experts is unknown and must be estimated from data, presenting frequentist procedures (which are analyzed) and Bayesian procedures (which are not analyzed).
QUALITY
The results are compelling, nontrivial, and appear correct based on my evaluation. I found the application of the Kearns-Saul inequality particularly strikingâ€”it seems almost uncannily well-suited for this problem, despite being originally developed for other purposes. The exponential bound in Theorem 1(i) is notably strong, scaling linearly with the number of experts who are correct with probability greater than \(1/2 + \epsilon\), for a fixed \(\epsilon > 0\).
That said, I have a few questions and minor concerns regarding the estimators, both frequentist and Bayesian.
1. As a minor point, I would suggest using the terms "fully empirical" instead of "adaptive" and "oracle" instead of "nonadaptive," as these seem to more accurately describe the distinction.
2. Regarding Theorem 7 (adaptive, high-confidence, frequentist case):  
   This result is only practically useful if the authors can demonstrate that the event \(R\) occurs with high probability for sufficiently large sample sizes. Without this, there is a risk that the method may frequently require refraining from making high-confidence decisions, thereby limiting its utility. The authors should provide more discussion on the sample sizes required for \(R\) to hold, given the (oracle, nonadaptive) probabilities. Specifically, they should address whether, under favorable conditions for the true probabilities, the adaptive bound becomes practically useful with high probability.
3. On the Bayesian approach: The authors appear to rely on the standard, unconditional Naive Bayes model, where the experts' opinions are treated as \(X\)-data and the outcome as \(Y\). However, many Bayesians might instead condition on the \(X\)-data and use a conditional likelihood approach. This would effectively turn Naive Bayes into logistic regression, which is often empirically superior. The authors should address this alternative and clarify why they chose not to consider it. Is there a specific reason for favoring Naive Bayes over a logistic regression-based approach?
CLARITY
The paper is well-written and accessible. Although I am not a specialist in probabilistic weighted-majority analysis, I had no difficulty following the arguments and results.
ORIGINALITY
While the results themselves are somewhat original, the proof techniques employed are highly innovative.
SIGNIFICANCE
The significance of this work is reasonably high, particularly due to the use of the Kearns-Saul inequality. The authors provide concentration bounds on the error of weighted majority voting with optimal weights and demonstrate how these weights can be learned from data. The results are interesting, and the proof techniques are especially noteworthy.
