The paper addresses the time-data tradeoffs encountered in noiseless (convex) regularized linear inverse problems (RLIP), such as compressed sensing. The authors demonstrate that when surplus data is available to solve an RLIP, the regularizer can be smoothed, allowing the RLIP to be relaxed into a simpler problem that can be solved more efficiently in terms of computational complexity. To establish this tradeoff, the authors employ a standard iterative dual smoothing optimization algorithm and show that, with excess data, minimizing the smoothed regularizer achieves the same level of accuracy with fewer iterations. Furthermore, they explicitly characterize the conditions under which the smoothed RLIP problem yields the same (true) solution as the original problem by leveraging the concept of statistical dimension, which precisely delineates the phase transition curve of RLIPs with random Gaussian sensing matrices. The results are presented for the specific cases of sparse signal estimation using the l-1 norm and low-rank matrix estimation via the nuclear norm, with references to additional examples and noisy signal estimation in future work.
Quality: The authors employ modern convex analysis tools, such as the statistical dimension of convex cones, to address the problem of time-data tradeoffs in statistical estimation in a rigorous and well-structured manner.  
Clarity: The paper is written with exceptional clarity and is self-contained.  
Originality and significance: While the authors acknowledge the pioneering work of Chandrasekaran and Jordan as a related example of time-data tradeoffs in RLIP, they propose a distinct approachâ€”smoothing the regularizer rather than enlarging the constraint set. This alternative method appears to be more flexible and applicable to practical problems encountered frequently.
My only concern pertains to the method's dependence on the choice of the optimization algorithm. Are these results generalizable to other, more specialized algorithms (e.g., approximate message passing for l-1 minimization) that provide strong performance guarantees? Overall, the paper introduces a novel, theoretically robust, and practically relevant approach to addressing time-data tradeoffs in regularized linear inverse problems.
