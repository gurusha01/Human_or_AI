This paper introduces a novel regularization technique for structured prediction. The core idea is fairly simple: a linear chain model is partitioned into smaller subchains, each treated as an independent training instance.
The authors present theorems (with proofs included in the supplementary material) demonstrating that this regularization approach can reduce generalization risk and improve convergence rates. Empirical evaluations against state-of-the-art methods indicate that the proposed method is both faster and more accurate. While the accuracy gains are modest, they are meaningful given that these are well-established tasks where even small improvements can be impactful.
My main concern lies in the assumption of a linear chain. Does this represent a limitation of the method? If not, the notation should be generalized to accommodate graphical models with arbitrary structures. Otherwise, the paper should explicitly state that it is restricted to linear chains. Addressing more complex models introduces additional challenges, but even if the scope is confined to linear chains, the contribution remains significant.
A secondary concern is the need to better situate this work within the context of related research. How does this method compare to other approaches that approximate structure during training, such as piecewise training (Sutton & McCallum, ICML 2007) or Wainwright's "Estimating the 'Wrong' Graphical Model" (JMLR 2006)? A more thorough discussion of related work would strengthen the paper.
Lastly, the manuscript would benefit from a more careful edit to address minor errors and enhance clarity. Specific suggestions include:
- Proposition 3: The rationale behind the learning rate definition is unclear. Please provide motivation and clarification.
- Figure 2: Is the metric shown accuracy or F1? The text appears to use these terms interchangeably.
- Are only the best-performing StructReg results used to compute significance? It seems unlikely that significance holds for all values of alpha.
058: confliction -> conflict  
078: two-folds -> two-fold  
098: local window of $ok$: The term "window" typically refers to features of adjacent nodes in a chain, but here it seems to describe features of observation $ok$. Please clarify.  
138: draw -> drawn  
164: Define $N_\lambda$ in Eq. 1.  
193: $g$ in Eq. 5 should likely be $G$, for consistency with Eq. 4.  
201: focus -> focuses  
220: xvalue -> value (?)  
229: value is bounded -> value be bounded  
236: simplified as -> approximated by (?) Since small terms are being ignored.
This paper proposes a novel regularization method for structured prediction, supported by both theoretical and empirical evidence. Despite its straightforward nature, the approach demonstrates strong performance and is grounded in a solid theoretical framework. I believe this paper makes a valuable contribution to the field of structured classification.
