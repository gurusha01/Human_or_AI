Summary: The paper presents an efficient optimization method for identifying structured low-rank matrices. The structure is represented through a linear map, and low rank is enforced by incorporating the nuclear norm of the structured matrix into the cost function. The optimization is performed using a generalized conditional gradient algorithm. To further accelerate the process, the authors employ a factorization of the large structured matrix, which introduces a non-convex auxiliary problem involving the optimization of two factor matrices. However, this auxiliary problem is efficiently solved using techniques inspired by Zhang et al. (NIPS2012). Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the algorithm achieves remarkably low computational complexity, and experimental results show that it is at least an order of magnitude faster than the next best competing method. The approach also scales effectively to very large problems, with speed comparisons provided for matrices containing over 300 million elements. A notable advantage is that the factor matrices begin with low ranks, unlike alternative methods that typically start with full-rank matrices.
Quality: The paper provides a rigorous theoretical analysis of computational complexity and convergence rates, which highlights significant improvements over existing methods. These theoretical findings are corroborated by experimental results, where the proposed method consistently outperforms competing approaches.
Clarity: While the paper is generally well-written, the material is complex, requiring readers to consult the supplementary materials and some referenced works to fully grasp the methodology and results.
Originality: The proposed method creatively integrates several ideas from prior algorithms to develop a novel and highly efficient solution.
Significance: The addressed problem is highly relevant to a range of applications, and the results convincingly demonstrate substantial improvements over the state of the art. The paper showcases a method that achieves significant speedups, with experimental evidence highlighting its effectiveness for large-scale problems.
