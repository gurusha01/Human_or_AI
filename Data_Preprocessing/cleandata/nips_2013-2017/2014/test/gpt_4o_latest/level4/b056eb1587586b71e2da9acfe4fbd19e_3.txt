The submitted paper explores the use of attributes as mid-level feature representations for action recognition (AR). Traditionally, attributes in AR are human-assigned without explicitly considering their discriminative power. This work introduces a data-driven approach to "discover" or, more accurately, select a compact subset of discriminative attributes from a larger pool.
QUALITY:
The proposed criteria for attribute selection appear to be well-formulated. However, the paper lacks justification for limiting relationships to pairwise interactions rather than considering higher-order relationships or one-vs-all formulations.
The claims made in the introduction are overly ambitious compared to the evidence provided in the results. Specifically, the assertion that human-labeled attributes (HLA) are "arbitrary," noisy, or redundant, potentially leading to degraded AR performance, underestimates the value of HLAs. These attributes are often chosen for their semantic relevance and play a critical role in hierarchical activity understanding. For instance, activities like applying eye makeup and applying lipstick share common attributes because they belong to the broader category of applying makeup. Moreover, as shown in Tables 2 and 3, data-driven attributes (DDA) generally perform worse than HLAs for most classes, with some results being significantly inferior. Improvements are observed only in the "mixed" case, indicating that DDAs may complement HLAs but are insufficient on their own. Therefore, the claim that a more compact set of attributes can be discovered is not convincingly supported by the results.
CLARITY:
- Lines 102â€“103: While the application domain is intriguing, it would be more informative to explain how the proposed attributes have been utilized in these applications (e.g., for optimization, classification, etc.).
- Line 129: The notations \( u_k^d \) and \( u^d \) require clarification.
- The determination of the parameter \( \lambda \) in Equation 4 and its impact on the results should be explicitly discussed.
ORIGINALITY:
The paper claims to introduce a "novel submodular objective function for attribute selection," but the novelty of this contribution is not sufficiently clear. The authors should elaborate on how their approach differs from prior methods, particularly those described in the related works section. Additionally, the distinctions between this work and the approaches in [22] and [23], which are directly compared in the experiments, should be clarified.
SIGNIFICANCE:
This paper is likely to interest researchers working on action recognition or attribute-based representations, both of which are active areas in computer vision. The proposed data-driven approach to attribute selection is promising. However, the paper would benefit from refinements in the introduction and motivation sections to better align its claims with the experimental results.
