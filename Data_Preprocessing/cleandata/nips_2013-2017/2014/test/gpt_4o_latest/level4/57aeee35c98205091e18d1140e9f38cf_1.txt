This paper addresses the challenge of estimating the average causal effect (ACE) between two binary variables when the causal structure among the covariates is only partially known. It builds upon a rule introduced by Entner et al. (2013), which aims to identify a set of observed covariates sufficient to block all back-door paths. However, the validity of Entner et al.'s rule is contingent on the faithfulness assumption. This work proposes using the rule to derive bounds, rather than point estimates, for the ACE and develops a method inspired by Ramsahai (2012).
While I have not fully grasped all the technical details, the core idea appears sound, intriguing, and potentially valuable. That said, I found it unclear how the conditions in Entner et al.'s rule factor into this approach. Without assuming faithfulness, these conditions do not seem to directly inform the causal structure. My interpretation is that the conditions, if satisfied, might influence the selection of relaxation parameters, but the paper explicitly sets this issue aside. It seems that the proposed method does not critically rely on the conditions in Entner et al.'s rule, and I am curious whether the observed robustness of the method in the experiments is related to this. A clarification on this point would be helpful.
Some minor observations:
1. In the first paragraph of Section 3, the phrase "… express violations of faithfulness as bounded violations of local independence …" is somewhat confusing. Isn't unfaithfulness about permitting additional independencies rather than violating existing ones? It seems to me that the framework aims to allow or represent "near violations" of faithfulness by constraining the degree of dependence.
2. In the experimental section, it might be useful to include the performance of Entner et al.'s method under their strict thresholds, treating an inconclusive result ("don't know") as reporting uninformative bounds.
3. In the second paragraph of p. 8, if "X=1 means the patient received a flu shot, Y=1 indicates the patient was not hospitalized," why would a negative ACE imply that the vaccine is desirable?
4. The table labeled "Table 1" at the top of p. 8 is referred to as "Table 5" in the text.
Overall, this is an engaging paper, though the technical details are somewhat challenging to follow.
