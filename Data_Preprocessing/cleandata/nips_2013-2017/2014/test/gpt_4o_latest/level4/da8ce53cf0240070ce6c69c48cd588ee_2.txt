This paper introduces a method called blossom tree, which integrates several approaches for statistically modeling multivariable continuous data. The combined methods include forest models and the graphical lasso. The resulting model appears to be novel and highly flexible, with the proposed algorithm showing potential for efficient estimation in high-dimensional, non-Gaussian settings. While the paper is generally clear, it is somewhat difficult to follow due to the seemingly ad-hoc nature of the model construction and the reliance on supplementary material for many results. Making the paper more structured and self-contained would improve its clarity. The experimental evaluation is limited to simulated data specifically designed with the proposed model in mind. A more robust experimental section, including significant results on a real-world dataset and comparisons with benchmarks such as glasso, would strengthen the work. Overall, this is a mostly well-written paper that presents a novel and potentially impactful method for modeling non-Gaussian multidimensional continuous data, but the experimental validation is insufficient.
