This study introduces a seemingly novel and faster approach to address nuclear-norm regularized estimation of low-rank matrices. The work is well-motivated, with the authors taking care to thoroughly explain their primary contributions and how these align with the existing body of literature.
The authors employ a relatively straightforward mathematical manipulation to reformulate the problem. The core of the work lies in leveraging this reformulation through their understanding of the conditional gradient algorithm.  
A somewhat innovative algorithm is proposed for estimating low-rank matrices, which demonstrates a computational speed-up over current methods.
