This paper examines the weighted majority algorithm and demonstrates consistency (i.e., the error rate of the aggregator approaching zero) under two scenarios: (1) when the competence level (risk of each expert) is known beforehand, and (2) when the competence level is estimated. For the second scenario, both frequentist and Bayesian approaches to estimating the competence level are presented.
In the first scenario, consistency is established by deriving upper and lower bounds on the aggregator's error rate. These bounds involve standard calculations, with the upper bound relying on a result by Kearns and Saul rather than Hoeffding's inequality. In the second scenario, under the frequentist framework, an independent set of labeled inputs is used to estimate each expert's competence level. Two estimates (and corresponding analyses) are provided, depending on the confidence level. In the Bayesian framework, the proposed estimator is fairly standard, and the analysis is left entirely as an open problem.
The primary issue with the paper lies in its lack of novelty. The estimators and analyses rely on standard tools, and there is no significant theoretical innovation. From a practical standpoint, the assumption of access to labeled samples for estimating competence levels is a limitation compared to the Dawid-Skene method, which can estimate both competence levels and ground truth without labeled data. In addition to the references cited in the paper, two related works are [1] and [2] below. Nonetheless, the problem addressed in the paper is highly relevant, particularly in the context of crowd-sourcing applications. A notable advantage of the weighted majority method over the Dawid-Skene model is its lack of modeling assumptions. Therefore, a theoretical analysis that characterizes conditions under which the weighted majority method outperforms the Dawid-Skene model would significantly strengthen the paper.
