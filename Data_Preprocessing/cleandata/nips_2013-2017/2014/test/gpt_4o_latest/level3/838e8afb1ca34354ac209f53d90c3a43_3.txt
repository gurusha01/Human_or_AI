The paper introduces "tag structure regularization," a novel approach to structured prediction that penalizes models based on sub-structure losses during training. The method decomposes training samples into simpler mini-samples, encouraging models to rely on local information and reducing reliance on long-range dependencies. The authors provide theoretical analysis suggesting that this regularization reduces generalization error bounds and accelerates stochastic gradient descent (SGD) convergence. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on sequential prediction tasks, such as part-of-speech tagging, biomedical named entity recognition, and Chinese word segmentation, while also achieving faster training times.
Strengths:  
The proposed method is conceptually simple yet impactful, addressing the underexplored area of structure regularization. By promoting reliance on local information, the approach effectively mitigates overfitting risks associated with complex structures, a key challenge in structured prediction. The theoretical analysis, while not without limitations, provides a foundation for understanding the benefits of the method, particularly its ability to accelerate SGD convergence. The experimental results are compelling, showing consistent improvements over strong baselines and achieving state-of-the-art performance on competitive tasks. Additionally, the method's practical utility is evident in its ability to integrate seamlessly with existing weight regularization techniques and its applicability to various graphical models, including linear chains, trees, and general graphs. The paper also highlights the method's efficiency, with faster training times attributed to both improved convergence rates and reduced computational overhead for simpler structures.
Weaknesses:  
The theoretical analysis, while insightful, makes assumptions that conflict with prior work, particularly regarding the measure of structure complexity. The generalization bound includes an \(n^4\) term, which seems excessively large and may limit the practical interpretability of the theoretical results. This arises from the linear decomposition of losses and the handling of the regularization term, which could benefit from more nuanced graph complexity measures used in related literature. Additionally, while the experiments are thorough, the paper does not explore the method's limitations in scenarios where long-range dependencies are critical, which could provide a more balanced evaluation.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:  
Pros:  
1. The method addresses a significant gap in structured prediction by focusing on structure regularization.  
2. Strong experimental results demonstrate both improved accuracy and faster training.  
3. The simplicity and practicality of the approach make it accessible to researchers and practitioners.  
4. The method's conceptual resemblance to dropout opens avenues for further exploration of related ideas.  
Cons:  
1. The theoretical analysis relies on assumptions that may not align with prior work, limiting its robustness.  
2. The \(n^4\) term in the generalization bound raises concerns about the scalability of the theoretical claims.  
3. The paper could benefit from a deeper exploration of scenarios where long-range dependencies are essential.
Conclusion:  
Despite theoretical concerns, the paper makes a strong scientific contribution by introducing a novel and practical method for structure regularization. Its simplicity, strong empirical results, and potential for broad applicability make it a valuable addition to the field. I recommend acceptance, with the suggestion that the authors address the theoretical limitations and explore edge cases in future work.
