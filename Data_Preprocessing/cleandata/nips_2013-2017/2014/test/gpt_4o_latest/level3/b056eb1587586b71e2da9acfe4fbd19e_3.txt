Review
Summary of the Paper
The paper introduces a data-driven approach to action recognition by selecting a compact and discriminative subset of attributes, moving beyond traditional human-labeled attributes (HLA). The authors propose three attribute selection criteria and formulate the problem as a submodular optimization task, combining entropy rate and weighted maximum coverage. A greedy algorithm is employed to achieve a (1-1/e)-approximation to the optimal solution. The paper evaluates the method on the Olympic Sports and UCF101 datasets, demonstrating that the selected attributes improve classification accuracy and outperform several state-of-the-art approaches. The authors also show that data-driven attributes (DDA) complement HLAs, leading to better performance when combined.
Strengths
1. Interesting Problem and Motivation: The paper addresses a critical issue in action recognitionâ€”reducing reliance on human-labeled attributes, which can be noisy or redundant, and proposing a data-driven alternative.
2. Submodular Optimization Framework: The use of entropy rate and weighted maximum coverage as criteria for attribute selection is well-motivated and mathematically grounded. The theoretical guarantees of submodularity and the (1-1/e)-approximation are compelling.
3. Experimental Validation: The results on two challenging datasets (Olympic Sports and UCF101) provide strong evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed method. The comparison with other submodular approaches and state-of-the-art methods is thorough.
4. Complementarity of HLAs and DDAs: The finding that DDAs are complementary to HLAs and improve performance when combined is a valuable insight for the community.
Weaknesses
1. Overstated Claims about HLAs: The paper claims that HLAs are arbitrary and noisy, but this is an overgeneralization. HLAs often have semantic meaning and hierarchical relevance, which the authors do not fully acknowledge.
2. Limited Exploration of Higher-Order Relationships: The restriction to pairwise relationships in attribute selection is not well-justified. Exploring higher-order or one-vs-all relationships could potentially yield better results.
3. Clarity Issues: 
   - The notation in Equation 4 (e.g., \(u_k^d\), \(u^d\), and \(\lambda\)) is ambiguous and requires clarification. The impact of \(\lambda\) on the results is mentioned but not adequately analyzed.
   - The paper lacks sufficient detail on how the selected attributes are applied for optimization or classification, which limits reproducibility.
4. Novelty Concerns: The novelty of the proposed submodular objective function is unclear, as it appears to build on existing work ([22], [23]). The distinctions from these prior methods need to be elaborated.
5. Experimental Results: While the results show improvements, DDA alone performs weaker than HLAs in most cases. This suggests that DDAs are insufficient as standalone features, which somewhat undermines the motivation for moving away from HLAs.
Arguments for Acceptance
- The paper addresses a relevant and challenging problem in action recognition.
- The proposed method is theoretically sound, with a well-defined optimization framework and strong experimental results.
- The insights into the complementarity of HLAs and DDAs are valuable for future research.
Arguments Against Acceptance
- The novelty of the submodular objective function is not clearly established.
- The paper lacks clarity in key areas, including notation and application details.
- The motivation for restricting relationships to pairwise combinations is weak, and higher-order relationships are not explored.
- The claims about the limitations of HLAs are overstated and not sufficiently supported by evidence.
Recommendation
Overall, the paper makes a meaningful contribution to the field of action recognition by proposing a data-driven attribute selection framework. However, the lack of clarity, overstated claims, and insufficient novelty in the submodular formulation are significant drawbacks. I recommend acceptance with major revisions, focusing on improving clarity, justifying design choices, and better distinguishing the proposed method from prior work.
