This paper presents a novel approach to solving continuous Markov random field (MRF) energies with polynomial potentials, leveraging a concave-convex decomposition (DC decomposition) and the concave-convex procedure (CCCP). The authors prove that any multivariate polynomial with even degree can be decomposed into a sum of convex and concave polynomials, a property they exploit to perform efficient inference on continuous MRFs. The decomposition is formulated as a sum-of-squares optimization problem, solvable via semi-definite programming (SDP). The proposed method demonstrates superior computational efficiency and solution quality compared to existing baselines, such as ADMM-Poly, across applications like 3D reconstruction, shape-from-shading, and image denoising.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Contribution: The paper introduces a theoretically grounded and practically impactful method for inference on continuous MRFs with polynomial potentials. The constructive proof of DC decomposition for even-degree polynomials is a significant theoretical contribution.
2. Technical Soundness: The approach is rigorously formulated, with clear connections to convex optimization and CCCP. The use of SDP for decomposition is elegant and computationally efficient.
3. Experimental Validation: The method is validated on diverse and challenging tasks, demonstrating faster convergence and better solution quality than baselines. The experiments are thorough, with comparisons across multiple metrics (energy, runtime, RMSE).
4. Broad Applicability: The method has potential applications in computer vision and imaging, as evidenced by its success in 3D reconstruction, shape-from-shading, and denoising tasks.
5. Clarity: The paper is well-written and logically structured, with clear explanations of the methodology and experimental results.
Weaknesses:
1. Approximation in DC Decomposition: The reliance on SDP for DC decomposition introduces an approximation that may fail for certain polynomials, limiting the method's reliability in some cases. This limitation is acknowledged but not deeply explored.
2. Global Convergence Claim: While CCCP guarantees global convergence, the paper does not sufficiently clarify how this property interacts with the approximation introduced by SDP.
3. Simplification for Certain Energies: For some continuous energies, an apparent DC decomposition exists without requiring the construction algorithm. The paper does not discuss how such cases could simplify the approach.
4. Clarity on Related Work: The discussion of Gaussian belief propagation contains inaccuracies, and the global convergence claim could benefit from additional clarification.
Recommendation:
The paper is recommended for acceptance due to its strong theoretical contributions, practical impact, and impressive experimental results. While the reliance on SDP approximations raises some concerns, the method's overall novelty, efficiency, and applicability outweigh these limitations. The authors are encouraged to address the noted weaknesses, particularly the reliability of the SDP-based decomposition and the clarification of global convergence claims.
Pro and Con Arguments:
Pros:
- Novel theoretical insights into polynomial decomposition.
- Efficient and scalable inference method for continuous MRFs.
- Strong experimental results demonstrating practical impact.
Cons:
- Approximation in DC decomposition may limit reliability.
