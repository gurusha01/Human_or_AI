This paper presents a novel and computationally efficient approach to solving nuclear-norm regularized low-rank matrix estimation problems with linear structural constraints. The authors reformulate the problem to exploit the Generalized Conditional Gradient (GCG) method, achieving significant computational improvements over existing methods. Their approach avoids computationally expensive operations such as full Singular Value Decompositions (SVDs), augmented Lagrangian techniques, or solving linear systems per iteration. The proposed algorithm demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in stochastic system realization (SSR) and spectral compressed sensing (SCS) tasks, both theoretically and empirically.
Strengths
1. Motivation and Contextualization: The paper is well-motivated, addressing the scalability limitations of existing methods for structured rank minimization. The authors effectively position their work within the broader literature, citing relevant prior contributions and highlighting the gaps their method addresses.
2. Technical Novelty: The reformulation of the problem is simple yet impactful, enabling the use of the GCG method. The proposed algorithm achieves a per-iteration complexity of \(O(MN)\), which is a significant improvement over the \(O(\min(M^2N, N^2M))\) complexity of competing methods. This is a clear advancement in the field.
3. Empirical Validation: The experimental results are thorough and compelling. The authors demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of their method on SSR and SCS problems, showing that their algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art competitors in terms of runtime and solution quality.
4. Clarity and Reproducibility: The paper is well-written and organized. The mathematical derivations are clear, and the experimental setup is described in sufficient detail to allow for reproducibility.
Weaknesses
1. Limited Scope of Applications: While the paper demonstrates the method's effectiveness on SSR and SCS tasks, it would benefit from additional experiments on other real-world applications, such as collaborative filtering or medical imaging, to showcase broader applicability.
2. Penalty Parameter Sensitivity: The reformulation introduces a penalty parameter (\(\lambda\)) to relax the linear constraints. While the authors argue that this trade-off is worthwhile, the paper does not explore the sensitivity of the algorithm to this parameter, which could affect practical usability.
3. Theoretical Guarantees: Although the convergence rate of \(O(1/\epsilon)\) is established, the paper does not provide a detailed comparison of theoretical guarantees (e.g., optimality gaps) with those of competing methods. This would strengthen the theoretical contribution.
Arguments for Acceptance
- The paper addresses a well-defined and important problem in low-rank matrix estimation.
- It introduces a novel reformulation and algorithm that significantly improve computational efficiency.
- The empirical results are strong and demonstrate clear advantages over existing methods.
Arguments Against Acceptance
- The scope of applications tested is somewhat narrow, limiting the generalizability of the results.
- The sensitivity of the algorithm to the penalty parameter is not thoroughly analyzed.
Recommendation
Overall, this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of structured low-rank matrix estimation. The proposed algorithm is both theoretically sound and empirically validated, offering a substantial improvement over existing methods. While there are minor limitations, they do not detract significantly from the overall quality of the work. I recommend accepting this paper, provided the authors address the sensitivity analysis of the penalty parameter and consider expanding the scope of applications in future work.
