The paper addresses the critical issue of model identifiability in Bayesian cognitive modeling, a topic of significant importance in psychophysics and cognitive science. The authors propose a novel framework to systematically test the identifiability of Bayesian observer models, with practical applications for improving experimental design. The paper is well-written and provides a clear exposition of the problem, methodology, and results. However, while the topic and approach are compelling, the impact of the key findings appears limited due to the reliance on numerous assumptions and the modest significance of the results.
Strengths:  
The methodology is innovative and well-suited for presentation at NIPS. The authors introduce a generalizable framework that efficiently explores the identifiability landscape of Bayesian observer models. The application of this framework to two case studies—time interval estimation and speed perception—demonstrates its utility in evaluating and ranking experimental designs. The paper provides valuable insights into how experimental constraints (e.g., motor noise measurements or loss function assumptions) influence the recovery of internal representations. The theoretical validation of prior work on speed perception is particularly robust and aligns with empirical findings.
Weaknesses:  
The work relies on a series of strong assumptions, such as the parametric forms of priors, likelihoods, and loss functions, which constrain the generalizability of the results. For instance, the log-stimulus transform (Line 134) imposes significant constraints, making Bayesian model identifiability contingent on these assumptions. Similarly, the justification for the observer's prior favoring a lattice representation over a uniform one (Line 158) is insufficiently motivated. In Section 4.1, the interchangeability of sensory and motor noise is unsurprising, and the lack of clear condition differences undermines the novelty of the findings. Additionally, the model fails to demonstrate the recovery of the absence of a slow-speed prior in the reference observer (Section 4.2), which raises concerns about its robustness. The figure design (e.g., Figure 1) is confusing and detracts from the clarity of the presentation. Finally, some technical clarifications are needed, such as the rationale for using a discrete stimulus distribution (Line 106) and the conditions for Stirling's approximation in Equation 14 (Line 252).
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:  
Pro:  
- The paper addresses a critical problem in Bayesian cognitive modeling.  
- The methodology is innovative and has practical implications for experimental design.  
- The framework is generalizable to a wide range of psychophysical tasks.  
Con:  
- The results are less impactful than the ambitious scope of the paper suggests.  
- The reliance on strong assumptions limits the generalizability of the findings.  
- Some technical aspects and figures require further clarification and refinement.  
Overall Assessment:  
This paper tackles an important problem with an innovative approach, but the significance of the results is somewhat limited. While the methodology is a valuable contribution, the reliance on numerous assumptions and the modest novelty of the findings temper its impact. The paper is suitable for NIPS, but revisions to clarify assumptions, refine figures, and strengthen the discussion of results are recommended.
