Review of the Paper
This paper addresses the important problem of action recognition in videos by leveraging Human Labeled Attributes (HLA) and Data Driven Attributes (DDA) as high-level concepts. The authors propose a novel method for selecting a compact and discriminative subset of attributes by formulating the problem as a submodular optimization task. The proposed approach combines entropy rate maximization with a weighted maximum coverage objective, and the authors provide a greedy algorithm with a (1-1/e)-approximation guarantee. The method is evaluated on two challenging datasets, Olympic Sports and UCF101, and is shown to improve upon baseline and some state-of-the-art methods.
Strengths:
1. Significance and Novelty: The paper tackles a critical problem in computer vision, where low-level features often fail to capture the complex spatio-temporal structures in videos. The use of both HLA and DDA, along with a novel submodular formulation for attribute selection, is a compelling contribution. The combination of entropy rate and weighted maximum coverage is well-motivated and theoretically sound.
2. Experimental Validation: The authors conduct experiments on two widely used datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that the selected attributes improve classification accuracy and outperform other submodular selection methods.
3. Generalizability: The proposed method is general and applicable to other recognition tasks that rely on attribute-based representations, which enhances its potential impact.
4. Theoretical Rigor: The paper provides a clear theoretical foundation for the submodular optimization approach, including proofs of submodularity and approximation guarantees.
Weaknesses:
1. Comparison with Simpler Methods: While the proposed method is novel, it would benefit from comparisons with simpler feature selection techniques such as L1 regularization (e.g., lasso or elastic net). This would help contextualize the advantages of the submodular approach.
2. State-of-the-Art Features: The paper does not compare its method to state-of-the-art results that use better dense features, such as those based on spatio-temporal pyramids or advanced deep learning techniques. Combining the proposed method with such features could yield more competitive results.
3. Limited Scope of Experiments: The experiments are restricted to video action datasets. Demonstrating the generality of the method by applying it to other vision domains (e.g., object recognition or scene classification) would strengthen the paper.
4. Clarity Issues: Some equations and notations (e.g., \( A_{d,l} \) in Eq. 2) are unclear, and minor errors in the text (e.g., line 161) need correction. These issues detract from the overall clarity of the paper.
5. Scalability: The computational complexity of the proposed method, especially for large-scale datasets with many attributes, is not thoroughly discussed.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper addresses an important and challenging problem in action recognition.
- The proposed attribute selection method is novel, theoretically sound, and well-motivated.
- Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the method, and the theoretical contributions are significant.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Comparisons with simpler feature selection methods and state-of-the-art dense features are missing.
- The scope of experiments is limited to action recognition, reducing the demonstrated generality of the approach.
- Clarity issues and minor errors in the text detract from the paper's readability.
Recommendation:
Overall, this paper makes a valuable contribution to the field of action recognition and feature selection. However, addressing the missing comparisons, extending experiments to other domains, and improving clarity would significantly strengthen the work. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions.
