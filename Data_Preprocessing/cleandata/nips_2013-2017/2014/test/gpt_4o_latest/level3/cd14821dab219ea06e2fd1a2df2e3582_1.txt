This paper revisits the weighted majority algorithm from a statistical learning perspective, establishing consistency results under two different settings: known and estimated competence levels of experts. For known competence levels, the authors derive sharp upper and lower bounds on error rates, leveraging Kearns and Saul's inequality instead of the more common Hoeffding's inequality. For estimated competence levels, the paper proposes both frequentist and Bayesian approaches. The frequentist analysis provides consistency guarantees under low- and high-confidence regimes, while the Bayesian approach introduces a theoretically optimal decision rule but leaves the error probability analysis as an open problem.
The paper's strengths lie in its rigorous analysis of the weighted majority algorithm and its relevance to decision-making scenarios, such as crowdsourcing. The use of Kearns and Saul's inequality to improve error bounds is a notable contribution, as it addresses the limitations of Hoeffding's inequality in heterogeneous settings. Additionally, the frequentist and Bayesian frameworks for handling unknown competence levels provide a structured approach to a challenging problem. The frequentist analysis, in particular, offers useful insights into the trade-offs between low- and high-confidence regimes.
However, the paper has several weaknesses. First, it lacks novelty, as the theoretical tools and estimators employed are standard and do not introduce significant new techniques. The reliance on labeled samples for competence estimation in the frequentist approach is a notable drawback, especially when compared to the Dawid-Skene method, which estimates both competence levels and ground truth without labeled data. The paper also misses an opportunity to compare the weighted majority algorithm with Dawid-Skene under specific conditions, which would have strengthened its practical relevance. Furthermore, while the Bayesian approach is conceptually appealing, the inability to compute or bound the error probability limits its practical utility.
In terms of clarity, the paper is well-organized and provides detailed proofs, but some sections, particularly the frequentist analysis, could benefit from more intuitive explanations to improve accessibility. The discussion of related work is thorough, but the paper could better position its contributions relative to recent advances in crowdsourcing and ensemble methods.
In conclusion, while the paper addresses a relevant problem and provides rigorous analysis, its lack of novelty and practical insights limits its impact. A stronger comparison with alternative methods and a deeper exploration of when the weighted majority algorithm outperforms Dawid-Skene would enhance its significance. I recommend acceptance only if the authors address these limitations in a revised version. 
Arguments for acceptance:
- Rigorous theoretical analysis of weighted majority consistency.
- Relevance to decision-making and crowdsourcing applications.
- Use of Kearns and Saul's inequality for sharper error bounds.
Arguments against acceptance:
- Limited novelty and reliance on standard tools.
- Dependence on labeled samples, which is less practical than Dawid-Skene.
- Missed opportunity to compare with alternative methods.
- Limited practical utility of the Bayesian approach due to unresolved open problems.
