This paper introduces a novel approach to leveraging excess observations in statistical estimators based on convex optimization. The authors propose smoothing nonsmooth regularizers more aggressively as the sample size increases, with the goal of reducing computational cost while maintaining recovery guarantees. The idea is theoretically grounded in the regularized linear inverse problem (RLIP) and supported by experiments on sparse vector and low-rank matrix recovery. The paper highlights a timeâ€“data tradeoff, where excess data is treated as a computational resource to accelerate optimization.
Strengths:
1. Novelty: The paper presents an interesting and original idea of exploiting excess observations to smooth optimization problems, which contrasts with conventional approaches that discard excess samples to reduce problem size.
2. Theoretical Contributions: The authors provide a rigorous theoretical framework, including bounds on the smoothing parameter and its relationship to recovery guarantees. The connection to statistical dimension and phase transitions is well-articulated.
3. Clarity: The paper is well-written and logically organized, making it accessible to readers familiar with convex optimization and statistical estimation.
4. Empirical Validation: The experiments demonstrate the potential computational gains of the proposed method, achieving significant speedups in both sparse vector and low-rank matrix recovery problems.
Weaknesses:
1. Recovery Guarantees: While the theoretical framework is compelling, the smoothing approach may compromise the probability of exact recovery, as suggested by the bound in Fact 2.3. This tradeoff is not fully explored, and the authors do not provide simulations explicitly measuring the probability of exact recovery.
2. Experimental Design: The experiments rely on predefined "closeness" metrics rather than exact recovery probabilities, which weakens the empirical validation of the method's recovery performance.
3. Ad Hoc Parameter Tuning: The smoothing parameter adjustment is heuristic and lacks a principled method for selection. The impact of aggressive smoothing on recovery guarantees is not thoroughly investigated.
4. Practicality: The method assumes prior knowledge of the true signal's structure (e.g., sparsity or rank), which is unrealistic in real-world scenarios. Additionally, the claim that the smoothing parameter depends on sample size raises concerns about its implementation without such prior knowledge.
5. Unfair Comparisons: Competing algorithms in the experiments are allowed to use all available samples, putting them at a disadvantage compared to the proposed method. A fair comparison would involve discarding excess samples for competing methods to reduce problem size and memory requirements.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:
- Pro: The paper introduces a novel and theoretically grounded idea with potential to reduce computational costs in convex optimization problems. It is well-written and provides empirical evidence of its effectiveness.
- Con: Critical issues remain unaddressed, including the impact of smoothing on exact recovery, the lack of principled parameter selection, and the unrealistic reliance on prior knowledge of the true signal.
Recommendation: While the paper presents an intriguing idea and makes a solid theoretical contribution, the unresolved issues regarding recovery guarantees, experimental fairness, and practical applicability limit its impact. I recommend a weak rejection at this stage, with encouragement to address these concerns for future submission.
