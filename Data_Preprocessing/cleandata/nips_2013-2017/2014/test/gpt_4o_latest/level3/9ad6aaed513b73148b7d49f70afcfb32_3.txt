This paper presents a novel theoretical and algorithmic contribution by proving that multivariate polynomials with even degrees can always be decomposed into convex and concave parts. The authors leverage this decomposition to perform MAP inference on continuous Markov Random Fields (MRFs) with polynomial potentials, using the Concave-Convex Procedure (CCCP). The decomposition is expressed as a sum-of-squares optimization, solvable via semidefinite programming. The approach is validated through experiments on 3D reconstruction, shape-from-shading, and image denoising tasks, demonstrating its potential to outperform existing methods in terms of solution quality.
Strengths:
1. Theoretical Contribution: The proof of the concave-convex decomposition for even-degree multivariate polynomials is a significant theoretical result. The construction of this decomposition and its efficient implementation via sum-of-squares optimization is well-grounded and novel.
2. Algorithmic Innovation: The application of CCCP to continuous MRFs with polynomial potentials is innovative and addresses a challenging problem in graphical models. The algorithm inherits global convergence guarantees, which is a strong theoretical property.
3. Experimental Validation: The paper demonstrates the method's effectiveness across diverse tasks, including 3D reconstruction, shape-from-shading, and image denoising. The results show competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.
4. Clarity and Organization: The paper is well-written and logically structured, with a clear exposition of the theoretical framework, algorithm, and experimental results. The supplementary material provides additional insights and examples.
Weaknesses:
1. Efficiency Concerns: While the authors claim improved efficiency, the method takes longer than L-BFGS in some cases. This discrepancy requires further clarification, particularly in scenarios where the proposed approach is slower despite achieving lower energy.
2. Energy Fluctuations: The energy versus sample index curve in Fig. 2 exhibits unexplained fluctuations. A detailed explanation of this phenomenon is necessary to strengthen the experimental findings.
3. Caption Clarity: The captions for tables are terse and lack sufficient detail to make the results self-contained. Expanding these captions would improve the reader's understanding of the experimental results.
4. Generality: While the method is extended to non-polynomial functions using bounded Hessians or Taylor approximations, the practical limitations of these extensions (e.g., scalability or approximation quality) are not fully discussed.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper introduces a novel and theoretically sound decomposition for even-degree polynomials, which has broad implications for optimization in graphical models.
- The proposed algorithm demonstrates strong empirical performance across multiple challenging tasks.
- The work addresses an important and underexplored problem in continuous MRF inference, advancing the state of the art.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The efficiency claims are inconsistent with the experimental results, particularly when compared to L-BFGS.
- Some experimental results, such as energy fluctuations, are not adequately explained, leaving gaps in the evaluation.
- The paper could benefit from clearer presentation of experimental details, particularly in table captions.
Recommendation:
Overall, this paper makes a significant theoretical and practical contribution to the field of continuous graphical models. While some issues, such as efficiency claims and unexplained experimental phenomena, need to be addressed, the strengths of the paper outweigh its weaknesses. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to clarify the efficiency claims, explain the energy fluctuations, and improve the presentation of experimental results.
