This paper addresses the challenging problem of best-arm identification in linear bandit models, proposing a new complexity notion and three sampling strategies: G-allocation, XY-allocation, and XY-Adaptive. The authors highlight the importance of leveraging the global linear structure of arms to improve sample efficiency and establish connections to experimental design theory, particularly the G-optimality criterion. The phased XY-Adaptive algorithm is a notable contribution, as it balances adaptivity with computational efficiency, avoiding the dimensionality penalties associated with fully adaptive strategies. The paper is novel in its exploration of pure-exploration tasks in linear bandits, a relatively underexplored area compared to multi-armed bandits (MABs).
Strengths:
1. Novelty: The paper introduces a new complexity notion for linear bandits and extends the study of best-arm identification to this setting, which is a significant departure from traditional MABs.
2. Algorithm Design: The phased XY-Adaptive strategy is a thoughtful innovation, addressing the limitations of both static and fully adaptive approaches.
3. Connections to Experimental Design: The use of G-optimality and the introduction of a transductive variant (XY-allocation) are insightful contributions that bridge bandit theory and experimental design.
4. Clarity of Theoretical Insights: The theoretical analysis, including bounds on sample complexity, is rigorous and provides a strong foundation for the proposed methods.
Weaknesses:
1. Imprecise Theoretical Statements: Propositions 1 and 2 require clarification, particularly regarding whether \( n \) is fixed and the proper application of union bounds. Additionally, the term "beta-approximation" in Theorem 1 is undefined, and the oracle definition in Section 3 is vague.
2. Lack of Lower Bounds: The claim of characterizing problem complexity is incomplete without a lower bound on sample complexity, which limits the theoretical impact of the work.
3. Unclear Terminology: The distinction between static and adaptive strategies is muddled, as stopping strategies remain adaptive even in "static" approaches.
4. Experimental Limitations: The numerical experiments are limited in scope, lacking comparisons with standard best-arm identification algorithms like LUCB or UGapE. The experiments focus on a specific problem setting, which raises concerns about generalizability.
5. Algorithm Scalability: The computational complexity of the proposed methods, especially in high-dimensional settings, is not thoroughly analyzed.
6. Presentation Issues: The paper suffers from minor issues such as notation overlaps, typos, unclear references to supplementary material, and insufficient self-containment.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper tackles a novel and challenging problem, making it a valuable contribution to the field.
- The proposed algorithms, particularly XY-Adaptive, are innovative and theoretically sound.
- The connection to experimental design theory adds interdisciplinary value.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The theoretical framework is incomplete without a lower bound on sample complexity.
- Experimental results are insufficient to demonstrate the practical utility and scalability of the algorithms.
- Presentation issues and imprecise terminology detract from the clarity and accessibility of the paper.
Recommendation: While the paper is a promising contribution, its weaknesses, particularly the lack of lower bounds and limited experimental validation, suggest that it requires significant revisions before acceptance. I recommend a weak reject, encouraging the authors to address the identified issues in a future submission.
