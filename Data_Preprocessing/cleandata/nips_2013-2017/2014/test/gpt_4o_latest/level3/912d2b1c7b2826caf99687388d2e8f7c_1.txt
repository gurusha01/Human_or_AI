The paper presents a novel and efficient optimization approach for solving structured low-rank matrix problems using nuclear norm regularization. The authors reformulate the problem to enable the application of a Generalized Conditional Gradient (GCG) algorithm, which is further accelerated by leveraging matrix factorization. This factorization introduces a non-convex auxiliary problem, which is efficiently solved using techniques from Zhang et al. (NIPS 2012). Theoretical analysis demonstrates low computational complexity and fast convergence, while experimental results validate the method's scalability and significant speed improvements over state-of-the-art methods.
Strengths:
1. Technical Soundness: The paper is technically robust, with clear theoretical analysis supporting the proposed method's computational efficiency and convergence properties. The complexity reduction to \(O(MN)\) per iteration is a significant improvement over existing methods requiring full Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).
2. Novelty: The reformulation of the structured rank minimization problem and the creative combination of GCG with matrix factorization represent a novel contribution. This approach avoids computationally expensive operations like full SVD and linear system solving, which are common in competing methods.
3. Significance: The addressed problem is highly relevant to applications in machine learning, signal processing, and control theory. The results demonstrate clear advancements over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in scalability to large matrices (e.g., over 300M elements) and faster convergence.
4. Empirical Validation: The experimental results on stochastic system realization and spectral compressed sensing are compelling. The method achieves significant speedups, maintains low memory requirements, and effectively recovers low-rank solutions, even for complex linear structures.
5. Clarity: The paper is well-written and organized, with detailed explanations of the problem formulation, algorithm, and experimental setup. The inclusion of theoretical guarantees further strengthens its clarity.
Weaknesses:
1. Dependence on Supplementary Material: While the paper is well-written, understanding some details (e.g., construction of matrices \(B\) and \(C\)) requires access to supplementary material and referenced papers. This could hinder reproducibility for readers without access to these resources.
2. Non-convexity in Factorization: The introduction of a non-convex auxiliary problem, while efficiently solved, may raise concerns about global optimality. Although the descent property is guaranteed, further discussion on potential limitations or failure cases would strengthen the paper.
3. Limited Comparisons: The experimental comparisons focus primarily on first-order methods from Fazel et al. (2011). Including additional baselines, particularly newer methods, would provide a more comprehensive evaluation.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper addresses a significant and challenging problem, offering a novel and efficient solution with clear theoretical and empirical benefits.
- The proposed method demonstrates substantial advancements in scalability and computational efficiency, making it highly impactful for large-scale applications.
- The combination of theoretical rigor and practical validation makes this a strong contribution to the field.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The reliance on supplementary material for key details could limit accessibility and reproducibility.
- The non-convex auxiliary problem, while well-handled, introduces potential risks that are not fully explored.
Recommendation: Accept with minor revisions. The paper makes a strong scientific contribution, but addressing the reproducibility concerns and providing additional experimental comparisons would further enhance its impact.
