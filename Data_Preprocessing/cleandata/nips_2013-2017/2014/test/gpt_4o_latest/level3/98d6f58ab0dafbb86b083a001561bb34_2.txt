This paper introduces a novel approach to addressing time-data tradeoffs in noiseless regularized linear inverse problems (RLIPs), leveraging excess data to smooth the regularizer and simplify computational solutions. The authors propose a dual-smoothing optimization algorithm and demonstrate its efficacy in reducing computational iterations as sample size increases. The statistical dimension is employed to characterize conditions under which the smoothed RLIP yields the same solution as the original problem. Applications to sparse signal estimation (l1 norm) and low-rank matrix recovery (nuclear norm) are explored, with extensions to noisy signal estimation briefly mentioned. The work builds on prior research in convex optimization and statistical computation, offering a fresh perspective on how excess data can be treated as a computational resource.
Strengths
The paper is technically sound and well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The use of modern convex analysis tools, such as statistical dimension, provides a principled foundation for the proposed method. The dual-smoothing algorithm is clearly described and demonstrates practical advantages, particularly in reducing computational costs for RLIPs with increasing data. The authors convincingly show that their approach is flexible and extends to multiple problem domains, including sparse vector recovery and low-rank matrix recovery. The numerical experiments are thorough and illustrate the time-data tradeoff effectively, with significant computational speedups (e.g., 2.5× for sparse recovery and 5.4× for low-rank recovery). The paper is well-written, organized, and accessible to readers familiar with convex optimization and statistical estimation.
Weaknesses
One concern is the method's dependence on the choice of the optimization algorithm. While the dual-smoothing approach is demonstrated with the Auslender–Teboulle algorithm, its applicability to other specialized algorithms, such as approximate message passing, is not explored. This limits the generalizability of the method. Additionally, while the paper briefly mentions extensions to noisy signal estimation, this aspect is underdeveloped and would benefit from more detailed analysis or experiments. Finally, the heuristic choice of the smoothing parameter (e.g., µ = µ(m)/4) lacks a fully principled justification, which could impact reproducibility and practical adoption.
