The paper presents a novel algorithm for feature selection in activity recognition, leveraging a combination of random walk, set-cover, and greedy optimization. The authors propose three selection criteria: high pairwise class discrimination, consistent discrimination across classes, and coverage of all class pairs. These criteria are combined into a submodular objective function, optimized using a greedy algorithm with a theoretical (1-1/e)-approximation guarantee. The experimental results on the Olympic Sports and UCF101 datasets demonstrate improved classification accuracy compared to baselines and state-of-the-art methods, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
Strengths:  
The paper addresses a significant challenge in action recognition by proposing a compact and discriminative attribute-based representation. The use of submodular optimization is well-motivated, and the theoretical guarantees for the greedy algorithm add rigor to the approach. The combination of human-labeled and data-driven attributes is a notable contribution, demonstrating complementary strengths. The experimental results are compelling, showing consistent improvements over baselines and existing methods. The related work section is thorough, situating the contribution within the broader literature on attribute-based representation and submodular optimization.
Weaknesses:  
While the proposed algorithm shows promise, several issues limit its clarity and completeness. First, the motivation for the second criterion (consistent discrimination across classes) is unclear. It adds complexity to the optimization process, and the authors do not convincingly demonstrate its necessity. The paper briefly mentions sparse coding (Eq. 5) but does not compare it to alternative methods like k-means, leaving its role in the pipeline underexplored. Additionally, hyperparameter tuning details are missing, which raises concerns about reproducibility and the robustness of the reported results. The discrepancy in Table 2 compared to prior work ([20]) is not adequately explained, potentially undermining the validity of the comparisons. Lastly, while the related work section is comprehensive, it omits relevant contributions such as Fu et al.'s work on multi-modal latent attributes, which could provide additional context.
Clarity:  
The paper is generally well-written and organized, but certain sections, such as the explanation of the second criterion and the role of sparse coding, are insufficiently detailed. Minor issues, such as a typo ("Combing" instead of "Combining") and unclear supplementary material, detract from the overall presentation.
Originality and Significance:  
The paper introduces a novel combination of techniques for attribute selection, advancing the state of the art in action recognition. The focus on submodular optimization and the integration of human-labeled and data-driven attributes are innovative. The results suggest that the method has practical significance, with potential applications in multimedia retrieval and video surveillance.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:  
Pros:  
1. Novel and theoretically grounded approach to attribute selection.  
2. Demonstrated improvements over baselines and state-of-the-art methods.  
3. Comprehensive evaluation on two challenging datasets.  
Cons:  
1. Unclear motivation for the second criterion, which complicates optimization.  
2. Missing experimental details, including hyperparameter tuning and sparse coding comparisons.  
3. Discrepancy in results (Table 2) and incomplete related work discussion.  
Recommendation:  
The paper makes a meaningful contribution to action recognition and is worthy of consideration for acceptance. However, the authors should address the unclear motivation for the second criterion, provide more experimental details, and resolve the discrepancies in the results. If these issues are clarified, the paper would be a strong addition to the conference.
