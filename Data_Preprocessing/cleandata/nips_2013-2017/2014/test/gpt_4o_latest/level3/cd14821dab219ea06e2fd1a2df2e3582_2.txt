The paper revisits the classical decision-theoretic problem of weighted expert voting from a statistical learning perspective, focusing on the consistency of the Nitzan-Paroush weighted majority rule. It addresses both the case of known expert competence levels and the more challenging scenario where these levels are unknown and must be estimated. The authors provide sharp error estimates for the optimal rule in the known competence case and propose frequentist and Bayesian approaches for the unknown competence case. The paper also introduces novel proof techniques, utilizes sharper concentration bounds, and highlights several open problems for future exploration.
Strengths:
1. Technical Quality: The paper is technically sound and rigorous. The theoretical results are well-supported by detailed proofs, and the authors carefully discuss the limitations and assumptions of their methods. The use of advanced concentration inequalities, such as the Kearns-Saul inequality, demonstrates a deep understanding of the problem and provides sharper bounds than standard tools like Hoeffding's inequality.
2. Clarity: The paper is well-written and well-organized, with clear explanations of the problem, methods, and results. The authors provide strong intuition behind their theoretical findings, making the work accessible to readers with a solid background in statistical learning and decision theory.
3. Originality: The paper addresses previously unexplored questions about the consistency of the Nitzan-Paroush rule and extends the analysis to the case of unknown competences. The frequentist and Bayesian approaches to handling unknown competences are novel and provide a significant contribution to the field.
4. Significance: The results are important for both theoretical and practical applications, as weighted expert voting is a fundamental problem in decision theory and machine learning. The paper advances the state of the art by providing nearly optimal bounds and raising interesting open problems, such as the computation of error probabilities in the Bayesian setting.
Weaknesses:
1. Limited Empirical Validation: While the theoretical results are strong, the paper does not include empirical experiments to validate the practical applicability of the proposed methods. For example, simulations could illustrate the performance of the frequentist and Bayesian approaches in realistic scenarios.
2. Complexity of Results: Some of the results, particularly in the high-confidence frequentist regime and the Bayesian setting, are highly technical and may be challenging for practitioners to interpret or implement. The lack of a non-trivial bound for the Bayesian error probability is a notable gap.
3. Assumptions: The independence assumption for expert predictions may limit the applicability of the results in real-world settings where experts' opinions are often correlated.
Recommendation:
I recommend acceptance of this paper. Its contributions are significant, and the theoretical insights are both novel and impactful. However, the authors are encouraged to include empirical validation in future work and to explore relaxations of the independence assumption. Additionally, addressing the open problems posed in the paper, particularly in the Bayesian setting, would further enhance its impact.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Rigorous and novel theoretical contributions.
- Clear and well-organized presentation.
- Advances the state of the art in weighted expert voting.
- Highlights open problems that can stimulate future research.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Lack of empirical validation.
- Some results may be too technical for practical implementation.
- Strong reliance on independence assumptions.
Overall, the paper represents a valuable contribution to the field and aligns well with the scope and standards of the conference.
