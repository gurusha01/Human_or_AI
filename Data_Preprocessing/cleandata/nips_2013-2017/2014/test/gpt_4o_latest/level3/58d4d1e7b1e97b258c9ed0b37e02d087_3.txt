The paper presents a Bayesian framework for systematically assessing the identifiability of observer models in perceptual tasks, addressing a critical issue in Bayesian modeling: the degeneracy of solutions. The authors propose a mathematically elegant model that combines computational efficiency with flexibility, making it applicable to a wide range of experimental scenarios. The framework is demonstrated through two case studies—time interval estimation and speed perception—where it evaluates the ability of experimental designs to recover internal representations such as priors and noise characteristics.
Strengths
One of the key strengths of the paper is its focus on identifiability, a foundational yet often overlooked aspect of Bayesian models in perceptual science. By systematically exploring the parameter space using a novel MCMC-based approach, the authors provide a robust method for evaluating the reliability of inferred parameters. The model's mathematical elegance and computational efficiency make it a practical tool for researchers designing experiments. Furthermore, the case studies are well-chosen to illustrate the framework's utility, with clear implications for experimental design in psychophysics. For example, the analysis of time interval estimation highlights how experimental constraints, such as measuring motor noise, can significantly improve the recovery of priors. Similarly, the speed perception case study validates the robustness of inferring slow-speed priors, aligning with empirical findings in the literature.
Another notable strength is the model's identifiability under theoretical assumptions, which allows for distinguishing parameter estimates. This is a significant contribution, as it provides researchers with actionable insights into how to design experiments that minimize degeneracy and improve the reliability of Bayesian model inferences.
Weaknesses
While the contribution is solid, it is incremental, as the framework builds on existing Bayesian models without introducing fundamentally new concepts. The paper would benefit from a more explicit comparison with recent Bayesian models, particularly in terms of how the proposed framework advances the state of the art. Additionally, the identifiability analysis is limited to theoretical assumptions and does not address practical challenges in perceptual science, such as disentangling sensory, decision, and response noise. For instance, the authors assume that motor noise can be independently measured, but this may not always be feasible in real-world experiments.
The clarity of the paper could also be improved. While the mathematical exposition is rigorous, some sections—particularly those detailing the model's parametrization—are dense and may be challenging for readers unfamiliar with the technical details. Including more intuitive explanations or visualizations would enhance accessibility.
Recommendation
Overall, the paper makes a valuable contribution to the field of Bayesian modeling in perception, particularly in its focus on identifiability and experimental design. However, the incremental nature of the contribution and the lack of practical considerations slightly limit its impact. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions, specifically addressing the need for a comparison with recent Bayesian models and a discussion of practical challenges in applying the framework to real-world experiments.
Arguments for Acceptance
