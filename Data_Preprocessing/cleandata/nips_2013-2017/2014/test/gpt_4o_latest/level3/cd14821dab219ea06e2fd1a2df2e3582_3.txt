This paper revisits the classical Nitzan-Paroush strategy for weighted expert voting and provides a rigorous statistical learning perspective on its consistency and error bounds. The authors derive sharp exponential concentration bounds for the error of the optimal weighted majority rule using the Kearns-Saul inequality, which is particularly well-suited for this problem. These results are significant, as they offer a deeper understanding of the conditions under which the error probability decays and at what rate. Notably, Theorem 1(i) provides a strong exponential bound that is linear in the number of experts with correctness probability greater than 1/2 + Îµ, a key strength of the paper.
The analysis extends to scenarios where expert competence levels are unknown and must be estimated empirically. The authors present both frequentist and Bayesian approaches to this problem. The frequentist analysis is thorough, distinguishing between low- and high-confidence regimes. However, the adaptive frequentist result in Theorem 7 has a limitation: it is only useful if the event R holds with high probability for large sample sizes. The authors should clarify when this condition can be expected to hold in practice. Additionally, while the Bayesian approach is elegant and admits a simple optimal empirical decision rule, the inability to compute or bound the error probability for this rule is a notable shortcoming, which the authors acknowledge as an open problem.
The paper is well-written and accessible, even for readers who are not experts in probabilistic weighted-majority analysis. The terminology could be improved for clarity; for instance, renaming "adaptive" to "fully empirical" and "nonadaptive" to "oracle" would better align with the paper's content. The originality of the results is moderate, as the main problem has been studied extensively, but the proof techniques, particularly the use of the Kearns-Saul inequality, are highly original and could inspire further research. The significance of the results lies in their potential to advance the theoretical understanding of weighted majority voting and their applicability to practical decision-making scenarios.
In summary, this paper makes a solid contribution to the field by providing sharp error bounds and exploring both frequentist and Bayesian approaches to weighted expert voting. However, the lack of analysis for Bayesian error probabilities and the limitations of Theorem 7 slightly detract from its overall impact. Strengths include the technical rigor, clarity, and originality of proof techniques, while weaknesses include the incomplete Bayesian analysis and the need for further clarification of certain conditions. Overall, the paper is a meaningful scientific contribution and merits consideration for acceptance.
