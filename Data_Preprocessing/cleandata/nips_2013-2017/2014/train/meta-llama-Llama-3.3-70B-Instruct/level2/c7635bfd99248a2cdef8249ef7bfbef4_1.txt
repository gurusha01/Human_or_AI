This paper proposes a novel framework for speeding up graphical model optimization, called Inference by Learning (IbyL). The approach relies on a multi-scale pruning scheme that progressively reduces the solution space by using a coarse-to-fine cascade of learned classifiers. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their framework on various computer vision problems, including stereo matching, image restoration, and optical flow estimation.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise overview of their approach. The technical details are well-explained, and the experimental results are thorough and convincing. The authors also provide a detailed comparison with existing methods, which helps to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of their approach.
One of the main strengths of the paper is its ability to balance accuracy and speed. The authors demonstrate that their framework can achieve significant speed-ups while maintaining an excellent accuracy of the labeling estimation. The use of a coarse-to-fine cascade of learned classifiers is a key innovation, as it allows the framework to adapt to the specific problem at hand.
The paper also has some limitations. For example, the authors assume that the graphical model is a discrete pairwise CRF/MRF, which may not be the case in all applications. Additionally, the framework requires a significant amount of training data to learn the classifiers, which may not be available in all cases.
Overall, I believe that this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of graphical model optimization. The authors provide a novel and effective framework for speeding up optimization, and their experimental results demonstrate its potential for a wide range of applications.
