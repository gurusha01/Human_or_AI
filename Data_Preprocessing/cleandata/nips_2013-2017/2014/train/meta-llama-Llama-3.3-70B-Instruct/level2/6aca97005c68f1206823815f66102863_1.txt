This paper presents a novel approach to locally weighted regression (LWR) by combining the benefits of Gaussian process regression (GPR) and LWR. The authors propose a probabilistic formulation of LWR, called Local Gaussian Regression (LGR), which retains the fast incremental training of LWR while providing a principled approach to hyperparameter tuning. The key idea is to localize the contribution of each local model towards the global fit of the training data, rather than localizing the training error of individual data points.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the background and motivation of the work. The technical contributions are sound, and the authors provide a detailed derivation of the LGR algorithm. The experimental evaluation is thorough, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of LGR in various robotic inverse dynamics learning tasks.

* The authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the background and motivation of the work.
