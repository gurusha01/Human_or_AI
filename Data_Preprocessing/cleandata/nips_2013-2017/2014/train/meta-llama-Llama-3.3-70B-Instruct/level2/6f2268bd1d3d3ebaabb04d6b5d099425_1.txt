This paper presents a novel approach to joint clustering and outlier detection, formulating the problem as an integer program. The authors propose a Lagrangian relaxation of the problem, which is solved using a subgradient method, and demonstrate that this approach is equivalent to a linear programming relaxation. The resulting algorithm is shown to be simple to implement, highly scalable, and with a small memory footprint.
The paper's main claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on synthetic and real data sets. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach in detecting clusters and outliers, and show that it outperforms other methods, such as k-means-- and APOC, in terms of accuracy and scalability.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the problem formulation, the Lagrangian relaxation, and the subgradient method. The experimental results are thorough and well-presented, and the authors provide a detailed analysis of the results.
The paper's strengths include:
* A novel and effective approach to joint clustering and outlier detection
* A thorough theoretical analysis of the problem and the proposed algorithm
* Extensive experiments on synthetic and real data sets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach
