This paper introduces a novel approach to blind source separation (BSS) problems by incorporating domain knowledge through signal aggregate constraints (SACs). The authors propose an additive factorial hidden Markov model (AFHMM) with SACs, which encourages the total signal for each unknown source to be close to a specified value. The paper provides a clear and well-structured presentation of the problem, related work, and the proposed approach.
The main claims of the paper are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results on a real-world energy disaggregation dataset. The authors demonstrate that the use of SACs significantly improves the performance of the AFHMM, resulting in a 45% decrease in normalized disaggregation error compared to the original AFHMM and a 29% improvement over a recent state-of-the-art approach.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a thorough discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of their approach. The use of SACs is a novel and useful contribution to the field of BSS, and the authors demonstrate its effectiveness in a practical application. The paper also provides a clear and concise presentation of the related work, including a discussion of the limitations of existing approaches.
