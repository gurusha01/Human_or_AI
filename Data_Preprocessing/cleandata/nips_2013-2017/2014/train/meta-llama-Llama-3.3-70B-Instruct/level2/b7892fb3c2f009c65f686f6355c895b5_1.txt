This paper presents a novel Bayesian formulation for nonlinear support vector machines (SVMs) using a Gaussian process and a scaled mixture of normals representation for the SVM hinge loss. The authors extend the previous work on linear Bayesian SVMs to nonlinear SVMs and integrate it into a factor model for joint feature learning and classifier design. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of the methodology, including the derivation of the Bayesian formulation, inference procedures, and experimental results.
The main claims of the paper are: (1) the proposed Bayesian nonlinear SVM formulation provides a more flexible and powerful approach to classification problems, (2) the integration of the nonlinear SVM into a factor model allows for joint feature learning and classifier design, and (3) the use of a skewed Laplace distribution as a more general loss function enhances modeling flexibility and improves MCMC mixing.
The support for these claims is provided through extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets, including USPS and gene expression data. The results show that the proposed nonlinear Bayesian SVM formulation outperforms other methods, including optimization-based SVM and GP classification, in terms of classification accuracy. The authors also demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in joint feature learning and classifier design, and show that it can provide meaningful features that are associated with relevant biological processes.
The paper is well-organized, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the methodology and results. The use of figures and tables to illustrate the results is helpful, and the authors provide sufficient details about the experimental setup and implementation.
