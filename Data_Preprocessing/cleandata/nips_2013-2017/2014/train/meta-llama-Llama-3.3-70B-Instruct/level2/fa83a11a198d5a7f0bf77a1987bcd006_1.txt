This paper proposes a novel bias-corrected estimator for covariance matrix estimation in the presence of autocorrelation, which is a common issue in many real-world applications. The authors demonstrate that the existing Sancetta estimator, while consistent in the high-dimensional limit, suffers from a high bias in finite sample sizes and is sensitive to the choice of the lag parameter. The proposed estimator is shown to be unbiased, robust to the choice of lag parameter, and yields superior performance in simulations on toy data and a real-world data set from an EEG-based Brain-Computer-Interfacing experiment.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, motivation, and related work. The theoretical analysis is thorough, and the simulations are well-designed to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed estimator. The real-world data example is also convincing, showing that the proposed estimator can improve the performance of Brain-Computer-Interfacing experiments.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel bias-corrected estimator that addresses the limitations of the existing Sancetta estimator.
* A thorough theoretical analysis of the estimator, including consistency and bias results.
* Well-designed simulations that demonstrate the advantages of the proposed estimator.
* A convincing real-world data example that shows the practical impact of the proposed estimator.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes a specific form of autocorrelation, which may not be applicable to all real-world scenarios.
* The proposed estimator requires the choice of a lag parameter, which can be challenging in practice.
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the computational complexity of the proposed estimator and its comparison to other methods.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the proposed estimator is a significant contribution to the field of covariance matrix estimation. The paper demonstrates the importance of considering autocorrelation in covariance matrix estimation and provides a practical solution to this problem.
