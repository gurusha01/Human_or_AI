This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of statistical theory, specifically in the area of nonparametric estimation under storage or communication constraints. The authors extend Pinsker's theorem to the case where estimation is carried out under limits on the number of bits used to encode an estimator, and analyze the excess risk in terms of this constraint, the signal size, and the noise level.
The main claim of the paper is that the authors provide a sharp characterization of the Pareto-optimal tradeoff curve for quantized estimation of a normal means vector in the minimax sense. They establish a lower bound on the asymptotic minimax risk for quantized estimators of nonparametric normal means for the case of a Euclidean ball, which is a significant improvement over existing results.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, as well as a detailed statement of their results. The technical proofs are relegated to the supplementary material, which makes the paper more accessible to a broader audience.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The authors provide a novel and significant contribution to the field of statistical theory, which has important implications for applications such as data compression and communication.
* The paper is well-organized, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem and their results.
* The technical proofs are rigorous and well-executed, and the authors provide a detailed analysis of the excess risk in terms of the constraint, signal size, and noise level.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes a high level of technical expertise in statistical theory and information theory, which may make it inaccessible to some readers.
* The authors do not provide a clear discussion of the practical implications of their results, which may limit the paper's appeal to a broader audience.
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with existing results in the field, which would help to contextualize the authors' contributions.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication, as it presents a significant and novel contribution to the field of statistical theory. However, I would suggest that the authors provide a more detailed discussion of the practical implications of their results, as well as a clearer comparison with existing results in the field.
