This paper proposes a unified low-rank tensor learning framework for multivariate spatio-temporal analysis, which can efficiently incorporate different properties in spatio-temporal data, such as spatial clustering and shared structure among variables. The authors demonstrate how the general framework can be applied to cokriging and forecasting tasks and develop an efficient greedy algorithm to solve the resulting optimization problem with convergence guarantee.
The paper's main claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors provide a thorough review of existing work in the field and clearly explain how their approach differs from previous contributions. The use of low-rank tensor learning and greedy algorithm is well-motivated, and the authors provide a detailed explanation of the optimization problem and the algorithm used to solve it.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide sufficient details for reproducibility. The experiments are thorough, and the results are impressive, showing that the proposed method outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency. The authors also provide a qualitative study, which provides insights into the predictive regions analyzed by the greedy algorithm.
