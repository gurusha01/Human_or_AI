This paper presents a new method for recovering the identities, amplitudes, and translations of waveforms that compose a signal. The method, called Continuous Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (COMP), is an extension of the Continuous Basis Pursuit (CBP) algorithm and leverages the success of Orthogonal Matching Pursuit in the realm of sparse recovery. The authors introduce a new basis derived from a singular value decomposition, which can also be used with CBP, and move to the Fourier domain to fine-tune the recovered time shifts.
The main claims of the paper are that COMP obtains increased accuracy and greatly increased speed over CBP across nearly all regimes tested, and that the SVD basis can also be used with CBP to increase its performance. The authors support these claims with simulations on both synthetic and neural data, showing that COMP outperforms CBP in terms of accuracy and speed.
The paper is well-written and clearly organized, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments and understand the methodology. The authors provide a thorough introduction to the problem and the existing methods, and clearly explain the contributions of their work. The simulations and results are well-presented and convincing, demonstrating the effectiveness of COMP.
The strengths of the paper include the novelty of the approach, the thorough evaluation of the method, and the clear presentation of the results. The authors also provide a detailed discussion of the limitations of the method and potential future directions.
The weaknesses of the paper are minor. One potential limitation is that the authors do not provide a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of COMP, which could be important for large-scale applications. Additionally, the authors could provide more discussion on the potential applications of COMP beyond spike-sorting in neural data.
Overall, the paper is well-written, well-organized, and presents a significant contribution to the field. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of COMP and provide a clear and convincing argument for its use.
