This paper proposes a general framework for learning distributed representations of attributes, which are characteristics of text that can be jointly learned with word embeddings. The authors introduce a third-order model where word context and attribute vectors interact multiplicatively to predict the next word in a sequence, leading to the notion of conditional word similarity. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach on several NLP tasks, including sentiment classification, cross-lingual document classification, and blog authorship attribution.
The strengths of this paper include its novel approach to modeling attributes and its ability to capture nuanced relationships between words and attributes. The experiments are well-designed and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model on a range of tasks. The paper is also well-written and easy to follow, with clear explanations of the model and its components.
One potential weakness of the paper is that it relies heavily on the quality of the attribute representations, which may not always be available or accurate. The authors acknowledge this limitation and propose an inference step to learn attribute representations at test time, but this may not always be effective. Additionally, the paper could benefit from more analysis of the learned attribute representations and their relationship to the word embeddings.
Overall, this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of NLP and has the potential to be useful in a range of applications. The proposed model is novel and well-motivated, and the experiments demonstrate its effectiveness on several tasks.
