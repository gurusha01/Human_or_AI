This paper proposes a novel prior formulation, the structured spike and slab prior, which allows for the incorporation of prior knowledge about the sparsity pattern in sparse signal recovery problems. The authors also develop a Bayesian inference scheme based on expectation propagation for the proposed model. The main claims of the paper are that the proposed model can effectively encode prior information about the structure of the sparsity pattern and that the expectation propagation-based algorithm can efficiently perform Bayesian inference under the proposed model.
The support for these claims comes from numerical experiments on synthetic data, which demonstrate the benefits of the model in terms of improved reconstruction accuracy and phase transition points. The experiments also show that the proposed algorithm outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, such as LARS and BG-AMP, in certain scenarios.
The paper is well-written, and the ideas are clearly presented. The authors provide a thorough review of related work and demonstrate a good understanding of the field. The use of expectation propagation as a Bayesian inference scheme is a good choice, given the complexity of the model.
The usefulness of the proposed model and algorithm is evident from the numerical experiments, which demonstrate their potential in various applications, such as EEG source localization and image reconstruction. The authors also provide a clear outline of future work, including developing a scheme for learning the structure of the sparsity pattern and extending the algorithm to the multiple measurement vector formulation with slowly changing support.
In terms of novelty, the paper presents a significant improvement over existing approaches by allowing for the incorporation of prior knowledge about the sparsity pattern. The use of a Gaussian process as a prior on the parameters Î³i is a new and interesting idea, and the authors demonstrate its effectiveness in encoding prior information about the structure of the sparsity pattern.
The paper is complete and well-organized, with sufficient details provided for reproducibility. The authors acknowledge the limitations of their approach, including the computational complexity of the algorithm, and provide suggestions for future improvements.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication. The ideas are novel and well-presented, and the numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and algorithm. The paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of sparse signal recovery and Bayesian inference.
