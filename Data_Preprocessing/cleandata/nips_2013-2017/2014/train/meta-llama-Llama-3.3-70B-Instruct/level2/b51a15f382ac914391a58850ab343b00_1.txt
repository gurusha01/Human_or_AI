This paper proposes a Generalized Unsupervised Manifold Alignment (GUMA) method to build connections between different but correlated datasets without any known correspondences. The main claims of the paper are that GUMA can simultaneously discover and align manifold structures, perform structure matching globally, and conduct heterogeneous manifold alignment well by finding the embedding feature spaces.
The paper provides a clear and well-organized introduction to the problem of manifold alignment, including the limitations of existing methods and the motivations behind the proposed approach. The authors formulate the problem as an explicit 0-1 integer optimization problem, considering the matching of global manifold structures as well as sample features. The optimization problem is then solved using an efficient alternate optimization algorithm, which alternately solves two submodels: one for learning alignment with integer constraints and the other for learning transforms to get the mutual embedding subspace.
The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed method on various tasks, including set matching, video face recognition, and visual domain adaptation. The results show that GUMA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in most cases, and the authors provide a detailed analysis of the results and the advantages of their approach.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the proposed method and its components. The experimental results are thorough and well-presented, and the authors provide a detailed comparison with other methods.
The strengths of the paper include:
* A clear and well-organized introduction to the problem and the proposed approach
* A well-formulated optimization problem that considers both global manifold structures and sample features
* An efficient alternate optimization algorithm that solves the optimization problem
* Thorough and well-presented experimental results that demonstrate the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed method
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The optimization problem is NP-hard, and the authors use a relaxed convex objective function to solve it, which may not always converge to the global optimum
* The algorithm requires careful tuning of hyperparameters, which can be time-consuming and may not always lead to the best results
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the algorithm and its scalability to large datasets
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of manifold alignment and provides a useful tool for building connections between different but correlated datasets. The proposed method has the potential to be applied to a wide range of applications, including computer vision, machine learning, and data mining.
