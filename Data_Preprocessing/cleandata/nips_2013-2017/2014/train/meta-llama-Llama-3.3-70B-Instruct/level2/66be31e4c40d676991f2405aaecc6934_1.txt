This paper introduces the concept of a pseudo-ensemble, a collection of child models spawned from a parent model by perturbing it with some noise process. The authors formalize this notion and explore its relationship to standard ensemble methods and existing notions of robustness. They also develop a novel regularizer, Pseudo-Ensemble Agreement (PEA), which minimizes variation in the output of a model when it is subject to noise on its inputs and internal state. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of PEA regularization in both fully-supervised and semi-supervised settings, achieving state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks.
The paper's main claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors provide a clear and concise definition of pseudo-ensembles and demonstrate their connection to existing methods such as dropout. The PEA regularizer is also well-motivated and its effectiveness is demonstrated through a series of experiments.
The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with clear explanations of the concepts and methods introduced. The authors provide sufficient background information and references to related work, making it easy for readers to understand the context and significance of the contributions.
The strengths of the paper include its novel and well-motivated concept of pseudo-ensembles, its clear and concise writing style, and its thorough experimental evaluation. The weaknesses of the paper are minor and include some minor typos and formatting issues.
