This paper proposes a novel framework for regularization based on group-induced majorization, which provides a unified perspective on various existing regularization techniques. The authors introduce the concept of orbitopes, which are convex hulls of group orbits, and demonstrate how several well-known regularizers can be recovered as special cases. The paper also explores the connection between the permutahedron and the recently proposed sorted `1-norm, and derives procedures for learning with these orbit regularizers via conditional and projected gradient algorithms.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the concept of group-induced majorization and its application to regularization. The technical contributions of the paper are significant, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of the properties of orbitopes and their relationship to existing regularization techniques.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to unify various existing regularization techniques under a single framework. The authors demonstrate how several well-known regularizers, including `1, `2, `âˆž, spectral, and nuclear matrix norms, can be recovered as special cases of the orbitope regularizer. This provides a new perspective on these techniques and highlights the connections between them.
The paper also makes significant contributions to the development of new regularization techniques. The authors introduce the permutahedron and signed permutahedron as new regularizers, and demonstrate their effectiveness in numerical experiments. The connection between the permutahedron and the sorted `1-norm is also an important contribution, as it provides a new insight into the properties of these regularizers.
The numerical experiments presented in the paper demonstrate the effectiveness of the orbitope regularizers in practice. The authors show that the permutahedron and signed permutahedron can outperform existing regularizers, such as `1 and `2, in certain scenarios. The continuation algorithm proposed in the paper is also shown to be effective in exploring the orbits and finding good solutions.
Overall, this paper makes significant contributions to the field of regularization and provides a new perspective on existing techniques. The technical quality of the paper is high, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of the properties of orbitopes and their relationship to existing regularization techniques. The paper is well-written and easy to follow, making it accessible to a wide range of readers.
