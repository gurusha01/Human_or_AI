This paper presents a statistical decision-theoretic framework for social choice, which views the problem of social choice as a decision-making problem under uncertainty. The authors develop a general framework that couples a statistical ranking model with an explicit decision space and loss function, and use Bayesian estimators as social choice mechanisms. The paper focuses on two parametric ranking models, the Mallows model and the Condorcet model, and derives two voting rules as Bayesian estimators. The authors evaluate these rules with respect to various normative properties, including anonymity, neutrality, monotonicity, and computational complexity.
The main claims of the paper are: (1) the proposed framework provides a principled methodology for the design and analysis of new voting rules; (2) the Bayesian estimators for the Mallows model and the Condorcet model satisfy some desired normative properties, but not others; (3) the computational complexity of the two rules is different, with the Bayesian estimator for the Condorcet model being computable in polynomial time, while the Bayesian estimator for the Mallows model is PNP||-hard; and (4) the asymptotic outcomes of the two rules are different when the data are generated from the Condorcet model.
The support for these claims is provided through theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors prove the normative properties of the Bayesian estimators and analyze their computational complexity. They also conduct experiments on synthetic data to compare the performance of the two rules with the Kemeny rule.
The usefulness of the ideas presented in the paper is evident, as they provide a new perspective on social choice and voting rules. The framework is general and flexible, and can be applied to various domains, such as political elections, meta-search engines, and recommender systems. The paper also highlights the importance of considering both statistical and social choice properties when designing voting rules.
The paper reflects common knowledge in the field, citing relevant literature and using established concepts and terminology. The authors also demonstrate a good understanding of the related work, discussing the limitations of previous approaches and highlighting the novelty of their contribution.
The novelty of the paper lies in its application of statistical decision theory to social choice, which provides a new perspective on the problem. The authors also derive new voting rules and analyze their properties, which contributes to the existing literature on social choice.
The completeness of the paper is good, with sufficient details provided for reproducibility. The authors provide proofs for the theoretical results and describe the experimental setup and results.
The limitations of the paper are acknowledged by the authors, who note that the Bayesian estimators do not satisfy all desired normative properties and that the computational complexity of the rules is different. The authors also discuss the open questions and future directions, such as characterizing the majority and Condorcet criterion of the Bayesian estimator for the Mallows model.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the arguments for and against acceptance are:
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper presents a new and interesting perspective on social choice
* The framework is general and flexible, and can be applied to various domains
