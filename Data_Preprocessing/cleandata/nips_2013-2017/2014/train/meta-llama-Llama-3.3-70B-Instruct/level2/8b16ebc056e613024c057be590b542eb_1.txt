This paper proposes a novel approach to inferring direct neural network connections from Calcium imaging time series using inverse covariance estimation. The authors introduce a simple convolution filter prior to applying sample covariance, which can be learned quickly using a supervised optimization algorithm. The main claim of the paper is that this approach can significantly improve the accuracy of inverse covariance estimation, achieving AUC scores competitive with the winning solution in the Kaggle Connectomics competition.
The paper is well-written and clearly organized, with a thorough introduction to the problem and related work. The authors provide a detailed description of their methodology, including the convolution filter and supervised optimization algorithm. The results are impressive, with the proposed algorithm achieving high AUC scores on the Kaggle Connectomics dataset.
The strengths of the paper include its novelty, clarity, and empirical evaluation. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the sensitivity of model performance to signal processing parameters and demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach in improving inverse covariance estimation. The use of a supervised optimization algorithm to learn the convolution filter is a significant contribution, as it eliminates the need for time-intensive grid search or coordinate ascent.
The weaknesses of the paper include the reliance on a Gaussian model for inverse covariance, despite the non-Gaussian nature of the data. The authors acknowledge this limitation and suggest that the learned convolution filter compensates for the model mis-specification. Additionally, the paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the implications of the results and potential applications to other fields.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, with a clear and well-motivated methodology. The claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and empirical results. The paper is also well-organized and clearly written, making it easy to follow.
The originality of the paper is high, as it introduces a novel approach to inverse covariance estimation and demonstrates its effectiveness in a challenging problem. The significance of the results is also high, as they have the potential to impact the field of neuroscience and beyond.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, as it makes a significant contribution to the field of neural network connectivity inference and demonstrates a novel and effective approach to inverse covariance estimation. The paper is well-written, clearly organized, and provides a thorough analysis of the results. With some minor revisions to address the limitations and implications of the results, the paper has the potential to be a valuable contribution to the field.
