This paper presents a novel framework for constructing prior distributions with structured variables, specifically focusing on sparse structure. The authors propose a principled approach based on the maximum entropy principle, where the prior is defined as the information projection of a base distribution onto the constraint set of interest. The main technical contributions include showing that the information projection of a base density to a domain constraint is given by its restriction, and proposing a family of parameterized approximations indexed by subsets of the domain when the restriction is intractable.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem and their approach. The technical sections are thorough and well-explained, with relevant references to previous work. The experiments on simulated data and high-dimensional neuroimaging data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of support recovery and predictive accuracy.
The strengths of the paper include:
* A clear and well-motivated introduction to the problem of constructing prior distributions with structured variables
* A principled and well-explained approach based on the maximum entropy principle
* Thorough and well-explained technical sections
* Effective experiments on simulated data and high-dimensional neuroimaging data
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes a strong background in Bayesian inference and information theory, which may make it difficult for non-experts to follow
* Some of the technical sections are dense and require careful reading to understand
* The paper could benefit from more discussion on the limitations and potential extensions of the proposed approach
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication. The authors have made a significant contribution to the field of Bayesian inference, and their approach has the potential to be widely applicable in a variety of domains.
