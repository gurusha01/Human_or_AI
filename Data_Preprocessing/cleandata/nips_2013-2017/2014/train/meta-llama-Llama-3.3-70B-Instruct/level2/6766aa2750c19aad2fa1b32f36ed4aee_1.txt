This paper presents a novel approach to policy search in continuous control tasks, leveraging iteratively refitted local linear models to optimize trajectory distributions under unknown dynamics. The authors propose a hybrid method that combines the strengths of model-based and model-free techniques, allowing for efficient optimization of complex policies in high-dimensional spaces.
The main claims of the paper are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors demonstrate that their approach outperforms prior methods in terms of sample complexity and quality of learned trajectories, and show that it can handle complex, non-smooth dynamics and partially observed tasks.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their approach, including the underlying mathematics and algorithms. The experimental evaluation is thorough, covering a range of tasks, including simulated robotic manipulation and locomotion.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposed approach is novel and well-motivated, addressing a significant challenge in policy search.
* The theoretical analysis is sound, providing a clear understanding of the underlying mathematics.
* The experimental evaluation is comprehensive, demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach in a range of tasks.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The approach relies on a number of assumptions, including the use of local linear models and a background dynamics distribution, which may not always hold in practice.
* The computational cost of the approach is not fully discussed, which could be a limitation in practice.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of policy search, and the proposed approach has the potential to be widely applicable in a range of domains.
