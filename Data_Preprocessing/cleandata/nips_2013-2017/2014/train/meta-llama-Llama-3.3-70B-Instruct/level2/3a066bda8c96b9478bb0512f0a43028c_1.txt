This paper proposes a novel learning algorithm called expectation loss SVM (e-SVM) that can handle situations where the labels of training data are continuous values within a bounded interval. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of e-SVM in segment proposal classification tasks under both strong and weak supervision, outperforming alternative approaches such as Support Vector Classification (SVC) and Support Vector Regression (SVR). The algorithm is also applied to two major computer vision tasks: semantic segmentation and object detection, achieving state-of-the-art object detection performance on the PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset.
The paper is well-structured, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the proposed algorithm, its strengths, and its limitations. The experimental results are thorough and demonstrate the effectiveness of e-SVM in various scenarios. The authors also provide a detailed comparison with existing methods, highlighting the advantages of their approach.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel learning algorithm that can handle continuous labels within a bounded interval
* The demonstration of the algorithm's effectiveness in various computer vision tasks, including segment proposal classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection
* The thorough experimental evaluation and comparison with existing methods
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The assumption that the positiveness of each segment proposal is a continuous value within a bounded interval, which may not always be the case in real-world applications
* The lack of a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm
* The limited discussion of potential applications of the algorithm beyond computer vision tasks
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of machine learning and computer vision, and the proposed algorithm has the potential to be applied to a wide range of applications. The authors demonstrate a good understanding of the related work and provide a clear explanation of the proposed algorithm and its strengths and limitations.
