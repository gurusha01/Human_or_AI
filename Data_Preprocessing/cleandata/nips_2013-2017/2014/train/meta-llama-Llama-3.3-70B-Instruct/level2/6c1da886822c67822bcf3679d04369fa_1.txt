This paper presents a novel approach to recommender systems that balances the trade-off between accuracy and user privacy. The authors propose a two-tiered notion of privacy, where a small set of "public" users share their preferences openly, and a larger set of "private" users require privacy guarantees. The paper provides theoretical guarantees for estimating item features in matrix completion problems and demonstrates empirically that a moderate number of public users suffices for reasonable accuracy.
The paper's main contributions are three-fold: (1) explicit guarantees for estimating item features, (2) a method for predicting ratings for new users based on the degree of overlap between their private ratings and the relevant item subspace, and (3) a new privacy mechanism for releasing 2nd order information needed for estimating item features while maintaining 1st order deniability.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their approach. The theoretical analysis is rigorous, and the empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The paper also provides a comprehensive review of related work and highlights the advantages of the proposed approach over existing methods.
Strengths:
* The paper presents a novel approach to balancing accuracy and privacy in recommender systems.
* The theoretical analysis provides explicit guarantees for estimating item features.
* The empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
* The paper provides a comprehensive review of related work.
Weaknesses:
* The paper assumes that the number of ratings for each user is larger than a certain threshold, which may not always be the case in practice.
* The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed method.
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the potential applications and limitations of the proposed approach.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper presents a novel and innovative approach to balancing accuracy and privacy in recommender systems.
* The theoretical analysis is rigorous and provides explicit guarantees for estimating item features.
* The empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The paper assumes that the number of ratings for each user is larger than a certain threshold, which may not always be the case in practice.
* The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed method.
Overall, I recommend accepting this paper because it presents a novel and innovative approach to balancing accuracy and privacy in recommender systems, and the theoretical analysis and empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. However, the authors should address the weaknesses mentioned above in the final version of the paper.
