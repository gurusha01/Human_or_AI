This paper proposes a new tight continuous relaxation for the balanced k-cut problem, which is a fundamental problem in graph-based clustering. The authors show that their relaxation is tighter than existing relaxations, such as the one proposed in [13], and that it can be optimized using a novel monotonic descent algorithm. The paper provides a thorough analysis of the relaxation and the algorithm, including theoretical guarantees and experimental results on various datasets.
The main claims of the paper are:
1. The proposed relaxation is tighter than existing relaxations, such as the one proposed in [13].
2. The relaxation can be optimized using a novel monotonic descent algorithm.
3. The algorithm converges to a partition of the graph, which is the desired output of the clustering problem.
The support for these claims is provided through a combination of theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors show that their relaxation is indeed tighter than existing relaxations, and that their algorithm converges to a partition of the graph. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on various datasets, including comparisons with other state-of-the-art clustering methods.
The usefulness of the proposed method is clear, as it provides a new and effective way to solve the balanced k-cut problem, which is a fundamental problem in graph-based clustering. The method is also flexible, as it can handle various balancing functions and can be used in a transductive setting.
