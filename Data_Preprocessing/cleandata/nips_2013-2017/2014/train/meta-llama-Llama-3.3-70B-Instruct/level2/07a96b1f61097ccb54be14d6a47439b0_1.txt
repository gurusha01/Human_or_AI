This paper presents a novel approach to recover low-rank matrices from grossly corrupted observations, particularly when the data exhibits clustering structures. The authors argue that the existing Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) method may not perform well in such cases due to its assumption of incoherent data. To address this limitation, they propose using the Low-Rank Representation (LRR) framework with a properly configured dictionary matrix.
The main claims of the paper are: (1) the LRR framework can handle coherent data by learning a suitable dictionary matrix, and (2) the proposed algorithm outperforms RPCA in experiments on both randomly generated matrices and real motion sequences. The authors provide theoretical guarantees for the exact and near recovery of the low-rank matrix using LRR, and demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through extensive experiments.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem and their approach. The technical sections are also well-organized, and the proofs of the theorems are provided in the appendix. The experiments are thorough and demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over RPCA.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The authors identify a significant limitation of the existing RPCA method and propose a novel approach to address it.
* The theoretical guarantees provided for the LRR framework are rigorous and well-established.
* The experiments are extensive and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in various settings.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The proposed algorithm requires the estimation of the rank of the low-rank matrix, which can be challenging in practice.
* The choice of the dictionary matrix is critical to the performance of the algorithm, and the authors do not provide a clear guideline for selecting the dictionary matrix in practice.
* The computational complexity of the proposed algorithm is not thoroughly analyzed, which may be a concern for large-scale applications.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of low-rank matrix recovery and provides a novel approach to handling coherent data. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through thorough experiments, and the theoretical guarantees provided are rigorous and well-established.
