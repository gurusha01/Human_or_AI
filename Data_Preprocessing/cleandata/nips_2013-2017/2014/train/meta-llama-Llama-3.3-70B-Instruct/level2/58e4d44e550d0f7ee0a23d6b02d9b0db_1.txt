This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of numerical linear algebra, specifically in the context of low-rank approximation in the streaming model. The authors provide a lower bound of Ω(dk/ε) bits of space for any streaming algorithm that outputs a k × d matrix R, such that ‖A - AR†R‖F ≤ (1 + ε)‖A - Ak‖F, where A is an n × d matrix and Ak is the best rank-k approximation to A.
The main claim of the paper is that this lower bound is almost tight, as it matches the upper bound of O(dk/ε) words of space provided by Ghashami and Phillips up to the word size. The authors achieve this by reducing the problem to a two-player communication game, where Alice and Bob try to solve an instance of the Index problem. The key insight is that if Bob can output a rank-k projection matrix P that provides a good low-rank approximation to the matrix B, then he can recover a significant amount of information about the input string x.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of their techniques. The proof of the main theorem is technical, but the authors break it down into manageable pieces and provide helpful lemmas and corollaries to support their argument.
The significance of this work lies in its implications for the design of efficient streaming algorithms for low-rank approximation. The authors show that the algorithm of Liberty, with an improved analysis by Ghashami and Phillips, is optimal up to the word size, which provides a strong foundation for future research in this area.
The paper also raises interesting questions about the possibility of obtaining multi-pass lower bounds, which could have significant implications for the design of efficient algorithms for low-rank approximation in various models.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication, as it presents a significant contribution to the field of numerical linear algebra and provides a thorough and well-written analysis of the problem.
