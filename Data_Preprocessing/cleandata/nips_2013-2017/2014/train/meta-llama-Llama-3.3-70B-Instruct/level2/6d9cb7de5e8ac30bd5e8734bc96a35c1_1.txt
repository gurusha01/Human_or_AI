This paper proposes a new norm, called the scaled latent trace norm, for multitask learning problems where tasks are indexed by multiple dimensions. The authors argue that existing norms, such as the overlapped trace norm and the latent trace norm, are not optimal in this setting, particularly when the dimensions or multilinear rank are heterogeneous. The scaled latent trace norm is shown to have better performance in various settings, including matrix completion, multitask learning, and multilinear multitask learning.
The paper is well-written and provides a clear overview of the problem and the proposed solution. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the excess risk of the three norms, including the scaled latent trace norm, and demonstrate its advantage in various settings. The experimental results on synthetic and real-world data sets also support the theoretical findings.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a new norm that addresses the limitations of existing norms in multitask learning problems with multiple dimensions.
* A thorough analysis of the excess risk of the three norms, including the scaled latent trace norm.
* Experimental results on synthetic and real-world data sets that demonstrate the advantage of the scaled latent trace norm.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes that the tasks are indexed by a pair of indices, which may not be the case in all multitask learning problems.
* The analysis of the excess risk is based on Rademacher complexity, which may not provide a tight bound in all cases.
* The experimental results are limited to a few data sets, and more extensive experiments would be needed to fully demonstrate the advantage of the scaled latent trace norm.
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of multitask learning and provides a new tool for addressing problems with multiple dimensions. The results are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results, and the paper is well-written and easy to follow.
