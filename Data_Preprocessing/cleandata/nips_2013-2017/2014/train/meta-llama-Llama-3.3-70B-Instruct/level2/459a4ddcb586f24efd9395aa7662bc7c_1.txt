This paper proposes a novel algorithm called Sparse Random Features, which learns a sparse non-linear predictor by minimizing an l1-regularized objective function over the Hilbert Space induced from a kernel function. The authors interpret the algorithm as Randomized Coordinate Descent in an infinite-dimensional space and provide a convergence analysis, showing that the proposed approach converges to a solution within ε-precision of that using an exact kernel method.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem and the proposed solution. The technical sections are also well-organized, and the proofs are provided in the appendix. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in terms of sparsity and efficiency.
The main claims of the paper are:
1. The proposed Sparse Random Features algorithm can achieve a sparse solution that requires less memory and prediction time while maintaining comparable performance on regression and classification tasks.
2. The algorithm converges to a solution within ε-precision of that using an exact kernel method, with a convergence rate of O(1/ε).
3. The proposed algorithm outperforms the existing Random Features algorithm and the kernel method in terms of sparsity and efficiency.
The support for these claims is provided through theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors provide a detailed convergence analysis, which shows that the proposed algorithm converges to a solution within ε-precision of that using an exact kernel method. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in terms of sparsity and efficiency.
