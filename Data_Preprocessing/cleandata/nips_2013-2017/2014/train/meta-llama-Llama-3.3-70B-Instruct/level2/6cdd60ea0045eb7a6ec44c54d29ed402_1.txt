This paper proposes a novel robust logistic regression algorithm, called RoLR, which estimates the parameter through a simple linear programming procedure. The authors prove that RoLR is robust to a constant fraction of adversarial outliers in the covariate matrix. The paper also applies RoLR to solving binary classification problems where a fraction of training samples are corrupted.
The main claims of the paper are: (1) RoLR is robust to a constant fraction of adversarial outliers, and (2) RoLR can be applied to binary classification problems with corrupted training samples. The authors support these claims with theoretical analysis and experimental results.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem of logistic regression with outliers. The related work section is also well-organized, and the authors provide a good overview of existing methods for robust logistic regression.
The theoretical analysis of RoLR is sound, and the authors provide a thorough proof of the algorithm's robustness. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of RoLR in both logistic regression and binary classification tasks.
The strengths of the paper include: (1) the proposal of a novel robust logistic regression algorithm, (2) the provision of theoretical guarantees for the algorithm's robustness, and (3) the demonstration of the algorithm's effectiveness in experimental results.
The weaknesses of the paper include: (1) the assumption that the outliers are adversarial, which may not always be the case in practice, and (2) the lack of comparison with other robust logistic regression methods.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the authors provide a significant contribution to the field of robust logistic regression. The proposed algorithm, RoLR, has the potential to be widely used in practice, especially in applications where outliers are common.
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel robust logistic regression algorithm with theoretical guarantees.
