This paper presents a novel approach to identifying and filtering out adversarial workers in crowdsourcing systems, which is a crucial problem in inferring true labels of tasks. The authors propose a reputation algorithm that assigns penalties to workers based on label disagreements and uses optimal semi-matchings to distribute these penalties in a load-balanced manner. The algorithm is designed to be robust to manipulation by sophisticated adversaries and can be used in conjunction with existing label aggregation algorithms.
The paper makes several key contributions. Firstly, it provides a thorough analysis of the problem of inferring true labels in the presence of adversarial workers, which is a significant departure from the standard random worker model. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their algorithm through a combination of theoretical guarantees and empirical results on real-world datasets. The results show that the algorithm can significantly improve the accuracy of existing label aggregation algorithms and detect workers who exhibit non-random strategies.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their approach. The theoretical analysis is rigorous, and the empirical results are convincing. The authors also provide a comprehensive review of related work, which helps to situate their contribution in the context of existing research.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to handle sophisticated adversaries who can adopt arbitrary labeling strategies. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the worst-case scenario and establish lower bounds on the minimum "damage" achievable by the adversaries. This provides a fundamental limit on the performance of any label aggregation algorithm in the presence of such adversaries.
The paper also has some limitations. For example, the algorithm assumes that the worker-task assignment graph is known, which may not always be the case in practice. Additionally, the algorithm may not perform well in scenarios where the number of adversarial workers is very large or where the adversaries are highly sophisticated.
Overall, this paper presents a significant contribution to the field of crowdsourcing and label aggregation. The proposed algorithm is novel, effective, and robust, and the theoretical analysis provides a thorough understanding of the problem. The empirical results demonstrate the practical applicability of the algorithm, and the paper provides a comprehensive review of related work.
