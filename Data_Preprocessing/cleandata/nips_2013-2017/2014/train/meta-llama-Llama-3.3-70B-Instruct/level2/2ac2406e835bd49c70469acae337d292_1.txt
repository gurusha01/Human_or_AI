This paper proposes a novel approach to learning Mixture of Hidden Markov Models (MHMM) using the Method of Moments (MoM). The authors demonstrate that an MHMM can be represented as a single Hidden Markov Model (HMM) with a block-diagonal transition matrix, allowing them to leverage existing MoM algorithms for HMMs. However, this approach introduces a permutation ambiguity, which the authors address by exploiting the spectral properties of the global transition matrix.
The paper's main claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, and their proposed algorithm is well-motivated and easy to follow. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, both in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency, compared to traditional Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithms.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a thorough review of related work in the field. The use of spectral properties to resolve the permutation ambiguity is a novel and interesting contribution. The experiments are well-designed, and the results are clearly presented.
One potential limitation of the paper is that the authors assume that the number of hidden states in each HMM is the same, which may not always be the case in practice. Additionally, the authors do not provide a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of their algorithm, which would be useful for understanding its scalability.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of machine learning, and the proposed approach has the potential to be useful in a variety of applications. The authors demonstrate a good understanding of the relevant literature and provide a clear and well-motivated presentation of their work.
