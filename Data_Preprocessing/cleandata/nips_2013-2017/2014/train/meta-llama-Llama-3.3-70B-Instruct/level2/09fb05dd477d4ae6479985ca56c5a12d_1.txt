This paper proposes a novel approach to object detection, called Large Scale Detection through Adaptation (LSDA), which enables the transformation of image classifiers into object detectors without requiring bounding box annotations for all categories. The authors claim that their method can significantly improve the performance of object detection on a large scale, making it possible to detect tens of thousands of categories.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise overview of their approach. The technical details are well-explained, and the experimental results are thorough and convincing. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on the ImageNet LSVRC-2013 detection challenge, achieving a 50% relative improvement in mean average precision (mAP) over a baseline method.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposed approach is novel and addresses a significant challenge in object detection, which is the lack of bounding box annotations for many categories.
* The authors provide a thorough analysis of their approach, including an ablation study and an error analysis, which helps to understand the strengths and weaknesses of their method.
* The experimental results are impressive, and the authors demonstrate the potential of their approach to enable detection of tens of thousands of categories.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The approach requires a significant amount of classification data, which may not be available for all categories.
* The authors do not provide a direct comparison with other state-of-the-art object detection methods, which makes it difficult to assess the relative performance of their approach.
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the limitations of the approach and potential avenues for future work.
Overall, I believe that this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of object detection and has the potential to enable large-scale detection of tens of thousands of categories. The approach is novel, and the experimental results are convincing. However, the paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the limitations of the approach and potential avenues for future work.
