This paper explores the connection between dimensionality and communication cost in distributed learning problems, specifically in estimating the mean of a d-dimensional Gaussian distribution. The authors provide a lower bound on the communication cost, showing that it scales linearly with the number of dimensions, and demonstrate an interactive protocol that achieves the minimax squared loss with O(md) bits of communication. They also initiate the study of distributed parameter estimation problems with structured parameters, providing a simple thresholding-based protocol for sparse parameter estimation.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem and their approach. The technical sections are also well-organized, and the proofs are thorough and easy to follow. The authors provide a good balance between theoretical analysis and practical implications, making the paper accessible to a broad audience.
The main claims of the paper are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors provide a direct-sum theorem, which relates the information cost of a d-dimensional problem to a one-dimensional problem, and use this theorem to establish a lower bound on the communication cost. They also demonstrate the effectiveness of their interactive protocol and thresholding-based protocol through theoretical analysis and experimental results.
The paper has several strengths, including its clear and concise writing style, thorough technical analysis, and good balance between theoretical and practical implications. The authors also provide a good discussion of the limitations of their approach and potential future directions.
However, there are some areas where the paper could be improved. For example, the authors could provide more experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness of their protocols in practice. Additionally, they could discuss the potential applications of their approach in more detail, and provide more context about the related work in the field.
Overall, I would rate this paper as a strong accept. The authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, a thorough technical analysis, and a good balance between theoretical and practical implications. The paper has several strengths, including its writing style, technical analysis, and discussion of limitations and future directions.
