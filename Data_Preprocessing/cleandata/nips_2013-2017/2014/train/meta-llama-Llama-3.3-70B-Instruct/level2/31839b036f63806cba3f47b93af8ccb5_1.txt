This paper addresses the problem of determining whether a causal or probabilistic query is estimable from data corrupted by missing entries, given a model of the missingness process. The authors extend the results of Mohan et al. [2013] by presenting more general conditions for recovering probabilistic queries and causal queries. The paper introduces the concept of Missingness Graphs (m-graphs) to explicitly portray the missingness process and the dependencies among variables in the available dataset.
The main claims of the paper are: (1) the authors provide sufficient conditions for recovering probabilistic queries, such as joint and conditional distributions, using general ordered factorization; (2) they introduce graphical conditions for recovering causal queries, including cases where the factors in their identifying estimands are not recoverable; and (3) they apply their results to problems of attrition, characterizing the recovery of causal effects from data corrupted by attrition.
The support for these claims is provided through a series of theorems and examples, including Theorem 1, which presents a sufficient condition for recoverability of a relation Q defined over substantive variables, and Theorem 4, which provides a condition for recovering P(y|do(x)) when Y and Ry are connected by an inducing path. The paper also discusses related work, including deletion-based methods, maximum likelihood methods, and inverse probability weighted methods.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide clear explanations of the concepts and techniques used. The use of examples, such as the gender wage-gap study and the simple attrition problem, helps to illustrate the applicability of the results. The paper also provides a comprehensive review of related work, highlighting the contributions of the authors and the limitations of existing methods.
The strengths of the paper include: (1) the introduction of a new framework for handling missing data, which provides a more general and flexible approach to recovering probabilistic and causal queries; (2) the provision of sufficient conditions for recovering causal queries, which is a significant contribution to the field; and (3) the application of the results to problems of attrition, which is an important area of research.
The weaknesses of the paper include: (1) the complexity of the notation and terminology, which may make it difficult for non-experts to follow; (2) the lack of empirical evaluation, which would provide further evidence of the effectiveness of the proposed methods; and (3) the limited discussion of the limitations of the approach, which would provide a more balanced view of the contributions and limitations of the paper.
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of missing data analysis and causal inference, and the results have the potential to be widely applicable in a range of fields, including social sciences, medicine, and economics. The paper is well-suited for publication in a top-tier conference or journal, and the authors are encouraged to address the weaknesses and limitations of the paper in future work.
