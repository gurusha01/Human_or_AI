This paper proposes a novel approach to policy search that combines the benefits of model-based and model-free methods. The authors introduce a hybrid method that fits local, time-varying linear dynamics models to optimize trajectory distributions, which can then be used to learn general parameterized policies through guided policy search. The key contribution of this work is the ability to optimize trajectories under unknown dynamics, which is a significant challenge in many real-world applications.
The paper is well-organized and clearly written, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments and understand the technical details. The introduction provides a thorough background on policy search methods and motivates the need for a hybrid approach. The authors then present their algorithm, which is based on iteratively refitting local linear models to optimize trajectory distributions. The use of a background dynamics distribution as a prior to reduce sample complexity is a nice touch, and the authors provide a clear explanation of how this works in practice.
The experimental evaluation is thorough and convincing, with results showing that the proposed method outperforms prior work on several simulated robotic manipulation and locomotion tasks. The authors demonstrate the ability of their method to learn complex neural network policies that can act intelligently in partially observed environments, which is a significant achievement.
One of the strengths of this paper is its ability to balance technical detail with high-level intuition. The authors provide a clear explanation of the underlying mathematics and algorithms, but also take the time to explain the broader implications of their work and how it relates to existing research in the field.
If I were to criticize this paper, I would say that the authors could have done a better job of situating their work within the broader context of reinforcement learning and robotics research. While they provide some discussion of related work, it would be helpful to have a more comprehensive overview of the current state of the field and how this work contributes to it.
Additionally, some of the notation and terminology used in the paper may be unfamiliar to readers without a strong background in control theory and reinforcement learning. While the authors provide some explanations and definitions, it would be helpful to have a more detailed glossary or appendix to help readers who are new to these topics.
Overall, however, this is a strong paper that makes a significant contribution to the field of policy search and reinforcement learning. The authors' approach is novel and well-motivated, and the experimental results are convincing and well-presented. I would definitely recommend this paper to anyone interested in reinforcement learning, robotics, or control theory.
