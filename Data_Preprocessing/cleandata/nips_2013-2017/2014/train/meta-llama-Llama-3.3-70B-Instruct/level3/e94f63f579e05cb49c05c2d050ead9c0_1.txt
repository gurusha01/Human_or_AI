This paper presents a novel approach to blind source separation (BSS) problems by incorporating domain knowledge through signal aggregate constraints (SACs). The authors introduce SACs to encourage the total signal for each unknown source to be close to a specified value, which is often available in many applications. The proposed method, called additive factorial hidden Markov model with signal aggregate constraints (AFHMM+SAC), is evaluated on a real-world energy disaggregation dataset and shows significant improvements over existing methods.
The paper is technically sound, well-written, and well-organized. The authors provide a clear motivation for the problem, a thorough review of related work, and a detailed description of the proposed method. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, with a 45% decrease in normalized disaggregation error compared to the original AFHMM and a significant improvement over a recent state-of-the-art approach.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The introduction of SACs, which provides a novel way to incorporate domain knowledge into BSS problems.
* The derivation of the objective function in the framework of posterior regularization, which provides a clear connection to existing work.
* The use of a convex quadratic program to solve the relaxed problem, which allows for efficient computation.
* The thorough evaluation of the proposed method on a real-world dataset, which demonstrates its effectiveness.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The assumption that the model parameters are known, which may not be the case in practice.
* The use of a simple relaxation of the integer quadratic program, which may not always provide the optimal solution.
* The lack of comparison to other methods that incorporate domain knowledge into BSS problems.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of BSS and energy disaggregation. The proposed method has the potential to be applied to a wide range of problems, and the experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness. However, further work is needed to address the limitations of the paper and to explore the application of the proposed method to other domains.
