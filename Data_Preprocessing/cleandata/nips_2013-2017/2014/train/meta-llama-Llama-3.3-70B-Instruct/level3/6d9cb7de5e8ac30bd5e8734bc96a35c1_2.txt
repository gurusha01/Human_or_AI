This paper proposes a new norm, called the scaled latent trace norm, to relax the convex condition for tensor multilinear rank. The authors provide both theoretical and experimental results demonstrating its advantage over existing norms, such as the overlapped trace norm and the latent trace norm. The paper is well-written and develops nice theorems showing the upper bound of error between empirical and true risk in different scenarios.
The strengths of the paper include its clear and concise presentation, as well as its thorough analysis of the proposed norm. The authors provide sample complexity comparisons for matrix completion, multitask learning, and multilinear multitask learning, and experimental results showing that the scaled latent norm performs better with inhomogeneous dimensions. The paper also provides a detailed discussion of the implications of the results for different settings, including matrix completion, multitask learning, and tensor completion.
However, there are some weaknesses to the paper. The contribution of the paper is the development of the "scaled" latent trace norm, which is an extension of the latent trace norm studied in previous work. The difference between the two norms is relatively small, and it is unclear if the scaled latent trace norm is always better in tensor completion. Additionally, the sample complexity of the scaled latent trace norm is only slightly better than that of the latent trace norm.
The upper bounds of all scenarios involved in the three norms are proportional to the number of training samples to the power of negative 1/2, making them not essentially distinguished. The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison of the scaled latent trace norm with other existing norms, as well as a more thorough analysis of its limitations and potential applications.
Overall, the paper is well-written and provides a clear and concise presentation of the proposed norm and its advantages. However, it could benefit from a more detailed analysis of its limitations and potential applications.
