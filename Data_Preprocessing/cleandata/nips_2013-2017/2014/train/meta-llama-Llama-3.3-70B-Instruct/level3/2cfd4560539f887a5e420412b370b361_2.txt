This paper introduces a new norm, the scaled latent trace norm, for tensors in the context of multitask learning. The authors argue that existing norms, such as the overlapped trace norm and the latent trace norm, are not optimal in this setting, particularly when the dimensions or multilinear rank are heterogeneous. The proposed norm is shown to have better dependence on the multilinear rank and dimensions, leading to improved sample complexities in various settings, including matrix completion, multitask learning, and multilinear multitask learning.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear exposition of the problem, the proposed solution, and the theoretical analysis. The experimental results on synthetic and real-world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed norm. The authors also provide a detailed comparison with existing norms and methods, highlighting the advantages of the scaled latent trace norm.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a new norm that addresses the limitations of existing norms in the context of multitask learning.
* A thorough theoretical analysis of the proposed norm, including its sample complexity and excess risk bounds.
* Experimental results that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed norm in various settings.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes that the dimensions and multilinear rank are heterogeneous, which may not always be the case in practice.
* The experimental results are limited to a few data sets, and it would be beneficial to see more extensive experiments on a wider range of data sets.
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the implications of the proposed norm for practical applications.
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of multitask learning and tensor analysis, and the proposed norm has the potential to be widely adopted in practice.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper proposes a new norm that addresses a significant limitation of existing norms in the context of multitask learning.
* The theoretical analysis is thorough and well-supported by experimental results.
