This paper introduces a novel framework for understanding the tradeoff between storage and risk in nonparametric estimation under communication constraints. The authors provide a sharp characterization of the Pareto-optimal tradeoff curve for quantized estimation of a normal means vector in the minimax sense. The main result is a lower bound on the asymptotic minimax risk, which can be viewed as the usual minimax risk without quantization, plus an excess risk term due to quantization.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of the problem formulation, the main results, and the proofs. The use of rate distortion theory and minimax theory is well-motivated, and the authors provide a nice connection between these two areas. The simulations provided in the paper demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed quantized estimation method and provide insight into the tradeoff between storage and risk.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The introduction of a novel framework for understanding the tradeoff between storage and risk in nonparametric estimation under communication constraints.
* The provision of a sharp characterization of the Pareto-optimal tradeoff curve for quantized estimation of a normal means vector in the minimax sense.
* The use of rate distortion theory and minimax theory to derive the main results.
* The inclusion of simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed quantized estimation method.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The assumption of a fixed but unknown mean vector, which may not be realistic in all scenarios.
* The lack of consideration of more general ellipsoids, which could be an important direction for future work.
* The computational complexity of the proposed source coding method, which may not be practical for large-scale problems.
Overall, I recommend acceptance of the paper. The paper provides a significant contribution to the field of nonparametric estimation under communication constraints, and the results have important implications for understanding the tradeoff between storage and risk. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of the main results and proofs.
