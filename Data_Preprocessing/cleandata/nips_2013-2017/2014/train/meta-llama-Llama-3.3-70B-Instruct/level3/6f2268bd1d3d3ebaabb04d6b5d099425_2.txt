This paper addresses the critical issue of clustering with outlier detection in unsupervised machine learning and optimization. The authors propose a gradient descent algorithm for clustering with outlier detection by modifying an integer programming model and relaxing it into a sequence of Lagrange relaxations. The experiment demonstrates the advantages of the proposed algorithm over other methods using both synthetic and real data.
A key positive point of this paper is the use of Lagrange relaxation, a new idea for outlier detection, making the algorithm clean and easy to implement. The paper provides a clear and well-organized presentation of the proposed algorithm and its theoretical properties. The experimental study shows that the proposed approach is highly competitive to the state-of-the-art approaches and is 10-100 times faster.
However, there are some negative points that need to be addressed. One major negative point is the lack of sufficient theoretical analysis, particularly in regards to convergence, which needs more detailed explanation. Another negative point is the need for more references, especially in computational statistics, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the technique.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis or experimental results. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of the work. The paper is clearly written, well-organized, and adequately informs the reader.
The originality of the paper is high, as it proposes a new algorithm for clustering with outlier detection. The paper clearly shows how this work differs from previous contributions and provides adequate references to related work. The significance of the paper is also high, as it addresses a difficult problem in a better way than previous research and advances the state of the art in a demonstrable way.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, as it provides a significant contribution to the field of clustering with outlier detection. However, I would suggest that the authors address the lack of theoretical analysis and provide more references to improve the paper's quality and comprehensiveness.
