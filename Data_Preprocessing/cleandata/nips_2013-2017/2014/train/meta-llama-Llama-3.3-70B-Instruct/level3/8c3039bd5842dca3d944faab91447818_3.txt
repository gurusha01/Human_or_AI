This paper introduces a novel framework for online multi-task learning with a shared annotator, where multiple learners share a single annotator with limited bandwidth. The authors propose an algorithm, SHAMPO, which learns to select a task to query its label and updates its models accordingly. The algorithm is analyzed in the mistake-bound model, and the results show that it can perform well compared to methods that observe all annotated data.
The paper is technically sound, well-structured, and easy to read. The authors provide a clear explanation of the problem setting, the algorithm, and the analysis. The experimental results on several datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, which outperforms other algorithms in terms of test error.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The introduction of a new framework for online multi-task learning with a shared annotator, which is a novel and interesting problem setting.
* The proposal of an algorithm, SHAMPO, which is shown to be effective in the experimental results.
* The analysis of the algorithm in the mistake-bound model, which provides a theoretical understanding of its performance.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper could benefit from more discussion on the related work, as the current discussion is brief and does not provide a comprehensive overview of the field.
* The experimental results could be more extensive, with more datasets and more comparison with other algorithms.
