This paper introduces a stochastic variational inference (SVI) algorithm for learning the parameters of hidden Markov models (HMMs) in a time-dependent data setting. The proposed algorithm, SVIHMM, extends the traditional SVI approach to handle dependent observations by using subchains of consecutive observations as the basic sampling unit. The authors address the challenges of applying SVI to HMMs, including the need to break dependencies between observations and the introduction of error due to edge effects.
The paper is well-structured and clearly written, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments and understand the technical details. The introduction provides a good overview of the background and motivation for the work, and the related work section is thorough and well-referenced. The technical sections are detailed and well-explained, with a clear description of the algorithm and its components.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel algorithm for SVI in HMMs, which addresses the challenges of dependent observations and edge effects.
* The provision of a clear and detailed description of the algorithm and its components.
* The inclusion of a thorough related work section, which provides context and background for the proposed approach.
* The presentation of experimental results, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm on synthetic and real-world datasets.
However, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement:
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the limitations and potential drawbacks of the proposed algorithm.
* The experimental results, while promising, are limited to a few datasets and could be expanded to include more comprehensive evaluations.
* Some of the technical details, such as the derivation of the batch factor and the GrowBuf procedure, could be clarified or expanded upon for better understanding.
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the potential applications and implications of the proposed algorithm, beyond the specific examples presented.
