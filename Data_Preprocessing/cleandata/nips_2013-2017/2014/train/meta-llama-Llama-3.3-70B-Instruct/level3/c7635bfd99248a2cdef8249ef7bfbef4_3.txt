This paper proposes a novel approach to low-rank approximation in the streaming model, providing a lower bound of Ω(dk/ε) bits of space for any streaming algorithm that outputs a k × d matrix R with ‖A - AR†R‖F ≤ (1 + ε)‖A - Ak‖F. The authors' main theorem shows that the algorithm of Liberty, with an improved analysis by Ghashami and Phillips, is optimal up to the word size.
The paper's strengths include its clear motivation, detailed proofs, and thorough analysis of the problem. The authors provide a comprehensive overview of previous work in the area and demonstrate a good understanding of the underlying concepts. The proof of the main theorem is well-structured and easy to follow, with each step clearly explained and justified.
However, there are some areas where the paper could be improved. The writing is sometimes dense and difficult to follow, with long paragraphs and complex sentences. Additionally, some of the notation and terminology may be unfamiliar to non-experts, which could make the paper harder to understand for a broader audience.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, originality, and significance. The authors provide a clear and concise abstract, and the introduction effectively motivates the problem and provides context. The paper is well-organized, with a clear structure and logical flow of ideas. The authors also demonstrate a good understanding of related work and provide a thorough analysis of the problem.
Some potential arguments for acceptance include:
* The paper provides a novel and significant contribution to the field of low-rank approximation in the streaming model.
* The authors' main theorem is a major result that sheds new light on the problem and provides a clear understanding of the limitations of streaming algorithms.
* The paper is well-written and well-organized, with clear and concise proofs and a thorough analysis of the problem.
Some potential arguments against acceptance include:
* The paper may be too technical and dense for a broader audience, which could limit its impact and accessibility.
* Some of the notation and terminology may be unfamiliar to non-experts, which could make the paper harder to understand.
* The paper could benefit from additional examples or illustrations to help clarify the concepts and make the results more intuitive.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, as it provides a significant and novel contribution to the field of low-rank approximation in the streaming model. However, I would suggest that the authors consider revising the paper to make it more accessible to a broader audience and to provide additional examples or illustrations to help clarify the concepts.
