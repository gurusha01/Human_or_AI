This paper proposes a novel approach to bipartite ranking, focusing on optimizing the accuracy at the top of the ranked list. The authors introduce a new algorithm, TopPush, which has a linear time complexity in the number of training instances, making it more efficient than existing methods. The paper provides a thorough analysis of the algorithm, including its dual formulation, convergence, and computational complexity. The experimental results demonstrate that TopPush is competitive with state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of performance and significantly outperforms them in terms of training efficiency.
The paper's technical contribution is strong, and the authors provide a clear and well-organized presentation of their work. The use of a large-margin approach and the development of a novel analysis for bipartite ranking are notable strengths of the paper. The experiments are well-designed, and the results are convincing, demonstrating the effectiveness of TopPush in optimizing the ranking accuracy at the top.
However, there are some areas for improvement. The experiments are mostly small-scale, except for the url dataset, and it would be beneficial to include larger-scale experiments to further demonstrate the scalability of TopPush. Additionally, the authors could provide more insights into the relationship between the proposed approach and existing methods, such as InfinitePush and AATP.
To further improve the paper, the authors could consider adding figures showing the performance vs. the number of training instances and time to demonstrate the benefits of their approach. Moreover, including the divide and conquer schema in the final paper would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the approach.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of bipartite ranking, and with some minor revisions, it has the potential to be a strong publication.
