This paper proposes a novel approach to learning distributed representations of attributes, which can be jointly learned with word embeddings. The authors introduce a third-order model where word context and attribute vectors interact multiplicatively to predict the next word in a sequence, leading to the notion of conditional word similarity. The paper demonstrates strong performance on several NLP tasks, including sentiment classification, cross-lingual document classification, and blog authorship attribution.
The strengths of this paper include its originality, technical soundness, and significance. The proposed approach is a novel combination of familiar techniques, and the authors provide a clear and well-organized presentation of their work. The experimental results are impressive, and the paper provides a thorough analysis of the performance of the proposed model.
However, there are some weaknesses that need to be addressed. The writing style could be improved, as some of the language used is overly dramatic (e.g., "elegant" algorithm) and the use of bold text in the introduction is unnecessary. Additionally, the paper could benefit from more analysis on the effect of initialization on the proposed EM method, as well as a clearer explanation of the relative log likelihood measure used in the experiments.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The paper is a complete piece of work, and the authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of their approach.
The clarity of the paper is generally good, but there are some areas where the writing could be improved. The paper is well-organized, and the authors provide enough information for the expert reader to reproduce the results. However, some of the notation and terminology could be more clearly explained, and the paper could benefit from more concise and direct language.
The originality of the paper is one of its strongest aspects. The proposed approach is a novel combination of familiar techniques, and the authors provide a clear and thorough explanation of their work. The paper is significantly different from previous contributions, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of related work.
The significance of the paper is also high. The results are important, and other people (practitioners or researchers) are likely to use these ideas or build on them. The paper addresses a difficult problem in a better way than previous research, and it advances the state of the art in a demonstrable way.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, but with some revisions to address the weaknesses mentioned above. The paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field, and with some improvements, it could be even stronger.
