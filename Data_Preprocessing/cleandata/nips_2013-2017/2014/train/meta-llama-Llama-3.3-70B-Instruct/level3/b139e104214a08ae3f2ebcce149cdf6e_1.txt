This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of nonparametric estimation, specifically in the context of quantized estimation under communication constraints. The authors derive a version of Pinsker's theorem for the normal means model with a quantized version of the data, providing a minimax lower bound on the risk. They also propose a strategy for encoding and decoding that achieves this lower bound, although it is computationally prohibitive.
The paper is well-written and provides useful results from a practical point of view, with correct proofs. The authors demonstrate a clear understanding of the underlying statistical theory and provide a thorough analysis of the problem. The simulations presented in the paper illustrate the empirical performance of the proposed quantized estimation method and provide insight into the behavior of the estimator under different parameter settings.
One potential weakness of the paper is the lack of a rigorous proof of the equivalence between the quantized normal means model and non-parametric estimation problems. Additionally, the title "quantized non-parametric estimation" may be misleading, and alternative titles such as "quantized infinite Gaussian sequence model" or "normal means model" might be more accurate.
The paper's strengths include its originality, significance, and clarity. The authors address a difficult problem in a better way than previous research, and their results advance the state of the art in a demonstrable way. The paper provides unique insights and perspectives on the problem of quantized estimation, and the authors' use of rate distortion theory and minimax analysis is innovative and well-executed.
Arguments for acceptance include:
* The paper presents a significant contribution to the field of nonparametric estimation
* The authors provide a thorough analysis of the problem and demonstrate a clear understanding of the underlying statistical theory
* The simulations presented in the paper illustrate the empirical performance of the proposed quantized estimation method
* The paper advances the state of the art in a demonstrable way and provides unique insights and perspectives on the problem of quantized estimation
Arguments against acceptance include:
* The lack of a rigorous proof of the equivalence between the quantized normal means model and non-parametric estimation problems
* The computational prohibitive nature of the proposed encoding and decoding strategy
* The potential for the title to be misleading
Overall, I believe that the paper's strengths outweigh its weaknesses, and I recommend acceptance. However, I suggest that the authors address the lack of a rigorous proof of the equivalence between the quantized normal means model and non-parametric estimation problems in a future revision.
