This paper addresses the problem of inferring causal relationships in a target domain using knowledge from multiple source domains with limited experiments. The authors provide necessary and sufficient conditions for deciding when causal effects are estimable and prove the completeness of a previously proposed algorithm, TR^mz, and the do-calculus for establishing transportability of causal effects.
The paper is well-organized and well-presented, but the claims and proofs can be difficult to follow due to their complexity. The authors build on previous work and provide significant contributions, including a complete characterization of transportability and proofs of completeness for TR^mz and the do-calculus.
The reviewer suggests several improvements, including defining key terms, simplifying certain sections, and adding references to previous work. The paper could also benefit from more examples and illustrations to help clarify the concepts and results.
The strengths of the paper include its technical soundness, clarity, and originality. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the problem and present a complete characterization of transportability, which is a significant contribution to the field. The paper is also well-written, and the authors provide clear explanations of the concepts and results.
The weaknesses of the paper include its complexity and the lack of examples and illustrations. Some sections, such as the proof of Theorem 4, are difficult to follow, and the authors could provide more intuition and explanations to help readers understand the results. Additionally, the paper could benefit from more references to previous work and a clearer discussion of the implications of the results.
Overall, the paper is a significant contribution to the field of causal inference and transportability, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of the problem and present a complete characterization of transportability. With some revisions to address the complexity and lack of examples, the paper has the potential to be a seminal work in the field.
