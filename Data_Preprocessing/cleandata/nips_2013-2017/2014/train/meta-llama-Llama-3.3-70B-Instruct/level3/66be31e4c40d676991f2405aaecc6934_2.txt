This paper proposes a novel prior formulation, the structured spike and slab prior, which allows for the incorporation of prior knowledge about the sparsity pattern in sparse signal recovery problems. The prior is based on a Gaussian process imposed on the spike and slab probabilities, enabling the encoding of prior information using generic covariance functions. The authors also provide a Bayesian inference scheme based on expectation propagation for the proposed model.
The paper's topic is of significant interest to the NIPS community, as sparse signal recovery is a fundamental problem in many fields. However, the paper's contribution is a somewhat straightforward generalization of existing ideas, with the introduction of a Gaussian process prior being the main novelty. The experiments on standard benchmark datasets demonstrate the benefits of the proposed model, particularly in cases where the sparsity pattern has a structured form.
One of the main strengths of the paper is its well-supported experiments, which provide a thorough evaluation of the proposed model. The results show that the structured spike and slab prior can improve the reconstruction performance, especially when the sparsity pattern has a structured form. The paper also provides a clear and detailed description of the proposed algorithm, making it easy to follow and implement.
However, there are some weaknesses in the paper. The introduction lacks clarity, with vague sentences and unclear roles of variables x and y, making it difficult to understand the paper's context. Additionally, the statement about iid masking noise is incorrect, as non-iid cases have been analyzed in previous references. The terminology "pseudo-ensemble" may have a negative connotation and could be revised to better convey the new approach to learning presented in the paper.
The paper also contains minor errors, including typos, which should be corrected through a spell-checker to improve overall quality. Furthermore, the remark about dropout's mode of action being poorly understood is not entirely correct, as its ensemble properties and regularization properties are reasonably well understood in deep non-linear neural networks.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, originality, and significance. The paper is technically sound, with claims well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The paper is also well-organized and clearly written, making it easy to follow. The proposed model is a novel combination of familiar techniques, and the paper provides a clear explanation of how it differs from previous contributions. The related work is adequately referenced, and the paper provides a unique approach to sparse signal recovery.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, as it provides a notable contribution to the field of sparse signal recovery. The paper's strengths, including its well-supported experiments and clear description of the proposed algorithm, outweigh its weaknesses, and the paper meets the conference guidelines for quality, clarity, originality, and significance.
