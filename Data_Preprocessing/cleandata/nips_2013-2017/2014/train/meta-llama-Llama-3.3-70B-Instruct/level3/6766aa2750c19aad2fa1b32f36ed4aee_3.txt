This paper proposes a novel approach to low-rank approximation in the streaming model, where the rows of a matrix are presented one at a time in an arbitrary order. The authors provide a deterministic streaming algorithm that outputs a $k \times d$ matrix $R$ such that $\|A - AR^{\dagger}R\|F \leq (1 + \epsilon) \|A - Ak\|F$, where $Ak$ is the best rank-$k$ approximation to $A$. The algorithm uses $O(dk/\epsilon)$ words of space, which is shown to be optimal up to the word size.
The paper is well-written and clearly explains the technical details of the algorithm and its analysis. The authors also provide a thorough discussion of the related work and the significance of their results. The evaluation of the method is extensive and includes comparisons to state-of-the-art methods.
The strengths of the paper include its technical soundness, clarity, and significance. The algorithm is based on a novel combination of existing techniques, and the analysis is rigorous and well-presented. The results are also significant, as they provide a tight lower bound on the space required for streaming algorithms for low-rank approximation.
The weaknesses of the paper are minor. One potential issue is that the algorithm is deterministic, which may limit its applicability in certain scenarios. Additionally, the paper could benefit from more experimental results on real-world datasets to demonstrate the practicality of the algorithm.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper. The technical quality is high, and the results are significant and well-presented. The paper is also well-written and easy to follow, making it accessible to a broad audience.
