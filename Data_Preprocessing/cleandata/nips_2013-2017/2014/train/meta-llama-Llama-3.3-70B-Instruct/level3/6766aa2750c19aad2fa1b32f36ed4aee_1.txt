This paper presents a novel approach to policy search in reinforcement learning, combining the strengths of model-based and model-free methods. The authors propose a guided policy search algorithm that uses local linear Gaussian controllers to optimize trajectory distributions, and then trains a general parameterized policy to match these distributions. The key innovation is the use of a background dynamics distribution as a prior to reduce the sample complexity of the local linear models.
The paper is well-written and clearly explains the motivation, approach, and experimental results. The authors provide a thorough discussion of the related work and highlight the advantages of their approach, including its ability to handle complex and discontinuous dynamics. The experimental evaluation is comprehensive, covering a range of tasks, including robotic manipulation and locomotion.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposed algorithm is novel and combines the strengths of model-based and model-free methods.
* The use of a background dynamics distribution as a prior is a clever idea that reduces the sample complexity of the local linear models.
* The experimental evaluation is comprehensive and demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach on a range of tasks.
* The paper is well-written and clearly explains the motivation, approach, and experimental results.
