This paper proposes a Generalized Unsupervised Manifold Alignment (GUMA) method to build connections between different but correlated datasets without any known correspondences. The method is based on the assumption that datasets of the same theme usually have similar manifold structures. The authors formulate the problem as an explicit integer optimization problem, considering structure matching, feature matching, and geometry preserving criteria. An efficient alternate optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the model.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of the proposed method. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in various applications, including set matching, video face recognition, and visual domain adaptation. However, there are some concerns that need to be addressed.
One of the main concerns is that the experimental results section lacks detail, particularly in presenting the results. For example, in Section 5.2, the authors compare their method with other state-of-the-art methods, but the results are only reported in a table without any discussion or analysis. Additionally, the authors do not provide enough information about the parameters used in their method, such as the balance parameters γf and γp, which are set to 1 without any explanation.
Another concern is that the proposed method may not be practical for real-world problems due to its reliance on accurately estimating the full HMM parameters before reversing the permutation to find the block diagonal structure. The authors assume that the datasets have similar manifold structures, but this assumption may not always hold in real-world applications.
Furthermore, the recovered transition matrix may not be sparse, and there is no guarantee that the spectral algorithms will learn a sparse transition matrix. This could lead to overfitting and poor generalization performance.
The experimental results may not accurately reflect real-world noise in the transition matrix, and the authors should have sampled observation data from a mixture of HMMs to learn parameters from observed data. The experiment in Section 4.2 lacks sufficient information to evaluate its quality, and more details about the mixture of HMMs parameters are needed.
The results in Table 1 are counterintuitive, with EM initialized with spectral learning sometimes performing worse than spectral learning alone. This suggests that the proposed method may not always outperform other state-of-the-art methods, and more analysis is needed to understand the results.
In conclusion, while the proposed GUMA method shows promise, there are several concerns that need to be addressed, including the lack of detail in the experimental results, the potential impracticality of the method for real-world problems, and the need for more analysis and evaluation of the results.
