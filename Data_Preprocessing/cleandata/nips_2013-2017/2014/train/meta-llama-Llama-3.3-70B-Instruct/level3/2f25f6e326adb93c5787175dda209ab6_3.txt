This paper presents a novel interpretation of the generalized linear model (GLM) as a biophysically inspired, conductance-based model, and extends it to a more realistic and flexible model, the conductance-based spiking model (CBSM). The CBSM allows for independent excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs, and captures neural responses more accurately than the standard GLM. The paper is well-written and of good quality, making it easy to read for those in the field.
The theoretical development in the paper is solid and interesting, providing a new perspective on existing formulations. The authors demonstrate that the GLM can be viewed as a special case of the CBSM, where the stimulus linearly modulates excitatory and inhibitory conductances in an equal and opposite manner. The CBSM, on the other hand, relaxes these constraints, allowing for more realistic and flexible modeling of neural responses.
The results and evaluation of the paper are somewhat disappointing, with unconvincing supplemental material and a lack of comparison to existing methods. The authors do provide some simulations and fits to real neural data, but the presentation of these results could be improved. Additionally, the paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison to other models and methods in the field.
Despite these limitations, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field, providing a new and interesting perspective on neural modeling. The CBSM has the potential to become a valuable tool for understanding the neural code in sensory systems, particularly in more naturalistic stimulus conditions. The authors demonstrate that the model can accurately estimate the tuning of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs to retinal ganglion cells purely from measured spike times, which is a significant achievement.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, and originality. The paper is technically sound, well-organized, and easy to follow. The authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the background and motivation of the work, and the results are well-presented. The paper is also original, providing a new and interesting perspective on neural modeling.
However, the paper could be improved in terms of significance and impact. While the authors demonstrate the potential of the CBSM, the paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the implications of the results and the potential applications of the model. Additionally, the paper could be strengthened by a more thorough comparison to existing methods and models in the field.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, but with some revisions to address the limitations mentioned above. The paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field, and with some improvements, it could be an excellent addition to the conference program.
