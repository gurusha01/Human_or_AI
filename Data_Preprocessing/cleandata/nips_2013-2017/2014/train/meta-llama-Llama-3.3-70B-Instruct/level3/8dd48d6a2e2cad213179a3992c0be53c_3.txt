This paper presents a novel approach to policy search in reinforcement learning, which combines the benefits of model-based and model-free methods. The authors propose a hybrid method that fits local, time-varying linear dynamics models to optimize trajectory distributions, and then uses guided policy search to learn general parameterized policies. The approach is shown to be effective in learning complex neural network policies that can solve challenging tasks, such as robotic manipulation and locomotion, in partially observed environments.
The paper is well-written and clearly explains the technical details of the approach. The authors provide a thorough review of related work and highlight the advantages of their method over existing approaches. The experimental evaluation is comprehensive and demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach in various tasks.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposed approach combines the benefits of model-based and model-free methods, allowing for efficient optimization of trajectory distributions and learning of complex policies.
* The use of local, time-varying linear dynamics models enables the approach to handle complex and discontinuous dynamics, which is a challenge for model-based methods.
* The guided policy search framework allows for learning of general parameterized policies, which can be used to solve a wide range of tasks.
* The experimental evaluation is comprehensive and demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach in various tasks.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The approach requires a significant amount of computation and data to learn effective policies, which may limit its applicability to real-world problems.
* The use of local, time-varying linear dynamics models may not be suitable for all tasks, and the approach may require additional modifications to handle more complex dynamics.
* The paper could benefit from more detailed analysis of the theoretical properties of the approach, such as convergence guarantees and sample complexity bounds.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of reinforcement learning and policy search, and the proposed approach has the potential to be applied to a wide range of tasks. However, further research is needed to fully understand the limitations and potential applications of the approach.
