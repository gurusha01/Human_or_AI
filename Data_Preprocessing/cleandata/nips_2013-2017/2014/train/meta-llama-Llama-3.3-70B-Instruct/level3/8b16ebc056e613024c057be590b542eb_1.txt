This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of numerical linear algebra, specifically in the context of low-rank approximation in the streaming model. The authors propose a novel approach to solving this problem, which achieves a similar effectiveness to a winning algorithm in a recent competition. The key result of the paper is the relation between the parameters f, n, and y, which is plotted in figure 1c. However, I suggest that this plot could be improved for better visualization.
The approach described in the paper is likely to be more robust than the winning algorithm's grid search approach, making it of particular interest to a subset of the NIPS community. The paper presents a useful approach to preprocessing calcium imaging data based on learning a convolution filter, which will likely be of interest to members of the NIPS community that work with such data.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of their work. The paper is clearly written, well-organized, and provides enough information for an expert reader to reproduce the results.
The originality of the paper lies in its novel approach to low-rank approximation in the streaming model. The authors combine familiar techniques in a new way, making it a significant contribution to the field. The related work is adequately referenced, and the authors clearly explain how their work differs from previous contributions.
The significance of the paper lies in its ability to address a difficult problem in a better way than previous research. The results are important, and other people, both practitioners and researchers, are likely to use these ideas or build on them. The paper advances the state of the art in a demonstrable way, providing a unique theoretical approach to low-rank approximation in the streaming model.
Arguments pro acceptance:
