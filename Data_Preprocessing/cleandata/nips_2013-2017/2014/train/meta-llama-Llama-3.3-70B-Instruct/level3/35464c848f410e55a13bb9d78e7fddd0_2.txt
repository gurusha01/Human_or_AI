This paper presents a novel approach to sparse signal recovery by introducing a structured spike and slab prior, which allows for the incorporation of prior knowledge about the sparsity pattern. The authors propose a hierarchical prior formulation that imposes a Gaussian process on the spike and slab probabilities, enabling the encoding of prior information using generic covariance functions. The paper also provides a Bayesian inference scheme based on expectation propagation for the proposed model.
The main strengths of the paper are:
* The introduction of a new prior formulation that can capture structured sparsity patterns, which is a significant contribution to the field of sparse signal recovery.
* The development of an efficient Bayesian inference algorithm based on expectation propagation, which can handle high-dimensional problems.
* The demonstration of the effectiveness of the proposed method through numerical experiments, including comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods.
However, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement:
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the relationship between the proposed method and existing approaches, such as the Nystrom method.
* The authors should provide more insight into the choice of the covariance function and its parameters, as well as the sensitivity of the results to these choices.
* The computational complexity of the algorithm is high, which may limit its applicability to very large-scale problems.
* There are several typos and errors in the paper, which should be corrected to improve the overall quality of the presentation.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper scores well on:
* Quality: The paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results.
* Clarity: The paper is well-organized, and the writing is clear and concise.
* Originality: The paper presents a novel approach to sparse signal recovery, which is a significant contribution to the field.
* Significance: The results have the potential to impact the field of sparse signal recovery and related areas, such as image and signal processing.
However, the paper could be improved by:
* Providing more context and background information on the problem of sparse signal recovery and the existing approaches.
* Discussing the limitations and potential extensions of the proposed method.
* Including more detailed information about the experimental setup and the parameters used in the simulations.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the results are promising. With some revisions to address the weaknesses and areas for improvement, the paper has the potential to be a strong contribution to the field of sparse signal recovery.
