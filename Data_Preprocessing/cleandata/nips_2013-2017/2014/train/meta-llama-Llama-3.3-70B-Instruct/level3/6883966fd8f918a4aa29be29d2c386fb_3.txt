This paper proposes a novel conductance-based point process model (CBSM) for neural responses, extending the traditional generalized linear model (GLM) by incorporating biophysically inspired synaptic conductances. The authors provide a theoretical interpretation of the GLM as a highly constrained conductance-based model and then relax these constraints to construct a more flexible and realistic model. The CBSM allows for independent excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs, enabling the capture of more complex neural response properties, such as gain control and distinct stimulus tuning of excitation and inhibition.
The paper's main strengths lie in its novel theoretical contribution, which provides a more biophysically plausible interpretation of neural encoding, and its ability to accurately estimate synaptic conductances from spike trains. The authors demonstrate the model's performance using simulations and real neural data, showing improved fit and predictive power compared to the traditional GLM.
However, the paper has several weaknesses. The writing is often unclear, and the notation can be confusing, making it difficult to follow the mathematical derivations. The paper lacks empirical validation, particularly in demonstrating the benefits of the CBSM in real-world scenarios. The derivation of the main theorems is unclear, and some notations, such as ||X||_* in equation 1, are undefined. Theorem 2.1 contains errors, including the incorrect appearance of sample complexity "n" and a potentially misinterpreted result from Hsu et al.
Furthermore, the paper's main theorem may not hold when \Lambda_D is unbounded, such as in heavy-tail distributions, leading to a significant gap between Lemma 3.1 and Theorem 5.1. The derivation of L(W,P) = L(W,D) on page 3 is questionable, with unclear handling of measure P.
To improve the paper, the authors should provide clearer writing, define all notations, and correct the errors in the theorems. Additionally, they should include more empirical validation, such as real-world experiments, to support their claims. The authors should also address the potential issues with the main theorem and provide a more rigorous proof.
