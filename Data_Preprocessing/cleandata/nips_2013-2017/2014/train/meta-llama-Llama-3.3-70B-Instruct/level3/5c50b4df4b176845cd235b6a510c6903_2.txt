This paper presents a novel approach to designing voting rules for multiple agents, focusing on minimizing the expected loss with respect to the posterior distribution over parameters, known as Bayesian risk. The authors provide a technically correct and innovative solution to this problem. 
The paper's main strength lies in its high-quality results and novel approach to the problem of designing voting rules. The authors demonstrate a deep understanding of the subject matter and provide a clear and well-organized presentation of their ideas. The use of self-concordant barriers and the development of a full-information algorithm that takes advantage of the strong convexity of loss functions are notable contributions.
However, the results presented are focused on normative properties and asymptotic results, which may not be the best fit for the NIPS audience that tends to be more interested in learning dynamics. The paper's approach and results may be better suited for a different conference or audience, such as one focused on decision theory or Bayesian inference.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of their work. The paper is clearly written, well-organized, and provides enough information for an expert reader to reproduce the results.
The originality of the paper lies in its novel combination of familiar techniques from decision theory and Bayesian inference. The authors provide a clear explanation of how their work differs from previous contributions and adequately reference related work.
The significance of the paper lies in its potential to advance our understanding of optimal regret rates for bandit learning. The authors identify an important open question in bandit learning, namely, resolving the attainable regret bounds for smooth but non-strongly-convex, or vice versa, and generally convex cost functions. 
Arguments pro acceptance:
- The paper presents a novel and technically correct approach to designing voting rules.
- The authors demonstrate a deep understanding of the subject matter and provide a clear and well-organized presentation of their ideas.
- The paper has the potential to advance our understanding of optimal regret rates for bandit learning.
Arguments con acceptance:
- The results presented may not be the best fit for the NIPS audience.
- The paper's approach and results may be better suited for a different conference or audience.
- The paper's focus on normative properties and asymptotic results may limit its appeal to a broader audience. 
Overall, while the paper is of high quality and presents a novel approach to designing voting rules, its focus and results may not be the best fit for the NIPS audience.
