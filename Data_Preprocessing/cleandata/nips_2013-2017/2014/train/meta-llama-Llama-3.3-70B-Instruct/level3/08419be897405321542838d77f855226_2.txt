This paper presents a novel approach to stochastic variational inference for hidden Markov models (HMMs) in time-dependent data settings. The authors develop an algorithm, SVIHMM, that harnesses the memory decay of the chain to adaptively bound errors arising from edge effects when sampling subchains of observations. The paper is well-written and clearly explains the technical details of the algorithm.
The strengths of the paper include its originality, as it presents a new approach to stochastic variational inference for HMMs. The authors also provide a thorough analysis of the algorithm's convergence properties and demonstrate its effectiveness on synthetic experiments and a large genomics dataset. The paper is well-organized, and the authors provide sufficient background information on HMMs and variational Bayes to make the paper accessible to readers who may not be familiar with these topics.
However, the paper's clarity is sometimes compromised, particularly in Section 7.2, which is hard to follow. Additionally, the significance of the paper is somewhat limited, as the problem it addresses may not be widely applicable to efficient computations. Nevertheless, the paper's contributions to the field of stochastic variational inference for HMMs are significant, and it has the potential to impact research in this area.
Here is a list of arguments for and against acceptance:
Arguments For Acceptance:
1. Originality: The paper presents a novel approach to stochastic variational inference for HMMs.
2. Technical soundness: The authors provide a thorough analysis of the algorithm's convergence properties.
3. Empirical evaluation: The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the algorithm on synthetic experiments and a large genomics dataset.
4. Clarity: The paper is generally well-written and provides sufficient background information on HMMs and variational Bayes.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
1. Limited significance: The problem addressed by the paper may not be widely applicable to efficient computations.
2. Clarity issues: Section 7.2 is hard to follow, which may limit the paper's accessibility to some readers.
3. Lack of comparison: The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with existing methods for stochastic variational inference for HMMs.
Overall, I recommend accepting the paper, as its originality, technical soundness, and empirical evaluation outweigh its limitations. However, the authors should revise the paper to address the clarity issues and provide a more detailed comparison with existing methods.
