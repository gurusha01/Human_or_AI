This paper proposes a novel approach to filter out adversarial voters in crowd-sourcing systems using two algorithms: soft and hard penalty assignment. The authors provide theoretical and experimental results that justify the proposed algorithms, showing promising outcomes in increasing the quality of aggregation voting.
The paper is well-written, and the ideas are clearly presented. The problem addressed is interesting, and the proposed approach is novel. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in improving voting quality.
However, I would like to see more details about the applications and potential use cases of the proposed approach. The authors could provide more context about the crowd-sourcing systems and the types of tasks that can benefit from this approach. Additionally, it would be helpful to clarify the optimal semi-matching algorithm used in the hard penalty assignment algorithm for better understanding.
I also noticed that the hard penalty assignment algorithm consistently outperforms the soft penalty assignment algorithm in real datasets, but not in synthetic datasets. The authors should provide further explanation for this discrepancy and explore the reasons behind it.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of the work.
The paper is clearly written, and the organization is good. The authors provide enough information for the expert reader to reproduce the results. However, some minor suggestions for improvement include providing more details about the experimental setup and the datasets used.
In terms of originality, the paper proposes a novel approach to addressing the problem of adversarial voters in crowd-sourcing systems. The combination of soft and hard penalty assignment algorithms is new, and the theoretical analysis provides new insights into the problem.
The significance of the paper lies in its potential to improve the quality of aggregation voting in crowd-sourcing systems. The proposed approach can be applied to various tasks, such as image classification, sentiment analysis, and recommender systems.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, but with some minor revisions to address the concerns mentioned above.
