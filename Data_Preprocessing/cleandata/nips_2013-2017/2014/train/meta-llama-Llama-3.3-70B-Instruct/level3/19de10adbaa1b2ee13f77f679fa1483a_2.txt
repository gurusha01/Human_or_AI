This paper proposes a novel framework for constructing prior distributions with structured variables, which is a crucial problem in Bayesian modeling. The authors introduce a principled approach based on the maximum entropy principle, where the prior is defined as the information projection of a base distribution onto the constraint set of interest. The paper focuses on the case of sparse structure and shows that approximate inference using convex subsets is equivalent to maximizing a submodular function subject to cardinality constraints. The authors also propose an efficient greedy forward selection procedure, which is guaranteed to achieve within a (1-1/e) factor of the global optimum.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem and their approach. The technical contributions are significant, and the paper includes a thorough analysis of the proposed method. The experiments on simulated and real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in terms of support recovery and predictive accuracy.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to provide a principled approach to enforcing structure in Bayesian models. The authors show that their approach can be applied to various structural constraints, such as sparsity, and that it can be used to improve the performance of existing models. The paper also provides a thorough analysis of the proposed method, including a discussion of the computational complexity and the guarantees of the greedy forward selection procedure.
However, there are some minor comments and suggestions that can improve the paper. First, some of the notation and definitions can be clarified, such as the definition of the set FA and the restriction of the density p to the set A. Additionally, some of the equations and algorithms can be explained in more detail, such as the derivation of the information projection and the greedy forward selection procedure.
In terms of the quality, clarity, originality, and significance of the paper, I would rate it as follows:
* Quality: 8/10 (the paper is well-written, and the technical contributions are significant, but some minor clarifications are needed)
* Clarity: 8/10 (the paper is clear, but some notation and definitions can be clarified)
* Originality: 9/10 (the paper proposes a novel framework for constructing prior distributions with structured variables)
* Significance: 9/10 (the paper has significant implications for Bayesian modeling and can be applied to various fields, such as neuroscience and computer vision)
Overall, I recommend accepting the paper, as it provides a significant contribution to the field of Bayesian modeling and has the potential to impact various areas of research.
