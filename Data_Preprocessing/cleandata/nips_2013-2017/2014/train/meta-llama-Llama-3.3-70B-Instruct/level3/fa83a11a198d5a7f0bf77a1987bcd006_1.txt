This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of ensemble learning, introducing new data-dependent learning guarantees for convex ensembles in the multi-class setting. The authors generalize the guarantees presented by Cortes et al. [2014] in the binary case, allowing for increasingly complex sub-families, including very deep or complex ones. The paper also introduces several new multi-class ensemble algorithms, including MDeepBoostSum, MDeepBoostMaxSum, and MDeepBoostCompSum, which benefit from these guarantees.
The strengths of the paper include its rigorous theoretical analysis, providing a finer learning bound than existing ones, and its empirical evaluation, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in comparison to AdaBoost.MR and additive multinomial Logistic Regression and their L1-regularized variants. The authors also provide a detailed discussion of the connections between their algorithms and other boosting algorithms, particularly in the absence of regularization.
However, there are some areas that require improvement. The manuscript could benefit from more guidance on how to choose the truncation parameter 'b' and a discussion on the robustness of the results to this choice. Additionally, the method's accuracy should be compared to cross-validation, as the trade-off between accuracy and computational time is crucial for practitioners. The assumptions on 'b' in equation 5 should be clarified, and the truncation kernel should be defined and explained.
Furthermore, a complementary theoretical analysis is needed to support the claims made in the manuscript, rather than relying solely on numerical analysis. The relative size of the three biases in Theorem 1 should be explained and visualized, including heatmaps or plots, to provide a clearer understanding of the results. The simulation setting should be explained more clearly, with equations and clear notation, and abbreviations like 'cmp' should be defined.
The value of 'R' used in the simulations should be specified, and a supplementary figure justifying footnote 4 should be provided. The justification for estimating a covariance matrix from an AR process, rather than the dynamics matrix, should be better explained to make the application more convincing.
