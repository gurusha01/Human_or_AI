This paper introduces a new norm, called the scaled latent trace norm, for tensors in the context of multitask learning. The authors argue that existing norms, such as the overlapped trace norm and the latent trace norm, are not optimal for multitask learning problems with heterogeneous dimensions. The proposed norm is shown to have better performance in various settings, including matrix completion, multitask learning, and multilinear multitask learning.
The paper is well-written and pleasant to read, with clear and concise explanations of the technical concepts. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the excess risk of the proposed norm, as well as the existing norms, using Rademacher complexity. The experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed norm.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The introduction of a new norm that addresses the limitations of existing norms for tensors in multitask learning.
* A thorough analysis of the excess risk of the proposed norm, as well as the existing norms.
* Experimental results that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed norm in various settings.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes that the dimensions of the tensor are heterogeneous, which may not always be the case in practice.
* The analysis of the excess risk is based on Rademacher complexity, which may not provide a tight bound in all cases.
* The experimental results are limited to a few datasets, and more extensive experiments would be needed to fully demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed norm.
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of multitask learning and tensor analysis. The proposed norm has the potential to improve the performance of multitask learning algorithms in various settings, and the analysis and experimental results provided in the paper demonstrate its effectiveness.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper introduces a new norm that addresses the limitations of existing norms for tensors in multitask learning.
* The analysis of the excess risk is thorough and provides insights into the performance of the proposed norm.
* The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed norm in various settings.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The paper assumes that the dimensions of the tensor are heterogeneous, which may not always be the case in practice.
* The analysis of the excess risk is based on Rademacher complexity, which may not provide a tight bound in all cases.
* The experimental results are limited to a few datasets, and more extensive experiments would be needed to fully demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed norm.
Rating: 8/10
Recommendation: Accept with minor revisions. The paper is well-written and makes a significant contribution to the field of multitask learning and tensor analysis. However, the authors should address the limitations of the paper, such as the assumption of heterogeneous dimensions and the limited experimental results, in the final version of the paper.
