This paper investigates the lower bound of space complexity for a streaming algorithm to approximate a matrix A using a low-rank matrix R. The problem is interesting and the paper provides an impressive improvement in the space lower bound compared to existing work. The authors show that any streaming algorithm that outputs a k × d matrix R and guarantees that ‖A−AR†R‖F ≤ (1 + )‖A−Ak‖F with probability at least 2/3, must use Ω(dk/ ) bits of space.
The paper is highly theoretical, making it challenging to follow, with many proofs provided in the supplementary file. However, the quality and significance of the paper are above the borderline of NIPS, and its readability can be improved. A minor comment suggests revising the proof of Lemma 6 for better clarity and readability.
The strengths of the paper include its novel approach to establishing a lower bound for streaming algorithms, its thorough analysis of the problem, and its clear presentation of the results. The weaknesses of the paper include its high level of technicality, which may make it difficult for non-experts to follow, and the lack of experimental results to validate the theoretical findings.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper to NIPS, as it presents a significant contribution to the field of streaming algorithms and low-rank approximation. The paper's technical soundness, originality, and significance make it a valuable addition to the conference program.
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The paper presents a novel and significant contribution to the field of streaming algorithms and low-rank approximation.
* The authors provide a thorough analysis of the problem and establish a tight lower bound for streaming algorithms.
* The paper is well-written and clearly presents the results, despite its high level of technicality.
Arguments con acceptance:
* The paper is highly theoretical and may be challenging for non-experts to follow.
* The lack of experimental results may make it difficult to validate the theoretical findings.
* The paper's readability could be improved with additional explanations and examples.
However, the strengths of the paper outweigh its weaknesses, and I believe that it makes a significant contribution to the field. Therefore, I recommend accepting this paper to NIPS.
