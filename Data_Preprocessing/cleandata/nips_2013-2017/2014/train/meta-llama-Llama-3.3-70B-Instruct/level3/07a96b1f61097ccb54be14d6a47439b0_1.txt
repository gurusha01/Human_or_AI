This paper addresses the problem of estimating the low-dimensional subspace of contaminated observations with inherent coherence, a common issue in realistic data. The proposed method, based on Low-Rank Representation (LRR), circumvents the standard theoretical bottleneck of previous Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) methods, which perform worse with increasing data coherence. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the problem, including the definition of coherence parameters and their properties, and propose a practical algorithm for obtaining a proper dictionary in unsupervised environments.
The paper is well-written, and the authors demonstrate a good understanding of the problem and the related work. The proposed method is both theoretically sound and demonstrates good performance in practice, making it a significant contribution to the field. The experiments on randomly generated matrices and real motion sequences verify the claims made by the authors and show that the proposed method outperforms RPCA in various scenarios.
One potential direction for future work is to explore the application of the proposed method to solve subspace clustering or segmentation problems. The authors' approach to learning a suitable dictionary under the LRR framework could be useful in these contexts, and it would be interesting to see how it compares to existing methods.
The paper meets all the criteria for a good scientific contribution, including quality, clarity, originality, and significance. The authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, a thorough analysis of the proposed method, and a detailed evaluation of the results. The paper is well-organized, and the writing is clear and easy to follow.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of the work.
The paper is also original, as it proposes a new approach to handling coherent data and provides a novel combination of familiar techniques. The related work is adequately referenced, and the authors clearly explain how their work differs from previous contributions.
Finally, the paper is significant, as it addresses a difficult problem in a better way than previous research and advances the state of the art in a demonstrable way. The results are important, and other people (practitioners or researchers) are likely to use these ideas or build on them.
