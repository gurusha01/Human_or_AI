This paper proposes a novel approach to recover low-rank and sparse matrices from corrupted observations, particularly when the low-rank component exhibits clustering structures. The authors argue that the existing Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) method may not perform well in such cases due to its preference for incoherent data. To address this issue, they introduce a Low-Rank Representation (LRR) framework with a learned dictionary matrix, which can effectively alleviate the challenges arising from coherent data.
The paper is well-written and provides a clear overview of the problem, related work, and the proposed approach. The authors provide a detailed analysis of the coherence parameters and their impact on the recovery performance of RPCA. They also establish a theoretical framework for the LRR approach and provide an algorithm for learning the dictionary matrix.
The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in recovering low-rank and sparse matrices from corrupted observations, particularly in cases where the low-rank component exhibits clustering structures. The results show that the proposed approach outperforms RPCA in terms of recovery accuracy and robustness to coherent data.
The strengths of the paper include:
* A clear and well-motivated problem statement
* A thorough analysis of the coherence parameters and their impact on RPCA
* A novel and effective approach to recover low-rank and sparse matrices from corrupted observations
* A detailed theoretical framework for the LRR approach
* Experimental results that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The proposed approach may not be applicable to cases where the low-rank component does not exhibit clustering structures
* The algorithm for learning the dictionary matrix may require careful tuning of parameters
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with other related work in the area
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of low-rank matrix recovery and provides a novel and effective approach to address the challenges arising from coherent data. The results have important implications for a wide range of applications, including data analysis, machine learning, and computer vision.
