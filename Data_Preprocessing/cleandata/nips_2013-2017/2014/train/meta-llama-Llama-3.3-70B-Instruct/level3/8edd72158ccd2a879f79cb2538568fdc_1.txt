This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of nonparametric estimation under communication constraints. The authors establish a sharp lower bound on the asymptotic minimax risk for quantized estimators of normal means for the case of a Euclidean ball. The paper is well-written, and the results are clearly presented.
The main strength of the paper is the development of a novel approach to quantify the tradeoff between the risk and the communication constraint. The authors provide a detailed analysis of the problem, including a lower bound on the asymptotic minimax risk and an adaptive source coding method that achieves this bound with high probability. The simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and provide insight into the behavior of the quantized estimator.
However, there are some weaknesses in the paper. The authors do not provide a detailed comparison to related work, which makes it difficult to fully appreciate the contributions of the paper. Additionally, the experimental section could be improved by providing more details on the method used to generate diverse agents and by including more comprehensive results.
In terms of originality, the paper presents a novel combination of minimax theory and rate distortion ideas to address the problem of nonparametric estimation under communication constraints. The authors also provide a unique perspective on the tradeoff between risk and communication constraint, which is a significant contribution to the field.
The significance of the paper lies in its potential to impact the field of nonparametric estimation and statistical theory. The results presented in the paper have important implications for the design of estimation algorithms under communication constraints, which is a critical problem in many applications, such as sensor networks and cloud computing.
