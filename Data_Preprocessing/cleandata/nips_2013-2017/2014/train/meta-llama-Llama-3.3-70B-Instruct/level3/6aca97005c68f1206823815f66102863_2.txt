This paper proposes a novel control-theoretic framework for building functioning attractor networks that satisfy key physiological constraints, including Dale's law and the presence of recurrent and sparse synaptic connections. The authors optimize network parameters to embed multiple analog memories as stable fixed points of the dynamics, using a combination of fixed point and stability conditions. The resulting networks operate in the balanced regime, are robust to corruptions of the memory cue and ongoing noise, and explain the reduction of trial-to-trial variability following stimulus onset.
The paper is well-written and clearly presents the link between the proposed framework and previous work on memory networks. The technical soundness of the paper is evident in the careful derivation of the network dynamics and the optimization procedure. The experiments demonstrate improved performance in terms of memory recall and robustness to noise, making the paper of interest to the NIPS community.
The strengths of the paper include the novel combination of control theory and neural networks, the careful consideration of physiological constraints, and the solid experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The weaknesses of the paper include the lack of clarity in section 4, which could be improved with more detailed explanations and examples. Additionally, the paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the computational cost of the variational updates and the complexity of the compared models.
To enhance the paper, the authors could consider mentioning the availability of the implementation and exploring the probabilistic nature of the algorithm in the experiments. For example, they could provide more details on the average log-density of held-out data, which would be more informative than MSE in a robotics environment. Furthermore, the authors could address the convergence of uncertainties introduced via parameters beta and provide more insights into the robustness of the network to different types of noise and perturbations.
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of neural networks and memory recall, and with some revisions to address the weaknesses and suggestions, it has the potential to be a strong contender for acceptance at NIPS.
