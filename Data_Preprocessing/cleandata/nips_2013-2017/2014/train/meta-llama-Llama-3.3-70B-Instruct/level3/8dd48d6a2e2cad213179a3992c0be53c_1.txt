This paper presents a novel approach to policy search in reinforcement learning, combining the strengths of model-based and model-free methods. The authors introduce a hybrid method that fits local, time-varying linear dynamics models to optimize trajectory distributions, which can then be used to learn general parameterized policies through guided policy search. The key contribution of this work is the development of an algorithm that can optimize linear-Gaussian controllers under unknown dynamics, using a background dynamics distribution as a prior to reduce sample complexity.
The paper is well-organized and clearly written, with a thorough introduction to the problem and related work. The authors provide a detailed explanation of their algorithm, including the use of KL-divergence constraints and dual gradient descent. The experimental evaluation is comprehensive, demonstrating the effectiveness of the method on a range of simulated robotic manipulation and locomotion tasks.
The strengths of this paper include its originality, technical soundness, and significance. The authors address a challenging problem in reinforcement learning, and their approach shows promise in handling complex, nonlinear dynamics and partially observed environments. The use of local linear models and background dynamics distributions is a novel contribution, and the experimental results demonstrate the method's ability to outperform prior model-free and model-based approaches.
However, there are some areas for improvement. The paper could benefit from more theoretical analysis, particularly with regards to the convergence and sample complexity of the algorithm. Additionally, some of the notation and terminology may be unfamiliar to non-experts, and the authors could provide more explanations and definitions to improve clarity.
In terms of originality, the paper builds on existing work in policy search and model-based reinforcement learning, but the specific combination of local linear models and guided policy search is novel. The authors provide a clear discussion of related work and how their approach differs from prior methods.
The significance of this work lies in its potential to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of policy search in complex, real-world environments. The authors demonstrate the method's ability to learn complex neural network policies that can generalize to new situations, which is a key challenge in reinforcement learning.
Overall, this paper presents a significant contribution to the field of reinforcement learning, and its strengths outweigh its weaknesses. With some revisions to address the areas mentioned above, this paper has the potential to be a high-impact publication.
