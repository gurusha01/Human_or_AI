This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of Bandit Convex Optimization (BCO), a fundamental framework for decision-making under uncertainty. The authors derive an efficient and near-optimal regret algorithm for BCO with strongly-convex and smooth loss functions, achieving a regret bound of Õ(√T). This result advances our understanding of optimal regret rates for bandit learning and addresses a long-standing open question.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, including a comprehensive review of prior work. The technical sections are thorough, and the analysis is rigorous. The authors employ a novel "shrinking exploration" scheme, which is crucial in achieving the optimal regret bound. The algorithm is based on a full-information online algorithm, denoted FTARL-σ, which is a variant of the FTRL methodology.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The originality of the results: The authors provide a novel algorithm and analysis that achieve a near-optimal regret bound for BCO with strongly-convex and smooth loss functions.
* The quality of the writing: The paper is well-organized, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the technical details.
* The significance of the results: The paper addresses a long-standing open question in the field of bandit learning and provides a significant advancement in our understanding of optimal regret rates.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* Some minor errors and typos: The authors mention a few minor errors and typos, including a missing definition, implicit quantities in a lemma, and typographical errors. However, these do not affect the overall results of the paper.
* Limited scope: The paper focuses on a specific setting, namely BCO with strongly-convex and smooth loss functions. While this is an important setting, it would be interesting to see how the results generalize to other settings.
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The paper presents a significant contribution to the field of BCO, achieving a near-optimal regret bound for a long-standing open question.
* The results are original and well-motivated, and the analysis is rigorous and thorough.
* The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the technical details.
Arguments con acceptance:
