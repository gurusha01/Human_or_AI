This paper proposes a novel approach to ensemble learning for multi-class classification, extending the previous work of Cortes et al. (2014) to the multi-class setting. The authors introduce a new data-dependent learning guarantee for convex ensembles, which depends on the Rademacher complexity of the hypothesis classes. This bound is finer than existing ones, with a linear dependency on the number of classes instead of a quadratic one. The paper also presents several new multi-class ensemble algorithms, including MDeepBoostSum, MDeepBoostMaxSum, and MDeepBoostCompSum, which are derived from different objective functions.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The introduction of a new learning guarantee that generalizes to the multi-class setting, providing a finer bound than existing ones.
* The proposal of several new ensemble algorithms that benefit from this guarantee, with a focus on multi-class classification.
* The empirical evaluation of these algorithms on several datasets, showing promising results and outperforming existing methods such as AdaBoost.MR and logistic regression.
However, there are also some weaknesses:
* The paper assumes that the base classifier set is composed of increasingly complex sub-families, which may not always be the case in practice.
* The algorithms proposed are based on a convex optimization problem, which may be computationally expensive to solve.
* The empirical evaluation is limited to a few datasets, and more extensive experiments would be needed to fully validate the results.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of ensemble learning, with a novel approach to multi-class classification and a thorough theoretical analysis. However, some technical improvements and more extensive empirical evaluations would be necessary to make the paper more robust and convincing.
