This paper proposes a framework for Bandit Convex Optimization (BCO) with strongly-convex and smooth loss functions, achieving a near-optimal regret bound of Õ(√T). The authors introduce an efficient algorithm that utilizes a "shrinking exploration" scheme, which is a key ingredient in achieving the optimal regret rate.
The paper is well-organized and clearly written, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments. The introduction provides a thorough background on BCO and its significance, while the technical sections delve into the details of the proposed algorithm and its analysis.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to provide a tight regret bound, which matches the lower bound of Ω(√T) established in recent work. The authors also provide a comprehensive analysis of the algorithm's performance, including a proof sketch of the main theorem.
However, there are some areas that require improvement. The proposed algorithm is not clearly presented, and a detailed outline or pseudocode would be helpful for better understanding. Additionally, some concepts, such as "structure" and specific statements about spike-and-slab, could be explained more clearly.
The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms others, but the reason for this is unclear, and some results are inconsistent with existing literature. Further investigation into these inconsistencies would be beneficial.
In terms of originality, the paper builds upon existing work on BCO, but the proposed algorithm and analysis are novel contributions. The paper also provides a comprehensive review of related work, making it a valuable resource for researchers in the field.
The significance of the paper lies in its ability to advance our understanding of optimal regret rates for bandit learning. The proposed algorithm and analysis provide new insights into the problem, and the results have the potential to impact the development of more efficient algorithms for BCO.
