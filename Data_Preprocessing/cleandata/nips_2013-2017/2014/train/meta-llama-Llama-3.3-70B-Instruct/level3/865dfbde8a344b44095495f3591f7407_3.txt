This paper introduces a novel method for solving Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) using Stochastic Variational Inference (SVI), which samples subchains in sequence data and addresses dependency breaking issues at subchain edges. The algorithm resolves dependency breaking by expanding a buffer around the target subchain until subchain posteriors converge across different length buffers. The method is shown to be more efficient than existing methods and applicable to real data through experiments. 
The paper provides insights into applying online learning algorithms to time-dependent models, making it an important advance in large-scale HMM inference. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through experiments, showcasing its ability to outperform existing methods.
