This paper proposes a novel framework for learning distributed representations of attributes, which can be jointly learned with word embeddings. The authors introduce a third-order model where word context and attribute vectors interact multiplicatively to predict the next word in a sequence, leading to the notion of conditional word similarity. The paper is well-organized, and the writing is clear. The authors provide a thorough review of related work and clearly explain their contributions.
The strengths of the paper include the novelty of the proposed framework, the thorough experimental evaluation, and the strong performance on several NLP tasks, including sentiment classification, cross-lingual document classification, and blog authorship attribution. The authors also provide interesting qualitative results, such as the ability to generate text conditioned on different attributes and the notion of conditional word similarity.
However, there are a few weaknesses and suggestions for improvement. On page 2, between section 2 and subsection 2.1, there is a typo where "patio-temporal" is written instead of the correct term "spatio-temporal". Additionally, the abbreviation "s.t." is used in formulae 5 and 6, which could be replaced with "subject to" for better readability.
In terms of the quality of the paper, the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The paper is a complete piece of work, and the authors are careful about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of their work. The clarity of the paper is good, and the organization is logical. The originality of the paper is high, as the proposed framework is novel and differs from previous contributions. The significance of the paper is also high, as the results are important and can be used by other researchers and practitioners.
Arguments for acceptance include:
* The paper proposes a novel framework for learning distributed representations of attributes.
* The experimental evaluation is thorough and demonstrates strong performance on several NLP tasks.
* The paper provides interesting qualitative results and insights into the notion of conditional word similarity.
Arguments against acceptance include:
* The paper may benefit from additional comparisons to other related work.
* Some of the experimental results could be further analyzed and discussed.
Overall, I recommend accepting this paper, as it makes a significant contribution to the field of NLP and provides a novel framework for learning distributed representations of attributes. With some minor revisions to address the typos and suggestions for improvement, the paper can be even stronger.
