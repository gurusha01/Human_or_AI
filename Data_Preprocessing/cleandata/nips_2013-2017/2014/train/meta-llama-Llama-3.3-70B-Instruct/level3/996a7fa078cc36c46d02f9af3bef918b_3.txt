This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of statistical theory, specifically in the area of nonparametric estimation under communication constraints. The authors introduce a new technique for handling storage or communication constraints in the normal means model, which is a fundamental problem in statistical theory. The approach is well-motivated by real-world applications, such as the Kepler telescope and cloud computing environments, where storage and communication costs can be significant.
The paper is technically sound, and the authors provide a clear and well-organized presentation of their results. The main result, Theorem 1, establishes a sharp lower bound on the asymptotic minimax risk for quantized estimators of nonparametric normal means for the case of a Euclidean ball. The authors also provide an adaptive source coding method that achieves this lower bound asymptotically with high probability.
The paper is original and significant, as it addresses a difficult problem in a better way than previous research. The authors provide a novel combination of familiar techniques from rate distortion theory and minimax theory, which is a unique contribution to the field. The results are important, and other researchers are likely to use these ideas or build on them.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide enough information for the expert reader to reproduce the results. The presentation is clear, and the notation is well-defined. The authors also provide a detailed discussion of related work and future directions, which is helpful for understanding the context and significance of the results.
However, there are some areas for improvement. The paper could benefit from a more detailed complexity analysis, as the authors mention that the computational complexity of the source coding method is exponential in n. Additionally, the authors could discuss potential disadvantages of the approach, such as the need for a known noise level and the assumption of a Euclidean ball.
Overall, the strengths of the paper outweigh its weaknesses, and it is a valuable contribution to the field of statistical theory. The arguments in favor of acceptance include:
* The paper presents a significant and original contribution to the field of statistical theory.
