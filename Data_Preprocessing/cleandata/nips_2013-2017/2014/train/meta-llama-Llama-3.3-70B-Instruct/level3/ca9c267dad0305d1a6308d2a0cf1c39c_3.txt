This paper proposes a novel approach to online multi-task learning with a single annotator, addressing the limitations of existing methods. The authors introduce an online algorithm that learns a low-rank dictionary to handle coherent data, which is a common challenge in real-world applications. The paper provides a thorough analysis of the problem, including the definition of coherence parameters and their impact on the recovery of low-rank matrices.
The paper's main strengths include its novel approach to handling coherent data, its ability to avoid the coherence parameters that increase with the underlying cluster number, and its extensive experimental evaluation on both synthetic and real-world data. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the relationship between the coherence parameters and the clustering structure of the data, which is a valuable contribution to the field.
However, there are some weaknesses in the paper. One significant limitation is the assumption that the dictionary matrix is low-rank, which may not always be the case in practice. Additionally, the paper's experimental evaluation could be more comprehensive, including comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods and more detailed analysis of the results.
In terms of quality, the paper is well-written and clearly organized, making it easy to follow. The authors provide a thorough introduction to the problem, including a review of existing methods and their limitations. The paper's technical contributions are sound, and the authors provide a detailed analysis of the algorithm's performance.
The paper's originality is also a significant strength, as it proposes a novel approach to handling coherent data in online multi-task learning. The authors provide a detailed analysis of the relationship between the coherence parameters and the clustering structure of the data, which is a valuable contribution to the field.
In terms of significance, the paper's contributions have the potential to impact a wide range of applications, including image processing, computer vision, and data analysis. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on several real-world datasets, including motion sequences and text documents.
Some minor notes include the need for corrections to grammatical errors and suggestions for improvement in the paper's presentation. Additionally, the authors could provide more detailed analysis of the results and comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and its technical contributions are sound. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the problem and propose a novel approach to handling coherent data in online multi-task learning. While there are some limitations and areas for improvement, the paper's strengths make it a valuable contribution to the field.
