This paper proposes a novel approach to blind source separation using Additive Factorial HMMs (AFHMM) with Signal Aggregate Constraints (SACs). The method is demonstrated to be effective in practice using both toy data and real data from domestic energy output readings, outperforming regular AFMM and AFAMAP methods. The paper is technically sound with a strong simulation section, but could benefit from additional theoretical aspects, such as a proof of convexity and scaling arguments.
The writing and structure of the paper are clear and well-organized, but some minor errors and clarifications are suggested, including a potential notation error and additional discussion on signal-to-noise ratios. The work is considered novel and original, with significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in the energy disaggregation problem.
The key strengths of the paper include:
* The introduction of Signal Aggregate Constraints (SACs) to incorporate domain knowledge into the blind source separation problem
* The development of a convex quadratic program for approximate inference in the AFHMM with SACs
* The demonstration of the effectiveness of the approach on real-world data from the energy disaggregation domain
The key weaknesses of the paper include:
* The lack of theoretical analysis, such as a proof of convexity and scaling arguments
* The potential for minor errors and clarifications, such as notation errors and additional discussion on signal-to-noise ratios
Overall, the paper is well-written and well-organized, and the approach is novel and original. The results demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in the energy disaggregation problem. However, additional theoretical analysis and minor clarifications are suggested to further strengthen the paper.
