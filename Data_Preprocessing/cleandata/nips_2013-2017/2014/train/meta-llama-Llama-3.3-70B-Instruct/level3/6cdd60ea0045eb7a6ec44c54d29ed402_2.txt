This paper proposes a novel approach to robust logistic regression by introducing a pseudo-ensemble method that deals with outliers with high leverage. The method is based on a linear programming problem that maximizes the sum of y*x'beta, excluding outliers with large leverage. The authors derive some risk bounds, although they may be too loose for practical use.
The manuscript contains a small simulation study that compares the proposed method favorably with classical logistic regression. However, the study raises questions about the preprocessing step and its impact on the results. The choice of parameter T and the sensitivity of the method to the choice of n are also unclear. The reviewer questions the need for the preprocessing step and suggests that the method may perform worse when there are no outliers.
The paper's strengths include its novel approach to robust logistic regression and its potential to handle outliers with high leverage. The pseudo-ensemble method is also shown to be effective in semi-supervised learning settings. However, the paper's weaknesses include the lack of clarity on the choice of parameter T and the sensitivity of the method to the choice of n. The simulation study is also limited, and more extensive experiments are needed to fully evaluate the method's performance.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of the work. The paper is clearly written, well-organized, and adequately informs the reader.
The originality of the paper is high, as it introduces a novel approach to robust logistic regression. The paper is significantly different from previous contributions, and the authors provide a clear explanation of how their work differs from existing research. The significance of the paper is also high, as it addresses a difficult problem in a better way than previous research and advances the state of the art in a demonstrable way.
