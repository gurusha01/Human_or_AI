This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of statistical theory, specifically in the area of nonparametric estimation under communication constraints. The authors provide a sharp characterization of the Pareto-optimal tradeoff curve for quantized estimation of a normal means vector in the minimax sense. The main result, Theorem 1, establishes a lower bound on the asymptotic minimax risk, which is then shown to be achievable by a proposed source coding method.
The paper is well-written, technically sound, and provides a clear exposition of the problem and the results. The authors demonstrate a good understanding of the relevant literature, including Pinsker's theorem and rate distortion theory. The experimental section provides useful insights into the performance of the proposed method, although it would be beneficial to include more comprehensive simulations to validate the theoretical results.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to bridge the gap between minimax theory and rate distortion ideas, providing a novel perspective on the problem of risk-storage tradeoffs in nonparametric estimation. The authors also provide a clear discussion of the implications of their results and potential directions for future work, including the application of their methods to more general ellipsoids and the design of computationally efficient quantized nonparametric estimators.
However, there are some areas where the paper could be improved. For example, the authors could provide more context on the significance of their results and how they relate to existing work in the field. Additionally, the experimental section could be expanded to include more detailed comparisons with other methods and a more thorough analysis of the results.
In terms of the conference guidelines, this paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, originality, and significance. The paper is well-organized, and the authors provide sufficient background information to make the results accessible to a broad audience. The results are novel and contribute to the advancement of the field, and the authors demonstrate a clear understanding of the relevant literature.
