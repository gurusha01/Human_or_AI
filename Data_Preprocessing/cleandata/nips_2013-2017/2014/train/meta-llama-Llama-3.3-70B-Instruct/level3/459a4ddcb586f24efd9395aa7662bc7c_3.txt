This paper proposes a novel algorithm, Sparse Random Features, for solving l1-regularized problems in Hilbert spaces. The algorithm is based on a random feature approximation of the kernel function and uses a randomized coordinate descent approach to optimize the objective function. The paper provides a thorough theoretical analysis of the algorithm, including convergence guarantees and bounds on the approximation error.
The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with clear explanations of the technical details. The authors provide a comprehensive overview of the related work in the field, including previous approaches to solving l1-regularized problems in Hilbert spaces. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in terms of accuracy, sparsity, and computational efficiency.
The key technical contribution of the paper is Theorem 2, which provides a convergence guarantee for the proposed algorithm. The theorem shows that the algorithm converges to a solution within Îµ-precision of the optimal solution, with a rate of convergence that depends on the number of random features drawn. The authors also provide corollaries that extend the guarantee to any number of random features and provide a bound on the approximation error with high probability.
The paper also provides a comparison with existing work, including the kernel method and Boosting. The authors show that the proposed algorithm outperforms these methods in terms of sparsity and computational efficiency, while maintaining comparable accuracy.
One potential weakness of the paper is the choice of lambda, which seems arbitrary. The authors could provide more discussion on the choice of lambda and how it affects the performance of the algorithm. Additionally, the paper could benefit from more comprehensive experimental results, including cross-validation and support-vectors/sparsity analysis.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of machine learning, providing a novel algorithm for solving l1-regularized problems in Hilbert spaces. The theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm, and the paper is well-written and easy to follow.
