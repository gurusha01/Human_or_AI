This paper presents a framework for constructing prior distributions with structured variables, specifically focusing on sparse structure. The authors propose a principled approach based on the maximum entropy principle, where the prior is defined as the information projection of a base distribution onto the constraint set of interest. The paper is well-written, and the idea is simple and easy to understand, with several examples provided to illustrate the model.
The technical contributions of the paper are sound, and the authors provide a clear and well-organized presentation of their work. The use of the maximum entropy principle to design prior distributions is a novel approach, and the authors demonstrate its effectiveness in capturing sparse structure. The paper also provides a thorough analysis of the special case of sparse structure, including the characterization of the restriction and the proposal of a greedy forward selection procedure.
However, the experiments presented in the paper are not particularly impressive, and the results do not demonstrate significant advancements over existing methods. The comparison to other sparsity-inducing models, such as Lasso and Spike and Slab, shows that the proposed approach outperforms them in some cases, but the differences are not substantial. Additionally, the paper lacks substantial innovation or improvement over previous work, and the model is a minor variation of previous papers.
The paper's strengths include its clear and well-organized presentation, its novel approach to designing prior distributions, and its thorough analysis of the special case of sparse structure. However, its weaknesses include the lack of impressive experimental results and the limited innovation and improvement over previous work.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper presents a novel approach to designing prior distributions based on the maximum entropy principle.
* The authors provide a clear and well-organized presentation of their work.
* The paper includes a thorough analysis of the special case of sparse structure.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The experiments presented in the paper are not particularly impressive.
* The results do not demonstrate significant advancements over existing methods.
* The paper lacks substantial innovation or improvement over previous work.
Overall, while the paper has some strengths, its weaknesses outweigh them, and I would recommend rejection. However, the authors may consider revising and resubmitting their work with more impressive experimental results and a clearer demonstration of the significance and innovation of their approach.
