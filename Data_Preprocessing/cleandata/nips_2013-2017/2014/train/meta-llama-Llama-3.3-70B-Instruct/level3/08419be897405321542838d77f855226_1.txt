This paper proposes a stochastic variational inference (SVI) algorithm for hidden Markov models (HMMs) in a time-dependent data setting. The authors address the challenge of applying SVI to HMMs by developing an algorithm that harnesses the memory decay of the chain to adaptively bound errors arising from edge effects. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of their approach.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The authors propose a novel approach to applying SVI to HMMs, which is a significant contribution to the field.
* The paper provides a thorough analysis of the algorithm, including a proof of convergence to a local mode.
* The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their algorithm on synthetic experiments and a large genomics dataset.
However, there are some weaknesses and limitations to the paper:
* The algorithm may not be suitable for very long chains, as the authors note that the buffer length Ï„ may need to be large to achieve good performance.
* The paper assumes that the underlying chain is irreducible and aperiodic, which may not always be the case in practice.
* The authors do not provide a comparison with other stochastic inference algorithms for HMMs, which would be useful for evaluating the performance of their approach.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, and originality. The authors provide a clear and well-written explanation of their approach, and the paper is well-organized and easy to follow. The algorithm proposed in the paper is novel and significant, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of its performance.
However, the paper may not meet the criteria for significance, as the authors do not provide a clear demonstration of the impact of their algorithm on the field. While the paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the algorithm on a large genomics dataset, it is not clear how this will translate to other applications or how it will advance the state of the art in the field.
Overall, I would recommend accepting the paper, but with some revisions to address the weaknesses and limitations noted above. The authors should provide a more detailed comparison with other stochastic inference algorithms for HMMs and demonstrate the significance of their approach more clearly.
