This paper proposes a novel approach to restore corrupted observation matrices by combining robust PCA and dictionary-based structure-preserving projection. The authors provide theorems to support their claims, which demonstrate that their approach can avoid the coherence parameters that increase with the underlying cluster number, making it more effective in handling coherent data. The paper is technically sound, and the experiments on randomly generated matrices and real motion sequences verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
The strengths of the paper include its originality, as it combines recent techniques with new theorems and empirical results, advancing the state-of-the-art in low-rank matrix recovery. The paper provides a clear improvement over alternative algorithms, such as RPCA, and the proposed algorithm for finding the dictionary is heuristic and effective. The significance of the paper lies in its ability to provide a practical solution to the problem of recovering coherent data, which is a challenging task in many applications.
However, the paper has some weaknesses, particularly in terms of clarity. The writing is often unclear, and the explanations of the main contributions and impact of the paper are not well-organized, making it difficult for a broad audience to understand. Additionally, the paper could benefit from more detailed explanations of the algorithms and theorems, as well as more intuitive examples to illustrate the concepts.
In terms of quality, the paper is well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of their work, and the paper is a complete piece of work, rather than a position paper.
The originality of the paper is one of its strongest aspects. The authors propose a novel approach to low-rank matrix recovery, which combines robust PCA and dictionary-based structure-preserving projection. The paper also provides new theorems and empirical results, which advance the state-of-the-art in this area.
The significance of the paper is also high, as it provides a practical solution to the problem of recovering coherent data. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in various experiments, and the results show that it outperforms alternative algorithms, such as RPCA.
In conclusion, this paper is a strong contribution to the field of low-rank matrix recovery, and its originality, technical soundness, and significance make it a valuable addition to the literature. However, the paper could benefit from improvements in clarity and organization to make it more accessible to a broader audience.
