This paper presents a novel approach to blind source separation problems by incorporating domain knowledge through signal aggregate constraints (SACs) into an additive factorial hidden Markov model (AFHMM). The authors propose a convex quadratic program for approximate inference, which is computationally efficient. The experimental results on a real-world energy disaggregation dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, showing a significant improvement over the original AFHMM and a recent state-of-the-art approach.
The paper is well-structured, and the authors provide a clear motivation for their work, discussing the challenges of blind source separation and the importance of incorporating domain knowledge. The related work section is comprehensive, and the authors provide a thorough overview of existing approaches to energy disaggregation.
The technical contributions of the paper are sound, and the authors provide a detailed derivation of the convex quadratic program for the relaxed AFHMM with SACs. The experimental evaluation is thorough, and the authors provide a comparison with other methods, including AFHMM and AFAMAP.
However, there are some concerns regarding the experimental section. The authors do not provide a comparison with other Bayesian quadrature methods, which makes it difficult to judge the superiority of the proposed method. Additionally, the authors could provide more experimental details, such as the number of points required to achieve the same accuracy as MCMC methods, for a more comprehensive evaluation.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their approach. The notation is consistent, and the figures and tables are well-organized and easy to understand.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, and originality. The authors provide a thorough evaluation of their method, and the results are significant, demonstrating a substantial improvement over existing approaches. The paper is well-organized, and the authors provide a clear summary of their contributions.
