This paper proposes a novel approach to recover low-rank and sparse components from a given data matrix, particularly when the low-rank component exhibits clustering structures. The authors argue that the state-of-the-art Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) method may not perform well in such cases due to its preference for incoherent data. To address this issue, the authors propose using the Low-Rank Representation (LRR) framework with a learned dictionary matrix that is low-rank and contains information about the ground truth matrix.
The paper is well-written and provides a clear overview of the problem, related work, and the proposed approach. The authors provide theoretical guarantees for the success of their approach and demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world data. The results show that the proposed approach outperforms RPCA in recovering low-rank and sparse components, especially when the low-rank component exhibits clustering structures.
The strengths of the paper include:
* A clear and well-motivated problem statement
* A thorough review of related work, including RPCA and LRR
* A novel and effective approach to recovering low-rank and sparse components
* Strong theoretical guarantees for the success of the approach
* Extensive experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The approach may not be applicable to all types of data, particularly those without clustering structures
* The computational complexity of the approach may be higher than that of RPCA
* The choice of dictionary matrix and its rank may require careful tuning
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of low-rank matrix recovery and provides a novel and effective approach to addressing the challenges of coherent data. The approach has the potential to be widely applicable and may lead to further research in this area.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper addresses a significant problem in the field of low-rank matrix recovery
* The proposed approach is novel and effective
* The paper provides strong theoretical guarantees and extensive experimental results
* The approach has the potential to be widely applicable and may lead to further research in this area
Arguments against acceptance:
* The approach may not be applicable to all types of data
* The computational complexity of the approach may be higher than that of RPCA
* The choice of dictionary matrix and its rank may require careful tuning
However, the strengths of the paper outweigh its weaknesses, and I believe that it makes a significant contribution to the field. Therefore, I recommend accepting the paper.
