This paper presents a novel result on low-rank approximation of a matrix with streaming rows, providing a lower bound of Ω(dk/ε) bits of space for any streaming algorithm that outputs a k × d matrix R with ‖A - AR†R‖F ≤ (1 + ε)‖A - Ak‖F. The authors establish this lower bound by reducing the problem to the Index problem in communication complexity, which is a well-known problem that requires a certain amount of communication between two players.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem and the related work. The technical sections are also well-organized, and the authors provide detailed proofs of their results. The paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis.
One of the strengths of the paper is that it provides a tight lower bound for the space complexity of streaming algorithms for low-rank approximation. This result has significant implications for the design of efficient algorithms for large-scale data sets. The paper also provides a clear and detailed analysis of the communication complexity of the problem, which is an important aspect of the research.
However, one potential weakness of the paper is that the result may not be surprising to experts in streaming algorithms. The authors acknowledge this in the introduction, but they also argue that the result is still important because it provides a tight lower bound for a fundamental problem in the field.
In terms of originality, the paper presents a novel combination of techniques from communication complexity and streaming algorithms. The authors use the Index problem to establish a lower bound for the space complexity of streaming algorithms, which is a new and interesting approach.
The significance of the paper lies in its implications for the design of efficient algorithms for large-scale data sets. The result provides a tight lower bound for the space complexity of streaming algorithms, which can help researchers design more efficient algorithms that are tailored to the specific requirements of their applications.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication. The paper is well-written, technically sound, and provides a significant contribution to the field of streaming algorithms.
