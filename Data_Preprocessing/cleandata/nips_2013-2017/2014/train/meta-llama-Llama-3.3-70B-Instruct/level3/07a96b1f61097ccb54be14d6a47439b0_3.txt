This paper proposes a novel approach to improve the effectiveness of Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) by exploiting additional clustering structure in the data using Low-Rank Representation (LRR) with a learned dictionary. The method is significant and related to previous subspace clustering papers, but with a more general assumption on clustering. The paper's theoretical analysis is verified by simulation and real data experiments, showing potential for application in various fields such as text data.
The paper's structure can be seen as a combination of low-rank structure and union-of-subspace cluster structure, differing from previous works in its approach to subspace clustering. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the coherence parameters and their properties, and show that the challenges raised by coherent data can be alleviated by LRR with a properly configured dictionary.
The paper makes significant contributions to the field, including describing a clustering structure that leads to high coherence, exploiting this structure using LRR, and partially solving the sparse corruptions problem in subspace clustering. The proposed algorithm is simple and effective, and the experimental results demonstrate its superiority over RPCA in handling coherent data.
However, the paper could be improved in terms of clarity and precision. Some sections are dense and difficult to follow, and there are a few typos and formatting issues. Additionally, the authors could provide more comparisons with alternative methods, such as solving noisy subspace clustering with l1 penalty followed by PCA.
Overall, the paper is well-written and provides a clear overview of the proposed method and its contributions. The authors demonstrate a good understanding of the related work and provide a thorough analysis of the problem and the proposed solution.
