This paper proposes a novel approach to understanding the tradeoff between storage and risk in nonparametric estimation under communication constraints. The authors develop a framework to analyze the excess risk of quantized estimators and provide sharp upper and lower bounds for the case of a Euclidean ball. The results are significant, as they establish a Pareto-optimal minimax tradeoff between storage and risk in this setting.
The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with clear and sound derivations. The authors provide a good introduction to the problem and motivate it with interesting applications, such as the Kepler telescope and cloud computing. The technical results are impressive, and the authors demonstrate a deep understanding of the underlying statistical and information-theoretic concepts.
The strengths of the paper include its originality, technical soundness, and significance. The authors tackle a difficult problem and provide a comprehensive analysis, including both theoretical and numerical results. The paper is also well-organized, and the authors provide a clear overview of the main results and their implications.
One potential weakness of the paper is that the proposed quantized estimation method is not computationally efficient. The authors acknowledge this limitation and suggest possible approaches to designing more efficient algorithms, such as dividing the variables into smaller blocks or adapting recent work on sparse regression for lossy compression.
In terms of the conference guidelines, this paper meets all the criteria for a good scientific contribution. The paper is technically sound, with well-supported claims and a complete piece of work. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of their work. The paper is also well-written, clear, and easy to follow, making it accessible to a broad audience.
