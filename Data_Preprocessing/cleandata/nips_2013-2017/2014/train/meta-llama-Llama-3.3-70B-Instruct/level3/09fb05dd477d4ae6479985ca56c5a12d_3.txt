This paper presents a novel approach to policy search in reinforcement learning, which combines the strengths of model-based and model-free methods. The authors propose a hybrid method that fits local, time-varying linear dynamics models to optimize trajectory distributions, and then uses guided policy search to learn arbitrary parameterized policies. The approach is shown to be effective in learning complex neural network policies that can solve challenging tasks, such as robotic manipulation and locomotion, in partially observed environments.
The paper is well-written and clear, with a thorough introduction to the background and related work. The authors provide a detailed explanation of their approach, including the use of a background dynamics distribution to reduce sample complexity, and the application of guided policy search to learn parameterized policies. The experimental evaluation is comprehensive, with comparisons to prior methods and demonstrations of the approach's effectiveness in various tasks.
The strengths of the paper include its novelty, clarity, and significance. The approach presented is a significant contribution to the field of reinforcement learning, as it addresses the challenges of learning in complex, partially observed environments. The use of local, time-varying linear dynamics models is a key innovation, as it allows the approach to handle discontinuous dynamics and high-dimensional state spaces.
However, there are some weaknesses to the paper. The authors could provide more comparisons to other baseline methods, such as model-based reinforcement learning approaches, to further demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach. Additionally, the paper could benefit from more discussion on the limitations and potential extensions of the approach, such as its applicability to hybrid discrete-continuous tasks.
Overall, the paper is well-suited for acceptance at NIPS, as it presents a novel and significant contribution to the field of reinforcement learning. The approach has the potential to be widely applicable and to advance the state of the art in learning complex policies for challenging tasks.
