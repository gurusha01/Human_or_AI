This paper proposes a novel approach to understanding the tradeoff between storage and risk in nonparametric estimation under communication constraints. The authors provide a sharp characterization of the Pareto-optimal tradeoff curve for quantized estimation of a normal means vector in the minimax sense. The main result gives a lower bound on the exact quantized asymptotic risk in terms of the number of bits used to encode the estimator, the signal size, and the noise level.
The paper has both theoretical and methodological contributions. The authors prove that the diverse vote can beat the uniform vote under certain noise models and demonstrate practical experiments in the Computer Go domain. However, the novelty of the paper is a concern, and it requires a clear statement on the technical contribution compared to Marcolino et al. (2013).
The experiment has limitations, including a lack of comprehensive results and potential performance issues with diverse voting under certain voting rules. Additionally, the setting of the main results may not be suitable for the Go domain due to dependent but not i.i.d. states.
The paper is well-written and clearly organized. The authors provide enough information for the expert reader to reproduce the results. However, some minor comments include indicating the domain of phi in the Mallows model, adding a bullet for the Plackett-Luce model, and using a different notation for the copy number in the uniform vote.
The significance of the paper lies in its ability to address a difficult problem in a better way than previous research. The results provide a unique theoretical approach to understanding the tradeoff between storage and risk in nonparametric estimation. The paper also opens up new directions for future work, including designing computationally efficient quantized nonparametric estimators and applying the approach to more general ellipsoids.
