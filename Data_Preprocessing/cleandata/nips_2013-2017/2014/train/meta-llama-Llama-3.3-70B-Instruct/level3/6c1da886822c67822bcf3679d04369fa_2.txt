This paper addresses the problem of estimating a normal means vector under communication constraints, where the goal is to minimize the excess risk due to quantization. The authors provide a sharp characterization of the Pareto-optimal tradeoff curve for quantized estimation of a normal means vector in the minimax sense. The main result gives a lower bound on the exact quantized asymptotic risk in terms of the number of bits used to encode the estimator, the signal size, and the noise level.
The paper is well-written and clearly organized, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments. The introduction provides a clear motivation for the problem and explains the main contributions of the paper. The background and problem formulation sections provide a thorough review of the relevant literature and establish the notation used in the paper.
The technical results are impressive, and the authors provide a detailed proof of their main theorem. The proof is based on a novel combination of minimax theory and rate distortion ideas, and the authors carefully explain each step of the argument. The simulations section provides empirical evidence for the theoretical results, and the discussion section outlines potential future directions for research.
The paper's novelty lies in its theoretical proof and definition of private protection mechanisms, with experiments providing supporting evidence. The authors' approach is original and significant, as it provides a new perspective on the problem of estimation under communication constraints. The results have important implications for a range of applications, including cloud computing and sensor networks.
The strengths of the paper include its technical rigor, clear writing, and thorough review of the literature. The authors provide a detailed analysis of the problem and carefully explain their results, making it easy for readers to understand the main contributions of the paper. The simulations section provides empirical evidence for the theoretical results, which helps to build confidence in the authors' conclusions.
The weaknesses of the paper are limited. One potential criticism is that the authors' approach is focused on the case of a Euclidean ball, and it is not clear how the results generalize to more complex parameter spaces. However, the authors acknowledge this limitation and outline potential future directions for research.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication. The authors provide a significant contribution to the field, and their results have important implications for a range of applications. The paper is well-written and clearly organized, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments.
