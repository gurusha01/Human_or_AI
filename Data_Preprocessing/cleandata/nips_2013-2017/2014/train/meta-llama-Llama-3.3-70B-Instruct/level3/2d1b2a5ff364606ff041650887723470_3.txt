This paper proposes a novel approach to blind source separation by incorporating signal aggregate constraints (SACs) into an additive factorial hidden Markov model (AFHMM). The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach, called AFHMM+SAC, on both synthetic and real-world energy disaggregation data. The paper is well-written, with a clear problem motivation and a good mathematical foundation, making it easy to follow and understand.
The evaluation results show a significant boost in performance metrics, including normalized disaggregation error (NDE) and signal aggregate error (SAE), indicating the effectiveness of the proposed technique. The comparison with other approaches, such as AFAMAP, demonstrates the superiority of AFHMM+SAC. However, the comparison is not entirely fair, as it uses less data than the proposed SACAFHMM method, and alternative approaches that utilize SAC but are less computationally efficient are not considered.
One potential issue with the results is that the plot in Figure 1 is unclear and may indicate that poor constraints can lead to significantly poorer performance, contradicting the discussion's claim of consistently better results. Additionally, the algorithm can be improved by incorporating more complex constraints, such as time constraints or limitations on simultaneous activities, to make it more versatile and applicable to real-world scenarios.
The paper's strengths include its originality, as it introduces a new approach to blind source separation, and its significance, as it addresses a difficult problem in a better way than previous research. The paper also provides a unique theoretical and pragmatic approach to the problem. However, the paper's weaknesses include the potential unfairness of the comparison and the lack of consideration of alternative approaches.
