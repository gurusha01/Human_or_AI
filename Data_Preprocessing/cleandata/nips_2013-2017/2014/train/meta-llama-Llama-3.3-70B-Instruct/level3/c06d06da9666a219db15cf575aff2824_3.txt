This paper presents a novel approach to recover low-rank and sparse matrices from corrupted observations, particularly when the low-rank component exhibits clustering structures. The authors argue that the existing Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) method may not perform well in such cases due to its preference for incoherent data. To address this issue, they propose using the Low-Rank Representation (LRR) framework with a learned dictionary matrix that is low-rank and contains information about the ground truth matrix.
The paper is well-structured and clearly written, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments and contributions. The introduction provides a thorough background on the problem of low-rank matrix recovery and the limitations of RPCA. The authors then present their main result, which shows that LRR can avoid the coherence parameters that increase with the underlying cluster number when the dictionary matrix is low-rank. They also provide a practical algorithm for learning the dictionary matrix in an unsupervised environment.
The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on both randomly generated matrices and real motion sequences. The authors compare their algorithm with RPCA and other state-of-the-art subspace clustering methods, showing that their approach can significantly improve the clustering performance.
The paper has several strengths, including:
* A clear and concise introduction to the problem and the proposed approach
* A thorough analysis of the limitations of RPCA and the benefits of using LRR with a learned dictionary matrix
* A practical algorithm for learning the dictionary matrix in an unsupervised environment
* Extensive experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach
However, there are also some weaknesses and potential areas for improvement:
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with other existing methods for low-rank matrix recovery, such as iterative methods or methods based on non-convex optimization
* The authors assume that the dictionary matrix is low-rank, which may not always be the case in practice. It would be interesting to explore the robustness of the proposed approach to different types of dictionary matrices
* The paper focuses primarily on the recovery of low-rank and sparse matrices, but it would be interesting to explore the applicability of the proposed approach to other types of matrix recovery problems, such as recovering matrices with missing entries or matrices with outliers.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of low-rank matrix recovery and provides a novel approach for handling coherent data. The authors' use of LRR with a learned dictionary matrix is a promising direction for future research, and the paper provides a solid foundation for further exploration of this approach.
