This paper proposes a novel approach to kernel approximation using sparse random features, which learns a sparse non-linear predictor by minimizing an l1-regularized objective function over the Hilbert Space induced from a kernel function. The authors interpret the algorithm as Randomized Coordinate Descent in an infinite-dimensional space and show that it converges to a solution within Îµ-precision of that using an exact kernel method.
The paper is well-structured and easy to follow, with a clear introduction to the problem and the proposed approach. The authors provide a detailed analysis of the convergence behavior of the algorithm and compare it to existing methods, including the kernel method and Boosting. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in achieving sparse solutions with comparable performance to the kernel method.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposed approach is novel and has potential applications beyond kernel approximation.
* The authors provide a thorough analysis of the convergence behavior of the algorithm.
* The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
However, there are some weaknesses:
* The paper uses many abbreviations, which can make it difficult to understand for non-experts.
* The authors could provide more mathematical equations to clarify the paper and explore the technique's applicability to other Monte Carlo methods.
* The presentation of the paper can be improved by including mathematical formulas and fixing figures, such as figure 4, for better readability and understanding.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, originality, and significance. The paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The paper is clearly written, and the authors provide enough information for the expert reader to reproduce the results.
