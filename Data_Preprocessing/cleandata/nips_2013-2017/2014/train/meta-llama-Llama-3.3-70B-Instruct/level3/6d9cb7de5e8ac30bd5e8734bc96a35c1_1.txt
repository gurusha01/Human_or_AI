This paper proposes a new weighted version of the latent trace norm tensor for linear multi-task learning, which shows improved bounds on excess risk and recovery performance. The authors argue that existing convex relaxations for tensor multilinear rank are not optimal in the context of multi-task learning with heterogeneous dimensions. The proposed scaled latent trace norm is defined with weights that correct the unfavorable behavior of the dual norm, leading to better mean squared error scaling.
The paper is well-written and organized, with technical results that are appropriately proven and sufficient literature coverage. The proposed rescaling has potential significant impact in practice, but requires more extensive experimental evaluation to confirm its effectiveness. The tensor norms studied in the paper can be seen as particular cases of a more general class of tensor penalties introduced in previous research.
The strengths of the paper include its clear motivation, rigorous theoretical analysis, and promising experimental results. The weaknesses include the need for more extensive experimental evaluation and the potential for improvement in the theoretical bounds. The paper's significance lies in its contribution to the development of new tensor norms for multi-task learning, which can lead to improved performance in various applications.
