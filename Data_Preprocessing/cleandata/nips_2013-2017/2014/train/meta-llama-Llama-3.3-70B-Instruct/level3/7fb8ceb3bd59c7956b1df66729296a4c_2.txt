This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of Bandit Convex Optimization (BCO), a fundamental framework for decision-making under uncertainty. The authors propose an efficient algorithm that achieves near-optimal regret for BCO with strongly-convex and smooth loss functions, advancing our understanding of optimal regret rates for bandit learning.
The paper's scope is broad and ambitious, tackling a crucial open question in the field. However, the exploration of ideas may lack depth in some areas, walking the line between broad and shallow versus narrow and deep. The authors' review of previous work is mostly limited to decade-old research, which is surprising given the importance of algorithm selection and metareasoning in AI and cognitive science.
The choice of sorting algorithms as the domain of focus is questionable, as it may not be the best fit for the rational metareasoning model. The model attempts to optimize a combined measure of algorithm accuracy and time/opportunity cost, which may not be directly applicable to sorting algorithms. Furthermore, the use of Bayesian linear regression is wondered to be of much benefit over simple ridge regression, given that only parameter means are being utilized.
The paper's contribution to state-of-the-art AI approaches to algorithm selection is also questionable, with concerns about the comparison to existing models, such as the Lagoudakis method and Guo's approach. Additionally, the contribution to cognitive science is uncertain, with concerns about the selection of sorting algorithms as the most suitable domain for studying human strategy selection, and the experimental setup and results not providing compelling evidence for the RM model.
The training of models used in the experiment is unclear, with questions about whether the models were trained on the same data and number of trials as humans. Minor comments include the use of a Gaussian distribution for modeling human response times, the standard deviation not appearing to be a polynomial in the extended features, and unclear table captions and equation interpretations.
Arguments for acceptance include the paper's significance in advancing our understanding of optimal regret rates for bandit learning, the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, and the importance of the problem being tackled. However, arguments against acceptance include the lack of depth in the exploration of ideas, the questionable choice of domain, and the unclear contribution to state-of-the-art AI approaches and cognitive science.
Overall, the paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of BCO, but its limitations and uncertainties need to be carefully considered. With revisions to address these concerns, the paper has the potential to make a significant impact on our understanding of bandit learning and decision-making under uncertainty.
