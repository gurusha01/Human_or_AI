This paper proposes a novel framework for learning distributed representations of attributes, which can be jointly learned with word embeddings. The authors introduce a third-order model where word context and attribute vectors interact multiplicatively to predict the next word in a sequence, leading to the notion of conditional word similarity. The paper is well-written, and the theory part is clear and well-motivated. However, the experimental section lacks depth and clarity, with too many experiments providing little insight into the proposed model.
The paper's strengths include its ability to capture distinctive notions of word similarities depending on the attributes being conditioned, as demonstrated in the conditional word similarity experiments. The results on sentiment classification, cross-lingual document classification, and blog authorship attribution are also promising, showing competitive performance with state-of-the-art approaches.
However, there are several weaknesses that need to be addressed. The experimental setup and parameters, such as the initial learning rate and momentum, are not clearly specified, making it difficult to understand the results. The attributes used in the experiments are not well-defined or motivated, with unclear choices and notations. For example, the sentence vector in section 3.1 and the language-id vector in figure 1 are not clearly explained. The dimensionality of the attribute vector is also not justified, with 234 unique attributes being represented by a 100-dimensional vector, which raises questions about the model's learning capabilities.
Furthermore, the results show some interesting patterns, but the model's behavior and potential biases are not fully explored or explained. The paper could benefit from more in-depth analysis and discussion of the results, as well as more detailed comparisons with existing work.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, but the claims are not always well-supported by theoretical analysis or experimental results. The paper is not a complete piece of work, as some of the experiments and results seem to be preliminary or incomplete. The authors are careful about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of the work, but more critical evaluation and discussion of the limitations and potential biases of the model are needed.
In terms of clarity, the paper is well-organized, but some parts of the experimental section are difficult to follow due to the lack of clear explanations and notations. The paper could benefit from more detailed explanations of the experimental setup and parameters, as well as more concise and clear summaries of the results.
In terms of originality, the paper proposes a novel framework for learning distributed representations of attributes, which is a significant contribution to the field. The paper also demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed model on several NLP tasks, which is a notable achievement.
In terms of significance, the paper addresses an important problem in NLP, which is learning representations of attributes that can be used for various tasks. The paper shows promising results on several tasks, which demonstrates the potential impact of the proposed model on the field.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, but with revisions to address the weaknesses mentioned above. The paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field, but it needs more careful evaluation, discussion, and explanation of the results, as well as more detailed comparisons with existing work.
