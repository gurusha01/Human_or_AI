This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of neural characterization by introducing a biophysically inspired point process model that explicitly incorporates stimulus-induced changes in synaptic conductance. The authors provide a novel interpretation of the popular generalized linear model (GLM) for neural spike trains, showing that it can be viewed as a special case of their conductance-based model. The proposed model, called the conductance-based spiking model (CBSM), relaxes the constraints of the GLM and allows for independent excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of their model and its relationship to previous work. The CBSM is shown to capture neural responses more accurately than the standard GLM and allows for the accurate inference of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic conductances from stimuli and extracellularly recorded spike trains.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to provide a biophysically plausible interpretation of the GLM, which has been a widely used tool for characterizing neural encoding. The authors demonstrate that the CBSM can exhibit gain control effects that cannot be captured by a classic GLM with a spike history filter and exponential nonlinearity.
However, one potential weakness of the paper is the choice of temporal profiles of filters used in the simulation, which have time-scales of 30-50 ms. This appears long compared to biological conductance timescales, and the authors should provide justification or reanalysis with smaller timescales to address this concern.
In terms of originality, the paper presents a novel combination of familiar techniques, providing a new and more flexible conductance-based point process model for neural responses. The authors adequately reference related work and demonstrate how their model differs from previous contributions.
The significance of the paper lies in its ability to provide a more accurate and interpretable model of spike responses in early sensory neurons. The authors demonstrate that the CBSM can accurately estimate the tuning of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs to retinal ganglion cells purely from measured spike times, which has important implications for understanding the neural code in sensory systems.
Overall, I believe that the paper deserves publication pending revision to address the major comment regarding timescales and correction of minor typos. The strengths of the paper, including its biophysically plausible interpretation of the GLM and its ability to capture neural responses more accurately, make it a valuable contribution to the field.
