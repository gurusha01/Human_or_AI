This paper presents a novel framework for constructing prior distributions with structured variables, based on the maximum entropy principle. The authors propose a method for designing prior distributions that incorporate domain constraints, and demonstrate its effectiveness in the context of sparse structured variables. The paper makes several important contributions, including the development of a new approach for approximate inference in structured subdomains, and the application of this approach to the problem of sparse support estimation.
The paper is well-written and clearly organized, with a thorough introduction to the background and motivation of the work. The technical contributions are carefully explained and supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors also provide a detailed comparison with existing methods, including Bayesian hierarchical models and non-probabilistic sparse predictive models.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to unify several existing approaches to structured prior design, including the spike and slab prior and the horseshoe prior. The authors show that their approach can be seen as a generalization of these methods, and that it provides a more principled and flexible framework for incorporating domain knowledge into Bayesian models.
The experimental results presented in the paper are impressive, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in a variety of settings. The authors show that their method outperforms several existing methods, including Lasso and ARD, in terms of support recovery and predictive accuracy. The results on the fMRI data are particularly notable, as they demonstrate the ability of the method to scale to high-dimensional problems and to provide biologically plausible results.
However, there are some potential limitations and areas for future work. One potential limitation is the complexity of the inference algorithm, which may make it difficult to apply the method to very large datasets. Additionally, the authors note that the method is most effective when the base density is well-understood, which may not always be the case in practice. Further work is needed to develop more efficient and robust inference algorithms, and to explore the application of the method to a wider range of problems.
Overall, this paper presents a significant contribution to the field of Bayesian modeling, and has the potential to impact a wide range of applications. The authors have demonstrated the effectiveness of their approach in several settings, and have provided a clear and well-motivated framework for incorporating domain knowledge into Bayesian models.
