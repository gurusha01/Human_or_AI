This paper proposes a novel approach to estimating sparse connectivity graphs of firing neurons using an L2 norm to obtain a penalized inverse covariance matrix and a soft thresholding approach. The method is self-contained, with extensive references, and its structure and presentation can be improved to make it more theoretically and scientifically motivated.
The proposed method compares favorably to other published methods, including those from the Kaggle Connectnomics competition, with improvements in computational speed and justification for chosen parameters. The author's rebuttal addressed concerns, providing a better justification for choices made and highlighting the paper's theoretical completeness, leading to an increased score.
The paper's quality is good, with claims well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The work is a complete piece, and the authors are careful about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of the work. The clarity of the paper can be improved, with some suggestions for reorganization and additional explanations to make it more accessible to readers.
The originality of the paper is high, with a novel combination of familiar techniques. The work differs significantly from previous contributions, and related work is adequately referenced. The significance of the results is also high, with important implications for the field of neuroscience and potential applications in other areas.
The main strengths of the paper are:
* A novel approach to estimating sparse connectivity graphs of firing neurons
* Improved computational speed and justification for chosen parameters
* Theoretical completeness and careful evaluation of strengths and weaknesses
The main weaknesses of the paper are:
* The structure and presentation can be improved for better clarity and motivation
* Some additional explanations and examples would be helpful for readers
Overall, I recommend accepting this paper, as it presents a significant contribution to the field of neuroscience and has the potential to impact other areas of research. The paper's strengths outweigh its weaknesses, and the author's rebuttal has addressed concerns and improved the paper's overall quality.
