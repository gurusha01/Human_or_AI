This paper proposes a novel prior formulation, the structured spike and slab prior, which allows for the incorporation of prior knowledge about the sparsity pattern in sparse signal recovery problems. The authors also provide a Bayesian inference scheme based on expectation propagation for the proposed model. The paper is well-organized and clearly written, making it easy to follow and understand the proposed methodology.
The proposed prior formulation is a significant contribution to the field, as it allows for the encoding of prior information about the structure of the sparsity pattern using generic covariance functions. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model through numerical experiments on synthetic data, showing improved performance compared to existing methods such as LARS and BG-AMP.
The strengths of the paper include the novelty of the proposed prior formulation, the clarity of the writing, and the thoroughness of the numerical experiments. The authors also provide a detailed description of the expectation propagation algorithm, making it easy to implement and understand.
One potential weakness of the paper is the lack of a systematic approach to selecting the kernel width for the Fredholm kernel. The authors suggest using a cross-validation method, but this is not explored in detail. Additionally, the paper could benefit from more toy experiments to demonstrate the limitations and effectiveness of the proposed method in different settings.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of the work.
The originality of the paper is high, as the proposed prior formulation is a novel combination of familiar techniques. The paper clearly differs from previous contributions, and the related work is adequately referenced.
The significance of the paper is also high, as the results are important and have the potential to impact the field of sparse signal recovery. The paper addresses a difficult problem in a better way than previous research and advances the state of the art in a demonstrable way.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, as it makes a significant contribution to the field and is well-written and well-organized. The strengths of the paper outweigh the weaknesses, and the authors have provided a thorough and detailed description of the proposed methodology and its applications.
