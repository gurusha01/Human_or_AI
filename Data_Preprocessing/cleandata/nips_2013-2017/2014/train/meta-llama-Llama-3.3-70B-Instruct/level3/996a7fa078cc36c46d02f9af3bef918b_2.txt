This paper proposes a novel extension of Pinsker's theorem to the setting of quantized estimation, where the goal is to estimate a normal means vector under a communication constraint. The authors establish a sharp lower bound on the asymptotic minimax risk for quantized estimators, which characterizes the tradeoff between the risk and the number of bits used to encode the estimator. The paper also presents an adaptive source coding method that achieves this lower bound asymptotically with high probability.
The paper is well-written and clearly motivated, with a thorough discussion of the background and related work. The theoretical results are rigorous and well-presented, with a clear explanation of the proof techniques used to establish the lower bound. The simulations provide a useful illustration of the performance of the proposed quantized estimation method, and demonstrate its effectiveness in practice.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to bridge the gap between two seemingly disparate areas of research: rate distortion theory and minimax estimation. The authors demonstrate a deep understanding of both areas, and show how they can be combined to yield new insights and results.
However, there are a few areas where the paper could be improved. One potential weakness is the lack of discussion of related work in reinforcement learning between 2000 and 2010, which may be relevant to the development of quantized estimation methods. Additionally, some of the notation and terminology used in the paper may be unfamiliar to readers without a strong background in information theory and statistical estimation.
In terms of originality, the paper presents a novel combination of familiar techniques from rate distortion theory and minimax estimation. The authors demonstrate a clear understanding of the underlying principles and show how they can be applied to a new and interesting problem. The results are significant, as they provide a sharp characterization of the tradeoff between risk and communication constraints in quantized estimation.
Overall, I would argue in favor of accepting this paper, as it presents a significant and original contribution to the field of statistical estimation. The paper is well-written, clearly motivated, and provides a rigorous and well-presented theoretical analysis of the problem. The simulations provide a useful illustration of the performance of the proposed method, and demonstrate its effectiveness in practice.
