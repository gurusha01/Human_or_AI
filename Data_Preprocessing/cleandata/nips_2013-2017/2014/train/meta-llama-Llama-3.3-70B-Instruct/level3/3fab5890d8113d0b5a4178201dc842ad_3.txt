This paper presents a novel framework for constructing prior distributions with structured variables, which is a crucial aspect of Bayesian modeling. The authors propose a principled approach based on the maximum entropy principle, where the prior is defined as the information projection of a base distribution onto the constraint set of interest. The paper focuses on the case of sparse structure and shows that approximate inference using convex subsets is equivalent to maximizing a submodular function subject to cardinality constraints.
The paper is well-written, technically sound, and provides a clear explanation of the proposed approach. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method through experiments on simulated data and high-dimensional neuroimaging data, showing superior support recovery and predictive accuracy compared to other sparsity-inducing models.
The strengths of the paper include:
* A novel and principled approach to constructing prior distributions with structured variables
* A clear and well-organized presentation of the technical material
* Effective experiments demonstrating the superiority of the proposed method
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with other related work in the field
* The experimental section could be improved with more detailed descriptions of the datasets and the experimental setup
* The paper assumes a certain level of familiarity with Bayesian modeling and information theory, which may make it difficult for non-experts to follow
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of Bayesian modeling and is a strong candidate for publication. The proposed approach has the potential to be widely applicable and could lead to important advances in the field.
