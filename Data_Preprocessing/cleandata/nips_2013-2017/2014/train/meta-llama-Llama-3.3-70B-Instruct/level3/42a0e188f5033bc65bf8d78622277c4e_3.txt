This paper proposes a novel prior formulation, the structured spike and slab prior, which allows for the incorporation of prior knowledge about the sparsity pattern in sparse signal recovery problems. The prior is based on a Gaussian process imposed on the spike and slab probabilities, enabling the encoding of prior information using generic covariance functions. The authors also provide a Bayesian inference scheme based on expectation propagation for the proposed model.
The paper is well-written, and the ideas are clearly presented. The structured spike and slab prior is a novel and interesting contribution to the field of sparse signal recovery. The use of a Gaussian process to model the prior distribution of the sparsity pattern is a key innovation, allowing for the incorporation of prior knowledge in a flexible and efficient manner.
The strengths of the paper include the clear presentation of the ideas, the novelty of the proposed prior formulation, and the thorough evaluation of the method through numerical experiments. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in recovering sparse signals with structured sparsity patterns, and the comparison with other methods (LARS, BG-AMP, and oracle least squares estimator) provides a clear understanding of the advantages and limitations of the proposed approach.
The weaknesses of the paper include the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm, which scales as O(D^3) in the worst case, although the authors provide some approximations to reduce the computational cost. Additionally, the paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the relationship between the proposed prior formulation and other existing methods for sparse signal recovery, such as the group spike and slab model and the Markov random field-based approaches.
