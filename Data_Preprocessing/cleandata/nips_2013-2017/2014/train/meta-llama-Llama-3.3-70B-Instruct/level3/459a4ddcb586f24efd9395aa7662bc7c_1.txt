This paper proposes a novel algorithm, Sparse Random Features, which learns a sparse non-linear predictor by minimizing an l1-regularized objective function over the Hilbert Space induced from a kernel function. The algorithm is shown to converge to a solution within ε-precision of that using an exact kernel method, by drawing O(1/ε) random features, outperforming the state of the art which needs O(1/ε^2) features.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a detailed convergence analysis through theorems, which appear to be correct and provide a solid foundation for the proposed algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the Sparse Random Features algorithm, which obtains a sparse solution that requires less memory and prediction time, while maintaining comparable performance on regression and classification tasks.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposed algorithm is novel and addresses a significant problem in kernel methods, which is the scalability issue.
* The convergence analysis is thorough and provides a solid foundation for the algorithm.
* The experimental results are impressive and demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes a certain level of familiarity with kernel methods and random features, which may make it difficult for non-experts to follow.
* The algorithm is compared to the state of the art, but it would be interesting to see comparisons to other related methods, such as boosting.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the proposed algorithm is novel and effective. The convergence analysis is thorough, and the experimental results are impressive. The paper has the potential to make a significant impact in the field of machine learning and kernel methods.
