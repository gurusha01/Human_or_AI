This paper proposes a novel method for aligning two datasets that lie on a single manifold with no correspondences, building upon previous work by Wang and Mahadevan. The authors introduce a sophisticated loss function consisting of three terms: geometry matching, feature matching, and geometry preserving, resulting in a non-convex optimization problem. To solve this problem, they propose a convex relaxation using an alternating projection idea and the Frank-Wolfe algorithm.
The paper is well-written and clearly organized, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments. The introduction provides a thorough overview of the problem and the related work, while the methodology section clearly explains the proposed approach. The experimental results demonstrate significantly improved performance over previous work on synthetic and moderately complex real datasets.
One of the major strengths of this paper is its ability to simultaneously discover and align manifold structures without predefining the local neighborhood structures. The authors also provide a thorough analysis of the optimization algorithm and its convergence properties. The experiments are well-designed and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in various applications, including set matching, video face recognition, and visual domain adaptation.
However, one of the major limitations of this work is the assumption that datasets lie on a single underlying manifold, which is unlikely to hold for most real-world datasets. This assumption may limit the applicability of the proposed method to more complex and high-dimensional datasets.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of the work. The paper is also well-organized and clearly written, making it easy to understand the proposed approach and its contributions.
The originality of the paper lies in its ability to formulate unsupervised manifold alignment as an explicit 0-1 integer optimization problem and propose an efficient optimization algorithm to solve it. The paper also provides a unique combination of familiar techniques, such as the Frank-Wolfe algorithm and convex relaxation, to solve a complex problem.
The significance of the paper lies in its ability to provide a novel solution to the problem of unsupervised manifold alignment, which has many applications in machine learning and computer vision. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method in various applications and provides a thorough analysis of its strengths and weaknesses.
