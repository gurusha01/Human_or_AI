This paper presents a general framework for constructing prior distributions with structured variables, using the maximum entropy principle to restrict the support of a distribution. The authors propose a novel approach to approximate inference for structured variables, which involves projecting the base distribution onto a constraint set and then optimizing over a subset of tractable densities. The paper focuses on the special case of sparse structure, where the authors show that the approximate inference problem is equivalent to maximizing a submodular function subject to cardinality constraints. The authors propose a greedy forward selection procedure, which is guaranteed to achieve within a (1-1/e) factor of the global optimum.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem and their approach. The technical contributions of the paper are sound, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of the properties of the proposed approach. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of support recovery and predictive accuracy, particularly in the context of high-dimensional functional neuroimaging data.
The strengths of the paper include:
* A clear and well-motivated introduction to the problem and the proposed approach
* A thorough analysis of the properties of the proposed approach, including the equivalence to maximizing a submodular function
* A novel and efficient greedy forward selection procedure for approximate inference
* Strong experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The technical work may not lead to surprisingly new or useful results for practical applications, as the authors acknowledge that the approach is closely related to existing work on sparse regression and Bayesian inference
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison to existing work on sparse regression and Bayesian inference, to highlight the novelty and contributions of the proposed approach
* The experimental results are limited to a single dataset, and it would be beneficial to see results on additional datasets to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed approach
Overall, the paper is well-written and provides a clear and concise introduction to the problem and the proposed approach. The technical contributions of the paper are sound, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. However, the paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison to existing work and additional experimental results to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed approach.
