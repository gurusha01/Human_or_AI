This paper introduces a novel approach to blind source separation problems by incorporating domain knowledge through signal aggregate constraints (SACs) into an additive factorial hidden Markov model (AFHMM). The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach, called AFHMM+SAC, on a real-world energy disaggregation problem, achieving significant improvements over existing methods.
The paper is well-written and provides a clear introduction to the problem of blind source separation and the challenges of identifiability. The authors motivate the use of SACs and provide a detailed derivation of the AFHMM+SAC model. The optimization problem is formulated as a convex quadratic program, which can be efficiently solved using existing packages.
The experimental results on both toy data and real-world energy disaggregation data demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the AFHMM+SAC approach. The authors show that their method outperforms existing approaches, including AFHMM and AFAMAP, in terms of normalized disaggregation error (NDE) and signal aggregate error (SAE).
The strengths of the paper include:
* A clear and well-motivated introduction to the problem and the proposed approach
* A detailed derivation of the AFHMM+SAC model and the optimization problem
* Effective experimental evaluation on both toy data and real-world energy disaggregation data
* Significant improvements over existing methods in terms of NDE and SAE
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes that the model parameters are known, which may not always be the case in practice
* The authors do not provide a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the AFHMM+SAC approach
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the limitations and potential extensions of the proposed approach
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of blind source separation and energy disaggregation. The proposed AFHMM+SAC approach has the potential to be applied to a wide range of problems, and the authors provide a clear and well-motivated introduction to the problem and the proposed approach.
