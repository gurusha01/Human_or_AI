This paper proposes a novel approach to active linear regression, which involves partitioning the space and reweighting data points and response values. The method utilizes a recent generalization bound for linear regression to determine the optimal weighting for the best rate of convergence. The authors suggest picking successively finer partitions as the number of points grows and provide label complexity bounds for the steps involved in the method.
The paper presents a well-written and well-organized approach to active linear regression, with a reasonably practical algorithm. The analysis is sound, and the authors have made a significant contribution to the field by advancing the state of the art in active linear regression. The method is novel and insightful, and the paper provides a clear and concise explanation of the approach.
The strengths of the paper include the novelty of the approach, the soundness of the analysis, and the potential impact on the field. The method has the potential to be widely applicable and could lead to significant improvements in the efficiency of linear regression algorithms. The paper is also well-written and easy to follow, making it accessible to a wide range of readers.
However, there are some limitations to the analysis. The requirement that label noise be bounded by O(||x||^2) may be restrictive in some cases, and the lack of a method or analysis for refining the partition or achieving an asymptotic rate may limit the applicability of the approach. Additionally, the paper could benefit from more experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method in practice.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication. The contributions are significant, and the paper is well-written and easy to follow. While there are some limitations to the analysis, the potential impact of the method on the field of active linear regression makes it a valuable contribution.
