This paper proposes a novel prior formulation, the structured spike and slab prior, which allows for the incorporation of prior knowledge about the sparsity pattern in sparse signal recovery problems. The prior is based on a Gaussian process imposed on the spike and slab probabilities, enabling the encoding of prior information using generic covariance functions. The authors also provide a Bayesian inference scheme based on expectation propagation for the proposed model.
The paper is well-structured, and the introduction provides a clear overview of the problem and the proposed approach. The technical sections are detailed, and the authors provide a thorough explanation of the structured spike and slab prior and the expectation propagation algorithm. The numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in various scenarios, including comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods.
However, there are some areas that require improvement. The connection to previous work, such as the spike and slab model and the group spike and slab model, could be more clearly explained. Additionally, the authors could provide more insight into the choice of the covariance function and its parameters. The computational complexity of the algorithm is also a concern, and the authors could explore ways to reduce it.
