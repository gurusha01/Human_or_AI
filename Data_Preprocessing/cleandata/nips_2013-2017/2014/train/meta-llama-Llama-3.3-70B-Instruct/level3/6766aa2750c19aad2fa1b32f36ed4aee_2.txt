This paper proposes a novel approach to low-rank approximation in the streaming model, where the rows of a matrix are presented one at a time. The authors provide a lower bound of Ω(dk/ε) bits of space for any streaming algorithm that outputs a k × d matrix R, such that ‖A - AR†R‖F ≤ (1 + ε)‖A - Ak‖F, where Ak is the best rank-k approximation to A. This lower bound matches the upper bound of Ghashami and Phillips up to the word size, improving on a simple Ω(dk) space lower bound.
The paper's main contribution is the proof of the lower bound, which is based on a reduction from the Index problem in communication complexity. The authors show that any streaming algorithm that solves the low-rank approximation problem can be used to solve the Index problem, and therefore, the space complexity of the streaming algorithm must be at least as large as the communication complexity of the Index problem.
The paper is well-written, and the proof is technically sound. The authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of the reduction and the proof, making it easy to follow. The paper also provides a good overview of the related work and the context of the problem.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to provide a tight lower bound for the space complexity of streaming algorithms for low-rank approximation. This bound has important implications for the design of efficient streaming algorithms for this problem.
However, one potential weakness of the paper is that it does not provide an upper bound that matches the lower bound. While the authors mention that the algorithm of Ghashami and Phillips achieves a space bound of O(dk/ε), this bound is not tight, and it would be interesting to see if a tighter upper bound can be achieved.
Another potential weakness is that the paper does not explore the implications of the lower bound for other related problems, such as matrix product or regression. It would be interesting to see if similar lower bounds can be established for these problems.
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of streaming algorithms and low-rank approximation. The proof is technically sound, and the paper provides a clear and detailed explanation of the reduction and the proof. While there are some potential weaknesses, the paper's strengths make it a valuable contribution to the field.
