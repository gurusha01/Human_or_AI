This paper proposes a novel approach to unsupervised manifold alignment, which is a crucial problem in machine learning and computer vision. The authors introduce a Generalized Unsupervised Manifold Alignment (GUMA) method that simultaneously discovers and aligns manifold structures without any pre-specified correspondences. The method is formulated as an explicit 0-1 integer optimization problem, considering the matching of global manifold structures and sample features. An efficient optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the problem by alternately solving two submodels.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem and the proposed method. The mathematical formulation of the problem is sound, and the optimization algorithm is well-explained. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on various tasks, including set matching, video face recognition, and visual domain adaptation.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to handle partial permutations and non-linear transformations, which is a significant improvement over existing methods. The authors also provide a thorough analysis of the computational complexity of the algorithm and demonstrate its efficiency in practice.
However, there are some minor errors and areas for improvement. For example, the definition of Hamming distance is not formally defined, and the Hamming ball definition needs to be corrected. Additionally, the indicator function is not clearly explained. The bibliography also needs to be carefully revised to correct formatting errors.
Despite these minor issues, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of manifold alignment and has the potential to impact various applications in machine learning and computer vision. The authors have demonstrated the effectiveness of their method on various tasks, and the proposed approach is novel and well-motivated.
