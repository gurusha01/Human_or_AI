This paper proposes a novel framework for learning distributed representations of attributes, which can be jointly learned with word embeddings. The authors introduce a third-order model where word context and attribute vectors interact multiplicatively to predict the next word in a sequence, leading to the notion of conditional word similarity. The paper is clearly written, and the experiments demonstrate significant performance gains of the proposed method over other methods on various datasets, including simulated data and real-world climatological and location-based datasets.
The strengths of the paper include its originality, technical soundness, and clarity. The authors provide a thorough explanation of the proposed model, and the experimental results are well-presented and easy to follow. The paper also provides a good overview of related work, and the authors do a good job of highlighting the differences between their approach and existing methods.
One of the minor weaknesses of the paper is the need for clarification on certain equations and a more detailed explanation of the scalability and performance of the algorithm. Additionally, the paper could benefit from more insight into the performance gains on different datasets and a more detailed analysis of the results.
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the experimental setup, including the hyperparameters used and the computational resources required. Additionally, the authors could provide more examples of the conditional word similarity and its applications. Furthermore, the authors could explore the scalability of the algorithm with longer runs and provide more insight into the performance gains on different datasets.
Overall, I believe that the paper is well-written, and the proposed method is novel and technically sound. With some minor revisions to address the weaknesses mentioned above, I think the paper has the potential to be a strong contribution to the field.
