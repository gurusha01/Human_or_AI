This paper proposes a novel approach to the low-rank approximation problem in the streaming model, where the rows of a matrix are presented one at a time in an arbitrary order. The authors provide a lower bound of Ω(dk/ε) bits of space for any streaming algorithm that outputs a k × d matrix R, such that ‖A - AR†R‖F ≤ (1 + ε)‖A - Ak‖F, where Ak is the best rank-k approximation to A.
The paper's main contribution is the proof of this lower bound, which is achieved through a reduction from the Index problem in communication complexity. The authors show that any streaming algorithm that solves the low-rank approximation problem can be used to solve the Index problem, and therefore, the space complexity of the streaming algorithm must be at least as large as the communication complexity of the Index problem.
The paper is well-written, and the proof is technically sound. The authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of the reduction from the Index problem, and the use of the communication complexity framework to establish the lower bound.
The significance of this work is that it provides a tight lower bound for the space complexity of streaming algorithms for low-rank approximation, which has important implications for the design of efficient algorithms for large-scale data processing. The paper also highlights the importance of considering the communication complexity of problems in the context of streaming algorithms.
