This paper proposes a Generalized Unsupervised Manifold Alignment (GUMA) method to build connections between different but correlated datasets without any known correspondences. The authors formulate unsupervised manifold alignment as an explicit 0-1 integer optimization problem, considering the matching of global manifold structures as well as sample features. The optimization problem is solved using an efficient alternate optimization algorithm, which alternately solves two submodels: learning alignment with integer constraints and learning transforms to get the mutual embedding subspace.
The paper is well-structured and easy to follow, with a clear introduction to the problem and related work. The proposed method is thoroughly explained, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of GUMA on various tasks, including set matching, video face recognition, and visual domain adaptation. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the computational cost and convergence of the algorithm.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposed method is novel and addresses a challenging problem in machine learning.
* The experimental results are comprehensive and demonstrate the effectiveness of GUMA on various tasks.
* The paper provides a detailed analysis of the computational cost and convergence of the algorithm.
However, there are some weaknesses:
* The paper could benefit from better contextualization and relation to existing works, such as the paper by Chaganty and Liang on spectral experts for estimating mixtures of linear regressions.
* The paper lacks thorough proofreading, with several minor typos and grammatical errors.
* The algorithm is complex and may be difficult to implement for practitioners without a strong background in optimization and manifold learning.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The paper is a complete piece of work, and the authors are careful about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of the work.
In terms of clarity, the paper is well-written, and the organization is clear. However, some sections, such as the optimization algorithm, may be difficult to follow for non-experts.
In terms of originality, the paper proposes a novel method that addresses a challenging problem in machine learning. The approach is new, and the combination of manifold alignment and optimization is unique.
In terms of significance, the results are important, and the paper addresses a difficult problem in a better way than previous research. The paper provides a unique approach to manifold alignment and demonstrates its effectiveness on various tasks.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, as it proposes a novel and effective method for manifold alignment and demonstrates its effectiveness on various tasks. However, the authors should address the minor typos and grammatical errors and provide better contextualization and relation to existing works.
