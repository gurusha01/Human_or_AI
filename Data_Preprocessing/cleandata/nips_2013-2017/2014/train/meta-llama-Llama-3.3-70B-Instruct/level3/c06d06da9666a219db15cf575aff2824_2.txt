This paper proposes a novel approach to recover low-rank matrices from grossly corrupted observations, particularly when the data exhibits clustering structures. The authors argue that the existing Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) method may not perform well in such cases due to its inability to capture the extra structures beyond low-rankness. To address this issue, the authors introduce a new algorithm based on Low-Rank Representation (LRR) with a properly configured dictionary. The key insight is that when the dictionary matrix is low-rank, LRR can avoid the coherence parameters that increase with the underlying cluster number, leading to improved recovery performance.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, as well as a detailed explanation of the proposed algorithm. The theoretical analysis is rigorous, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The authors also provide a thorough review of related work and highlight the contributions of their paper.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel algorithm that can handle coherent data, which is a common challenge in many applications.
* The provision of a rigorous theoretical analysis that establishes the conditions under which the proposed algorithm can achieve exact recovery.
* The demonstration of the effectiveness of the proposed approach through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world data.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The assumption that the dictionary matrix can be properly configured, which may not always be the case in practice.
* The lack of a clear explanation of how to choose the parameters of the algorithm, such as the rank of the dictionary matrix.
* The limited comparison with other state-of-the-art methods, which makes it difficult to fully assess the performance of the proposed approach.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of low-rank matrix recovery and provides a promising approach for handling coherent data. However, further work is needed to address the limitations of the proposed algorithm and to fully explore its potential in various applications.
