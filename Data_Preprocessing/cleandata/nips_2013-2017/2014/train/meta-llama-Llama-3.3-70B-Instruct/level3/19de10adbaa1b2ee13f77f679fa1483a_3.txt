This paper presents a novel approach to designing prior distributions for structured variables, leveraging the maximum entropy principle to define a prior as the information projection of a base measure to the set of distributions supported on the constraint domain. The authors focus on the case of sparse structure and demonstrate that approximate inference using selected convex subsets is equivalent to maximizing a submodular function subject to cardinality constraints. They propose an efficient greedy forward selection procedure, which is guaranteed to achieve within a (1âˆ’ 1e ) factor of the global optimum.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, as well as a thorough explanation of their approach. The technical contributions are significant, and the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through experiments on simulated data and high-dimensional neuroimaging data.
The strengths of the paper include:
* A novel and principled approach to designing prior distributions for structured variables
* A thorough and well-motivated introduction to the problem
* Significant technical contributions, including the development of an efficient greedy forward selection procedure
* Strong experimental results, demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach on both simulated and real-world data
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes a strong background in Bayesian inference and information theory, which may make it difficult for non-experts to follow
* The authors could provide more discussion on the limitations of their approach and potential avenues for future work
* The experimental results, while strong, are limited to a single dataset and may not generalize to other domains
Overall, I believe that this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of Bayesian inference and machine learning, and I would recommend it for publication.
