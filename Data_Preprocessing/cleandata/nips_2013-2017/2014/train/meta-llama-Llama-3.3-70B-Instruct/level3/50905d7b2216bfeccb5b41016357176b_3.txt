This paper introduces a novel approach to blind source separation problems by incorporating domain knowledge through signal aggregate constraints (SACs). The authors propose an additive factorial hidden Markov model (AFHMM) with SACs, which encourages the total signal for each unknown source to be close to a specified value. The paper provides a clear and well-organized presentation of the problem setting, related work, and the proposed model.
The strengths of the paper include the introduction of SACs, which provides a novel contribution to the field of blind source separation. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through experiments on a real-world energy disaggregation dataset, showing significant improvements over existing methods. The paper also provides a thorough discussion of the methodology and the results, making it easy to follow and understand.
However, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement. The empirical study is limited to a single application domain, and it would be beneficial to see the approach applied to other domains to demonstrate its generalizability. Additionally, the paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the computational complexity and scalability of the proposed method. The authors mention that the computing time is similar to that of other methods, but a more thorough analysis would be helpful.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of their work. The paper is clearly written, well-organized, and provides enough information for an expert reader to reproduce the results.
The originality of the paper lies in the introduction of SACs and the application of the AFHMM with SACs to the energy disaggregation problem. The paper provides a novel combination of familiar techniques and demonstrates how this approach can be used to address a difficult problem in a better way than previous research.
The significance of the paper is evident in its potential to improve the state of the art in blind source separation and energy disaggregation. The approach has the potential to be applied to other domains and could provide unique insights and solutions to real-world problems.
