This paper proposes a novel prior formulation, the structured spike and slab prior, which allows for the incorporation of prior knowledge about the sparsity pattern in sparse signal recovery problems. The authors also provide a Bayesian inference scheme based on expectation propagation for the proposed model. The paper is well-structured and clearly written, making it easy to follow.
The proposed prior formulation is a significant contribution to the field, as it allows for the encoding of prior information about the structure of the sparsity pattern using generic covariance functions. The authors demonstrate the benefits of the model through numerical experiments on synthetic data, showing that it can improve the phase transition point and provide better reconstruction results compared to other methods.
The expectation propagation-based algorithm is also a notable contribution, as it provides a flexible and efficient way to perform Bayesian inference under the proposed model. The authors provide a clear explanation of the algorithm and its implementation, making it easy to understand and replicate.
One of the strengths of the paper is its clarity and organization. The authors provide a clear introduction to the problem and the proposed solution, and the paper is well-structured and easy to follow. The numerical experiments are also well-designed and provide a clear demonstration of the benefits of the proposed model.
However, there are a few areas where the paper could be improved. One potential weakness is the lack of comparison to other methods that can incorporate prior knowledge about the sparsity pattern, such as Markov random fields. Additionally, the paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the implications of the proposed model and its potential applications in different fields.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, and originality. The paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The paper is also clearly written and well-organized, making it easy to understand. The proposed prior formulation and the expectation propagation-based algorithm are novel and significant contributions to the field.
