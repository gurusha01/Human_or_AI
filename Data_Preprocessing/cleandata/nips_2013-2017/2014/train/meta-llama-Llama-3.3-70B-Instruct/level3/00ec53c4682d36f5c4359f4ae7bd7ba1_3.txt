This paper proposes a novel framework for learning distributed representations of attributes, which can be jointly learned with word embeddings. The authors introduce a third-order model where word context and attribute vectors interact multiplicatively to predict the next word in a sequence, leading to the notion of conditional word similarity. The paper is well-written, and the methodology and implementations are clearly described. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on several NLP tasks, including sentiment classification, cross-lingual document classification, and blog authorship attribution.
The strengths of the paper include the novelty of the proposed approach, the clarity of the writing, and the thoroughness of the experimental evaluation. The authors provide a detailed description of the methodology and implementations, making it easy to follow and understand. The experimental results are impressive, and the paper demonstrates significant improvements over baseline approaches.
However, there are some weaknesses to the paper. The paper lacks a single theme and seems to be split across multiple contributions, making it difficult to identify the main contribution. The abstract and introduction could be more focused, providing a clearer overview of the paper's main contributions. Additionally, the paper is missing some citations in deep learning and computer vision, including references to independent subspace analysis and local spatio-temporal features for action recognition.
Despite these weaknesses, the paper offers significant practical contributions and interesting ideas that complement the main ideas in deep learning. The proposed approach has the potential to be applied to a wide range of NLP tasks, and the experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness. Therefore, I recommend accepting this paper to NIPS 2014 with suggested improvements.
