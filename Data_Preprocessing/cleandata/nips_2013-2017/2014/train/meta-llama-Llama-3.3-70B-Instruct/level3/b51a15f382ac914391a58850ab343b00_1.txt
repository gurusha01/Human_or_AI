This paper proposes a Generalized Unsupervised Manifold Alignment (GUMA) method to align manifold structures of different datasets and find correspondences between objects in different datasets. The method combines three objective functions: geometry matching, feature matching, and geometry preserving. The paper provides a clear and well-organized introduction to the problem of manifold alignment, reviews existing methods, and explains the proposed method in detail.
The proposed method is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the method on several datasets, including face image sets, protein sequences, video face recognition, and visual domain adaptation. The results show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in many cases.
However, the novelty of the proposed method is limited, as it combines existing related methods. The geometry preserving term in the objective function is similar to existing unsupervised manifold alignment methods, while the geometry matching and feature matching terms relate to other established methods like kernelized sorting and CCA-based matching.
The paper is clearly written, and the authors provide enough information for the expert reader to reproduce the results. The organization of the paper is logical, and the notation is consistent throughout. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the computational cost of the proposed algorithm and demonstrate its efficiency.
The significance of the paper lies in its ability to align manifold structures of different datasets without any known correspondences. The proposed method has many potential applications, including cross-domain learning, data integration, and feature learning. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of the method on several real-world applications, including video face recognition and visual domain adaptation.
