This paper proposes a novel control-theoretic framework for building functioning attractor networks that satisfy key physiological constraints, including Dale's law and the presence of recurrent and sparse synaptic connections. The authors directly optimize network parameters to force sets of arbitrary analog patterns to become stable fixed points of the dynamics, resulting in networks that operate in the balanced regime and are robust to corruptions of the memory cue and ongoing noise.
The paper is well-written and clearly organized, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments and understand the significance of their contributions. The introduction provides a thorough review of previous work on memory networks, highlighting the limitations of existing models and the need for a more realistic and robust approach. The methods section is detailed and well-explained, making it possible for readers to reproduce the results.
The results section presents a convincing demonstration of the effectiveness of the proposed framework, showing that the optimized networks can store and recall multiple analog memories with high accuracy and robustness. The use of a rate-based formulation of the circuit dynamics raises questions about the applicability of the method to spiking memory networks, but the authors provide a clear discussion of this limitation and suggest potential avenues for future research.
One potential weakness of the paper is the lack of explicit comparison to other models of memory networks, making it difficult to fully appreciate the significance of the authors' contributions. Additionally, the paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the optimized network parameters and their relationship to the underlying physiology of the brain.
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to our understanding of the neural substrate of memory and provides a novel and robust framework for building attractor networks that satisfy key physiological constraints. The results are convincing, and the paper is well-written and easy to follow, making it a strong candidate for acceptance.
