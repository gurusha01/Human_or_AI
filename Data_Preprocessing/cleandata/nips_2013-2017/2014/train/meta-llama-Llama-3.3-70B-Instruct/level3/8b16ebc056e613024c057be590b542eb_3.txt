This paper proposes a novel approach to reconstructing network topology from calcium imaging data using inverse covariance matrix estimation with a learned convolution filter. The method appears to be original and improves upon the current state-of-the-art performance for the Kaggle calcium imaging dataset. However, I have some concerns regarding the restriction of the convolution filter to 10 time steps, which may limit the method's ability to capture longer-range dependencies in the data. The authors should provide more insight into the reasoning behind this choice and explore the potential impact on the results.
Furthermore, the inverse covariance method has inherent limitations, such as only being able to extract undirected graphs, which may not accurately represent the complex neural circuits. The authors should discuss these limitations and potential ways to address them.
The paper's clarity is generally good, but some technical terms, such as AUC, could be defined for the benefit of non-expert readers. Additionally, more details about the Kaggle dataset and the experimental setup would be helpful.
The significance of this work lies in its potential to advance our understanding of neural circuits, which has important implications for neuroscience. However, I believe that the contribution is incremental, building upon existing algorithms with inherent limitations. The authors should provide more discussion on the implications of their work and potential avenues for future research.
One of the main concerns is the lack of understanding of why the convolution filter improves performance and its generalization to other datasets. The authors should provide more insight into the underlying mechanisms and explore the potential applications of their method to other domains.
In conclusion, the paper presents an interesting approach to reconstructing network topology from calcium imaging data, but it requires more clarification on the method's limitations, more details on the experimental setup, and a deeper discussion on the implications and potential applications of the work.
