This paper proposes a novel approach to robustifying linear regression models against outliers and corruptions in measured predictors. The authors introduce the concept of a pseudo-ensemble, which is a collection of child models spawned from a parent model by perturbing it according to some noise process. The paper is technically sound from a theoretical perspective, providing a clear and well-structured framework for understanding the relationship between pseudo-ensembles and standard ensemble methods.
The experimental evaluation, however, is limited, particularly in terms of real-world data sets. The authors rely heavily on the MNIST dataset and a sentiment analysis benchmark, which may not adequately support the claims of improved performance. Additionally, the paper lacks some details, such as information about the Airline delay dataset, and contains minor errors, like a typo near Eq. 7.
The proposal is novel, but its originality is limited as it combines previous works, and the authors acknowledge this by referencing relevant related works. The significance of the paper is also limited due to its focus on a specific type of regression method and the constrained experimental evaluation.
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The paper provides a clear and well-structured framework for understanding the concept of pseudo-ensembles and their relationship to standard ensemble methods.
* The authors propose a novel regularizer that performs well empirically and provides insight into the mechanisms behind dropout's success.
* The paper demonstrates the potential of pseudo-ensembles to improve the performance of existing models on real-world benchmarks.
Arguments con acceptance:
* The experimental evaluation is limited, and the authors rely heavily on a single dataset.
* The paper lacks some details and contains minor errors.
* The originality of the proposal is limited, and the authors build upon existing works.
Overall, the paper is well-written and easy to follow, but the limited experimental evaluation and lack of originality may impact its significance and impact on the field. With additional experiments and a more thorough evaluation of the proposed approach, this paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of machine learning.
