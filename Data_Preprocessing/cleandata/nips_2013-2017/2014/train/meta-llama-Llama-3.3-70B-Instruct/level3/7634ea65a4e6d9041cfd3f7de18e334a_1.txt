This paper introduces a novel model for structured sparsity in spike-and-slab models, along with an expectation propagation algorithm for Bayesian inference. The proposed model, called the Structured Spike and Slab model, allows for the incorporation of prior knowledge of the sparsity pattern by imposing a spatial Gaussian process on the spike and slab probabilities. This is a significant contribution to the field of sparse signal recovery, as it enables the encoding of prior information on the structure of the sparsity pattern using generic covariance functions.
The paper is well-written and easy to understand, with interesting examples and comparisons to other approaches. The authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the proposed model and the expectation propagation algorithm, making it accessible to readers with a basic understanding of Bayesian inference and sparse signal recovery.
The approach presented in the paper is simple and novel, distinguishing it from previous works in the same area. The use of a Gaussian process to model the sparsity pattern is a key innovation, allowing for the incorporation of prior knowledge and enabling the model to capture complex structures in the data.
The paper evaluates the proposed model and algorithm through a series of numerical experiments, demonstrating its effectiveness in recovering sparse signals with structured sparsity patterns. The results show that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, such as LARS and BG-AMP, in terms of reconstruction accuracy and computational complexity.
