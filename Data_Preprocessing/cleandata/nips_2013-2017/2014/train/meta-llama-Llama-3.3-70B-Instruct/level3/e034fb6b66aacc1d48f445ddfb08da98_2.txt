This paper proposes a novel framework for constructing prior distributions with structured variables, which is a crucial aspect of Bayesian modeling. The authors extend the maximum entropy principle to design prior distributions when the a-priori information includes structural constraints. The key contribution of this work is the development of a principled approach for enforcing structure in Bayesian models via structured prior selection.
The paper is well-written, clear, and effectively demonstrates the value of context variables in language applications using factored log-bilinear models. The authors provide a thorough introduction to the background and motivation of the problem, and the technical contributions are well-explained. The experiments on simulated data and high-dimensional neuroimaging data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of support recovery and predictive accuracy.
The strengths of this paper include:
* The proposal of a novel framework for constructing prior distributions with structured variables, which addresses a significant challenge in Bayesian modeling.
* The development of a principled approach for enforcing structure in Bayesian models via structured prior selection, which is based on the maximum entropy principle.
* The provision of a thorough introduction to the background and motivation of the problem, and the technical contributions are well-explained.
* The experiments on simulated data and high-dimensional neuroimaging data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of support recovery and predictive accuracy.
The weaknesses of this paper include:
* The paper assumes a significant amount of background knowledge in Bayesian modeling and information theory, which may make it challenging for readers without this background to follow.
* The experiments are limited to two datasets, and it would be beneficial to see the results on more datasets to further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the implications of the results and the potential applications of the proposed approach.
