This paper proposes a novel approach to recover low-rank and sparse matrices from corrupted observations, particularly when the low-rank component exhibits clustering structures. The authors argue that the state-of-the-art Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) method may not perform well in such cases due to its preference for incoherent data. To address this issue, the authors propose using the Low-Rank Representation (LRR) framework with a learned dictionary matrix. The main contribution of this paper is the proof that LRR can avoid the coherence parameters that increase with the underlying cluster number when the dictionary matrix is low-rank and contains information about the ground truth matrix.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem and the proposed approach. The mathematical proofs and derivations are rigorous and well-presented. The experimental results on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in recovering low-rank and sparse matrices.
The strengths of this paper include:
* The proposal of a novel approach to recover low-rank and sparse matrices from corrupted observations, particularly when the low-rank component exhibits clustering structures.
* The rigorous mathematical proofs and derivations that support the proposed approach.
* The experimental results that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in recovering low-rank and sparse matrices.
The weaknesses of this paper include:
* The assumption that the dictionary matrix can be learned in an unsupervised manner, which may not always be the case in practice.
* The lack of comparison with other state-of-the-art methods for robust matrix recovery.
* The limited scope of the experimental evaluation, which only considers a few specific scenarios.
Overall, this paper presents a significant contribution to the field of robust matrix recovery and provides a novel approach to address the challenges arising from coherent data. The proposed approach has the potential to be applied in a wide range of applications, including image and video processing, data mining, and machine learning.
