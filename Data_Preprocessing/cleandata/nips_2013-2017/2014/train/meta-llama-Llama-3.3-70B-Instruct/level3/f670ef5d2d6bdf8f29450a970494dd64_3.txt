This paper introduces a novel framework for online multi-task learning with a shared annotator, where multiple learners share a single annotator with limited bandwidth. The authors propose an algorithm, SHAMPO, which learns to select tasks to query and update models based on the received feedback. The algorithm is analyzed in the mistake-bound model, and the authors provide bounds on the expected cumulative number of mistakes.
The paper is well-written, and the presentation is clear and easy to follow. The authors provide a thorough introduction to the problem setting and motivate the need for a shared annotator. The algorithm is well-described, and the analysis is rigorous. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in various settings, including multi-task binary classification and contextual bandits.
