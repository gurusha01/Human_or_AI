This paper proposes a Conductance-Based Spiking Model (CBSM) that extends the traditional Generalized Linear Model (GLM) by incorporating biophysically realistic synaptic conductances. The authors demonstrate that the GLM can be viewed as a special case of the CBSM, where the stimulus linearly modulates excitatory and inhibitory conductances in an equal and opposite manner. By relaxing these constraints, the CBSM can capture more complex neural responses, including shunting and hyperpolarizing inhibition, and time-varying changes in gain and membrane time constant.
The strengths of this paper include its clear and well-organized presentation, as well as its ability to provide a novel interpretation of the GLM. The authors also demonstrate the effectiveness of the CBSM in capturing neural responses in simulations and real data from macaque retinal ganglion cells. The model's ability to estimate excitatory and inhibitory synaptic conductances from spike trains is a significant contribution to the field.
However, there are some weaknesses to the paper. One potential concern is the behavior of the inhibitory filter, which may be prone to overfitting. The authors address this issue by introducing a regularizing penalty term, but it is unclear whether this is sufficient to prevent overfitting in all cases. Additionally, the paper lacks cross-validation in the experimental results, which could demonstrate the model's applicability in a more natural environment.
Arguments for acceptance include:
* The paper provides a novel and biophysically realistic extension to the traditional GLM
* The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of the CBSM in capturing neural responses in simulations and real data
* The model's ability to estimate excitatory and inhibitory synaptic conductances from spike trains is a significant contribution to the field
Arguments against acceptance include:
* The potential for overfitting in the inhibitory filter
* The lack of cross-validation in the experimental results
* Minor errors in subscripts and wording that need to be corrected to improve the paper's overall quality and clarity
Overall, I believe that this paper makes a significant contribution to the field and should be accepted with minor revisions to address the concerns mentioned above. The authors have demonstrated the effectiveness of the CBSM in capturing neural responses, and their model has the potential to provide new insights into the neural code in sensory systems.
