This paper proposes a novel prior formulation, the structured spike and slab prior, which allows for the incorporation of a priori knowledge of the sparsity pattern in sparse signal recovery problems. The prior is based on a Gaussian process imposed on the spike and slab probabilities, enabling the encoding of prior information on the structure of the sparsity pattern using generic covariance functions. The authors also provide a Bayesian inference scheme based on expectation propagation for the proposed model.
The paper is well-written and clearly organized, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments. The introduction provides a good background on sparse signal recovery and the need for structured sparsity patterns. The proposed prior formulation is well-motivated, and the authors provide a clear explanation of how it can be used to encode prior knowledge of the sparsity pattern.
The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in recovering sparse signals with structured sparsity patterns. The results show that the proposed method outperforms other methods, such as LARS and BG-AMP, in terms of phase transition and F-measure. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the algorithm and propose several strategies to reduce it.
