This paper introduces a new additive factorial hidden Markov model (AFHMM) that incorporates signal aggregate constraints (SACs) to improve the performance of blind source separation problems, specifically in the context of energy disaggregation. The authors propose a convex quadratic program for approximate inference, which allows for efficient computation. The paper is well-structured and clearly written, with a good balance of theoretical and experimental results.
The quality of the paper is good, with a thorough discussion of the problem setting, related work, and the proposed approach. The authors provide a clear explanation of the AFHMM and SACs, and demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on both simulated and real-world data. The experimental results show that the AFHMM+SAC outperforms the original AFHMM and a recent state-of-the-art approach, with a significant improvement in normalized disaggregation error and signal aggregate error.
However, the readability of the paper is poor due to an excessive use of acronyms, some of which are overly long. For example, AFHMM+SAC, AFAMAP, and NTC are used frequently throughout the paper, which can make it difficult for readers to follow. Additionally, the authors incorrectly place a constraint on the prior density instead of stating an a priori constraint that consequently constrains the posterior density.
The originality of the paper is high, as it proposes a new approach to incorporating domain knowledge into blind source separation problems. The use of SACs is a novel contribution, and the authors demonstrate its effectiveness in improving the performance of the AFHMM. The paper also provides a thorough review of related work, which helps to situate the proposed approach within the broader context of energy disaggregation research.
The significance of the paper is also high, as it addresses a difficult problem in energy disaggregation and provides a unique solution. The results show that the AFHMM+SAC can improve the accuracy of energy disaggregation, which has important implications for energy management and conservation. The paper also provides a unique theoretical and pragmatic approach to incorporating domain knowledge into probabilistic models, which can be applied to other areas of research.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, but with some revisions to improve readability and clarity. The authors should consider reducing the number of acronyms used and providing a clearer explanation of the technical details. Additionally, the authors should correct the mistake in the constraint placement and provide a more detailed discussion of the implications of their results.
