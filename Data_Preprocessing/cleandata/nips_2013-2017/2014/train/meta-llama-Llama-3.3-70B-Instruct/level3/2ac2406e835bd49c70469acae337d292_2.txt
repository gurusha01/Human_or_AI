This paper proposes a Generalized Unsupervised Manifold Alignment (GUMA) method to build connections between different but correlated datasets without any known correspondences. The authors formulate the problem as an explicit integer optimization problem, considering the matching of global manifold structures and sample features. The method alternately optimizes two submodels: learning alignment with integer constraints and learning transforms to get the mutual embedding subspace.
The paper is well-organized and clearly written, making it easy to follow. The authors provide a thorough introduction to the problem of manifold alignment and its importance in various applications. They also provide a detailed explanation of the proposed method, including the optimization algorithm and the experimental setup.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel and effective method for unsupervised manifold alignment, which can simultaneously discover and align manifold structures without predefining the local neighborhood structures.
* The use of an efficient optimization algorithm, which can approximately seek for optima along the descent path of the relaxed objective function.
* The demonstration of the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed method through extensive experiments on set matching, video face recognition, and visual domain adaptation.
However, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement:
* The notation used in the paper could be improved for clarity and consistency. For example, the authors use bold letters to denote vectors and matrices, but it is not always clear what the dimensions of these vectors and matrices are.
* The experimental results could be presented in a more comprehensive and comparable way. For example, the authors could provide tables summarizing the results of different methods, rather than relying on graphs and figures.
* The authors could provide more analysis and discussion of the results, including the limitations and potential extensions of the proposed method.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of manifold alignment and has the potential to be a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners. With some revisions to address the areas for improvement, the paper could be even stronger and more effective in communicating the authors' ideas and results.
