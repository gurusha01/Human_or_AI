This paper presents an extension of low-rank spectrogram-factorization models that generalizes latent factors over an arbitrary set of bases for sound decomposition. The proposed model expands on the Gaussian Composite Model by introducing a time-domain expression that can work with different sets of impulse responses, including non-orthogonal ones, and uses an EM analysis procedure. 
The quality of the paper is interesting, but the implications and potential complications of the approach are not fully clear. The estimation procedure, although impressive, is difficult to follow in detail. The work is well-explained and motivated, but the evaluation is superficial, relying on only one illustrative result and one SNR improvement measurement, making it hard to draw conclusions.
The originality of the work is limited, as it heavily relies on the Fevotte et al foundation, although the time-domain interpretation offers a new perspective. The significance of the work is potentially high, as it allows matrix-factorization techniques to be applied to overcomplete bases, but the thin evaluation and significant artifacts in examples fail to demonstrate its importance.
Arguments pro acceptance:
- The paper presents a novel extension of low-rank spectrogram-factorization models.
- The proposed model has the potential to improve source separation and denoising.
- The time-domain interpretation offers a new perspective on the Gaussian Composite Model.
Arguments con acceptance:
- The implications and potential complications of the approach are not fully clear.
- The evaluation is superficial and relies on limited results.
- The originality of the work is limited due to its reliance on existing foundations.
- The significance of the work is not fully demonstrated due to the thin evaluation and significant artifacts in examples.
Overall, while the paper presents an interesting extension of low-rank spectrogram-factorization models, its limitations in terms of clarity, evaluation, and originality raise concerns about its potential impact and significance. Further work is needed to fully demonstrate the importance and effectiveness of the proposed approach.
