This paper proposes a novel method for multitask learning using tensors, which allows for the exploitation of similarities across multiple dimensions. The authors introduce a new norm, called the scaled latent trace norm, which improves upon existing norms for tensors in the context of multitask learning. The paper provides a thorough theoretical analysis of the proposed norm, including its denoising performance and sample complexity, and demonstrates its effectiveness through experiments on synthetic and real-world data sets.
The strengths of the paper include its clear and well-organized presentation, its thorough theoretical analysis, and its convincing experimental results. The authors provide a detailed comparison of their proposed norm with existing norms, including the overlapped trace norm and the latent trace norm, and demonstrate its advantages in various settings.
However, there are some areas where the paper could be improved. For example, the authors could provide more detail on the motivation behind certain design choices, such as the use of the scaled latent trace norm. Additionally, the paper could benefit from more extensive experiments on real-world data sets, including a more detailed analysis of the results and a comparison with other state-of-the-art methods.
Some potential criticisms of the paper include the fact that the proposed norm may not be suitable for all types of multitask learning problems, and that the authors' analysis is limited to a specific setting. Furthermore, the paper could be improved by providing more insight into the interpretability of the results, and by discussing potential applications of the proposed method in real-world scenarios.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of multitask learning, and its results have the potential to be of interest to a wide range of researchers and practitioners. The authors' use of tensors to model multitask learning problems is a promising direction, and their proposed norm has the potential to be a useful tool in this context.
