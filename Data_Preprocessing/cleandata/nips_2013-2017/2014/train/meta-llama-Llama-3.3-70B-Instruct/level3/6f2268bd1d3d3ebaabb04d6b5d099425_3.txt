This paper proposes a novel approach to bipartite ranking, titled TopPush, which aims to optimize the ranking accuracy at the top of the ranked list. The approach is well-written and organized, making it easy to follow and understand despite its technicalities. The introduction of the TopPush algorithm to the machine learning community is a notable contribution, as it addresses the computational challenge of bipartite ranking by designing an algorithm with a linear time complexity in the number of training instances.
The paper's strengths include its clear motivations and goals, as well as its novel analysis that bounds the generalization error for the top ranked instances. The experimental validation shows that the proposed approach is highly competitive to the state-of-the-art approaches and is 10-100 times faster. The paper also provides a detailed comparison of the computational complexity of TopPush with that of other state-of-the-art algorithms, demonstrating its efficiency.
However, the paper also has some limitations. The experimental validation could be more comprehensive, with more datasets and comparison to other algorithms. Additionally, the paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the relationship between the proposed approach and other existing methods for bipartite ranking.
Overall, the ideas proposed in the paper are potentially interesting and novel, warranting a poster presentation at NIPS. The paper demonstrates a good understanding of the technical aspects of bipartite ranking and provides a clear and well-organized presentation of the proposed approach.
