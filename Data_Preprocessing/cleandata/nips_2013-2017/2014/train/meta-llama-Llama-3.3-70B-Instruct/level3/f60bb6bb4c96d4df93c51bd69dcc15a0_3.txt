This paper proposes a novel algorithm, TopPush, for bipartite ranking that optimizes accuracy at the top of the ranked list. The key feature of TopPush is its linear time complexity in the number of training instances, making it more efficient than existing algorithms. The paper provides a thorough analysis of the algorithm, including its dual formulation, convergence, and computational complexity. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of TopPush in maximizing accuracy at the top and its scalability to large datasets.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem of bipartite ranking and the motivation behind their work. The technical sections are well-organized, and the authors provide a detailed analysis of the algorithm, including its theoretical guarantees. The experimental results are thorough and demonstrate the superiority of TopPush over existing algorithms.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel algorithm, TopPush, that optimizes accuracy at the top of the ranked list with linear time complexity.
* A thorough analysis of the algorithm, including its dual formulation, convergence, and computational complexity.
* Experimental results that demonstrate the effectiveness of TopPush in maximizing accuracy at the top and its scalability to large datasets.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes that the ranking function is linear, which may not always be the case in practice.
* The authors do not provide a comparison with other algorithms that optimize accuracy at the top, such as AATP and InfinitePush, in terms of their theoretical guarantees.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel algorithm that addresses a important problem in bipartite ranking.
* The algorithm has linear time complexity, making it more efficient than existing algorithms.
* The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm in maximizing accuracy at the top and its scalability to large datasets.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The paper assumes that the ranking function is linear, which may not always be the case in practice.
* The authors do not provide a comparison with other algorithms that optimize accuracy at the top in terms of their theoretical guarantees.
Overall, I recommend accepting the paper because it proposes a novel algorithm that addresses an important problem in bipartite ranking and provides a thorough analysis of the algorithm, including its theoretical guarantees. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm, and its linear time complexity makes it more efficient than existing algorithms. However, the authors should address the weaknesses of the paper, including the assumption of linearity and the lack of comparison with other algorithms in terms of theoretical guarantees.
