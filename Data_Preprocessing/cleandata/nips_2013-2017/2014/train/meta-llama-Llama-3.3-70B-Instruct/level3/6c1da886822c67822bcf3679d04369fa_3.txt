This paper proposes a novel approach to matrix completion in recommendation systems with privacy guarantees by constraining parameter estimation and modifying typical matrix completion methods. The authors demonstrate that a small number of public users with many ratings can provide sufficient overlap with private data to enable good accuracy while maintaining privacy. The paper is well-written, but lacks clarity in comparing their method to previous methods, such as experimental comparisons or privacy guarantees.
The approach is novel, applying common privacy-aware learning techniques to recommendation systems, but requires further experiments to strengthen understanding of its performance and comparison to previous methods. The paper belongs to an important class of algorithms that balance privacy and accuracy, making it a potentially significant contribution to the field of data privacy.
The strengths of the paper include its novelty, potential impact, and well-written presentation. However, the weaknesses include the lack of clarity in comparisons to previous methods, limited experimental evaluation, and the need for further analysis to fully understand the approach's performance.
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel approach to matrix completion with privacy guarantees, which is an important and timely topic.
* The authors demonstrate the potential of their approach through theoretical analysis and some experimental results.
* The paper is well-written and easy to follow, making it accessible to a wide range of readers.
Arguments con acceptance:
* The paper lacks clarity in comparing their method to previous methods, which makes it difficult to fully understand the approach's strengths and weaknesses.
* The experimental evaluation is limited, and more extensive experiments are needed to fully assess the approach's performance.
* The paper requires further analysis to fully understand the approach's performance and potential limitations.
Overall, the paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of data privacy, but requires further development and evaluation to fully realize its potential. With additional experiments, analysis, and clarity in comparisons to previous methods, the paper could be even stronger and more convincing. 
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis. However, the paper could benefit from more extensive experimental evaluation to demonstrate the approach's performance in practice. The paper is clear and well-organized, making it easy to follow and understand.
