This paper presents a novel framework for low-rank approximation in the streaming model, providing a significant contribution to the field. The authors introduce a deterministic streaming algorithm that outputs a k × d matrix R, achieving a good trade-off between accuracy and speed. The algorithm's space bound of O(dk/ ) words is shown to be almost optimal, with a matching lower bound of Ω(dk/ ) bits, even for randomized algorithms.
The paper is well-written, clearly organized, and easy to follow, making it accessible to a broad audience. The authors provide a thorough analysis of their algorithm, including a detailed proof of the lower bound. The technical challenges are well-addressed, and the paper includes a comprehensive discussion of related work.
The strengths of the paper include:
* A novel and efficient algorithm for low-rank approximation in the streaming model
* A thorough analysis of the algorithm's performance, including a lower bound
* A clear and well-organized presentation
The weaknesses of the paper are minor and include:
* Some minor typos and grammatical errors throughout the manuscript
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the implications of the lower bound for future research
Overall, the paper is a significant contribution to the field of numerical linear algebra and streaming algorithms. The results are important, and the paper is well-written and easy to follow. The authors have made a substantial effort to ensure the quality and clarity of the presentation.
