This paper presents a novel approach to modeling neural responses by introducing a biophysically inspired point process model that explicitly incorporates stimulus-induced changes in synaptic conductance. The authors provide a thorough interpretation of the popular generalized linear model (GLM) as a highly constrained conductance-based model and extend it to create a more flexible and realistic conductance-based spiking model (CBSM). The CBSM allows for independent excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs, capturing neural responses more accurately than the standard GLM.
The paper is well-organized, and the writing is clear. The authors provide a detailed explanation of the model, its components, and the mathematical derivations. The results section is comprehensive, with simulations and real neural data demonstrating the effectiveness of the CBSM in estimating synaptic conductances and predicting spike rates.
The strengths of the paper include its novel approach to modeling neural responses, the thorough analysis of the GLM, and the demonstration of the CBSM's ability to accurately estimate synaptic conductances from spike trains. The authors also provide a detailed comparison of the CBSM with the GLM, highlighting the advantages of the new model.
One potential weakness of the paper is the reliance on a simplified model of neural dynamics, which may not capture the full complexity of real neural systems. Additionally, the authors note that the model parameters are not guaranteed to converge to the true values, which may limit the model's applicability in certain situations.
To further improve the model, the authors could consider extending it to infer network connectivity structure from spike data on a limited number of neurons, as suggested by recent work (e.g., Abarbanel et al.). This would allow for a more comprehensive understanding of neural circuits and their dynamics.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of neural modeling, providing a novel and more realistic approach to understanding neural responses. The CBSM has the potential to become a valuable tool for understanding the neural code in sensory systems, and its ability to accurately estimate synaptic conductances from spike trains makes it a promising approach for future research.
