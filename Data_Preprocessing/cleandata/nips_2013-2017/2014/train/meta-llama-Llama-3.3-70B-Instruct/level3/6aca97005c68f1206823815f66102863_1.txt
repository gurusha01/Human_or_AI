This paper proposes a novel control-theoretic framework for building functioning attractor networks that satisfy key physiological constraints, including Dale's law and the presence of recurrent and sparse synaptic connections. The authors extend Locally Weighting regression (LWR) by weighting individual data points by each model, resulting in local models as Gaussian processes (GP). The algorithm has two versions: a batch version with fixed local model centers and an incremental version that adds new models in a Bayesian spirit.
The paper is well-written and easy to read, with a clear introduction to the transition from LWR to Local Gaussian Process (LGP). The experiments on a robotic setup show that LGP outperforms the state-of-the-art LWPR method in inverse dynamics learning with fewer local models. The new weighting of local models is original, and the experimental results highlight the significance of the presented method.
However, the paper lacks a thorough comparison with a related article, "Local Gaussian process regression for real-time", which would be interesting to see at the experimental level. Despite this, the paper demonstrates a good understanding of the underlying concepts and provides a clear explanation of the proposed method.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of the work. The paper is clearly written, well-organized, and provides enough information for an expert reader to reproduce the results.
The originality of the paper lies in the novel combination of familiar techniques, and it is clear how this work differs from previous contributions. The related work is adequately referenced, and the authors provide a clear explanation of how their work advances the state of the art.
The significance of the paper is evident, as it addresses a difficult problem in a better way than previous research. The results are important, and other people are likely to use these ideas or build on them. The paper provides unique data, unique conclusions on existing data, or a unique theoretical or pragmatic approach.
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel and original method for building functioning attractor networks.
* The experimental results demonstrate the significance of the presented method.
* The paper is well-written, clear, and easy to read.
* The authors provide a clear explanation of the proposed method and its advantages.
Arguments con acceptance:
