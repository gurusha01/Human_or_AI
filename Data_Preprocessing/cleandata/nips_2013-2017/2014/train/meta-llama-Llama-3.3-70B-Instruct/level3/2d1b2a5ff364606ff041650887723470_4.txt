This paper proposes an extension to the additive factorial HMM model with signal aggregate constraints (SACs) to improve the performance of blind source separation problems, specifically in the context of energy disaggregation. The authors introduce SACs, which encourage the total signal for each unknown source to be close to a specified value, and incorporate them into an additive factorial hidden Markov model (AFHMM). The resulting model, AFHMM+SAC, is shown to outperform both the original AFHMM and a recent state-of-the-art approach, AFAMAP, on real-world energy disaggregation data sets.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear motivation for the introduction of SACs. The technical contributions of the paper are sound, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of the optimization problem and its solution using convex quadratic programming. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, with significant improvements in normalized disaggregation error (NDE) and signal aggregate error (SAE) compared to the baseline models.
One potential weakness of the paper is the lack of discussion on the potential limitations of the SACs approach. For example, the authors assume that the total signal for each source is known in advance, which may not always be the case in practice. Additionally, the authors do not provide a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed approach, which could be an important consideration for large-scale applications.
The paper is well-organized, and the authors provide a clear and concise presentation of the technical material. The related work section is thorough, and the authors provide a clear discussion of the differences between their approach and existing methods.
In terms of originality, the paper proposes a novel combination of familiar techniques, specifically the incorporation of SACs into an AFHMM. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in a real-world application, which is a significant contribution to the field.
The significance of the paper lies in its potential to improve the performance of blind source separation problems, particularly in the context of energy disaggregation. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in a real-world application, which could have significant implications for the development of more efficient and effective energy management systems.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, as it makes a significant contribution to the field of blind source separation and energy disaggregation. The technical contributions are sound, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
