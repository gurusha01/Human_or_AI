This paper proposes a novel framework for learning distributed representations of attributes, which can be jointly learned with word embeddings. The authors introduce a third-order model where word context and attribute vectors interact multiplicatively to predict the next word in a sequence, leading to the notion of conditional word similarity. The paper presents several experimental tasks, including sentiment classification, cross-lingual document classification, and blog authorship attribution, demonstrating strong performance gains over baseline models.
The method's quality is well-founded, and the evaluation is thorough, with a range of experiments and comparisons to alternative approaches. However, the paper could benefit from more comprehensive experiments and comparisons to other subset selection approaches. Additionally, the paper lacks clarity, with a sloppy and hard-to-follow write-up, undefined notation, and convoluted text structure, making it difficult to understand the proposed method.
Despite these issues, the paper appears to be original, presenting a unique approach to subset selection that is not similar to other existing work. The method derived in the paper presents a solid advance and a useful contribution to the subset selection literature, with potential applications in various NLP tasks. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the results, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of their approach.
Some specific errors and areas for improvement include undefined notation, unclear statements, and a lack of direct explanation for certain concepts and approaches. For example, the authors could provide more context and explanation for the choice of the third-order model and the multiplicative interaction between word context and attribute vectors.
Overall, the paper has both strengths and weaknesses, and the authors could benefit from revising the paper to address the clarity and notation issues. The paper's originality, thorough evaluation, and potential impact on the field make it a valuable contribution, and with revisions, it could be even stronger.
