This paper presents a novel approach to blind source separation problems by incorporating domain knowledge through signal aggregate constraints (SACs). The authors introduce SACs, which encourage the total signal for each unknown source to be close to a specified value, and incorporate them into an additive factorial hidden Markov model (AFHMM). The paper provides a clear and well-organized presentation of the problem, related work, and the proposed approach.
The strengths of the paper include the originality of the idea, the thoroughness of the theoretical analysis, and the convincing empirical evaluation on a real-world energy disaggregation dataset. The authors demonstrate that the use of SACs significantly improves the performance of the AFHMM, resulting in a 45% decrease in normalized disaggregation error compared to the original AFHMM and a 29% improvement over a recent state-of-the-art approach.
However, there are some weaknesses to the paper. The empirical evaluation is limited to a single dataset, and it would be beneficial to see the approach applied to other domains and datasets. Additionally, the computational complexity of the proposed approach is not thoroughly analyzed, and it is unclear how the method would scale to larger datasets.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of the work. The paper is well-written, and the organization is clear and easy to follow.
The originality of the paper is high, as it introduces a new approach to incorporating domain knowledge into blind source separation problems. The significance of the paper is also high, as it addresses a difficult problem in a better way than previous research and provides a unique solution that can be applied to a wide range of domains.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, as it presents a novel and significant contribution to the field of blind source separation. However, I would suggest that the authors address the limitations of the empirical evaluation and provide a more thorough analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed approach.
