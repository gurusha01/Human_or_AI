This paper proposes a novel approach to designing prior distributions for Bayesian models with structured variables, leveraging the maximum entropy principle. The authors introduce a framework for constructing priors by projecting a base distribution onto a constraint set, and demonstrate its application to sparse structured variables. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and thorough explanation of their methodology.
The strengths of this paper include its originality, technical soundness, and significance. The proposed approach is a novel combination of familiar techniques, and the authors provide a rigorous theoretical analysis to support their claims. The paper also addresses a difficult problem in a better way than previous research, as it provides a principled approach to enforcing structure in Bayesian models. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of support recovery and predictive accuracy, particularly in the context of high-dimensional functional neuroimaging data.
However, there are some weaknesses to the paper. The experimental setup could be improved by comparing the proposed approach to other sampling algorithms for the Bayesian Nonparametric Bayesian Partitioning (BNBP) model, rather than just the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP)-LDA model. Additionally, the paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed approach, as well as a more thorough discussion of its limitations and potential applications.
Overall, the arguments in favor of accepting this paper include its originality, technical soundness, and significance, as well as its potential to advance the state of the art in Bayesian modeling. The arguments against acceptance include the limited experimental setup and the need for a more detailed analysis of computational complexity and limitations.
Here is a list of arguments pro and con acceptance:
