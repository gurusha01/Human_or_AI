This paper presents a novel approach to policy search in reinforcement learning, which combines the strengths of model-based and model-free methods. The authors propose a hybrid method that fits local, time-varying linear dynamics models to optimize trajectory distributions, and then uses guided policy search to learn arbitrary parameterized policies. The key innovation is the use of a KL-divergence constraint to limit the change in the trajectory distribution at each iteration, which allows the method to handle complex and discontinuous dynamics.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the methodology and its underlying principles. The experimental evaluation is thorough and demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach on a range of tasks, including robotic manipulation and locomotion. The results show that the method outperforms prior model-free and model-based approaches, and is able to learn complex policies that can generalize to new situations.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposed method is novel and combines the strengths of model-based and model-free approaches.
* The experimental evaluation is thorough and demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach on a range of tasks.
* The paper provides a clear and concise explanation of the methodology and its underlying principles.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The method requires a significant amount of computational resources and data to train the policies.
* The approach may not be suitable for tasks with high-dimensional state and action spaces, as the number of samples required to estimate the dynamics may be prohibitively large.
* The method assumes that the dynamics can be approximated by a time-varying linear-Gaussian model, which may not always be the case.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of reinforcement learning, and the proposed method has the potential to be applied to a wide range of tasks. The authors have demonstrated the effectiveness of the approach on a range of tasks, and have provided a clear and concise explanation of the methodology and its underlying principles.
