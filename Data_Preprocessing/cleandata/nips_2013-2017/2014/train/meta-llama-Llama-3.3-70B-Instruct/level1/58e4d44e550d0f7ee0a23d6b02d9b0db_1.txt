This paper presents a lower bound on the space complexity of streaming algorithms for low-rank approximation in the row-update model. The authors show that any streaming algorithm that outputs a $k \times d$ matrix $R$ such that $\|A - AR^{\dagger}R\|F \leq (1 + \epsilon) \|A - Ak\|_F$ must use $\Omega(dk/\epsilon)$ bits of space, even for randomized algorithms that succeed with constant probability.
The paper relates to previous work on low-rank approximation, including the seminal work of Frieze, Kannan, and Vempala, and the more recent work of Clarkson and Woodruff, who showed lower bounds for the entry-update model. The authors also build on the work of Liberty, who presented a deterministic streaming algorithm for low-rank approximation in the row-update model, and Ghashami and Phillips, who improved the analysis of Liberty's algorithm.
The strengths of the paper include its clear and well-organized presentation, its thorough analysis of the problem, and its significant contribution to the field of streaming algorithms. The authors provide a detailed proof of their lower bound, which involves a reduction from the Index problem in communication complexity. They also provide a clear explanation of the intuition behind their proof and the technical challenges that they overcame.
The weaknesses of the paper are relatively minor. One potential weakness is that the authors do not provide a clear explanation of the significance of their lower bound in terms of practical applications. While they do mention that their result shows that the algorithm of Ghashami and Phillips is optimal up to the word size, they do not provide a detailed discussion of the implications of their result for practitioners.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication. The paper presents a significant contribution to the field of streaming algorithms, and its clear and well-organized presentation makes it easy to follow. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the problem and a detailed proof of their lower bound, which makes their result convincing.
