This paper proposes a novel sampling framework for inference in probabilistic models, specifically an active learning approach that converges more quickly than Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) benchmarks. The authors introduce a warped model for probabilistic integrands, permitting a cheap active learning scheme to optimally select sample locations. The algorithm, termed warped sequential active Bayesian integration (WSABI), is demonstrated to offer faster convergence relative to simple Monte Carlo and annealed importance sampling on both synthetic and real-world examples.
The paper builds upon previous work in Bayesian quadrature, which has been hindered by prohibitive computation costs. The authors' contributions extend existing work in two ways: (1) they propose a square-root GP prior on the likelihood function, which enforces non-negativity without approximations, and (2) they introduce a fast active sampling scheme that targets the reduction in entropy of the total integrand.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem of probabilistic inference and the challenges of numerical integration. The technical sections are thorough and well-explained, with a clear description of the proposed methodology and its advantages over existing approaches.
The results section is comprehensive, with a range of experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of WSABI in terms of convergence speed and accuracy, compared to other state-of-the-art methods such as Monte Carlo and annealed importance sampling.
The strengths of the paper include:
* A clear and well-motivated introduction to the problem and the proposed methodology
* A thorough and well-explained technical section
* A comprehensive results section with a range of experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets
* A demonstration of the effectiveness of WSABI in terms of convergence speed and accuracy
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes a certain level of background knowledge in Bayesian inference and Gaussian processes, which may make it difficult for non-experts to follow
* Some of the technical sections are dense and may require multiple readings to fully understand
* The authors could provide more discussion on the limitations of WSABI and potential avenues for future work
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel and effective methodology for probabilistic inference, which has the potential to improve the state-of-the-art in this area
* The results section is comprehensive and demonstrates the effectiveness of WSABI in a range of experiments
* The paper is well-written and provides a clear and concise introduction to the problem and the proposed methodology
Arguments against acceptance:
* The paper assumes a certain level of background knowledge in Bayesian inference and Gaussian processes, which may limit its accessibility to non-experts
* Some of the technical sections are dense and may require multiple readings to fully understand
* The authors could provide more discussion on the limitations of WSABI and potential avenues for future work.
Overall, I believe that the paper is a strong contribution to the field of probabilistic inference and deserves to be accepted. The authors have proposed a novel and effective methodology, and the results section demonstrates its effectiveness in a range of experiments. With some minor revisions to address the weaknesses mentioned above, the paper has the potential to be a valuable addition to the conference proceedings.
