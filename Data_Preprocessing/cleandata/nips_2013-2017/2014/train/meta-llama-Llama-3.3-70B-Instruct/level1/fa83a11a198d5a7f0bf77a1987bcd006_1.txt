This paper addresses the problem of estimating covariance matrices in high-dimensional settings with autocorrelated data, which is a common challenge in many signal processing and machine learning applications. The authors build upon the work of Sancetta, who extended the shrinkage framework to handle non-i.i.d. data, and propose a new bias-corrected estimator that outperforms existing methods.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, as well as a thorough review of previous work in the area. The proposed estimator is carefully motivated, and the theoretical analysis is rigorous and well-supported by simulations and real-world experiments.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The authors identify a significant limitation of the Sancetta estimator, which is its high bias in finite sample sizes, and propose a correction that addresses this issue.
* The proposed estimator is shown to be unbiased and robust to the choice of hyperparameters, which is a significant advantage over existing methods.
* The simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed estimator in a variety of settings, including high-dimensional data and autocorrelated time series.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes a specific form of autocorrelation, which may not be applicable to all real-world scenarios.
* The proposed estimator requires the choice of a lag parameter, which can be challenging to select in practice.
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with other existing methods, such as cross-validation, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the strengths and limitations of the proposed estimator.
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of covariance matrix estimation and provides a useful tool for practitioners working with high-dimensional and autocorrelated data.
