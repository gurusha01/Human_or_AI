This paper proposes a novel approach to recover low-rank matrices from grossly corrupted observations, particularly when the data exhibits clustering structures. The authors argue that the existing Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) method may not perform well in such cases due to its inability to capture the extra structures beyond low-rankness. To address this issue, they introduce a Low-Rank Representation (LRR) framework with a properly configured dictionary, which can effectively alleviate the challenges raised by coherent data.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, related work, and their proposed approach. The technical contributions of the paper are significant, including the proof that LRR can avoid the coherence parameters that increase with the underlying cluster number when the dictionary matrix is low-rank. The authors also propose a practical algorithm for learning the dictionary matrix in an unsupervised environment, which outperforms RPCA in their extensive experiments.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The authors provide a thorough analysis of the limitations of RPCA and the benefits of using LRR with a properly configured dictionary.
* The proposed algorithm is simple and effective, and the authors provide a detailed proof of its correctness.
* The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in recovering low-rank matrices from grossly corrupted observations.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The authors assume that the dictionary matrix is low-rank, which may not always be the case in practice.
* The proposed algorithm requires the estimation of the rank of the low-rank matrix, which can be challenging in practice.
* The authors do not provide a detailed comparison with other existing methods for robust low-rank matrix recovery.
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of low-rank matrix recovery and provides a novel approach for handling coherent data. The proposed algorithm is simple and effective, and the experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness in practice.
