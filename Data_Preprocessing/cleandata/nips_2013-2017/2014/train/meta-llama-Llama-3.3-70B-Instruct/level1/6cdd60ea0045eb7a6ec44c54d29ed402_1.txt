This paper proposes a new robust logistic regression algorithm, called RoLR, which estimates the parameter through a simple linear programming procedure. The authors prove that RoLR is robust to a constant fraction of adversarial outliers in the covariate matrix. The paper also applies RoLR to solving binary classification problems where a fraction of training samples are corrupted.
The main ideas of this paper relate to previous work on robust logistic regression, such as the work by Pregibon [14], Cook and Weisberg [4], and Johnson [9], which proposed procedures to identify influential observations. However, these methods are not robust to corrupted covariate matrices. The paper also draws inspiration from recent works on robust sparse regression [3, 13].
The strengths of this paper include:
* The proposal of a new robust logistic regression algorithm, RoLR, which is robust to a constant fraction of adversarial outliers in the covariate matrix.
* The provision of theoretical guarantees for RoLR, including bounds on the parameter estimation error and the empirical and population risks.
* The application of RoLR to solving binary classification problems with corrupted training samples.
* The use of a simple and efficient linear programming procedure to solve RoLR, which can scale to large problems.
The weaknesses of this paper include:
* The assumption that the outliers are adversarial and unbounded, which may not be realistic in all scenarios.
* The requirement of knowing the number of outliers, which may not be available in practice.
* The potential degradation in performance of RoLR compared to standard logistic regression when there are no outliers.
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel and robust logistic regression algorithm that can handle adversarial outliers in the covariate matrix.
* The theoretical guarantees provided for RoLR are strong and demonstrate its robustness.
* The application of RoLR to binary classification problems is a significant contribution.
* The use of a simple and efficient linear programming procedure to solve RoLR makes it scalable to large problems.
Arguments con acceptance:
* The assumption of adversarial and unbounded outliers may not be realistic in all scenarios.
* The requirement of knowing the number of outliers may not be practical.
* The potential degradation in performance of RoLR compared to standard logistic regression when there are no outliers may be a concern.
Overall, this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of robust logistic regression and binary classification. The proposal of RoLR and its theoretical guarantees demonstrate its robustness and potential for handling adversarial outliers. However, the assumptions and requirements of the algorithm may need to be carefully considered in practice.
