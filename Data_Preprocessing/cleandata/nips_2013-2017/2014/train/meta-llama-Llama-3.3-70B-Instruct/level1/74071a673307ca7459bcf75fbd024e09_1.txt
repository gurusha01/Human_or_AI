This paper presents a novel framework for constructing prior distributions with structured variables, specifically focusing on sparse structure. The authors propose a principled approach based on the maximum entropy principle, where the prior is defined as the information projection of a base distribution onto the constraint set of interest. The paper provides a thorough theoretical analysis, including the derivation of the information projection and its approximation using tractable subsets. The authors also demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through experiments on simulated data and high-dimensional neuroimaging data.
The paper's strengths include:
* A clear and well-motivated introduction to the problem of constructing prior distributions with structured variables
* A thorough and rigorous theoretical analysis, including the derivation of the information projection and its approximation
* A well-organized and easy-to-follow presentation of the results
* A demonstration of the effectiveness of the approach through experiments on simulated data and high-dimensional neuroimaging data
The paper's weaknesses include:
* The paper assumes a strong background in Bayesian inference and information theory, which may make it difficult for non-experts to follow
* Some of the notation and terminology may be unfamiliar to readers without a strong background in the field
* The paper could benefit from more discussion of the limitations and potential extensions of the approach
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The paper presents a novel and principled approach to constructing prior distributions with structured variables
* The theoretical analysis is thorough and rigorous
* The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in practice
* The paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of Bayesian inference and machine learning
Arguments con acceptance:
* The paper may be difficult for non-experts to follow due to the assumed background in Bayesian inference and information theory
* The notation and terminology may be unfamiliar to some readers
* The paper could benefit from more discussion of the limitations and potential extensions of the approach
Overall, I believe that the paper is well-written, well-organized, and presents a significant contribution to the field of Bayesian inference and machine learning. I recommend acceptance, but suggest that the authors consider revising the paper to make it more accessible to non-experts and to provide more discussion of the limitations and potential extensions of the approach.
