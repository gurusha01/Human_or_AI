This paper proposes a novel approach to inferring direct neural network connections from Calcium imaging time series using inverse covariance estimation. The authors introduce a simple convolution filter prior to applying sample covariance, which can be learned quickly using a supervised optimization algorithm. The proposed algorithm is shown to be relatively fast and accurate, producing AUC scores comparable to the winning solution in the Kaggle Connectomics competition.
The paper is well-written and clearly organized, with a thorough introduction to the problem and related work. The authors provide a detailed description of their methodology, including the use of a convolution filter and supervised optimization algorithm. The results are impressive, with the proposed algorithm achieving high AUC scores on the Kaggle Connectomics dataset.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel approach to inferring neural network connections using inverse covariance estimation
* The introduction of a simple convolution filter that can be learned quickly using a supervised optimization algorithm
* The achievement of high AUC scores on the Kaggle Connectomics dataset
* The provision of a detailed description of the methodology and results
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The assumption of a Gaussian model for inverse covariance, despite the data being highly non-Gaussian
* The lack of comparison to other state-of-the-art methods for inferring neural network connections
* The limited evaluation of the proposed algorithm on a single dataset
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel approach to inferring neural network connections using inverse covariance estimation
* The results are impressive, with high AUC scores on the Kaggle Connectomics dataset
* The paper is well-written and clearly organized
Arguments against acceptance:
* The assumption of a Gaussian model for inverse covariance may not be valid for the highly non-Gaussian data
* The lack of comparison to other state-of-the-art methods for inferring neural network connections may limit the impact of the paper
* The limited evaluation of the proposed algorithm on a single dataset may not be sufficient to demonstrate its generalizability.
Overall, I would recommend accepting the paper, as it proposes a novel approach to inferring neural network connections and achieves impressive results on the Kaggle Connectomics dataset. However, the authors should be encouraged to address the weaknesses of the paper, including the assumption of a Gaussian model and the limited evaluation of the proposed algorithm.
