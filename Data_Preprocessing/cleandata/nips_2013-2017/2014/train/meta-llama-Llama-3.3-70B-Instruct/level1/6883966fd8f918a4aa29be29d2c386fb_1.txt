This paper proposes a new active learning algorithm for parametric linear regression with random design, providing finite sample convergence guarantees for general distributions in the misspecified model. The algorithm improves over passive learning by adapting to the underlying distribution, using a stratification technique to approach the optimal risk. 
The paper relates to previous work at NIPS and elsewhere, building on existing research in active learning, regression, and Monte-Carlo function integration. The authors provide a clear and well-organized introduction to the problem, discussing the limitations of passive learning and the potential benefits of active learning in regression.
The strengths of the paper include:
1. Technical soundness: The paper provides a rigorous analysis of the algorithm, including finite sample convergence guarantees and a detailed proof of the main theorem.
2. Originality: The algorithm and analysis are novel, addressing a previously unexplored setting in active learning.
3. Significance: The paper demonstrates the potential for active learning to improve over passive learning in regression, which is a fundamental problem in machine learning.
However, there are also some weaknesses:
1. Complexity: The algorithm and analysis are complex, which may make it difficult for some readers to follow.
2. Assumptions: The paper relies on several assumptions, such as the boundedness of the error and the existence of a well-specified model, which may not always hold in practice.
3. Computational efficiency: The algorithm requires multiple stages and the use of rejection sampling, which may be computationally expensive.
To improve the paper, the authors could consider:
1. Simplifying the presentation: Breaking down the analysis into smaller, more manageable pieces, and providing more intuitive explanations of the key ideas.
2. Relaxing assumptions: Exploring ways to relax the assumptions, such as using more robust error bounds or developing algorithms that can handle model misspecification.
3. Empirical evaluation: Providing empirical results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm in practice, and comparing it to other active learning algorithms.
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of active learning, and with some revisions, it has the potential to be even stronger.
