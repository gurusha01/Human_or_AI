This paper proposes a novel approach to bipartite ranking, titled TopPush, which aims to optimize the ranking accuracy at the top of the ranked list. The authors address the computational challenge of bipartite ranking by designing an algorithm with a time complexity linear in the number of training instances, in contrast to most existing methods whose computational costs depend on the number of instance pairs.
The paper is well-organized and clearly written, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments. The introduction provides a thorough overview of the bipartite ranking problem and the limitations of existing approaches. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the proposed TopPush algorithm, including its dual formulation, convergence, and computational complexity.
The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of TopPush in optimizing the ranking accuracy at the top, outperforming state-of-the-art algorithms such as InfinitePush and AATP. The results also show that TopPush is computationally more efficient than these algorithms, making it a promising approach for large-scale datasets.
