This paper explores a two-tiered notion of privacy in recommender systems, where a small set of "public" users share their preferences openly, and a large set of "private" users require privacy guarantees. The authors show theoretically and demonstrate empirically that a moderate number of public users with no access to private user information already suffices for reasonable accuracy. They also introduce a new privacy concept for gleaning relational information from private users while maintaining a first-order deniability.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem and their approach. The technical sections are detailed and well-organized, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments. The experiments are thorough and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The authors provide a novel approach to addressing the trade-off between accuracy and privacy in recommender systems.
* The theoretical analysis is rigorous and provides insights into the performance of the proposed approach.
* The experiments are well-designed and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in comparison to other methods.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes that the public users are willing to share their preferences openly, which may not always be the case in practice.
* The proposed privacy mechanism may not be suitable for all types of data, and the authors could explore other mechanisms in future work.
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the potential applications and limitations of the proposed approach.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication. The authors have made a significant contribution to the field of recommender systems and privacy, and the paper is well-written and easy to follow.
