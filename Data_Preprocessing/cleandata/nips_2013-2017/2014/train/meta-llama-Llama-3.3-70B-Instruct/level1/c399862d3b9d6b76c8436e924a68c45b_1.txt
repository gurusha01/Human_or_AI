This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of Bandit Convex Optimization (BCO), a fundamental framework for decision-making under uncertainty. The authors provide an efficient and near-optimal regret algorithm for BCO with strongly-convex and smooth loss functions, achieving a regret bound of Õ(√T). This result advances our understanding of optimal regret rates for bandit learning and addresses a long-standing open question in the field.
The paper builds upon previous work on BCO, including the seminal work of [5] and subsequent improvements by [7], [9], and [2]. The authors' algorithm, Algorithm 1, employs a novel "shrinking exploration" scheme, which enables the achievement of the optimal regret bound. The algorithm uses a self-concordant barrier as a regularization term, allowing for the development of a full-information algorithm that takes advantage of the strong-convexity of the loss functions.
The paper is well-organized, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, including the necessary background and notation. The technical sections are thorough and well-explained, with careful attention to detail. The proof of the main theorem, Theorem 10, is provided in a sketch form, with the key steps and intuition clearly explained.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The achievement of a near-optimal regret bound for BCO with strongly-convex and smooth loss functions, which is a significant contribution to the field.
* The development of a novel "shrinking exploration" scheme, which enables the achievement of the optimal regret bound.
* The use of a self-concordant barrier as a regularization term, which allows for the development of a full-information algorithm that takes advantage of the strong-convexity of the loss functions.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The assumption of strongly-convex and smooth loss functions, which may not always hold in practice.
* The lack of experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm in practice.
* The complexity of the algorithm, which may make it difficult to implement and analyze in certain scenarios.
