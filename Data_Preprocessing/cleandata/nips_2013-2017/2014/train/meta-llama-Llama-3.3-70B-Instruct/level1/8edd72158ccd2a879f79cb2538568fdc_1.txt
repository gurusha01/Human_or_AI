This paper presents a novel theoretical model of two-stage noisy voting, which builds upon recent work in machine learning and social choice. The model is applied to the design of systems of software agents, with a focus on computer Go programs. The authors demonstrate that a diverse team of agents, each with its own biased and noisy perception of the world, can outperform a uniform team composed of multiple copies of a single agent. The paper provides a thorough analysis of the model, including theoretical results and experimental evaluations.
The strengths of the paper include its novel contribution to the field of social choice and machine learning, its thorough analysis of the model, and its experimental evaluation using computer Go programs. The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with clear explanations of the model and its assumptions. The authors also provide a detailed discussion of the limitations of their model and potential avenues for future research.
The weaknesses of the paper include its reliance on simplifying assumptions, such as the assumption that the state space is "flat" and that the agents' strategies do not affect the probability distribution over states. Additionally, the experimental evaluation is limited to a single domain (computer Go) and may not generalize to other domains.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper presents a novel and significant contribution to the field of social choice and machine learning.
* The model is thoroughly analyzed, with clear explanations of its assumptions and limitations.
* The experimental evaluation provides strong evidence for the effectiveness of the diverse team approach.
* The paper is well-written and easy to follow, making it accessible to a broad audience.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The model relies on simplifying assumptions that may not hold in practice.
* The experimental evaluation is limited to a single domain and may not generalize to other domains.
* The paper could benefit from additional experimental evaluations or theoretical analyses to further support its claims.
Overall, I believe that the paper is a strong contribution to the field and deserves to be accepted. However, I would like to see the authors address some of the limitations of their model and provide additional evidence to support their claims. 
Quality: 8/10
