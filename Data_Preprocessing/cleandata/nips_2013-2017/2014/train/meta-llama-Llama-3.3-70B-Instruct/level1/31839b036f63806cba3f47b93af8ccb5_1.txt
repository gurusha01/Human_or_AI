This paper addresses the problem of determining whether a causal or probabilistic query is estimable from data corrupted by missing entries, given a model of the missingness process. The authors extend the results of Mohan et al. [2013] by presenting more general conditions for recovering probabilistic queries and causal queries. The paper introduces the concept of "Missingness Graphs" (m-graphs) to explicitly portray the missingness process and the dependencies among variables in the available dataset.
The paper's main contributions are: (1) the introduction of general ordered factorization, which broadens the concept of ordered factorization to include the set of R variables, allowing for the recovery of probabilistic queries in a wider range of problems; (2) the derivation of graphical conditions for recovering causal effects of the form P(y|do(x)) when Y and its missingness mechanism are not d-separable; and (3) the application of these results to problems of attrition, characterizing the recovery of causal effects from data corrupted by attrition.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the concept of m-graphs and the notion of recoverability. The technical sections are thorough and well-organized, with detailed proofs and examples to illustrate the main results. The paper also provides a comprehensive review of related work, highlighting the contributions of the paper in the context of existing research.
The strengths of the paper are: (1) the introduction of a novel and powerful framework for handling missing data, which has the potential to be applied to a wide range of problems; (2) the derivation of graphical conditions for recovering causal effects, which provides a clear and intuitive understanding of when causal queries can be recovered; and (3) the application of the results to problems of attrition, which demonstrates the practical relevance of the paper's contributions.
The weaknesses of the paper are: (1) the paper assumes a certain level of familiarity with graphical models and causal inference, which may make it difficult for readers without a strong background in these areas to follow; (2) the paper's results are based on a set of assumptions about the missingness process, which may not always be satisfied in practice; and (3) the paper does not provide a comprehensive evaluation of the performance of the proposed methods, which would be necessary to fully assess their effectiveness.
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The paper introduces a novel and powerful framework for handling missing data, which has the potential to be applied to a wide range of problems.
* The paper derives graphical conditions for recovering causal effects, which provides a clear and intuitive understanding of when causal queries can be recovered.
* The paper applies the results to problems of attrition, which demonstrates the practical relevance of the paper's contributions.
Arguments con acceptance:
* The paper assumes a certain level of familiarity with graphical models and causal inference, which may make it difficult for readers without a strong background in these areas to follow.
* The paper's results are based on a set of assumptions about the missingness process, which may not always be satisfied in practice.
* The paper does not provide a comprehensive evaluation of the performance of the proposed methods, which would be necessary to fully assess their effectiveness.
Overall, I believe that the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of causal inference and missing data, and I recommend acceptance. However, I suggest that the authors provide additional explanations and examples to make the paper more accessible to readers without a strong background in graphical models and causal inference, and that they provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the performance of the proposed methods.
