This paper presents a novel Bayesian formulation for nonlinear support vector machines (SVMs) based on a Gaussian process and a scaled mixture of normals representation of the SVM hinge loss. The authors extend the previous work on linear Bayesian SVMs to nonlinear SVMs and integrate the Bayesian SVM into a factor model, allowing for joint feature learning and nonlinear classifier design. The paper provides a thorough derivation of the model, including the mixture representation for SVMs, inference using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and expectation-conditional maximization (ECM), and a fast approximation using the Fully Independent Training Conditional (FITC) method.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the technical details. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, showing improved performance over existing methods on several benchmark datasets. The application of the nonlinear discriminative factor model to gene expression data also yields promising results, with the model identifying biologically meaningful features associated with breast cancer.
The strengths of the paper include:
* A novel and well-motivated extension of the Bayesian SVM framework to nonlinear SVMs
* A thorough derivation of the model and its components
* Effective use of MCMC and ECM for inference
* Demonstration of improved performance over existing methods on several benchmark datasets
* Application of the model to a real-world problem in gene expression analysis
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes a significant amount of background knowledge in Bayesian inference, Gaussian processes, and SVMs, which may make it challenging for non-experts to follow
* Some of the technical details, such as the derivation of the mixture representation for SVMs, may be difficult to understand without careful reading and attention to notation
* The paper could benefit from more discussion of the limitations and potential extensions of the proposed approach
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of machine learning and provides a useful extension of the Bayesian SVM framework to nonlinear SVMs. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach through a range of experiments and applications, and the paper is well-written and clear.
