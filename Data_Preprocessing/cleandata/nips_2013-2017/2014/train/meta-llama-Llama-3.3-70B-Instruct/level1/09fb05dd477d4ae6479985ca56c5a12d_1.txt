This paper proposes a novel approach to object detection, called Large Scale Detection through Adaptation (LSDA), which enables the transformation of image classifiers into object detectors without requiring bounding box annotations for all categories. The authors address the challenge of scaling object detection to tens of thousands of categories by leveraging the availability of image-level labels and adapting a convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn the difference between classification and detection tasks.
The paper builds upon previous work on domain adaptation, multiple instance learning, and deep CNNs, and makes significant contributions to the field of object detection. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on the ImageNet LSVRC-2013 detection challenge, achieving a 50% relative improvement in mean average precision (mAP) over a baseline classification-only network.
The strengths of this paper include:
* A well-motivated and clearly explained problem statement, highlighting the need for scalable object detection methods
* A novel and effective approach to adapting classifiers to detectors, leveraging domain adaptation and CNNs
* Strong experimental results, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed method on a large-scale detection challenge
* A thorough analysis of the errors made by the system, providing insights into the types of mistakes and areas for improvement
The weaknesses of this paper include:
* The reliance on a large amount of classification data, which may not always be available
* The need for a small amount of detection data to fine-tune the network, which may limit the applicability of the method to categories with no available detection data
* The potential for overfitting to the adaptation data, which may affect the generalizability of the method to new categories
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper presents a novel and effective approach to object detection, addressing a significant challenge in the field
* The experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method, with significant improvements over a baseline classification-only network
* The paper provides a thorough analysis of the errors made by the system, providing insights into the types of mistakes and areas for improvement
Arguments against acceptance:
* The reliance on a large amount of classification data may limit the applicability of the method to categories with limited data
* The need for a small amount of detection data to fine-tune the network may limit the applicability of the method to categories with no available detection data
* The potential for overfitting to the adaptation data may affect the generalizability of the method to new categories.
Overall, this paper presents a significant contribution to the field of object detection, and the strengths of the paper outweigh the weaknesses. The proposed approach has the potential to enable detection of tens of thousands of categories, and the experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the method. With some revisions to address the potential limitations and weaknesses, this paper has the potential to make a significant impact in the field.
