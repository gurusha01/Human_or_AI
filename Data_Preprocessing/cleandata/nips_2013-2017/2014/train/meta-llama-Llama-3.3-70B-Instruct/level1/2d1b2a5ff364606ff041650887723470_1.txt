This paper introduces a novel approach to blind source separation (BSS) problems by incorporating domain knowledge into the problem through signal aggregate constraints (SACs). The authors propose an additive factorial hidden Markov model (AFHMM) with SACs, which encourages the total signal for each unknown source to be close to a specified value. This approach is particularly useful in applications where the total signal varies widely across sources, and prior knowledge of the expected total values is available.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem of BSS and the motivation for their approach. The technical sections are also well-explained, and the authors provide a detailed derivation of the convex quadratic program for approximate inference. The experimental results on both toy data and real-world energy disaggregation data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, showing significant improvements over the original AFHMM and a recent state-of-the-art approach.
The strengths of this paper include:
* The introduction of a novel and effective approach to BSS problems, which incorporates domain knowledge through SACs.
* A clear and concise presentation of the technical material, including a detailed derivation of the convex quadratic program.
* Strong experimental results, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on both toy data and real-world energy disaggregation data.
The weaknesses of this paper include:
* The assumption that the model parameters are known, which may not always be the case in practice.
* The use of a simplified model, which assumes that each source signal can be modeled by a hidden Markov chain with a finite set of states.
* The lack of a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed approach, although the authors do provide some discussion of the computational efficiency of the algorithm.
Overall, this paper presents a significant contribution to the field of BSS, and the proposed approach has the potential to be widely applicable in a variety of domains. The authors have demonstrated the effectiveness of their approach through strong experimental results, and the paper is well-written and easy to follow.
