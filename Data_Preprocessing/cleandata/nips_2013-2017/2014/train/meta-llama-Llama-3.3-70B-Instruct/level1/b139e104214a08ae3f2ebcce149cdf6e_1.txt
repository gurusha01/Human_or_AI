This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of statistical theory, specifically in the area of nonparametric estimation under storage or communication constraints. The authors extend Pinsker's theorem to the case where estimation is carried out under bit constraints, providing sharp upper and lower bounds for the excess risk in terms of the constraint, signal size, and noise level.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, including relevant background and motivation. The technical results are presented in a logical and easy-to-follow manner, with careful attention to detail and notation. The authors also provide a detailed discussion of related work, including connections to rate distortion theory and minimax analysis.
The main result of the paper, Theorem 1, provides a lower bound on the asymptotic minimax risk for quantized estimators of nonparametric normal means for the case of a Euclidean ball. The authors also present an adaptive source coding method that achieves this lower bound asymptotically with high probability. The simulations presented in the paper demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and provide insight into the tradeoff between the rate of quantization and the excess risk.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem and relevant background.
* The technical results are presented in a logical and easy-to-follow manner.
* The authors provide a detailed discussion of related work and connections to other areas of research.
* The simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and provide insight into the tradeoff between the rate of quantization and the excess risk.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes a fixed but unknown mean vector, which may not be realistic in all applications.
* The authors do not provide a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed method, which may be a limitation in practice.
* The paper focuses on the case of a Euclidean ball, and it is not clear how the results generalize to other parameter spaces.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper presents a significant contribution to the field of statistical theory.
* The technical results are sound and well-presented.
* The authors provide a detailed discussion of related work and connections to other areas of research.
* The simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The paper assumes a fixed but unknown mean vector, which may not be realistic in all applications.
* The authors do not provide a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed method.
* The paper focuses on the case of a Euclidean ball, and it is not clear how the results generalize to other parameter spaces.
Overall, I recommend acceptance of the paper, as it presents a significant contribution to the field of statistical theory and provides a clear and well-presented analysis of the problem. However, the authors should be encouraged to address the limitations of the paper, including the assumption of a fixed but unknown mean vector and the lack of analysis of computational complexity.
