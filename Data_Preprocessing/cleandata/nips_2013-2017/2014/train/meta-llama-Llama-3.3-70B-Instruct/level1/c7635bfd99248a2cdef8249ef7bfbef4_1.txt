This paper proposes a novel framework, called Inference by Learning (IbyL), for speeding up graphical model optimization while maintaining excellent solution accuracy. The approach relies on a multi-scale pruning scheme that progressively reduces the solution space by using a coarse-to-fine cascade of learned classifiers. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their framework on various computer vision problems, including stereo matching, image restoration, and optical flow estimation.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise overview of the proposed approach. The related work section is thorough, and the authors adequately discuss the limitations of existing methods. The technical contributions of the paper are significant, and the experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach over existing methods.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposed framework is general and versatile, making it applicable to a wide range of graphical model optimization problems.
* The use of a multi-scale pruning scheme allows for significant speed-ups while maintaining excellent solution accuracy.
* The authors provide a thorough analysis of the experimental results, including evaluations of the energy ratio, best label agreement, speed-up factor, and active label ratio.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes that the graphical model is a discrete pairwise CRF/MRF, which may limit its applicability to more general graphical models.
* The authors do not provide a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed approach, which would be useful for understanding its scalability.
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the potential applications of the proposed framework beyond computer vision.
Arguments pro acceptance:
