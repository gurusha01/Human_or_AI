This paper proposes a parallel randomized block coordinate method, called Parallel Direction Method of Multipliers (PDMM), to solve optimization problems with multi-block linear constraints. The method is an extension of the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) and can handle multiple blocks in parallel. The authors establish the global convergence and iteration complexity of PDMM with constant step size, and demonstrate its effectiveness in two applications: robust principal component analysis and overlapping group lasso.
The paper is well-written and provides a clear overview of the proposed method and its theoretical guarantees. The authors also provide a detailed comparison with existing methods, including ADMM and its variants, and demonstrate the superiority of PDMM in terms of convergence speed and accuracy.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a new parallel randomized block coordinate method that can handle multiple blocks in parallel, which is a significant improvement over existing methods.
* The establishment of global convergence and iteration complexity of PDMM with constant step size, which provides a strong theoretical foundation for the method.
* The demonstration of the effectiveness of PDMM in two applications, which shows the practical value of the method.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The method requires careful tuning of parameters, including the step size and the number of blocks to be updated, which can be time-consuming and may require expertise.
* The method may not be suitable for problems with a large number of blocks, as the computational cost of updating all blocks in parallel can be high.
* The comparison with existing methods is limited to two applications, and it would be beneficial to see a more comprehensive comparison with other methods and applications.
Overall, the paper is well-written and provides a significant contribution to the field of optimization. The proposed method has the potential to be widely used in practice, and the theoretical guarantees provided in the paper provide a strong foundation for its use.
