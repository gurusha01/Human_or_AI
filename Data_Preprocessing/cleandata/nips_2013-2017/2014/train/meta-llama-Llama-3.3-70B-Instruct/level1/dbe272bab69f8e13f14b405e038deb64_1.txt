This paper presents a novel interpretation of the generalized linear model (GLM) for neural spike trains, framing it as a biophysically inspired, yet highly constrained, synaptic conductance-based model. The authors then propose a more realistic and flexible conductance-based point process model (CBSM) that relaxes these constraints, allowing for independent excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs. The CBSM is shown to capture neural responses more accurately than the standard GLM and enables the estimation of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic conductances from extracellularly recorded spike trains.
The paper's strengths include its clear and well-organized presentation, making it easy to follow and understand the authors' arguments. The theoretical contributions are significant, providing a new perspective on the GLM and introducing a more realistic model of neural responses. The results, both from simulations and real neural data, demonstrate the CBSM's improved performance and ability to estimate synaptic conductances accurately.
The weaknesses of the paper are relatively minor. One potential issue is the lack of concavity guarantees for the log-likelihood of the CBSM, which may lead to difficulties in optimization. However, the authors address this concern by using numerical optimization methods and demonstrating their effectiveness. Another potential limitation is the use of a simplified model for the conductance nonlinearities, which may not capture the full complexity of real neural systems.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper presents a novel and significant theoretical contribution to the field of neural modeling.
* The CBSM is shown to outperform the standard GLM in capturing neural responses and estimating synaptic conductances.
* The results are well-supported by both simulations and real neural data.
* The paper is clearly and well-organized, making it easy to follow and understand.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The lack of concavity guarantees for the log-likelihood of the CBSM may lead to difficulties in optimization.
* The use of a simplified model for the conductance nonlinearities may not capture the full complexity of real neural systems.
* The paper may benefit from additional discussions on the limitations and potential extensions of the CBSM.
Overall, I believe that the paper's strengths outweigh its weaknesses, and it makes a significant contribution to the field of neural modeling. I recommend acceptance, with minor revisions to address the potential limitations and concerns mentioned above.
