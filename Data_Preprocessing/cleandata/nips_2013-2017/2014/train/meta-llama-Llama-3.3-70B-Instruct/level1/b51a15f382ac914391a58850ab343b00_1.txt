This paper proposes a Generalized Unsupervised Manifold Alignment (GUMA) method to build connections between different but correlated datasets without any known correspondences. The method is based on the assumption that datasets of the same theme usually have similar manifold structures. The authors formulate the problem as an explicit integer optimization problem, considering structure matching and preserving criteria, as well as feature comparability of corresponding points in the mutual embedding space.
The paper is well-written and clearly organized, making it easy to follow. The authors provide a thorough review of previous work on manifold alignment, highlighting the limitations of existing methods and motivating the need for a new approach. The proposed method is novel and addresses the key challenges of manifold alignment, including the lack of correspondences between datasets and the need for efficient optimization.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a new and effective method for unsupervised manifold alignment, which can simultaneously discover and align manifold structures without predefining local neighborhood structures.
* The use of an efficient optimization algorithm, which extends the Frank-Wolfe algorithm to approximately seek for optima along the descent path of the relaxed objective function.
* The demonstration of the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed method through extensive experiments on dataset matching, video face recognition, and visual domain adaptation.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The complexity of the optimization problem, which may make it challenging to scale to large datasets.
* The need for careful tuning of hyperparameters, such as the balance parameters γf and γp, to achieve good performance.
* The lack of theoretical analysis of the convergence and optimality of the proposed algorithm.
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel and effective method for unsupervised manifold alignment, which addresses key challenges in the field.
* The method is demonstrated to be effective and practicable through extensive experiments on various applications.
* The paper is well-written and clearly organized, making it easy to follow and understand.
Arguments con acceptance:
* The complexity of the optimization problem may limit the scalability of the method to large datasets.
* The need for careful tuning of hyperparameters may make it challenging to achieve good performance in practice.
* The lack of theoretical analysis of the convergence and optimality of the proposed algorithm may raise concerns about the robustness and reliability of the method.
Overall, I believe that the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of manifold alignment and is worthy of acceptance. However, I would like to see more theoretical analysis and experimentation to further demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.
