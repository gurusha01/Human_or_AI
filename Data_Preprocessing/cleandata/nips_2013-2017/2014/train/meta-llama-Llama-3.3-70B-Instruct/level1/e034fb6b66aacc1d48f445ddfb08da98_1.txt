This paper proposes a general framework for learning distributed representations of attributes, which are characteristics of text that can be jointly learned with word embeddings. The authors introduce a third-order model where word context and attribute vectors interact multiplicatively to predict the next word in a sequence, leading to the notion of conditional word similarity. The paper is well-written, and the ideas are clearly presented, making it easy to follow.
The strengths of this paper include its originality, as it proposes a novel approach to learning attribute representations. The experiments are also well-designed, and the results are impressive, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed framework on various NLP tasks, including sentiment classification, cross-lingual document classification, and blog authorship attribution. The use of a tensor decomposition to model the interactions between words and attributes is also a significant contribution.
However, there are some weaknesses to the paper. One potential issue is that the model may be sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters, such as the number of factors in the tensor decomposition. The authors do not provide a thorough analysis of the hyperparameter sensitivity, which could be an important consideration in practice. Additionally, the paper could benefit from more comparisons to other state-of-the-art models, particularly in the cross-lingual document classification task.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of the work. The paper is also well-organized, and the writing is clear and concise.
The originality of the paper is one of its strongest aspects. The proposed framework is novel and differs significantly from previous contributions. The authors provide a clear explanation of how their work differs from previous research, and the related work is adequately referenced.
The significance of the paper is also high. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework can achieve strong performance on a wide range of NLP tasks, and the ideas presented in the paper have the potential to be used in other areas of NLP research. The paper provides unique insights into the notion of conditional word similarity and how it can be used to improve NLP models.
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel and original framework for learning attribute representations.
* The experiments are well-designed, and the results are impressive.
* The paper provides a clear explanation of the ideas and how they differ from previous research.
