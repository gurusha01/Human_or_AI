This paper presents a statistical decision-theoretic framework for social choice, which views the decision to be made on behalf of a system of agents as a statistical decision problem. The authors propose a general framework that couples a statistical ranking model with an explicit decision space and loss function, and adopt Bayesian estimators as social choice mechanisms. The paper focuses on two parametric ranking models, the Mallows model and the Condorcet model, and evaluates the Bayesian estimators for these models with respect to various normative properties, including anonymity, neutrality, monotonicity, and computational complexity.
The paper's main contribution is the introduction of a statistical decision-theoretic framework for social choice, which provides a principled methodology for the design and analysis of new voting rules. The authors show that the Bayesian estimator for the Condorcet model satisfies some desired properties, such as anonymity, neutrality, and monotonicity, and can be computed in polynomial time. In contrast, the Bayesian estimator for the Mallows model is PNP||-hard, which means that it is at least NP-hard.
The paper also compares the asymptotic outcomes of the two Bayesian estimators with the Kemeny rule, and shows that when the data is generated from the Mallows model, all three methods are equal asymptotically almost surely. However, when the data is generated from the Condorcet model, the Bayesian estimator for the Condorcet model is different from the other two with non-negligible probability.
The strengths of the paper include its novel approach to social choice, its thorough evaluation of the Bayesian estimators, and its comparison with existing voting rules. The paper is well-written and well-organized, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their framework and results.
The weaknesses of the paper include the complexity of the proofs, which may be difficult to follow for non-experts. Additionally, the paper assumes a uniform prior distribution, which may not be realistic in all scenarios. The authors also note that the Bayesian estimator for the Mallows model is PNP||-hard, which may limit its practical applicability.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper presents a novel and interesting approach to social choice, which has the potential to contribute to the field.
* The authors provide a thorough evaluation of the Bayesian estimators, including their normative properties and computational complexity.
* The paper compares the Bayesian estimators with existing voting rules, which provides a useful perspective on their performance.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The proofs are complex and may be difficult to follow for non-experts.
* The paper assumes a uniform prior distribution, which may not be realistic in all scenarios.
* The Bayesian estimator for the Mallows model is PNP||-hard, which may limit its practical applicability.
Overall, I recommend accepting the paper, as it presents a novel and interesting approach to social choice, and provides a thorough evaluation of the Bayesian estimators. However, the authors should consider revising the paper to make the proofs more accessible to non-experts, and to discuss the limitations of their approach in more detail.
