This paper presents a novel approach to the algorithm selection problem by applying the framework of rational metareasoning, which is a theoretical framework from artificial intelligence. The authors derive a mathematical theory of how people should choose between cognitive strategies and test its predictions in a behavioral experiment. The paper is well-written, and the ideas are clearly presented, making it easy to follow.
The paper's main strength is its ability to bridge the gap between computer science and cognitive science. The authors successfully apply the rational metareasoning framework to the algorithm selection problem and demonstrate its effectiveness in a behavioral experiment. The results show that people quickly learn to adaptively choose between cognitive strategies, and their choices are consistent with the model's predictions but inconsistent with previous theories of human strategy selection.
The paper also has several other strengths. The authors provide a thorough review of the related work in both computer science and cognitive science, which helps to situate their contribution in the broader context. The experimental design is well-thought-out, and the results are carefully analyzed. The paper also raises important questions about the nature of human intelligence and how it can be improved.
However, there are some weaknesses to the paper. One potential limitation is that the experiment is limited to a specific domain (sorting algorithms), and it is unclear how well the results will generalize to other domains. Additionally, the paper assumes that people's strategy selection is based on rational metareasoning, which may not always be the case. The authors acknowledge this limitation and suggest that future research should investigate human strategy selection learning in more ecological domains.
Another potential weakness is that the paper does not provide a clear comparison with other approaches to algorithm selection. While the authors mention that their approach outperforms existing methods, they do not provide a detailed comparison of the different approaches.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the ideas are clearly presented. The authors make a significant contribution to the field by applying the rational metareasoning framework to the algorithm selection problem and demonstrating its effectiveness in a behavioral experiment.
