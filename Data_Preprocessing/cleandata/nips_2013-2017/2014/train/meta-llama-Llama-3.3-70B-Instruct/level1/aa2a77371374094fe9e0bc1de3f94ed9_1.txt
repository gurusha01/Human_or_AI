This paper proposes a unified low-rank tensor learning framework for multivariate spatio-temporal analysis, which can efficiently incorporate different properties in spatio-temporal data, such as spatial clustering and shared structure among variables. The framework is applied to cokriging and forecasting tasks, and an efficient greedy algorithm is developed to solve the resulting optimization problem with convergence guarantee.
The paper is well-written and clearly organized, with a good balance between theoretical development and empirical evaluation. The authors provide a thorough review of existing work in the area and clearly motivate the need for a new approach. The proposed framework is novel and has the potential to make a significant impact in the field.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposed framework is general and can be applied to various spatio-temporal analysis tasks, including cokriging and forecasting.
* The greedy algorithm developed to solve the optimization problem is efficient and has a convergence guarantee.
* The empirical evaluation is thorough and demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method on both synthetic and real-world datasets.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes that the data is linearly correlated, which may not always be the case in practice.
* The proposed framework may not be scalable to very large datasets due to the computational complexity of the greedy algorithm.
* The paper could benefit from more detailed analysis of the theoretical properties of the proposed framework, such as the consistency and asymptotic normality of the estimates.
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel and general framework for multivariate spatio-temporal analysis.
* The empirical evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method on various datasets.
* The paper has the potential to make a significant impact in the field of spatio-temporal analysis.
Arguments con acceptance:
* The paper assumes linearity of the data, which may not always be the case in practice.
* The computational complexity of the greedy algorithm may limit the scalability of the proposed framework to very large datasets.
* The paper could benefit from more detailed theoretical analysis of the proposed framework.
Overall, I recommend accepting the paper with minor revisions to address the weaknesses mentioned above. The paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of spatio-temporal analysis, and the proposed framework is novel and well-motivated. With some revisions to address the limitations and provide more detailed theoretical analysis, the paper can be even stronger.
