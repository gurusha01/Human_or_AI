This paper proposes a new norm, called the scaled latent trace norm, for multitask learning problems where tasks are indexed by multiple dimensions. The authors argue that existing norms, such as the overlapped trace norm and the latent trace norm, are not optimal in this setting, particularly when the dimensions or multilinear rank are heterogeneous. The scaled latent trace norm is designed to recognize the mode with the lowest rank relative to its dimension, which is shown to lead to competitive sample complexities in various settings.
The paper provides a thorough analysis of the excess risk of the proposed norm, as well as the existing norms, through their Rademacher complexities. The results are presented in a clear and concise manner, with detailed proofs and derivations provided in the appendices. The authors also provide an extensive experimental evaluation of the proposed norm on both synthetic and real-world data sets, demonstrating its effectiveness in various multitask learning settings.
The strengths of the paper include:
* A clear and well-motivated introduction to the problem of multitask learning with multiple dimensions
* A thorough analysis of the excess risk of the proposed norm, as well as the existing norms
* An extensive experimental evaluation of the proposed norm on both synthetic and real-world data sets
* A clear and concise presentation of the results, with detailed proofs and derivations provided in the appendices
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes a certain level of familiarity with tensor notation and multilinear algebra, which may make it difficult for some readers to follow
* The experimental evaluation could be more comprehensive, with additional comparisons to other state-of-the-art methods
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the implications of the results, and how they relate to existing work in the field
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication, as it presents a significant contribution to the field of multitask learning and provides a thorough analysis of the proposed norm. However, I would suggest that the authors address the weaknesses mentioned above, particularly with regards to the experimental evaluation and the discussion of the implications of the results.
