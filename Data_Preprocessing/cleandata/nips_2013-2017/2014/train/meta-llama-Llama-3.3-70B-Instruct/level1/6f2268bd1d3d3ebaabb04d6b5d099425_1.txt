This paper presents a novel approach to joint clustering and outlier detection using an extension of the facility location formulation. The authors propose a Lagrangian relaxation of the integer programming problem, which is solved using a subgradient method. The resulting algorithm is shown to be equivalent to a linear programming relaxation and is provably scalable and efficient.
The paper is well-written and clearly explains the problem formulation, the Lagrangian relaxation, and the subgradient method. The authors also provide a thorough analysis of the algorithm's convergence and quality, including a comparison with other methods such as k-means-- and affinity propagation. The experimental results on synthetic and real data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
The strengths of the paper include:
* A clear and concise problem formulation that combines clustering and outlier detection
* A novel and efficient algorithm for solving the problem using Lagrangian relaxation and subgradient method
* A thorough analysis of the algorithm's convergence and quality
* Experimental results that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes that the number of outliers is known, which may not always be the case in practice
* The algorithm requires a careful choice of the step size function, which can affect its performance
* The paper could benefit from more comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods for clustering and outlier detection
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of clustering and outlier detection, and the proposed method has the potential to be widely applicable. The authors have demonstrated the effectiveness of their approach through thorough analysis and experimental results.
