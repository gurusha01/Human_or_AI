This paper proposes a novel signal synthesis model with low-rank time-frequency structure, which bridges the gap between time-frequency synthesis and traditional nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) approaches. The model, called Low-Rank Time-Frequency Synthesis (LRTFS), is a generative probabilistic model that represents a signal as a sum of layers with their own time resolution and latent low-rank structure.
The paper relates to previous work on NMF and Gaussian Composite Models (GCMs), which have been used for audio signal processing applications such as music decomposition and speech enhancement. The authors argue that their approach improves upon these previous methods by providing a generative model of the raw signal itself, rather than just its short-time Fourier transform (STFT).
The strengths of the paper include its clear and well-organized presentation, as well as its thorough evaluation of the proposed model on two audio signal processing tasks: music decomposition and speech enhancement. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the LRTFS model in decomposing signals into meaningful components and improving speech quality in noisy environments.
The weaknesses of the paper include the fact that the maximum marginal likelihood estimation (MMLE) approach is not scalable to large signal processing applications, and that the estimation of the hyperparameter λ is not well addressed. Additionally, the paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with other state-of-the-art methods in the field.
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel and well-motivated model that addresses a significant gap in the field of signal processing.
* The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model on two relevant audio signal processing tasks.
* The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with clear explanations of the proposed model and its relationship to previous work.
Arguments con acceptance:
* The MMLE approach is not scalable to large signal processing applications, which limits its practical usefulness.
* The estimation of the hyperparameter λ is not well addressed, which could impact the performance of the proposed model.
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with other state-of-the-art methods in the field, to better establish its contributions and limitations.
Overall, I believe that the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of signal processing and is well-suited for publication at NIPS. However, the authors should address the limitations of the MMLE approach and provide a more detailed comparison with other state-of-the-art methods to strengthen their results. 
Quality: 8/10
The paper is technically sound, and the proposed model is well-motivated and clearly explained. However, the MMLE approach is not scalable, and the estimation of λ is not well addressed.
Clarity: 9/10
The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with clear explanations of the proposed model and its relationship to previous work.
Originality: 8/10
The paper proposes a novel model that addresses a significant gap in the field of signal processing. However, the idea of using low-rank time-frequency structures is not entirely new.
Significance: 8/10
The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed model on two relevant audio signal processing tasks, which is significant for the field of signal processing. However, the limitations of the MMLE approach and the lack of comparison with other state-of-the-art methods reduce the significance of the results.
