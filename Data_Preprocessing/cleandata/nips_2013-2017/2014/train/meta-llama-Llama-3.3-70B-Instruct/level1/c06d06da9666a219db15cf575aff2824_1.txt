This paper presents a new method for recovering the identities, amplitudes, and translations of waveforms that compose a signal. The method, called Continuous Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (COMP), is an extension of the Continuous Basis Pursuit (CBP) algorithm, which is a technique for sparse recovery. The authors introduce a new basis derived from a singular value decomposition (SVD) and use a greedy approach to recover the waveforms. The method is tested on simulated and neural data, where it shows gains over CBP in both speed and accuracy.
The paper is well-written and clearly explains the background and motivation for the research. The authors provide a thorough review of previous work in the area, including the CBP algorithm and other sparse recovery techniques. The presentation of the new method is clear and easy to follow, and the authors provide a detailed explanation of the algorithm and its components.
The strengths of the paper include the introduction of a new basis derived from SVD, which is shown to improve the performance of CBP, and the use of a greedy approach, which is faster and more accurate than CBP. The authors also provide a thorough evaluation of the method on simulated and neural data, which demonstrates its effectiveness.
The weaknesses of the paper include the fact that the method is limited to signals that can be represented as a sparse sum of translated and scaled copies of waveforms. Additionally, the authors do not provide a thorough analysis of the computational complexity of the method, which could be an important consideration for large-scale applications.
In terms of the criteria for evaluation, the paper scores well on quality, as the method is technically sound and well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The paper also scores well on clarity, as the writing is clear and easy to follow. The originality of the paper is high, as the authors introduce a new basis and a new greedy approach that improves upon previous methods. The significance of the paper is also high, as the method has the potential to be used in a variety of applications, including spike sorting and neural data analysis.
