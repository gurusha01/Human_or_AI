This paper introduces a novel sampling algorithm for Markov chain Monte Carlo-based Bayesian inference for factorial hidden Markov models (FHMMs). The algorithm, called Hamming ball sampling, is based on an auxiliary variable construction that restricts the model space, allowing for iterative exploration in polynomial time. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through simulated and real data examples, comparing it to standard block Gibbs sampling methods.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem of inference in FHMMs. They also provide a thorough review of existing methods, including the limitations of conditional Gibbs samplers. The proposed Hamming ball sampling algorithm is well-motivated, and the authors provide a detailed description of the method, including its extensions to more general cases.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The introduction of a novel sampling algorithm that addresses the limitations of existing methods
* A clear and concise presentation of the problem and the proposed solution
* A thorough evaluation of the method through simulated and real data examples
* The provision of extensions to more general cases, including non-binary factor chains and asymmetric local moves
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The method may not be applicable to all types of FHMMs, and the authors could provide more discussion on the limitations of their approach
* The evaluation of the method is primarily based on simulated and real data examples, and more theoretical analysis of the method's properties would be beneficial
* The authors could provide more comparison to other existing methods, such as variational inference, to demonstrate the advantages of their approach
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the proposed Hamming ball sampling algorithm is a significant contribution to the field of Bayesian inference for FHMMs. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through simulated and real data examples, and the method has the potential to be applied to a wide range of problems.
