This paper proposes a novel approach to locally weighted regression (LWR) by combining the strengths of Gaussian process regression (GPR) and LWR. The authors introduce Local Gaussian Regression (LGR), a probabilistic framework that retains the fast incremental training of LWR while providing a global generative model. The key idea is to localize the contribution of each local model towards the global fit of the training data, rather than localizing the training error of individual data points.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the background and motivation of the work. The technical contributions are sound, and the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through empirical evaluations on several synthetic and real robot datasets.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the background and motivation of the work.
* The technical contributions are sound, and the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through empirical evaluations.
* The paper is well-organized, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the proposed approach.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes a significant amount of background knowledge in machine learning and robotics, which may make it difficult for non-experts to follow.
* The authors could provide more detailed explanations of the mathematical derivations and the implementation details of the proposed approach.
* The paper could benefit from more comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods and a more detailed analysis of the results.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the background and motivation of the work. The technical contributions are sound, and the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through empirical evaluations.
