This paper proposes a novel prior formulation, the structured spike and slab prior, which allows for the incorporation of prior knowledge about the sparsity pattern in sparse signal recovery problems. The prior is based on a Gaussian process imposed on the spike and slab probabilities, enabling the encoding of prior information using generic covariance functions. The authors also provide a Bayesian inference scheme based on expectation propagation for the proposed model.
The paper is well-written and clearly explains the motivation behind the proposed model. The authors relate their work to previous research in the field, including the use of sparsity-promoting priors, group sparsity approaches, and Markov random fields. The proposed model is shown to be flexible and able to capture complex sparsity patterns, and the authors demonstrate its effectiveness through numerical experiments on synthetic data.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel prior formulation that can incorporate prior knowledge about the sparsity pattern, which is a significant contribution to the field of sparse signal recovery.
* The development of a Bayesian inference scheme based on expectation propagation, which is a widely used and effective method for approximate inference.
* The demonstration of the effectiveness of the proposed model through numerical experiments on synthetic data, including comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The computational complexity of the proposed algorithm, which scales as O(D^3) and may be prohibitively expensive for large-scale problems.
* The need for a low-rank approximation of the prior covariance matrix, which may not always be accurate and may require careful tuning of the hyperparameters.
* The lack of a clear scheme for learning the structure of the sparsity pattern, which is an important aspect of the proposed model.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel and significant contribution to the field of sparse signal recovery.
* The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model through numerical experiments on synthetic data.
* The paper is well-written and clearly explains the motivation and technical details of the proposed model.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The computational complexity of the proposed algorithm may be prohibitively expensive for large-scale problems.
* The need for a low-rank approximation of the prior covariance matrix may not always be accurate and may require careful tuning of the hyperparameters.
* The lack of a clear scheme for learning the structure of the sparsity pattern may limit the applicability of the proposed model.
Overall, I believe that the paper is a significant contribution to the field of sparse signal recovery and deserves to be accepted. However, the authors should be encouraged to address the weaknesses of the paper, including the computational complexity and the need for a clear scheme for learning the structure of the sparsity pattern.
