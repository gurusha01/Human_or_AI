This paper proposes a novel learning algorithm called expectation loss SVM (e-SVM) that can handle situations where the labels of training data are continuous values within a bounded interval. The authors apply this method to segment proposal classification tasks and extend it to learn segment classifiers under weak supervision, where only bounding box annotations are available. The paper presents experiments on two major computer vision tasks: semantic segmentation and object detection, achieving state-of-the-art object detection performance on the PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset.
The paper relates to previous work at NIPS and elsewhere, particularly in the areas of weakly supervised learning and weighted SVMs. The authors discuss the limitations of existing methods, such as Support Vector Classification (SVC) and Support Vector Regression (SVR), and demonstrate how their e-SVM approach can outperform these methods in segment proposal classification tasks.
The strengths of the paper include its novel approach to handling continuous labels, its ability to extend to weak supervision, and its impressive experimental results on object detection. The authors also provide a clear and well-organized presentation of their method, including a detailed description of the expectation loss SVM model and its optimization algorithm.
However, there are some weaknesses to the paper. One potential limitation is that the method relies on the quality of the segment proposals, which may not always be accurate. Additionally, the authors could provide more analysis on the choice of regularization term and its impact on the performance of the latent e-SVM model.
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The paper presents a novel and effective approach to handling continuous labels in segment proposal classification tasks.
* The method can be extended to weak supervision, making it more practical for large-scale datasets.
* The experimental results on object detection are impressive, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset.
Arguments con acceptance:
* The method relies on the quality of the segment proposals, which may not always be accurate.
* The choice of regularization term and its impact on the performance of the latent e-SVM model could be further analyzed.
* The paper could benefit from more comparisons to other related methods, such as Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) and weighted SVMs.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of computer vision, and its strengths outweigh its weaknesses. With some minor revisions to address the limitations, the paper is ready for acceptance.
