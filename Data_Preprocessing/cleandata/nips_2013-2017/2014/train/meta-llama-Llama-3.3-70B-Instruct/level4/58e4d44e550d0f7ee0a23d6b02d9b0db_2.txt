This manuscript examines the lower bound of space complexity for a particular streaming algorithm, which aims to approximate matrix A using AR^\dagR, where R^\dag denotes the pseudo-inverse of matrix R, with the rows of A presented sequentially in an arbitrary order. The investigated problem is intriguing, and the paper provides an impressive improvement in the space lower bound compared to existing research. As the primary contribution of this paper is the enhanced lower bound, it is predominantly theoretical, making it challenging to follow in its entirety. Many proofs are relegated to the supplementary materials, and while I reviewed the paper, I did not scrutinize every detail; however, the presented proofs appear sound. In terms of quality and significance, I believe this paper surpasses the NIPS acceptance threshold. My primary concern is the placement of numerous proofs in the supplementary file, which hinders the paper's readability. A minor suggestion is to revise the proof of Lemma 6, potentially by removing the phrase "expanding the square" from the lengthy equation. Overall, this is a solid theoretical paper that advances the lower bound of space complexity for low-rank approximation in streaming scenarios, although its readability could be enhanced by reorganizing the presentation of proofs.
