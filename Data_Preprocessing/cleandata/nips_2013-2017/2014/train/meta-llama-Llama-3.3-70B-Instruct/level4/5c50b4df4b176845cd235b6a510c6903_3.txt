The development of voting rules can be approached in a systematic manner by considering the underlying statistical decision-making model. A notable research direction in computational social choice, as seen in the work of Conitzer and Sandholm, involves identifying voting rules that emerge as the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) in specific settings. This submission presents an inverse approach, where a statistical model comprising a prior distribution over the ground truth and a loss function is posited, and the optimal voting rule that minimizes expected loss is derived. The resulting rule is then analyzed to determine its properties and behavior.
The authors apply this framework to two variants of the Mallows model, which differ in their assumption about the ground truth - whether it must be a consistent linear ordering or not. In both models, pairwise orderings are independently flipped according to a noise parameter, introducing randomness into the decision-making process. The derived voting rules exhibit distinct characteristics that set them apart from well-established rules. A comprehensive analysis of these new rules is conducted along three key dimensions: firstly, the standard properties they satisfy, such as monotonicity; secondly, their behavior in the limit of a large number of independent and identically distributed inputs, compared to the Kemeny rule; and thirdly, the computational complexity associated with their implementation, which is found to be challenging when the ground truth is a linear order, but tractable otherwise.
Although the individual findings may not be groundbreaking, the overarching concept is intriguing, and the cumulative results provide a detailed examination of a natural instantiation of the proposed framework. The thorough investigation of this approach yields a valuable contribution to the field, even if the specific results may not be revolutionary.
