This paper explores a group-theoretic perspective on penalized likelihood functions within vector spaces, demonstrating that commonly employed regularization terms, such as L1-, L2-, and L_infty-norms, can be viewed as specific instances of "orbit regularization". This generalized framework also suggests novel, reasonable forms of regularization that exhibit desirable properties when optimized using conditional and projected gradient algorithms.
Quality:
The research is of high quality, with thorough citations of relevant literature, including both foundational and recent works.
Clarity:
The presentation is outstanding, featuring carefully chosen notation that adheres to conventional standards. Definitions are clear, and the paper is engaging and relatively accessible, despite its abstract subject matter.
However, the paper does not conform to the NIPS guidelines for section headings and reference styles. Additionally, there are minor errors, such as the typo "klowledge" at Line 035, and the inconsistent placement of periods in definitions and propositions (e.g., Def 5, Prop 6).
Originality:
While the proposed perspective appears to be novel within the machine learning community, the underlying mathematical concepts are not entirely new, with some results (e.g., Propositions 11 and 12) drawing from earlier works, such as those by Eaton (1984) and Hardy et al. (1952). The paper could more effectively highlight its unique contributions.
Significance:
The impact of this work is uncertain, as it is unclear how it advances the state of the art in machine learning practice. Although having multiple efficient regularization forms is beneficial, the lack of an objective method to select the best form for a given problem limits the potential for significant advancements in the field. Nevertheless, the paper presents a well-organized, meticulously prepared perspective that may enhance our understanding of likelihood regularization in machine learning problems with linear structures.
