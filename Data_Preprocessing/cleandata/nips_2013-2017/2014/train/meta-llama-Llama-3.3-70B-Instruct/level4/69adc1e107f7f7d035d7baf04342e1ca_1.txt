The authors tackle the challenge of mz-transportability, which involves deducing a causal relationship R in a target domain by leveraging causal knowledge acquired from multiple source domains with limited experimental data. 
In the target domain, only observational data is available, which is insufficient on its own to infer R.
The key contributions of this paper are:
1. Establishing a necessary and sufficient condition to determine when causal effects in the target domain can be estimated from the available information.
2. Providing a proof that the previously proposed TR^mz algorithm for computing the transport formula is complete.
3. Demonstrating that the do-calculus is complete for establishing the mz-transportability of causal effects.
*Quality & Clarity:
This paper is primarily theoretical, and the authors provide strong support for their claims. The organization and presentation are clear, although the proofs and claims can be complex and challenging to follow at times, such as on page 6. However, this complexity is likely due to the advanced theoretical analysis rather than poor presentation.
To improve the paper, I suggest:
- Providing a definition for "a maximal root set" in Definition 4, similar to the one in [21].
- Modifying Definition 5 to include "(called an hedge for P_x(y))" for clarity.
- Offering a more rigorous definition of "an hedge" after Definition 4, rather than including it in Definition 5.
- Clarifying the meaning of "separable".
- Presenting complex concepts in a simpler manner, if possible.
*Originality & Significance:
The paper builds upon the NIPS 2013 paper "[1] Transportability from Multiple Environments with Limited Experiments", which is adequately referenced. The current paper significantly advances the field by providing conditions for the complete characterization of transportability, proving the completeness of TR^mz, and demonstrating the completeness of do-calculus for mz-transportability. 
To enhance the paper, I recommend:
- Explicitly stating at the beginning of Section 3 that the first part of this section (page 4) is a repetition from [1] or other publications.
- Adding a reference to [1] for equation (2), explaining how it was derived.
Additional comments:
- The abstract's third line could be rephrased to clarify that "limited experimental data" refers only to the target domain.
- The motivation's first line may benefit from adding "that" after "experiments" for better clarity.
- Various minor corrections and suggestions are provided throughout the paper to improve readability and accuracy.
- The contribution of this paper is significant for NIPS, despite the complexity of the definitions, theorems, and proofs, which can make it challenging to understand all the details.
