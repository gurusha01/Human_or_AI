Review - Summary:
The authors present a novel approach that combines trajectory optimization and policy learning for systems with unknown dynamics, approximated using linear local models. The proposed trajectory optimization algorithm is rooted in DDP/iLQG methods, where local linear models are assumed to be Gaussian and derived from samples obtained through previous policy solutions. The paper introduces an iLQG-based method that leverages these approximated local models, enabling optimization by constraining the changes in the modified iLQG solution using KL-divergence. Furthermore, the authors integrate their trajectory optimization method into the Guided Policy Search framework, allowing for the learning of richer parameterized policies through iterative swapping between trajectory optimization and policy learning steps. The effectiveness of the method is evaluated through simulations.
Quality:
This paper is of high caliber, with clear writing and a well-structured presentation. However, there are instances where the text relies heavily on prose, and support for certain statements is not immediately apparent. The paper's significance and interest to the robotics and robot learning community are notable, particularly due to its focus on "unknown dynamics." While the paper builds upon the contributions of [11, 12, 13], its evaluation is thorough and of high quality, with comparisons to several state-of-the-art methods. The simulated tasks are engaging and effectively demonstrate performance differences.
Clarity and Questions:
Certain sections of the paper lack clarity, and although relevant information may be present, it is not always easily accessible. 
1. It would be beneficial to define "unknown dynamics" and "hybrid" explicitly in the introduction. The term "unknown dynamics" may evoke a "model-free" connotation, but the paper does not identify as such. Instead, creating models from samples is typically considered a model-based approach, such as in PILCO. Using terms like "local Gaussian models" might be more precise.
2. The statement "parameterized policy never needs to be executed on the real system" (line 52) requires clarification. As understood, this implies using a Gaussian controller throughout the learning process and only learning the parameterized policy at the end, based on the Gaussian controller's findings. This seems to deviate from the GPS framework, where the parameterized policy is not directly influenced by trajectory optimization and vice versa.
3. The conclusion that the method "transforms a discontinuous deterministic problem into a smooth stochastic one" (line 59) is strong but not entirely convincing. A more intuitive explanation would be beneficial. Additionally, including experimental results on tasks involving real physical contact or impact would significantly strengthen the paper, as simulations with contact are challenging and local models may not capture discontinuities effectively.
4. The introduction of GMM for background dynamics distribution in Section 3.2 seems beneficial, but its importance is only clarified later (lines 400-401). Presenting the method as using a mixture of Gaussians to approximate unknown dynamics from the outset might avoid confusion.
5. The system's behavior under saturation, considering real-world actuation limits, is not addressed. Does saturation compromise the induction of Gaussian trajectory distributions when controller commands are saturated?
6. The finding that iLQG with a true model performs worse than the proposed method, which uses approximated linear models, is counterintuitive. An explanation for this phenomenon would be valuable.
Originality and Significance:
Although the paper is incremental relative to [11, 12, 13], its contribution is substantial. The concept of optimizing trajectories and designing controllers for systems with unknown dynamics is highly relevant to the robotics community and addresses a gap not previously covered by [11, 12, 13].
In general, the paper is well-written and accessible. It successfully applies the GPS framework to systems with unknown dynamics by utilizing local Gaussian models. While incremental, the idea is of significant interest to the robotics community.
