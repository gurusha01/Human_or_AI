This manuscript presents a method for reconstructing network topology from calcium imaging data using inverse covariance matrix estimation, with a key innovation being the application of a learned convolution filter to the calcium traces. The empirical results demonstrate that this filter substantially enhances reconstruction performance and reduces the time required for inferring connectivity in new datasets.

QUALITY
The overall approach appears to be sound, but there are several aspects that require clarification from the authors.
Firstly, the restriction of the convolution filter length to 10 time steps, with the learned filter peaking at time step 8, raises questions about whether the filter has sufficient "time lag space" to converge. It is unclear whether this restriction is due to computational limitations or if there are biophysical or empirical reasons for correlations to diminish after 10 time steps. The authors should provide a discussion on this point.
Secondly, while the study focuses on improving the inverse covariance method, a more comprehensive discussion on the inherent limitations of this method would be beneficial. For instance, the fact that only undirected graphs can be extracted is a significant restriction in the context of neural circuits.
Thirdly, the sensitivity of the reconstruction to the value of $\chi$ in Eq.7 is unclear. Specifically, how crucial is it to accurately estimate $\chi$, and how does the reconstruction performance generalize to datasets with significantly different sparsity levels than those assumed during training?
CLARITY
The manuscript is well-structured and clearly written.
It would be helpful to provide a brief description of the Kaggle dataset, including the availability of ground truth connectivity, at the beginning of the methods section. Additionally, clarifying the timescales for non-expert readers would be beneficial, such as explaining the meaning of "one time step" in the convolution filter and the x-axis labels (e.g., "time (20 ms)"). Defining AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve) would also improve clarity.
ORIGINALITY
Although I am not an expert in the specific literature on calcium imaging, it appears surprising that the application of convolution filters to calcium data prior to covariance estimation has not been explored previously. Nevertheless, the presented work is original and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Kaggle leaderboard.
SIGNIFICANCE
Estimating network topology has significant implications for neuroscience, particularly with the advent of whole-network imaging techniques. There is a clear need for statistical methods in this area. While this study provides state-of-the-art performance and speed, it essentially builds upon a known algorithm (L2-regularized inverse covariance estimation) without addressing its fundamental limitations, such as the implicit Gaussian assumption and undirected graph recovery. This manuscript is technically sound, well-written, and achieves state-of-the-art performance in topology extraction from calcium data, an important problem in neuroscience. However, my primary concern is the lack of a deeper understanding of why the learned convolution filter improves performance and generalizes well to other datasets. Additionally, the contribution appears to be an incremental addition to an existing algorithm.
