This manuscript presents a derivation of Pinsker's theorem for the normal means model, specifically addressing the scenario where quantized data is observed instead of the original data, thereby establishing a minimax lower bound. Additionally, it outlines a strategy for encoding and decoding that achieves this lower bound, effectively estimating mean parameters from quantized data.
The clarity of the writing and the practical utility of the results are notable strengths. Upon reviewing the proofs, they appear to be correct. However, as acknowledged by the authors, the proposed encoding-decoding method is computationally intensive. It would be intriguing to explore whether the findings from [12] and subsequent related research could be applied to develop more computationally efficient schemes.
One suggestion for improvement pertains to the title, which currently refers to 'quantized non-parametric estimation'. A more precise title might be 'quantized infinite Gaussian sequence model' or 'normal means model', as the paper focuses on these aspects. The reason for this suggestion is the lack of a rigorous proof demonstrating the equivalence, in the sense of LeCam and following the approach of Brown and Low (1996) for the unquantized case, between the quantized normal means model and non-parametric estimation problems within this work. Overall, the paper offers valuable theoretical contributions to a problem with practical relevance, and its clear presentation enhances its impact.
