The manuscript proposes a multi-task learning approach that integrates mid-level attributes and category semantics to enhance classification performance, particularly in one/few-shot learning scenarios. This is achieved through a sparse coding technique that extracts discriminative information for category identification while enabling generative modeling for new category discovery. The method's effectiveness is demonstrated on the Animals with attributes dataset, showcasing improved classification results.
However, upon closer examination, it becomes apparent that the paper combines various existing ideas from semantic models, discriminative embedding, multi-task learning, and sparse learning. Although the authors attempt to differentiate their work, the contribution in terms of a novel approach or algorithm is limited. The paper's reliance on recent terminology related to attributes and semantics seems to obscure the fact that it is essentially integrating different pieces of information about object categories, a concept that is not new.
In fact, existing deep learning methods have been able to achieve similar results without requiring manual specification of these information pieces. The vision community has also explored coarse-to-fine strategies for many years, which share similarities with the proposed approach. Furthermore, the idea of jointly performing discriminative and generative modeling has been present in the pattern recognition literature for at least three decades, as evident from references [Ref1-4]. The paper's use of existing sparse coding schemes, such as [14], which learns dictionaries in an unsupervised manner, is also not novel, as there are efforts that learn dictionaries discriminatively, such as [Ref5-6].
In light of these observations, it appears that the paper does not offer significant new or interesting contributions to the field. The concepts and techniques presented are largely covered by existing literature, which is not adequately referenced. As a result, the paper lacks substantial contributions to support its acceptance.
