The primary objective here is to determine a k-rank approximation of a matrix A of dimensions $n\times d$, where the rows are streamed one at a time. 
Notably, the algorithm proposed by Ghashami and Phillips, as presented at SODA in 2014, is demonstrated to be optimal, with a space complexity lower bound of $\Omega(dk/e)$, considering the constraints of word size.
The theoretical framework is established through a reduction to the Index problem, a well-known concept within communication complexity. The subsequent explanation is clear, well-structured, and technically robust. Upon formulating the problem within the authors' framework, the mathematical proofs follow standard procedures.
However, a significant concern arises regarding the impact and novelty of the results presented, particularly in comparison to those already established in the aforementioned SODA paper. This work confirms the tightness of the O(dk/e) space requirement for the low-rank matrix approximation algorithm in a streaming context, as initially proposed by Ghashami and Phillips. The paper is well-written and appears to be technically sound.
