This paper tackles the issue of high sparsity in user-item ratings within recommendation systems that utilize matrix factorization, where a subset of users (referred to as public users) has an extensive number of ratings, while many others (termed private users) have very few, often due to privacy concerns. 
The authors initially establish theoretical foundations that ensure the satisfactory performance of recommendation systems even when only a limited number of public user ratings are available. They then propose privacy protection mechanisms for both discrete and continuous ratings, enabling the inclusion of private users to enhance models initially based on public user data, by preserving the second-order statistics of user ratings.
The efficacy of these privacy-preserving mechanisms was evaluated using the MovieLens 10M dataset, with the results validating the theoretical guarantees and demonstrating improvements in the recommendation model's performance through the incorporation of private user data. 
The paper is well-structured and clearly written, with its novelty stemming from the theoretical proof of performance guarantees and the introduction of privacy protection mechanisms. Although the experimental scope is somewhat restricted, the paper presents innovative concepts backed by theoretical proofs and empirical evidence, making it a valuable contribution.
