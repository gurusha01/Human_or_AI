The manuscript is well-structured and presents a potentially groundbreaking finding, although its novelty may be more pronounced to non-experts in the field of streaming algorithms. The theoretical framework and Theorem 4, in particular, seem to be sound. 
In summary, this manuscript addresses the problem of low-rank "k" approximation of a matrix where the rows are streamed. A recent study (SODA 2014) proposed an algorithm for this task with a space complexity of O(dk/epsilon) words. The optimality of this bound remained an open question. This paper establishes a lower bound of \Omega(dk/epsilon), demonstrating that the existing bound is indeed optimal and that \Theta(dk/epsilon) words of space are required.
