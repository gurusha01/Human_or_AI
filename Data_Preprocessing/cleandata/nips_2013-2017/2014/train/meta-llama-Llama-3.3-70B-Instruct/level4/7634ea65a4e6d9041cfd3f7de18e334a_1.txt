This manuscript introduces a concise and innovative framework for incorporating structured sparsity into spike-and-slab models, alongside an expectation propagation algorithm designed for Bayesian inference. The text is well-organized and supplemented with engaging examples and comparative analyses against existing methods. While the field has seen prior research, the proposed methodology distinguishes itself through its simplicity and novelty.
