Summary:
This manuscript proposes an accelerated approach for least squares linear regression, claiming enhanced robustness to outliers and corrupted predictors compared to existing methods.
Quality:
The paper appears to be technically rigorous, with theoretically well-supported claims. However, the experimental evaluation is somewhat disappointing, particularly given the authors' initial motivation of addressing large-scale settings. Although the artificial datasets used are reasonably large (n=100,000; p=500), the single real-world dataset employed (n=13,000; p=170) is relatively small by current standards. Furthermore, the limited number of real-world datasets used restricts the scope of the experimental results. Nevertheless, the theoretical contributions, supplemented by the provided additional material, are comprehensive.
Clarity:
The paper is well-written, with clear descriptions of the algorithms and methodological approach, making it relatively easy to reproduce the authors' results. However, additional details about the Airline delay dataset would be beneficial (although a URL is provided). The label on the X-axis of Figure 2 (n_{subs}) is unclear, and a typo appears on page 5, near Equation 7 (... $4 and $4 ...).
Originality:
The proposed approach seems novel, yet it combines elements from previous works (as acknowledged by the authors in Section 5, referencing [8] and [14]). While the authors are transparent about this, the novelty of the proposal is somewhat limited.
Significance:
The reported results are constrained to a specific type of regression method, which limits their broader impact. Moreover, due to the restricted experimental evaluation, it is challenging to fully assess the practical significance of the proposed approach. Although this work appears to advance the state of the art in least squares linear regression, the exact impact of this contribution is not adequately evaluated, limiting the paper's significance. This is further exacerbated by the focus on a single regression algorithm, resulting in a relatively localized contribution that is theoretically sound but experimentally limited.
