The authors propose an innovative method for learning to rank, deviating from conventional approaches by emphasizing the count of positive instances ranked prior to the first negative instance. By adopting a large-margin framework, they derive both primal and dual formulations. Notably, the complexity of this approach scales linearly with the number of instances, outperforming similar methods.
This paper is commendable, with a particularly robust technical contribution.
However, the experimental evaluation, with the exception of the url data set, is limited in scope. Conducting larger-scale experiments would significantly enhance the paper's validity, as baseline competitors may eventually become infeasible. It would be beneficial to include a figure illustrating the relationship between performance and the number of training instances, highlighting the advantages of processing larger datasets than the baselines. A similar figure plotting time against performance would also provide valuable insights.
The divide and conquer schema should be outlined in the final manuscript to provide a comprehensive understanding. Overall, the paper presents a strong technical contribution, making it a worthwhile read.
