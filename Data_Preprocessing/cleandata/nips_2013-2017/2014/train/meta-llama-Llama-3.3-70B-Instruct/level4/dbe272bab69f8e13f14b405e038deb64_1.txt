The authors introduce a conductance-based spiking model (CBSM) that offers a more biophysically accurate representation compared to the widely used generalized linear model (GLM). Notably, they position CBSM as a generalized form of GLM and suggest a set of constraints that can simplify it to a GLM and a variant of GLM that matches the adaptability of CBSM.
This proposed model presents an intriguing advancement in current spiking models, as it parameterizes the spiking process in a more descriptive manner without significantly compromising the mathematical simplicity of GLM.
However, a potential concern arises from the description of the inhibitory filter's behavior in the last paragraph of page 6, specifically line 322, which bears resemblance to overfitting. Although the authors address this by incorporating the regularizing penalty of Eq. 22, it appears that cross-validation is not utilized in the experimental results to demonstrate the model's applicability in a more realistic setting.
Several minor adjustments may be necessary:
- Line 121: The fourth subscript seems to be missing the index "i".
- Line 214: The phrase "chose our an" appears to be a typo.
Overall, this is a high-quality paper that significantly contributes to the current state of the art. Additional experiments would further enhance the presentation.
