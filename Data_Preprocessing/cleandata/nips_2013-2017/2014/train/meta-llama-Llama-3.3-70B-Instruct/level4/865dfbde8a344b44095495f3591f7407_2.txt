The paper introduces stochastic variational inference (SVI) for Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), addressing the challenges posed by the chain-based dependence structure, which differs from the independence assumption in Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and the pairwise dependence in network models. Unlike network models, where subsampling has been handled in previous studies (Gopalan et al., 2012), HMMs require a different approach due to their chain-based dependence.
The authors propose a method to scale noisy subsample gradients for unbiased estimates and bound the error induced by updating only variables corresponding to subchain samples. They achieve this by augmenting subsampled subchains with additional observations, which enables incremental and efficient computation of the forward-backward algorithm. The proposed algorithm is applied to a large genomics dataset, demonstrating comparable performance to Variational Bayes (VB).
The strengths of the paper include:
* Clear and significant contributions through the development of an SVI algorithm for HMMs
* Well-written presentation of the methodology and results
However, there are some weaknesses:
* The lack of comparison to Johnson et al. (2014), which developed an algorithm for large collections of independent series, makes it difficult to assess the practical benefits of the proposed SVI algorithm
* The claim of "significant gains" in computation for the genomic data compared to the EM algorithm is not supported by runtime evidence
* The computational complexity of the batch versus SVI algorithm is not explicitly stated, although it is evaluated; it is assumed that the SVI algorithm still has quadratic per-iteration complexity in terms of states
* The worst-case cost when the subchain length (L) is poorly chosen is not clearly discussed; the algorithm requires a good choice of L and the number of chains per mini-batch, which is critical for the "buffering" algorithm to provide a good approximation. While the authors argue that this is not a concern, the evidence is based on simulated data and is not entirely convincing.
Overall, the paper presents a thorough development of SVI for HMMs, respecting the chain-based dependencies in long time-series data. However, the lack of comparison to prior SVI algorithms (Johnson et al., 2014) for collections of independent time-series data is a notable drawback.
