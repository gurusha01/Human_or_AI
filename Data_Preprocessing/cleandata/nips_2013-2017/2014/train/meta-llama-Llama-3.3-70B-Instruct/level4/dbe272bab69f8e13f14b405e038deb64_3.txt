The authors have enhanced a state space approach for inferring synaptic conductance, originally introduced as a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) based on a linear assumption in reference [8]. The key advancement in this work is the incorporation of nonlinear stimulus-induced changes in synaptic conductance into a dynamic model of neuronal membrane potential. This proposed method provides an interpretation of GLM in terms of a conductance-based model, enabling the inference of synaptic conductance and time series of inputs. The methodology appears robust, and I believe this paper warrants publication, contingent upon the authors revising the manuscript to address the following comments.
Major Comment:
The temporal profiles of the filters utilized in the simulation exhibit time scales of 30-50 ms, which seem unusually long compared to the commonly acknowledged time scales of biological conductance. I would like the authors to provide a rationale for this choice or redo the analysis using smaller time scales.
Minor Typos:
- Page 3: The notation "ge(t) Ei" should be corrected to "gi(t) Ei".
- Page 7: The repetition of "this" should be corrected.
Overall, the improvement of the state space method for inferring synaptic conductance, by offering a conductance-based model interpretation of GLM, has the potential to make a significant contribution, provided the issue of time scale is adequately discussed.
