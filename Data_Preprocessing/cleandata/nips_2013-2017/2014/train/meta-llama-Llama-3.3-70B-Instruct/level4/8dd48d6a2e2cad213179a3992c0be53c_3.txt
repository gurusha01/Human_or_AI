This manuscript introduces a comprehensive Bayesian framework that integrates max-margin constraints into clustering models, building upon the Regularized Bayesian inference technique established by Zhu et al. and adapting it for unsupervised learning scenarios. The authors illustrate the effectiveness of their approach through two distinct clustering models: a Dirichlet Process-based Gaussian Mixture Model (DP-GMM) and a cluster-topic model, both of which incorporate max-margin constraints. 
The paper is commendably clear and detailed in its presentation of the novel max-margin clustering approach and its model variants. However, further elaboration on the posterior inference section, particularly concerning the sampling complexity, would be beneficial since the practical performance of the method is heavily dependent on the efficiency of the sampler. The comparison of the two models with baseline systems and the analysis of their sensitivity to hyperparameters are also noteworthy aspects of the paper.
An alternative to the heuristic model selection method could be to adopt a non-parametric approach, estimating this during inference, potentially utilizing the existing heuristic as an informative prior. 
A point of clarification is needed: does "p" denote the dimensionality of the latent space, implying that the time complexity for DPGMM includes an additional cubic factor in "p"?
The improvement in clustering quality achieved by incorporating max-margin constraints into unsupervised Bayesian models is a positive finding. However, the datasets presented in Table 1 are relatively small, raising questions about the method's scalability to larger, more complex datasets. The integration of recent advancements in fast sampling techniques, such as randomization and approximation methods, could potentially enhance the inference speed and is worth considering, either as future work or within the related work section.
It would be informative to determine if the accuracy differences outlined in Table 2 are statistically significant, for instance, comparing S3VM and MMCTM for L=5,10, and providing the relevant statistical significance values.
Overall, the paper is well-structured and successfully extends the RegBayes framework to unsupervised settings. The demonstration of the new approach's utility through two clustering models, showing enhanced clustering quality with max-margin constraints, is a significant contribution.
