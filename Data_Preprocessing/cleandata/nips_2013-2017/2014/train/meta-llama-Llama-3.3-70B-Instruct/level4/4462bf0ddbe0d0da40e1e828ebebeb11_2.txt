The paper proposes an EM algorithm for learning Determinantal Point Processes, combining eigendecomposition of the kernel, optimization on the Stiefel manifold, representation of DPPs as mixtures of elementary DPPs, and lower-bounding the log-likelihood using Jensen's Inequality. The experimental results demonstrate favorable performance compared to the simpler "K-Ascent" scheme.
Quality: The method appears to be well-founded and believable, but the evaluation could be improved. The experiments are limited and do not compare the proposed approach to alternative subset selection methods, making it unclear what benefits the DPP approach provides.
Clarity: The writing is not particularly clear, with a somewhat sloppy and hard-to-follow presentation. Notation is often undefined or defined after being used, and the text is unnecessarily convoluted due to its process-oriented structure, which includes side remarks and discussions of alternative approaches. A clearer presentation of the developed method, followed by a separate discussion, would be preferable.
Originality: The paper appears to be original, as no similar work is known to me.
Significance: The derived method presents a solid advance and a useful contribution to the subset selection literature.
Details:
- On page 2, line 81, the marginal kernel K is used without prior definition. It would be helpful to specify what type of kernel qualifies as a marginal kernel.
- On page 2, line 100, V is not defined.
- On page 3, line 159, the statement "minimises the change to Frobenius norm" is unclear and could be rephrased as "chooses the closest (in Frobenius norm) PSD matrix to Q".
- Page 4 is difficult to understand, and instead of referencing [26], it would be beneficial to outline the simpler approach directly, avoiding the need for the reader to look up the more complex original method.
- On page 4, line 189, the term "weight" is unclear and requires definition.
- On page 7, line 324, the rationale behind equation (30) is unclear, and it would be helpful to explain why m_{ij} is not used and why the empirical covariance matrix could not have been used as the kernel for initialization. 
The paper presents a novel method for learning Determinantal Point Processes, which is assumed to be original. However, the write-up lacks clarity, and the experiments only compare the proposed method to other DPP methods, without considering alternative approaches.
