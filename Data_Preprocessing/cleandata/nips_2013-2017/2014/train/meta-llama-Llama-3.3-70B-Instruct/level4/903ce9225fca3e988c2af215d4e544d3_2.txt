The authors have adequately addressed my initial concerns, and I am satisfied with their revisions. Specifically, the issue with the proof of Theorem 1 can be resolved by adopting the authors' suggested choice of epsilon, although I find the introduction of the additional $Vt^{2/3}$ term in the second-to-last inequality to be unnecessary. Furthermore, after confirming that the "first part still holds," the authors can proceed directly to the case where $\epsilon = 1/4 \sqrt{K/\tilde{\Delta}T}$. Regarding line 424, while the authors' intention is clear, I see no justification for omitting the $T^{1/3}$ term, as it provides valuable information about the initial performance, and its exclusion could be misleading.
I appreciate the authors' efforts in correcting their derivations, and I am pleased to adjust my review scores accordingly.
Initially, I had provided a summary of the paper, which explored the multi-armed bandit problem in a non-stationary setting, introducing a quantity $VT$ that bounds the variation in reward distribution means. The authors derived a lower bound for the worst-case regret of any strategy in terms of $VT$, time horizon, and number of arms, and provided a matching upper bound for an epoch-variant of the Exp3 strategy, demonstrating a tight dependency on $V_T$.
In terms of quality and clarity, the paper was well-written in some parts but lacked clarity in others, particularly in the proof details and notation. My initial major concerns included:
- A perceived mistake in the proof of Theorem 1, specifically on line 119 in the appendix, where the second inequality seemed to not follow from the assumption $T\ge KV_T$.
- Difficulty in reconstructing the bound (a) on line 424 in the proof of Theorem 2, where the authors' assumption $VT\ge K^{-1}$ led to a linear dependence on $K$, rather than the claimed dependence on $(KVT)^{1/3}$.
I also provided suggestions for improvement, including:
- Aligning notation and nomenclature with related literature, such as introducing policies in a standard way.
- Emphasizing the importance of the two paragraphs following Theorem 2.
- Reorganizing the proof of Theorem 2 to be more naturally positioned.
- Clarifying the connection to reference [27] in a single section, such as the discussion.
The contribution was deemed original and significant, adding new understanding to the interface between stationary and non-stationary MAB problems, with potential practical interest. However, the paper's readability and structure were initially found to be lacking, with technical issues in the proofs, which have since been addressed.
