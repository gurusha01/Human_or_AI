This manuscript proposes a novel approach that integrates a coarse-to-fine cascade with pruning classifiers to accelerate the optimization of Markov Random Fields (MRFs). 
While the employed greedy pruning method appears intriguing, the paper lacks substantial theoretical and empirical evidence to substantiate the effectiveness of this heuristic. Furthermore, the applicability of the method is restricted to MRFs with piecewise smooth solutions. 
Certain sections of the paper require clarification. For instance, the description of the pruning matrix is ambiguous, particularly with regards to the definition of "active". The updating process of the pruning matrix in the algorithm is also not well-explained. To improve comprehension, I recommend that the authors provide a simplified example to illustrate the algorithm. Conversely, the introduction to the proposed approach in Section 1 is overly lengthy and contains redundant information. Figure 2 is also of limited informative value. 
The experimental results are interesting but require further clarification. Firstly, the comparison involves three algorithms, yet only one curve is presented in Figure 1. Given the multiple algorithms being compared, displaying only the ratio is insufficient. Secondly, the energy ratio is defined as the ratio of the current energy to the lowest computed energy by any strategy, which raises questions as to why it is less than 1 in numerous cases. 
Following author feedback: 
The authors have addressed some of the initial confusions in the manuscript. I expect the authors to rectify all typographical errors and address the concerns raised by the reviewers. Although I have revised my rating from 4 to 5, I still believe that the pruning method lacks theoretical justification. 
Additional comments on the experiments: 
- In column (d) of Figure 1, both curves in the 3rd row exhibit less than 96% agreement, contradicting the claim that "the agreement is never worse than 96%". 
- Consider relocating Figure 2 to the appendix and providing additional experiments or analysis on hyperparameter selection. The heuristics presented are interesting, but the manuscript suffers from a lack of clarity and weak theoretical and empirical support.
