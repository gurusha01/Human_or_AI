The paper presents max-margin Bayesian clustering (BMC), a novel approach that integrates the max-margin criterion into Bayesian clustering techniques. This is exemplified by the Dirichlet process max-margin Gaussian mixture, which relaxes the Gaussian assumption of traditional Dirichlet process Gaussian mixtures by incorporating max-margin posterior constraints, thereby enabling the inference of cluster numbers from data. The proposed techniques, including DPMMGM and MMCTM, are evaluated against various existing methods through several numerical experiments.
The paper effectively combines deterministic and Bayesian clustering approaches, addressing the limitations of each. Deterministic methods can handle constraints but struggle with inferring cluster numbers, whereas Bayesian techniques can infer cluster numbers but are less adept at handling constraints like the max-margin criterion.
Quality:
The BMC algorithm is notable for being the first extension of regularized Bayes inference to unsupervised clustering tasks. Moreover, the DPMMGM algorithm leverages max-margin constraints to relax the Gaussian assumptions inherent in standard DPGMM, introducing a significant new capability.
Clarity:
On page 4, the statement "The max-margin constraints take effects in the model via \tilde\phi_i's in (8)" lacks sufficient explanation within the paper, making it unclear why this statement holds true. The authors should provide more substantial support for such claims. 
Additionally, the phrase "Gausses in the pseudo likelihood would balance the clusters to some extent" on page 4 is imprecise, particularly with the use of "Gausses" and the vague conclusion "to some extent," which does not meet the precision expected in this type of publication.
A typo is found on page 6, where "controll" is misspelled.
Figure 2 on page 6 shows differing results between the two algorithms, but the discussion fails to adequately explain why DPMMGM's result is superior. The claim that DPGMM is more fragmented lacks significance in this context, and it appears that DPGMM might actually provide a better fit to the data, raising questions about what is lost by switching to DPMMGM.
The statement "thus driving the data points to collapse as well" on page 6 requires clarification. Furthermore, the discussion should be expanded to connect the intuition to figures 3(a)-(j), as the numerous figures and trends are challenging to interpret, making the conclusion "the results indeed follow our intuition" less obvious than claimed.
Originality:
Although the ideas presented seem original, a significant portion of section 3 on robust Bayesian max-margin clustering closely follows the techniques introduced in [17], particularly in the steps between equations (6)-(7)-(8). This similarity raises questions about the novelty and importance of the work, suggesting that the core ideas might have been previously established and are being reapplied to a new model formulation. Without further clarification, this impacts the perceived impact of the paper.
Significance:
The extensive numerical results demonstrate that DPMMGM outperforms DPGMM, and similarly, MMCTM outperforms SVM and S3VM, which are significant findings. However, the paper lacks theoretical statements on the performance or convergence of the algorithms, despite its comprehensive model development.
The paper explores an interesting topic and presents algorithms that perform well in numerical comparisons. Nonetheless, further clarification is needed to distinguish the technical approach from that in [17], which is crucial for assessing the paper's impact.
