The paper presents an innovative application of neural networks, specifically learning representations for symbolic expressions and discovering their mathematical identities. Although the expressions explored are somewhat restricted and it remains unclear whether this methodology can be generalized to more complex expressions, the paper is intriguing and has potential for positively impacting symbolic software libraries.
The problem formulation aims to identify expressions with reduced computational complexity; however, the algorithm does not explicitly enforce this constraint. It would be beneficial to explore potential strategies for limiting the search space to solutions that meet this criterion, acknowledging the non-trivial nature of this challenge.
Regarding the constraints outlined in Section 2, it is unclear whether the scheduler is the sole limiting factor for more intricate mathematical expressions. The inclusion of more formal analysis or empirical experiments to justify these restrictions would be welcome.
Furthermore, the paper's structure could be improved for better clarity and readability. A more detailed explanation of each stage would enhance the overall flow.
Additionally, it is essential to clarify whether there are constraints on the size of vectors or matrices. For instance, the expression for RBM-1 in the supplementary material appears to be invalid for certain parameter values (e.g., k=1, n=1).
Some minor errors were also noted, including typos on pages 332 ("show for"), 148 ("has contains"), 289 ("is is"), and 338 ("by be"). Overall, the paper introduces a novel and interesting concept, despite some limitations and areas for improvement.
