Summary: The authors propose a novel model of auto-associative memory in a rate-based neural network, incorporating biologically plausible constraints such as Dale's Law and non-saturating unit responses. Unlike previous models, this network encodes memories through synaptic modifications based on a gradient descent procedure, ensuring stable fixed points via a recently developed method. The authors demonstrate the model's effectiveness through simulations, showcasing slow network dynamics, stability, and robustness to perturbations and stochastic input noise. Notably, the trained network exhibits features consistent with experimental observations, including a synaptic weight distribution centered at zero with long tails and balanced excitatory and inhibitory inputs.
Review: This submission is a well-written, innovative contribution that will resonate with the scientific community. The authors provide a thorough review of the history of training neural networks for auto-associative tasks, highlighting key advancements and limitations. The network architecture and training procedure are clearly presented, and the figures effectively illustrate the main results. The authors also demonstrate the network's performance under noisy conditions, highlighting the robustness of the training procedure.
One potential improvement would be to elucidate the relationship between the chosen training procedure and the stated objectives. Given that other methods have been employed to enforce Dale's Law or achieve graded network memories, it is unclear why this particular method was selected. The authors may want to discuss whether alternative training procedures could achieve similar results and what makes this method particularly effective.
Additionally, although it may be beyond the scope of this paper, a comparison of the trained network's performance with previous models in terms of network capacity would be of significant interest to the community. The authors' application of a recent method to ensure stable fixed points in a dynamical system has yielded a novel model of auto-associative memory that adheres to several key constraints of real neural networks, including non-saturating unit responses. This model demonstrates promising results, and further exploration of its capabilities and limitations would be a valuable contribution to the field.
