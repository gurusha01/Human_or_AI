This manuscript presents a novel approach to identifying more efficient algebraic identities, leveraging distributed and recursive neural representations to achieve successful classification. 
The definition of the problem appears to be somewhat narrow in scope.
One aspect that requires clarification is the description of the "weight tensor W3 (of size lxlxl, such that the output is also of size l)". This raises the question of whether a neural tensor network is employed instead of a conventional linear network. Notably, Bowman's work demonstrated the superiority of tensor networks over RNNs in similar contexts.
In Section 7.2, Efficient Identity Discovery, it is ambiguous whether the RNN is still utilized for classification purposes, despite the evaluation of various search strategies. The methodology for generating proposals within the search process is not clearly explained and warrants further elaboration.
Additionally, several typographical errors were encountered, including: "has contains a single matrix" which should be rephrased; "listed in table Table 1" contains redundant wording; "vector is the presented to the next operation" requires correction; "The final vector is pass to a softmax classifier" needs grammatical adjustment; "as to how explore space of possible" is unclear; "The scheduler is is fixed" contains duplication; "The difficulty of the task by be appreciated by looking" requires rephrasing; "which can easily captured with" needs correction. Furthermore, Figure 3 incorrectly references a TNN instead of an RNN.
