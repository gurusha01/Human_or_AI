This manuscript presents a novel framework for semi-supervised learning, leveraging Fredholm kernels to extend traditional supervised learning optimization problems and incorporate unlabeled data, resulting in a discretized form of the Fredholm integral equation.
Quality
The manuscript exhibits high technical merit, with claims substantiated by rigorous theoretical analysis and compelling empirical results. The proposed formulation yields a new, data-dependent kernel that integrates unlabeled information, leading to a classification function that, although distinct from the classical representer theorem solution, remains elegant and computationally efficient. 
However, I have several comments: Firstly, regarding Equation 3, which describes the solution to the proposed optimization problem, it is unclear whether this equation remains valid when the associated kernel is not positive semi-definite (PSD), as acknowledged by the authors. A detailed proof of the derivation of Equation 3 would be beneficial. Secondly, in the experimental section, the authors select an "optimal" parameter for all benchmarked methods, but the process of determining these parameters and the definition of "optimal" are not explicitly stated.
Clarity
The manuscript is, for the most part, well-written and organized, making it easy to follow, with the main concepts adequately explained. Nevertheless, there are several typographical errors, including:
* Line 82: The phrase "... will a Euclidean ..." should be corrected to "... will be a Euclidean ..."
* Line 83: The word "or" is missing.
* The title of Section 4 contains a typo, "Fredhom," which should be corrected to "Fredholm."
* Line 247: "porportional" should be spelled "proportional."
* Line 283: The phrase "That is, or..." should be revised to "That is, for..."
* Line 352: The sentence requires rewriting to improve clarity.
Originality
Although the proposed approach bears some relation to a recent NIPS publication ([9]), it introduces novel concepts and clearly distinguishes itself from existing work.
Significance
The results presented are both important and significant, demonstrating a substantial effort to evaluate the proposed method across multiple datasets and application domains. Overall, the manuscript is well-written, with a strong theoretical foundation and a convincing experimental section.
