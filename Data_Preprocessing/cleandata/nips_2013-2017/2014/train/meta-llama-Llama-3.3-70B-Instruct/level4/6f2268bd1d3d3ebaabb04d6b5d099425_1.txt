This paper explores the integration of clustering and outlier detection, presenting a well-structured and readable manuscript. The authors build upon an earlier formulation of facilities location without outliers by Charikar et al., with their primary contribution being the development of a solution to this problem formulation.
The Facilities Location Outlier (FLO) problem was previously demonstrated to be intractable, with no existing approximation algorithm that balances scalability and guarantees. A review of the extensive literature citing the original FLO paper, which exceeds 100 citations, confirms this limitation. The proposed Lagrange relaxation approach appears straightforward and reasonable. The analysis of the Lagrange relaxation is notable, particularly the key finding that the LP relaxation of FLO is equivalent to the Lagrange relaxation, which is not immediately apparent.
The inclusion of experimental results enhances the paper by demonstrating the formulation's effectiveness, especially the speedup achieved over the LP relaxation. However, the absence of absolute values in the experimental section raises some concerns. For instance, Figure 3 illustrates the speedup of the Lagrange relaxation method over the LP relaxation but does not provide the absolute execution time of the Lagrange relaxation method.
The authors' main accomplishment lies in adapting an existing formulation (FLO) to effectively address outlier detection and clustering simultaneously. Their significant contributions include the Lagrange relaxation formulation for the existing objective function and the experimental validation of its usefulness, showcasing the potential of this approach in solving the combined clustering and outlier detection problem.
