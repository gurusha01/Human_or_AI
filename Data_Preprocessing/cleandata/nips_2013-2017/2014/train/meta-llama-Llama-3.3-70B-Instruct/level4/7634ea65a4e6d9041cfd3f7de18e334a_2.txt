This manuscript presents a novel spike and slab sparse prior, which accommodates correlated sparse variables through the utilization of generic covariance functions, thereby encoding their structure. This constitutes a new spike and slab prior tailored for modeling structured sparsity patterns. The authors also devise an algorithm for the inference of spike and slab variables under the proposed prior, leveraging the framework of expectation propagation. To mitigate the computational complexity of the algorithm, approximations to the inverse of a covariance matrix are introduced. The numerical results underscore the method's significant outperformance of existing approaches in sparse recovery problems characterized by structured sparsity.
The paper makes an original contribution to the realm of sparse recovery, offering a solution to the longstanding challenge of inference for structured sparsity, a problem that has confounded researchers over the past decade. Although the manuscript does not provide a solution for any general joint distribution of sparse variables, it proposes a viable solution for a substantial subset of distributions. Consequently, I believe it will resonate with a broader audience and prove useful to numerous researchers in the field.
The manuscript is well-written, albeit with opportunities for improvement in notation (as detailed below). Furthermore, acronyms are not consistently defined, such as MMV. 
One potential enhancement for the revised manuscript (in addition to the detailed comments that follow) is the inclusion of real-data examples where the structure in the sparse variables can be effectively modeled by the set of distributions considered in the paper. The current example, featuring an EEG measurement matrix, is less convincing since the sparse variables are sampled from a distribution defined by the authors, rendering it not truly a real-world example, as the actual data of interest is the measurement matrix, whose properties are not the primary focus of the paper. Incorporating such examples would substantially strengthen the manuscript and amplify the impact of the proposed method.
Another aspect worthy of discussion in the paper is the attenuation of correlation among sparse variables with respect to the correlation of parameters gamma (as illustrated in Fig. 1c). It would be beneficial to elucidate the factors influencing this attenuation and explore potential means of controlling this dependence. Additionally, examining how the curvature of the curves in Fig. 1c varies with other parameters could provide valuable insights for real-world applications.
Detailed comments:
- The title of Section 2 contains a typo, which should be corrected to "slab" instead of "slap".
- Line 093 should be revised to "easy to generate" from "easy the generate".
- In Section 3, when replacing f1 with f1 tilde, it would be helpful to explain the rationale behind transitioning from the conditional distribution of y given x to a conditional distribution of x given m1 and V1, where m1 is dependent on y.
- In Section 3, the application of the function d(x,y) in equations 18-21 is not clearly explained.
- In Section 3.1, the notation tilde(f)_a,i should be explicitly defined, as the subscript "i" is introduced without prior explanation. Consider using a superscript or defining it within the text for clarity.
- The use of bold A and regular A for distinct variables is confusing and should be modified for better readability.
- In Section 3.2, the definition of N (potentially the rank of V1) should be provided.
- Line 306 contains a typo, which should be corrected to "slab" instead of "slap". 
Overall, this is an intriguing and technically sound paper that introduces a novel structured sparsity prior and provides an accompanying algorithm for inference under this prior. The numerical results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method in structured sparse recovery.
