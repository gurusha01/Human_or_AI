The authors extend a recent Bayesian SVM by leveraging Gaussian Processes, resulting in a hierarchical GP model, for which they propose two approximate inference methods: an MCMC sampler and an EM algorithm. Additionally, they introduce a sparse (FITC) approximation to further accelerate computations. A notable contribution is the development of a GPLVM model for the Bayesian kernel SVM.
The paper's writing is generally clear and concise. The proposed extensions to the Bayesian SVM, although individually standard, collectively form an intriguing set of contributions. However, the numerous contributions and extensions lead to a somewhat limited experimental evaluation for each. While the authors assess predictive performance on various datasets, further empirical validation beyond basic prediction errors and computational time would be beneficial to thoroughly examine the model's properties in terms of modeling and inference. The topic of Bayesian kernel SVM is interesting and relevant, but a more in-depth intuition and empirical comparison to related models would have been desirable to better understand the model's characteristics and distinctions.
