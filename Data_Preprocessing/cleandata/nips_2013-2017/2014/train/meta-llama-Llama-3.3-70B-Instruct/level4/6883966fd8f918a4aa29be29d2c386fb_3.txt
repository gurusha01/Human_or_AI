This manuscript is challenging to comprehend due to a lack of clarity. It builds upon recent findings by Hsu et al regarding loss minimization, but unfortunately, their theorem is misstated. A significant omission is the empirical validation of the benefits of active learning in parametric linear regression. The main theorems' derivations are unclear and potentially incorrect.
The notation ||X||_* in equation 1 is introduced without prior definition. Theorem 2.1 requires verification, particularly the sample complexity expression, which should only feature "n" once; the condition n > c log(n) seems to misinterpret Hsu et al's intention.
The equivalence derivation of L(W,P) = L(W,D) on page 3 appears flawed, especially considering P as a measure, making the subsequent line perplexing. Although the result might be correct, the reasoning is questionable.
The implications of an unbounded \Lambda_D, which occurs with heavy-tailed distributions, on the main theorem are unclear. This scenario likely exacerbates the gap between Lemma 3.1 and Theorem 5.1.
Experimental support is crucial for substantiating the claims made. The overall quality of the manuscript would benefit from improvements in writing, result presentation, and proof clarity. Additionally, incorporating real-world experiments would significantly enhance the manuscript's validity and impact.
