This paper addresses the problem of minimizing block-separable functions under linear constraints, proposing a variant of the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) termed PDMM. The PDMM method involves randomly selecting K blocks of the primal variable for update and incorporating a backward step to refine the dual variable, allowing for parallel implementation of the primal variable update process. The paper establishes a sublinear convergence rate for the proposed method, which serves as a generalization of several ADMM variants.
The paper is well-structured and clear, making it easy to follow. I am inclined to accept this paper, with the following questions and comments aimed at enhancing its clarity and completeness:
1) The algorithmic description provided in equations (5) and (6) lacks sufficient detail. It is unclear whether all coordinates of $y^{t+1}$ and $\hat{y}^{t+1}$ are updated or if only a single block "i" is considered. Based on my understanding, only a block of the dual variable "y" is updated, but the method for selecting "i" is not specified. This point requires clarification in the revision.
2) In the proof of Theorem 2, it appears that $\sum_{i=1}^I$ is missing from the expression.
3) Further discussion on Theorem 2, which presents the convergence rate of the PDMM method, would be beneficial. Given that PDMM generalizes several ADMM variants, it is natural to inquire whether Theorem 2 aligns with the convergence rates of these variants when parameters like K and J are appropriately chosen. Additionally, considering the splitting of the transformation matrix A into multiple blocks, the theorem should provide insight into the optimal splitting strategy.
4) I am interested in a comparison with the tensor completion problem ("tensor completion for estimating missing values in visual data, 2012"), which also exhibits a multiple block structure. It would be valuable to know if there are any indications of which ADMM variant is optimal for this problem.
Minor points:
1) Equation (9) is missing a space after "min".
2) On line 217, the space before "Section" should be removed. Overall, I am positive about accepting this paper, with the expectation of more discussion following Theorem 2 to enhance the paper's quality.
