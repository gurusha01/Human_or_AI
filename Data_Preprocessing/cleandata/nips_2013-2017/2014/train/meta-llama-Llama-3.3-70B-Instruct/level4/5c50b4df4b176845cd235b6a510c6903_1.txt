The authors approach social choice mechanisms through the lens of statistical decision theory, leveraging this perspective to develop two novel voting mechanisms grounded in Bayesian risk minimization. The paper delves into the characteristics of the rankings generated by these new mechanisms, as well as a comprehensive analysis of their computational complexity. Notably, the decision problems associated with identifying optimal winning candidates for one of the proposed schemes are found to be NP-hard, whereas the other falls within the realm of polynomial time complexity. The paper culminates in an asymptotic comparison between the decisions yielded by the authors' mechanisms and the Kemeny voting rule, supplemented by an experimental validation of the asymptotic findings.
The research presented is innovative, and the paper is well-crafted, albeit dense with technical content.
Several minor suggestions for improvement are offered:
* The definition of the loss function $L{0-1}(\theta,c)$ in Definition 4 is not explicitly provided, which may cause confusion due to its distinction from the function introduced in Example 1. A clarification, such as $L{0-1}(\theta, c) = 0$ if $\theta \in \mathcal{L}c(C)$ (or $\mathcal{B}c(C)$) and $1$ otherwise, would be beneficial.
* In Lemma 2, the implicit use of quantities outside the lemma statement (lines 249-251) may lead to confusion. Reframing the statement to be self-contained would enhance clarity.
* The definition of the $P_||^NP$-hard problem might more appropriately utilize truth-table reductions rather than many-one reductions, although this does not impact the paper's results.
* A typographical error on Page 7, line 343, should be corrected from "where d is not ranked" to "where b is not ranked".
* Another typo on Page 7, line 346, should be amended from "BETTER DECISION" to "OPTIMAL BAYESIAN DECISION".
The authors have successfully applied a fresh perspective to a well-established area, not only contributing meaningful insights but also highlighting intriguing open questions for future exploration.
