This manuscript introduces a novel algorithm for optimizing the balanced k-cut objective function via continuous relaxation, applicable to both traditional clustering scenarios without labeled data and transductive settings. Comprehensive experimental evaluations compare the proposed method to various spectral clustering variants, revealing its frequent outperformance of existing approaches. Notably, the new algorithm consistently yields superior balanced k-cuts and, somewhat unexpectedly, also excels in identifying better partitions according to related objective functions, even when compared to algorithms specifically designed for those functions.
Minor comments:
- On page 1, in the introduction's first paragraph, consider reversing the order of "frequently" and "outperform" for improved clarity.
- The bibliography should be organized in alphabetical order.
A continuous relaxation approach to the balanced k-cut problem is proposed, with thorough experimental results demonstrating significant qualitative improvements over preceding related techniques.
