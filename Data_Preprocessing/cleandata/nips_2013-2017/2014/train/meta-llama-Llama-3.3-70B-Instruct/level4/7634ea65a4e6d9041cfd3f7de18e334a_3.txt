This manuscript explores a novel structured spike-and-slab prior that utilizes a Gaussian process to enforce spatial contiguity in the sparsity pattern. Notably, this work builds upon previous research by Cevher et al. (2008), which employed an Ising model to capture between-element correlations. A key distinction between the current study and Cevher et al. (2008) lies in the replacement of the Ising model with a Gaussian process linked through a Probit function. The proposed spike-and-slab prior is applied as a prior distribution for an unknown signal in a linear inverse problem, and an Expectation Propagation (EP) algorithm is developed for signal inference under this prior. The experimental evaluations are conducted using synthetic data.
The primary innovation of the proposed spike-and-slab prior stems from its Gaussian process-based correlation structure. However, the manuscript fails to provide a comparative analysis between this correlation structure and the Ising model used in Cevher et al. (2008), neither theoretically nor experimentally. Several additional concerns are raised, including: 
(1) The methodology for computing the correlation between z1 and z2 in Figure 1(c) is not clearly explained.
(2) The abbreviation MMV is introduced without definition.
(3) The experiments rely solely on synthetic data, with no inclusion of real-world data.
(4) In Experiment 2, the decision to exclude BG-AMP from the comparison is questionable, especially given the paper's acknowledgment that BG-AMP is expected to perform poorly due to the violation of the Gaussian iid assumption for Aij.
Overall, this paper introduces a correlated spike-and-slab prior with a Gaussian process-imposed correlation structure. However, the relationship between this prior and the Ising model-based prior from Cevher et al. (2008) is not adequately explored, and several methodological and experimental shortcomings are identified, including the lack of comparison with BG-AMP in Experiment 2 and the exclusive use of synthetic data in the experiments.
