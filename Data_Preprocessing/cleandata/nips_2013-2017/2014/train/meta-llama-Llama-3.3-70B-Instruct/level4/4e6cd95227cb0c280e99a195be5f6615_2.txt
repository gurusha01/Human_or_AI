This paper presents a novel sampling algorithm for the state posterior distribution in a multi-chain model, with its primary contribution being the application of slice sampling to multi-chain hidden Markov models.
My main concerns regarding this work are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item It is unclear whether the proposed method can be generalized to accommodate more complex transition matrices in Finite Hidden Markov Models (FHMM) beyond what is specified in equation (1).
\item The example provided in Section 2, specifically panel a of Figure 2, demonstrates that a pairwise blocked Gibbs sampler cannot transition from the initial state multi-chain configuration to the true one in a single step. While the authors interpret this as evidence that the standard Gibbs chain is susceptible to local mode trapping, I believe it more accurately illustrates that the mixing of the standard Gibbs chain can be slower compared to the proposed Hamming ball sampler.
\item Previous research has shown that the mixing of the basic Forward-Filtering Backward-Sampling (FFBS) sampler for Hidden Markov Models (HMM) can be enhanced through the use of permutation samplers (Fr\"uhwirth-Schnatter, 2001) or antithetic sampling (Billio et al., 2014). I question whether the performance of both the Gibbs sampler and the Hamming ball sampler could be further improved by integrating these sampling strategies, and additional simulation results or discussion on this topic would be beneficial.
\end{enumerate}
Minor observations and suggestions include:
\begin{enumerate}
\item On line 152, a formal definition or reference for the Hamming distance would be helpful for clarity.
\item The description of the Hamming ball on line 168 appears to be inconsistent with the decomposition provided in equation (6), suggesting an intersection rather than a union.
\item The definition of $I(\cdot)$ on line 171 as the identity function is perplexing, as it is more commonly recognized as the indicator or characteristic function.
\item The bibliography requires careful review for formatting consistency, including corrections such as "Markov" instead of "markov", "Monte Carlo" instead of "monte carlo", and "Indian" instead of "indian" on lines 434, 452, and 467, respectively.
\end{enumerate}

The paper tackles a challenging problem and introduces an innovative sampler for the hidden states of a multi-chain HMM. While it requires some minor revisions, I strongly recommend acceptance following these revisions.
