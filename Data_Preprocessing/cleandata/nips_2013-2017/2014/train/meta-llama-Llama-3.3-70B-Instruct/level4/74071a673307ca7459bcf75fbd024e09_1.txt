Review- Overview:
This manuscript presents a novel framework for imposing structure on Bayesian models through the selection of structured priors, guided by the maximum entropy principle. While the optimal prior may be intractable, the authors propose an approximate method utilizing submodule optimization, which has the potential to make a significant impact in the field of constructing priors with structured variables.
Quality
The paper demonstrates technical rigor, with the authors providing empirical results on both simulated and functional MRI data to validate the effectiveness of their methodology. The discussion of strengths and limitations further enhances the paper's quality.
Clarity
The manuscript is well-organized and clearly written, making it easy to follow.
Minor errors: On page 4, lines 210 and 211, "Corollary 10" appears to be a typo and should be replaced with "Corollary 6". Additionally, the reference format should be standardized throughout the paper.
Originality
The paper exhibits sufficient novelty, assuming the proofs are correct, which suggests a meaningful contribution to the field.
Significance
The manuscript tackles an important topic and proposes a computationally feasible and intuitive approach, making it a valuable addition to the field.
Overall, this is a strong piece of work, and I recommend accepting this paper for publication.
