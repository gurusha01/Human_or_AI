The authors explore an extension of Pinsker's theorem, which establishes the minimax rate in nonparametric estimation with squared error risk for normal means in an L2 ball, to a setting where the number of bits used in estimation is bounded. Specifically, they derive exact formulas for the minimax risk as the number of samples approaches infinity, given a bound on the bitrate, denoted as B. As expected, their formula reduces to Pinsker's formula when B approaches infinity and degenerates to the radius of the L2 ball when B approaches zero.
QUALITY
The paper appears to be technically sound, although a thorough verification of all details was not conducted. The techniques employed, while rooted in standard methods from rate-distortion theory and the literature on establishing minimax risk lower bounds, exhibit distinct and nontrivial variations, particularly evident in Theorems 1 and 2. These variations demonstrate a high level of complexity and difficulty.
CLARITY
The paper is well-written, requiring some prior knowledge from the reader but presenting the material in an accessible manner. The authors have made a considerable effort to ensure clarity, given the inherent complexity of the subject matter.
ORIGINALITY
To the best of my knowledge, the results presented are novel, although the underlying techniques are not. A notable concern is that the paper does not adequately discuss how its contributions relate to existing work, particularly in terms of what aspects are truly new and what might be considered an expected extension of previous research. The discussion in Section 5, specifically the third paragraph, feels overly restrictive and would benefit from elaboration, potentially at the expense of other material. Upon examining the referenced Yang and Barron (YB) paper, it becomes apparent that the connections between the current work and earlier studies run deeper than acknowledged. The proof of YB's Theorem 1 shares similarities with the reasoning behind the authors' Theorem 1, suggesting that classical minimax risk lower bounds may implicitly involve rate distortion. This raises questions about the novelty of the present paper's results and whether they could be derived more straightforwardly from existing theorems. The absence of this discussion in the paper is notable.
In summary, while the detailed proofs and the specific result are original, the general type of result and its underlying concepts are less innovative than the authors imply. This is not a reason for rejection but does warrant further consideration.
SIGNIFICANCE
Given the observations on originality, the significance of the paper, while reasonable, may not be as high as suggested. The combination of rate-distortion theory and minimax nonparametric analysis in a novel setting contributes to its significance, but the analysis methods, although technically sound and nontrivial, build heavily on established techniques.
PRO/CON-Analysis
PRO: The paper is well-written, presents a highly nontrivial and useful result, and offers precise asymptotics.
CONTRA: It relies heavily on earlier work without fully exploring the relationship between the current and previous research, which might diminish its perceived impact.
COMMENT ON IMPACT SCORE: The choice of impact score was challenging due to the binary options provided. Ultimately, "incremental" was selected because, despite the novel setting that combines rate distortion and minimax nonparametric analysis, the analytical approach is very similar to existing methods in both fields. The interrelation between these methods was already well understood, making the term "incremental" mathematically justified. The paper's strength lies in its precise asymptotics, but the fact that such a result would exist is not entirely surprising, given the foundation laid by previous studies.
