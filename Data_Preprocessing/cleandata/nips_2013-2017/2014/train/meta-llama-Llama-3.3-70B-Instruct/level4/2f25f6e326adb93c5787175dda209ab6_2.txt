While the conventional NMF approach focuses on a generative model of the time-frequency analysis coefficients of a signal, the proposed approach adopts a generative model of the time-domain signal itself by characterizing a generative model of time-frequency synthesis coefficients, thereby enabling the exploration of multi-resolution representations previously unattainable in traditional NMF frameworks.
This paper presents an intriguing concept, with the multi-resolution extension being a particularly noteworthy aspect that I find compelling.
Although the authors provide results on multi-resolution signal decompositions, I am also interested in evaluating the proposed method's performance in the single-resolution scenario in comparison to IS-NMF. Specifically, I would like to know whether it yields comparable W and H matrices and if the current algorithm matches the speed and stability of the multiplicative update algorithm used in IS-NMF. The proposed framework's consideration of a generative model of the time-domain signal, through the description of a generative model of time-frequency synthesis coefficients, distinguishes it from the regular NMF framework, which models the time-frequency analysis coefficients, and this distinction facilitates the development of multi-resolution representations that were previously inaccessible within the traditional NMF framework.
