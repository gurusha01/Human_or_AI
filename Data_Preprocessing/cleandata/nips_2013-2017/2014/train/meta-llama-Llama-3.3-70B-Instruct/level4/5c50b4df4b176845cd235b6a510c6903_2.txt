This paper formulates the problem of designing voting rules for multiple agents as a decision-making process that minimizes expected loss with respect to the posterior distribution over parameters, effectively framing it as a Bayesian risk minimization problem.
In my evaluation, the results presented are technically sound, novel, and engaging.
My primary observation is that the paper focuses on the normative properties and asymptotic behaviors (as the number of voters increases) of Bayesian estimators. However, the NIPS audience typically shows a stronger interest in learning dynamics. Despite perceiving the results as being of high quality, I question whether NIPS is the ideal platform for this work, given its emphasis. The formulation of voting rules as a Bayesian risk minimization problem yields novel and interesting normative and asymptotic results, which, although valuable, may not align perfectly with the conference's primary focus.
