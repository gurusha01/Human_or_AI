This paper presents a clustering approach that automatically addresses outlier detection, building upon the Facility Location with Outliers (FLO) problem introduced in theoretical computer science in 2001. The novelty of this approach lies in its utilization of the Lagrangian relaxation of the original integer linear programming problem, demonstrating equivalence to solving the linear relaxation of FLO and analyzing the convergence properties of the subgradient method, thereby enhancing scalability. Experimental results are provided for both synthetic and real-world datasets, including MNIST.
The paper is well-structured, clear, and easy to follow, despite its technical complexity, with well-defined motivations and objectives. The introduction of the FLO formulation to the machine learning community is a notable contribution, as it was previously confined to theoretical computer science. However, it is worth noting that the statement regarding clustering and outlier detection as separate problems overlooks novel clustering formulations that focus on the concept of a cluster itself, such as those discussed in M. Pelillo's "What is a cluster?" (NIPS'09 Workshop on Clustering), where clustering and outlier detection are inherently intertwined.
A significant issue with the proposed formulation is its requirement for the number of outliers as input, which can be more challenging to determine than the number of clusters. Additionally, the "cost" of creating a new cluster needs to be defined, and the choice made in the experiments appears heuristic. 
The experimental validation does not demonstrate a substantial improvement over other methods. Notably, the MNIST experiments (Table 1) show that APOC and LR are essentially equivalent, with k-means-- outperforming the proposed LR algorithm.
Minor observations include that Definition 2 should be classified as a Proposition. 
Although the experimental results are not convincing and the method requires problematic parameter settings, the ideas presented are potentially interesting and somewhat novel. Therefore, I would consider allowing the authors to present their work in a poster format at NIPS, encouraging them to provide additional experimental evidence to demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach.
