This manuscript introduces a novel Bayesian nonparametric approach to modeling grouped data with mixed membership, leveraging a Beta-Negative Binomial Process (BNBP). Although previous research has utilized this stochastic process, the current work distinguishes itself in several key aspects.
Notably, the authors derive an exchangeable partition probability function (EPPF) and establish prediction rules based on it. The relationship between Bayesian nonparametrics and EPPF has been a subject of study in statistics since the foundational work of J. Pitman, yet its application in Bayesian nonparametric (BNP) research has been limited. The connection established in this paper between BNBP and EPPF represents a significant step towards integrating EPPF analysis into BNP research, potentially paving the way for further investigations in this direction.
Another noteworthy aspect is the randomization of group sizes, which are typically treated as fixed constants in other studies. This approach enables the derivation of marginal distributions, offering a fresh perspective on the analysis of grouped data.
In my opinion, this paper makes substantial theoretical contributions to the field. However, its practical applicability remains uncertain. The proposed inference algorithm is more complex than the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP), both in theory and implementation. While the results demonstrate some improvement, it is not sufficient to justify the increased complexity in practical scenarios. Furthermore, the manuscript lacks an intuitive explanation for why the proposed framework would outperform HDP in practice.
Despite these reservations, I believe this paper has significant theoretical merit. To strengthen its case, I hope the authors can provide clarification on how their method can enhance practical performance compared to HDP and offer insights into its potential advantages. On balance, I am inclined to recommend acceptance.
