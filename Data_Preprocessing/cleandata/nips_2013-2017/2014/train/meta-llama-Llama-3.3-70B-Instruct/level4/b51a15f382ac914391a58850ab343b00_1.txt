This manuscript presents an unsupervised approach for aligning manifold structures across disparate datasets and establishing correspondences between objects within these datasets. The methodology integrates three distinct objective functions: a geometry matching component, a feature matching component, and a geometry preserving component. The learning process involves alternating between matching objects and estimating projection matrices to maximize the overall objective function. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method in comparison to existing unsupervised manifold alignment techniques.
The novelty of the proposed method, however, is somewhat limited as it combines elements from three related methodologies. Nonetheless, the integration of these frameworks to tackle the challenging problem of unsupervised manifold alignment is noteworthy. The method yields impressive performance in the conducted experiments.
Upon examination, the geometry preserving term in the objective function aligns with those employed in conventional unsupervised manifold alignment methods, as discussed in the paper. The geometry matching term bears resemblance to unsupervised object matching techniques, such as kernelized sorting and least square object matching, with equation (3) mirroring the formulation used in convex kernelized sorting. A more in-depth discussion on these object matching methods would be beneficial. Furthermore, the feature matching term draws parallels with CCA-based unsupervised matching methods, including matching CCA and many-to-many matching latent variable models, which also seek to determine linear projection matrices and object correspondences.

In the context of the face pose experiments, it appears that calculating similarities between datasets might be feasible, potentially allowing for the application of supervised manifold alignment methods. Clarification is needed to confirm whether this task is indeed suited for unsupervised methods. While the proposed method combines existing techniques, its application to unsupervised manifold alignment, a notoriously difficult problem, is of interest and demonstrates the potential of integrating related frameworks to achieve meaningful results.
