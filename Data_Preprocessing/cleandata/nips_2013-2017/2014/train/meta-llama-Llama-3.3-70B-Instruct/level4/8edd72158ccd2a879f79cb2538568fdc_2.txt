This manuscript presents a theoretical framework for evaluating the quality of a collective decision made by a team of agents, where the teams are formed in two distinct ways: "Uniform" teams comprising multiple instances of the same agent, and "Diverse" teams consisting of a single instance of several different agent types. The authors demonstrate that, under certain conditions, as the number of agents increases, the Diverse team converges in probability to the correct choice almost surely, whereas the Uniform team retains a non-zero probability of error.
The paper is well-structured, and its technical quality is exceptional. The findings are substantial and pertinent, highlighting the notion that decision-making by a diverse team leads to more robust outcomes, whereas a homogeneous group of agents lacks sufficient variance, resulting in overly predictable behavior. The authors provide a solid theoretical foundation to quantify these concepts and illustrate that even diversity achieved through a single, widely-used Go program with varying parameters can yield significant performance improvements in 9x9 Go when employing an appropriate voting scheme. Furthermore, they establish connections between their assumptions, voting rules, and other rules utilized in the literature.
However, several concerns arise. Firstly, there appears to be a disconnect between the theoretical foundations and the experimental section, which focuses exclusively on the application to Go. The experimental section would benefit from a more comprehensive evaluation, including comparisons of different noise models, validation of the assumptions outlined in section 3, or a more explicit link between the theoretical framework and the experimental results. It is unclear whether the Go application satisfies the assumptions 1-4, which raises questions about the applicability of Theorem 2 in this context. This disconnect is also evident in the discussion section, which primarily focuses on the application to games, whereas the initial part of the paper presents a more general framework.
Additionally, as this work builds upon previous research ([18,19]), the authors should more clearly highlight the novel contributions of this paper. While the noise model approach seems suitable for the computer Go setting, where an underlying true ranking of alternatives exists, its applicability to more general social choice settings, such as elections, where the existence of a true ranking is uncertain, remains unclear. It would be beneficial to explore whether this approach can be extended to scenarios where the true ranking is unknown.
In summary, this paper establishes a significant theoretical result, demonstrating the asymptotic optimality of a diverse team of agents under certain assumptions, while showing the suboptimality of a uniform team. Although the experimental results are noteworthy, they appear somewhat disconnected from the primary theoretical findings, and the originality of the work compared to previous research could be more explicitly stated.
