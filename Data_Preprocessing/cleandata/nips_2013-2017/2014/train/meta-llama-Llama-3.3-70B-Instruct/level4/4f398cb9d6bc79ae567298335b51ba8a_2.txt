The authors address the challenging task of proposing convex relaxations for learning deep architectures, where the primary obstacle lies in the iterative composition of layers, with each layer's weight matrix and output matrix playing crucial roles. The output matrix of one layer serves as the input quantities for the next, posing significant difficulties in formulating the learning problem.
The authors introduce a novel convex relaxation approach, building upon a previous relaxation technique popularized for maximum margin clustering. This new approach involves lifting the problem into a higher-dimensional space, parameterizing it using the normalized quantity M = Theta' (Theta Theta')Theta, where denotes the pseudo-inverse and ' represents the transpose. This formulation yields significant benefits, including spectral constraints on M, whereas the un-normalized convex relaxation would result in both spectral and non-spectral constraints. The proposed approach can be efficiently implemented using a conditional gradient algorithm, and preliminary experimental results are presented on synthetic and real-world datasets.
Detailed comments:
The discussion (lines 349-352) regarding convergence to a stationary point is concise and should be expanded upon in the final version of the paper. The exposition can be improved by utilizing supplemental material for proofs and mathematical arguments, reserving the main paper for clear explanations and illustrations.
The authors' effort to meticulously define the problem and design a useful convex relaxation is commendable, as they thoroughly review various options and highlight their corresponding challenges. These sections of the paper provide valuable review material for addressing current challenges in building theoretically grounded deep learning approaches. The paper is innovative and fresh, tackling one of the most daunting challenges in the machine learning community: designing useful convex relaxations of deep learning problems. The proposed approach is novel and interesting, warranting a clear acceptance.
