The manuscript "Speeding-up Graphical Model Optimization via a Coarse-to-fine Cascade of Pruning Classifiers" presents a novel framework for enhancing MRF Optimization by utilizing a cascade of classifiers to progressively prune the search space, transitioning from coarse to fine-grained models.
The proposed pruning scheme is innovative, intriguing, and appears to yield effective solutions in practice, outperforming other approaches in terms of speed. Several parameters are preset (e.g., C = 10, 5 scales, rho), but the method's robustness with respect to these parameter values is unclear. However, since the same parameters are used for all evaluation datasets, it is likely that they are not overly specialized (although line 294 mentions that C was set to 10 based on its satisfactory accuracy, implying that the value may have been determined by examining the test data).
The manuscript is well-structured and easy to follow. The significant speed-up achieved by the new method has the potential to substantially impact the field. Some minor errors were noted: 
Line 90 should read "different classifiers per scale are used" instead of "is used". 
Lines 102-103 require a correction to "with a fine-grained pruning of the labels" from "fined-grained". 
Line 155 contains an error in the heading with excessive content. 
Line 363 should be revised to "all aggressiveness factors except lambda" from "expect lambda". 
Line 370 needs correction to "illustrated in column (d,e,f)" from "(d,e,g)". 
The pruning scheme introduced in this work is both novel and interesting, offering a practical solution that is faster than existing approaches, and its considerable speed-up could have a profound impact on the field.
