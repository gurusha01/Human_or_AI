This paper proposes an approach to accelerate optimization for the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) problem in graphical models. The authors introduce a coarse-to-fine methodology, providing clear motivation for their work. Their method integrates label pruning for each variable with sequential optimization of the pruned, yet refined problem.
Upon examination, the work appears to be both original and technically correct. However, one aspect that could be more explicitly addressed is the applicability of the proposed method to graph structures lacking apparent regularity, particularly in comparison to grid graphs commonly derived from images.
An additional intriguing consideration is the potential for incorporating this method within a learning procedure, which could further enhance its utility. Given the limitations of my familiarity with related works, it is challenging for me to fully evaluate the significance of this contribution. Nonetheless, the paper's coarse-to-fine approach for accelerating MAP inference seems innovative and well-founded, with experimental results that support its efficacy.
