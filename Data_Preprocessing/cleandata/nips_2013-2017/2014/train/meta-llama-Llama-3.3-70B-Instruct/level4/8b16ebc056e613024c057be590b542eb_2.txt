This manuscript presents a novel approach for estimating sparse connectivity graphs of firing neurons, leveraging an L_2 norm to derive a penalized inverse covariance matrix that enhances the cost function. Notably, the authors replace a previously employed hard thresholding technique with a soft thresholding method. The cost function is formulated as X-entropy and optimized utilizing the BFGS algorithm.
The paper is well-structured and self-contained, with an extensive list of references that support the authors' claims. The text is clear and easy to follow, although the organizational structure occasionally emerges organically from the content rather than being explicitly stated, resulting in a narrative that feels more chronological and incremental than theoretically driven.
In comparison to existing methods, including those that participated in the Kaggle Connectomics competition, the proposed approach demonstrates favorable performance. However, the frequent references to the competition give the impression that the manuscript is a late submission that benefits from hindsight, which reinforces the incremental tone of the publication.
Following the author rebuttal, I have revised my assessment and increased my score. The authors' justification for improved computational speed, achieved through a differentiable parameterization with a simple and easily implementable formula, was persuasive. Additionally, the authors provided a more comprehensive rationale for their design choices, such as filter order and chi2 value. While the paper is theoretically sound and well-written, its presentation still resembles a belated contribution to the Kaggle competition, showcasing an improvement primarily through the application of logistic regression for preprocessing and an X-entropy cost function formulation that enables the use of efficient off-the-shelf solvers.
