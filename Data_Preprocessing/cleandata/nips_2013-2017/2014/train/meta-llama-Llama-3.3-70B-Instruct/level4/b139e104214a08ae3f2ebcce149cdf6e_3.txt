The authors establish a lower bound on the minimax risk for estimating normal means subject to a "communication constraint," which imposes a limit on the number of bits available to represent an estimate. They propose a theoretical, albeit non-implementable, discretized estimator that achieves this bound and demonstrate its performance through small-scale simulations.
The paper is well-structured and clearly presented, with the authors conveying their ideas in an organized and lucid manner. The findings are noteworthy and, to my knowledge, unprecedented. 
However, the authors do not provide a practical encoding method that attains the proposed bound, nor do they assess existing encoding methods in relation to their bound. Moreover, the model underlying the bound could be substantially generalized, and the results appear to lack immediate practical applicability, somewhat limiting their scope. Nonetheless, the paper constitutes a significant theoretical contribution toward elucidating the tradeoff between statistical power and storage resources. 
This well-written paper presents an interesting theoretical advancement, as the authors derive a lower bound on minimax risk for the estimation of normal means under a communication constraint, representing a valuable step toward understanding the interplay between statistical power and storage resources.
