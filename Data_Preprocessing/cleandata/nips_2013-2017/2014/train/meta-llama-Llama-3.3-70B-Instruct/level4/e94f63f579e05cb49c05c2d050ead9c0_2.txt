This manuscript investigates the utilization of Bayesian quadrature in the context of Bayesian inference, a methodology initially proposed by Osborne et al. (NIPS 2012). The current research expands upon this foundation, introducing novel enhancements. The overarching approach involves constructing a probabilistic model of the posterior surface for a given Bayesian inference problem, thereby facilitating meta-inference over quantities of interest, including the partition function. Two key innovations are presented: firstly, the employment of a squared Gaussian Process to model the likelihood, diverging from Osborne et al.'s use of an exponentiated Gaussian Process; and secondly, the evaluation of the posterior at points of high uncertainty. As with previous work, various approximations are necessary to render inference computationally tractable.
The introduced innovations are indeed valid and are demonstrated to be effective by the authors. However, given the clear precedent set by Osborne et al., a comparative experimental analysis between the proposed method ("WSABI") and an exponentiated GP, rather than solely against un-warped Bayesian Monte Carlo, would have been beneficial. 
A minor critique pertains to the terminology: the phrase "95% confidence interval" might be perceived as misleading, as it could be confused with frequentist confidence intervals when used to describe a region encompassing 95% of the posterior mass. Consideration of alternative terminology might be warranted. Furthermore, the title of the paper may be deemed confusing or misleading due to the unconventional use of the term "sampling" in the context of Bayesian inference. A more descriptive title, such as "Squared Gaussian Processes for Fast Bayesian Quadrature," could enhance clarity.
The manuscript presents noteworthy advancements over recent studies leveraging Bayesian quadrature for Bayesian inference.
