The authors present a multi-class extension of the Deep Boosting framework, initially proposed by Cortes and Mohri. They commence by establishing a generalized bound for the linear combination of base hypotheses, each belonging to sets with distinct Rademacher complexities. This bound enhances the standard multi-class generalization bound put forth by Koltchinskii and Panchenko. Motivated by this bound, the authors formulate an optimization problem aimed at minimizing an upper limit of the generalization error, which is solved using a coordinate-descent style algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm, utilizing decision trees as base hypotheses, over conventional multi-class boosting algorithms such as AdaBoost.MR and its variants.
The optimization problem is well-founded, stemming from the improved generalization bound, and naturally lends itself to a coordinate-descent algorithmic solution. Notably, the criterion for selecting a weak hypothesis is derived as the sum of the weighted error and the complexity of the hypothesis class, showcasing a thoughtful approach.
The experimental results underscore the effectiveness of the proposed method. However, to further enhance the robustness of the findings, it would be beneficial to adopt the approach used in the ICML'14 paper on Deep Boosting, where validation sets are utilized for parameter optimization.
The formulation adopted in this work is "primal," focusing on minimizing losses, such as exponential or logistic loss, similar to the approaches in AdaBoost or LogitBoost. An alternative perspective is the "dual" view of boosting, as seen in the motivation behind AdaBoost, which involves minimizing relative entropy under linear constraints, a concept explored by Kivinen and Warmuth in COLT'99. Further investigations into this dual view have been conducted in TotalBoost, SoftBoost, and ERLPBoost by Warmuth et al. in ICML'06, NIPS'07, and ALT'08, respectively. Exploring the dual view for the proposed algorithm could provide deeper insights and enhance understanding.
Following the authors' response and the presentation of new experimental results based on the reviewers' suggestions, the evaluation of this work is elevated. The theoretical contributions are deemed sufficient and valuable for the NIPS community.
