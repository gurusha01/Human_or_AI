The authors investigate the application of logistic regression in the presence of outliers in the data, without imposing any distributional assumptions on these outliers, which can occur due to various factors such as sensor errors in video data.
The paper presents a novel algorithm, referred to as RoLR, accompanied by rigorous performance guarantees. While the algorithm itself is straightforward to outline, it leverages complex theoretical concepts, and the mathematical derivations underlying the performance guarantees are particularly noteworthy. The simulation results appear promising.
Specifically, the following points warrant clarification:
- On line 135, the rationale behind assuming $\beta^*$ has a unit length is not explicitly stated.
- Line 157 mentions that $X_i$ is p-dimensional, which raises questions about how the square and absolute value operations are defined in this context.
Overall, the paper is well-written and of high quality. Although the practical performance of the method on real-world data remains to be seen, the theoretical contributions made are significant and valuable. The innovation and mathematical rigor demonstrated in the paper are commendable, making it a substantial contribution to the field.
