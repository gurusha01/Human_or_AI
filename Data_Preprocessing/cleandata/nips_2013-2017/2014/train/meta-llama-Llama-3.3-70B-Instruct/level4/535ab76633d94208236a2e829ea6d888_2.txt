The manuscript proposes a methodology to identify and exclude adversarial voters in crowdsourcing systems, aiming to enhance the accuracy of aggregated voting outcomes. It introduces two algorithms, namely soft and hard penalty assignment, designed to filter out such voters. The theoretical framework supporting these algorithms is sound, and the experimental results demonstrate potential.
This problem is intriguing, and further elaboration on its practical applications would be beneficial. 
Providing a brief explanation of the optimal semi-matching algorithm, a crucial component of the hard penalty assignment algorithm, would enhance clarity.
The consistent outperformance of the hard penalty assignment over the soft penalty assignment in real datasets, as opposed to synthetic ones, is not immediately clear and warrants further explanation.
Overall, the problem is compelling, and the paper is well-structured. Expanding on the discussion of applications where this issue is relevant would add value to the manuscript.
