This manuscript explores the metric labeling problem, a specific instance of MAP/MPE inference in graphical models where potentials are constrained to metric distance functions. As a theoretical contribution, it elucidates intriguing relationships between move-making algorithms, which rely on a reduction to min-cut, and particular rounding schemes employed in conjunction with linear programming relaxations. Notably, the paper demonstrates that certain move-making algorithms can achieve equivalent approximation guarantees as rounding schemes while leveraging the efficiency of min-cut solvers.
The presentation of the paper is commendable, making complex theoretical concepts accessible without overwhelming the reader with technical intricacies. The largely self-contained nature of the paper and its overall readability are significant strengths. The inclusion of an experimental section in the supplementary materials, which empirically validates the theoretical findings, is also appreciated.
However, a concern arises regarding the novelty of the presented results. Given that several closely related findings have been previously established, it would be beneficial to explicitly clarify the extent to which Theorems 1, 2, and 3 expand upon or generalize prior work. Furthermore, the relationship between the move-making algorithms proposed in this paper (Algorithms 2, 4, and 6) and existing move-making algorithms (such as those in [14,15]) should be delineated. Specifically, what distinguishes the current algorithms, enabling them to offer improved approximation guarantees?
Additional questions pertain to the computational cost of solving the linear program (4) required for move-making and whether this cost is factored into the runtime analysis in the experimental results. Moreover, it is unclear whether Algorithm 6 is indeed the algorithm referred to as HIER in the experimental section of the supplementary materials.
Following the authors' responses, which addressed these concerns, it is evident that this paper constitutes a well-crafted theoretical contribution. By providing theoretical guarantees for the approximation achieved by move-making algorithms, it addresses a significant problem in computer vision. The analysis presented has the potential to inspire the development of novel inference algorithms for other combinatorial problems, underscoring the paper's value and impact.
