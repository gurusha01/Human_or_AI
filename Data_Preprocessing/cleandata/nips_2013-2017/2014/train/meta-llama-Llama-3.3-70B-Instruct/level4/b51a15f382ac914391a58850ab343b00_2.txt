This study presents a novel approach to unsupervised manifold alignment, aiming to establish a shared embedding space where related data points from two distinct but related datasets are mapped to similar locations, such as faces with identical expressions and poses from different subjects. The potential applications of manifold alignment are vast, including mapping between datasets with significantly different appearances and recognition tasks.
Previous methods have typically addressed the matching of structures, where related data points should exhibit similar local geometry, and alignment, which involves identifying related data points, as separate steps. However, the authors argue that this two-step process is suboptimal, particularly in cases of partial matching, and propose a simultaneous learning approach for these steps.
The concept of jointly learning alignment and structure is intriguing and intuitively sensible. The paper also conducts a comprehensive series of experiments and introduces an extension to the Frank-Wolfe integer programming algorithm for alignment optimization. The writing and organization of the paper are of high quality, and the investigation into the effects of using only the structure matching term or the feature matching term is a valuable addition.
Notably, there is a scarcity of prior work on unsupervised manifold matching compared to semi-supervised approaches, with only two studies discussed in the introduction. A question arises regarding the amount of user labeling required to achieve comparable performance using a semi-supervised method, which could impact the significance of the results and the importance of assuming no correspondences. Furthermore, it is worth considering whether the proposed approach can be extended to handle cases where hard assignment is not applicable, and a mapping-based alignment approach, such as the one described in [19], would be more suitable. Overall, this paper proposes a simultaneous learning framework for structure and alignment in unsupervised manifold learning, improving upon prior separate optimization methods, and presents an extended evaluation, including an adaptation of the Frank-Wolfe integer programming algorithm.
