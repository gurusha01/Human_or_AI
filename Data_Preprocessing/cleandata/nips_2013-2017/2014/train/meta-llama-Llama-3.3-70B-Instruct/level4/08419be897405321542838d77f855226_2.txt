This manuscript presents two approaches for identifying simpler symbolic expression trees, namely, an ngram-based method that analyzes sequences of sub-expressions and a recursive neural network (RNN) that generates continuous representations of these trees to predict subtree combination rules. As illustrated in Figure 3, the ngram approach appears to outperform the RNN in two out of three tasks.
Regarding specific evaluation criteria:
Quality - The paper exhibits a high level of technical quality.
Clarity - While the overall narrative is clear, certain sections, such as Section 7.2, are somewhat convoluted and challenging to comprehend.
Originality - The work demonstrates a high degree of innovation in its methodologies.
Significance - However, the practical impact and relevance of these methods are limited, as they address a problem that may not be commonly encountered in real-world computational efficiency optimization scenarios, rendering the significance of the proposed approaches uncertain.
