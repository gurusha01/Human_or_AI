The authors present a novel clustering framework that integrates max-margin constraints to define clusters as a balance between modeling data density and separating observations based on cluster-specific latent projections, utilizing regularized Bayesian inference. This approach is applied to both standard DPGMM and topic modeling, resulting in the proposed DPMMGMM and MMCTM models. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated on synthetic and real datasets, showing improved recovery of ground truth information compared to standard non-parametric mixture modeling (DPGMM and CTM), as measured by normalized mutual information and accuracy.
The proposed framework is intriguing, and the introduction of cluster separation is reasonable and appears to provide significant benefits, potentially warranting publication. The framework extends regularized Bayesian inference, and non-trivial implementation details are provided in the appendix.
However, my primary concern lies in the tuning of regularization strength (c) and margin (l), which significantly impact the results. Although the paper discusses the influence of these parameters, the suggested tuning method seems somewhat ad hoc. It would strengthen the paper to investigate cross-validated tuning versus the proposed heuristic, forming DPMMGMM. Additionally, the optimal parameter setting for MMCTM is unclear, and it is essential to clarify how this was determined. For topic modeling results, the choice of c=9 and l=0.1 appears to be an informed setting, but the selection process is unclear. This should be clarified or the influence of these choices better accounted for, as tuning these parameters seems crucial for the approach's performance.
Minor comments:
Figure 3 requires clarification on the meaning of the lines, which are assumed to represent \eta_k.
Typos: "Gausses" should be "Gaussians", "in the generate process" should be "in the generative process", "needed to sampled" should be "needed to be sampled", "to jointly sampled" should be "to jointly sample", and "many of the the sampling formula are" should be "many of the sampling formulas are".
Overall, the framework is interesting and appears to have utility in extracting ground truth structure, but adequate tuning of tradeoff and margin parameters is essential for its effectiveness.
