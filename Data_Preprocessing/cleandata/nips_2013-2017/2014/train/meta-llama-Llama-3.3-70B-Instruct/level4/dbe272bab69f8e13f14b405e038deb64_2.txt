This paper presents a well-structured and impactful investigation into the inference of synaptic conductance from spike train recordings, substantiated by physiological data validation. 
To further enhance the methodology, it would be beneficial to explore its potential extension in determining network connectivity structures, in conjunction with synaptic conductances, using spike data from a restricted subset of neurons within the network. Relevant studies, such as those by Abarbanel et al and other recent research, provide valuable insights and examples in this area of inquiry. 
Overall, the paper is well-written and significant, offering substantial contributions to the field by inferring synaptic conductance from recorded spike trains, with robust validation from physiological data.
