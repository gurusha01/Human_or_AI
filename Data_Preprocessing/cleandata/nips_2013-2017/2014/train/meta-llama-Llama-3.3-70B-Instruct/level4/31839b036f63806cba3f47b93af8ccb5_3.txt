This paper presents an intriguing approach to addressing the issue of recovering a distribution from knowledge of the generating process and the process leading to missing data. The authors explore a more general class of missingness processes than previously considered, notably by Mohan et al., which yields a novel identification formula. Furthermore, they delve into the identification of causal queries, demonstrating that these can be identified even in scenarios where the observational joint distribution remains unidentified.
The paper is well-structured and clear, although there are several areas that require clarification and improvement, as outlined below.
MAIN COMMENTS:
(1) A crucial premise of the results presented is the availability of knowledge regarding the observation censorship process. However, it is unclear whether such knowledge is readily accessible in typical machine learning applications. Enhancing the main paper with more detailed information about Figure 1, potentially by resizing the figure, would be beneficial.
(2) In Section 2, it is assumed that the missing data processes are based on a fully known population. This assumption excludes certain missing data problems, such as estimating population sizes in animal populations, where the existence of individuals may not be known even if no variables are observed for them.
(3) The term "mgraph" appears to be used inconsistently, sometimes including V variables (as in Figure 1) and other times excluding them (as in Figure 2). Clarification on whether V variables are being omitted in certain graphs and the rationale behind this is necessary.
(4) The restriction that R variables cannot be parents of variables in V or U in mgraphs warrants explanation, especially given that R variables are treated as real quantities rather than mere indicators. Justification for this restriction, whether for convenience or based on theoretical grounds, should be provided.
(5) The term "neighbor," introduced at the bottom of page 4, lacks a definition. Including a clear definition would enhance the readability and understanding of the paper.
(6) On page 8, the first paragraph references the "rectification" of observations by Garcia. It is essential to clarify whether Garcia et al.'s work assumes positivity, a condition inherent in the authors' definition of recoverability. If Garcia et al. do not assume positivity, their approach might necessitate a stronger condition.
(7) The statement on page 8 that the Maximum Likelihood method yields consistent estimates under the Missing At Random (MAR) assumption is overly vague. A more detailed explanation of why maximum likelihood cannot be applied to the missingness processes described in the paper would be beneficial.
MINOR COMMENTS:
- Page 1, line 33: The phrase "can bias outcomes" could be rephrased for clarity.
- Page 2, Figure 1: A typo ("Qualifications") should be corrected.
- Page 2, Example 1, and page 3, line 158: The equation P(Y |X,Z,R_y) = P(X,Z) should be corrected to P(Y|X,Z) on the RHS.
- Page 3, line 168: The notation Y || R | X,Z should be specified as Y || R_y | X,Z for precision.
- Page 3, line 214: The condition (ii) R^{part} ={R^{(1)},R^{(2)}, \ldots , R^N} should be corrected to R^{(N)}.
- Page 3, line 215: "R^j respectively" should be formatted as R^{(j)} for consistency.
- Page 4, Corollary 1: It is noted that this does not contain partially observed variables, which could be a point of discussion.
- Page 6, Footnote 2: A reference for the variable-level definition mentioned would be a valuable addition.
Overall, the paper is technically sound and builds upon earlier work in an interesting manner. However, clarifying the points mentioned above would significantly enhance its clarity and applicability.
