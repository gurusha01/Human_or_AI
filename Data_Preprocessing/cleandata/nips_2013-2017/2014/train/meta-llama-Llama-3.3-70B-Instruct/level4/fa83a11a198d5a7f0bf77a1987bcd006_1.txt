This paper presents a compelling combination of theoretical, simulated, and real-world results, making it a notable contribution. However, there are several key issues that need to be addressed, along with some minor concerns.
Major concerns:
-- The selection of lambda can be done through cross-validation (CV) or a theoretical tool. If the theoretical tool is parameter-free, it offers a clear advantage. Nevertheless, the presence of a truncation parameter in this manuscript introduces uncertainty. Specifically, the method for choosing 'b' and the robustness of the results to this choice are not adequately discussed. For this method to become a standard approach, it is essential to provide guidance on selecting 'b' and demonstrating the robustness of the results to this choice.
-- Given that the primary justification for using this method over CV is computational efficiency, it is crucial to acknowledge the trade-off between accuracy and time that practitioners often face. While this method is indeed faster than CV, assuming an appropriate choice of 'b', its accuracy compared to CV needs to be evaluated. If the method is significantly less accurate, the time savings may not be substantial enough to justify its use. For instance, in the real-data example, using the average class covariances for other subjects could provide a fast, parameter-free, and potentially equally accurate alternative.
Minor concerns:
-- Equation 5 mentions 'b' as a constant satisfying certain properties as a function of 'n'. It would be beneficial to formally clarify the assumptions on 'b' and provide a more detailed explanation of 'b' itself, including the definition of the truncation kernel.
-- The statement "we will provide a complementary analysis on the behavior of the estimator for finite n" could be rephrased to "complementary theoretical analysis" to avoid potential confusion, as the current wording might suggest a solely numerical analysis.
-- A minor formatting issue is noted on line 206, where a space is missing.
-- Regarding Theorem 1, additional explanation of the relative sizes of the three biases would be helpful. Since the biases are functions of 'b', 'n', 's', and covariances, visual aids such as plots or heatmaps could effectively illustrate the relative magnitudes of these biases. For example, a heatmap showing the difference between bias(San) and bias(BC) for fixed 'n' while varying 'b' and 's', or for a fixed function 'b_n' while varying 'n' and 's', would be informative.
-- The simulation setting is not clearly explained and requires further clarification, including equations and notation. Specifically, the notation for the 'parameter matrix' and the meaning of '/' need to be defined. Additionally, the abbreviation 'cmp' is unclear and could be expanded for better understanding.
-- A supplementary figure to justify the claim made in footnote 4 would be beneficial.
-- The statement "We average over R multivariate" lacks specificity regarding the value of 'R' used in these simulations.
-- A more detailed justification for estimating a covariance matrix from an AR process rather than the dynamics matrix is necessary. Although the manuscript eventually demonstrates a significant application that justifies this approach, a clearer explanation earlier on would be helpful. Overall, this paper has the potential to become a new standard, provided that guidance on choosing 'b' is offered, the performance is shown to be robust to this choice, and the accuracy is not significantly worse than that of cross-validation.
