This paper introduces the additive factorial Hidden Markov Model (AFHMM) with signal aggregate constraints (SAC) as a solution to the blind source separation problem, formulating a convex quadratic problem for the relaxed AFHMM with SAC. The approach yields promising outcomes on both synthetic and real-world data.
Strengths:
- The paper is well-structured and grounded in solid mathematical principles.
- The motivation behind addressing the problem is clearly articulated.
- The evaluation results demonstrate a significant improvement in performance metrics, including NDE and SAE.
Suggestions for improvement:
- The comparison of results primarily focuses on AFHMM without SAC and AFAMAP, both of which utilize less data than SACAFHMM, potentially leading to an unfair assessment. It would be beneficial to explore other methods that could incorporate SAC but may not be as computationally efficient.
- Figure 1's results appear unclear, suggesting that AFAMAP outperforms SACAFHMM at distances exceeding 10^4. This discrepancy raises questions about the potential for poorly chosen constraints to drastically degrade performance, contradicting the discussion's implication of consistently superior results.
- The incorporation of more complex constraints into the algorithm, such as mutual exclusivity (e.g., simultaneous use of heater and cooler being impossible) or limited resource usage (e.g., no more than 3 out of 10 bulbs being active at once), could enhance the model's applicability. Additionally, time-constrained devices (e.g., grinders with less than 10 minutes of operation) could be considered. The possibility of extending the algorithm to accommodate various types of constraints is an area worthy of exploration. While the paper is well-written and effectively motivates the problem, future research directions could involve broadening the model to incorporate a wider range of constraints.
