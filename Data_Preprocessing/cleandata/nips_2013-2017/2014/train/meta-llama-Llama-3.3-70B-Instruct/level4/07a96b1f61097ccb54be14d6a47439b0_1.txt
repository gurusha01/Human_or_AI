This manuscript tackles the challenge of accurately estimating the low-dimensional subspace from contaminated observations that exhibit inherent coherence. A notable limitation of existing Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) methods is their deteriorating performance as data coherence increases. The authors of this paper adeptly overcome this hurdle. Given the prevalence of cluster structures in real-world data, resolving this issue has substantial practical implications. The proposed approach is not only grounded in theory but also empirically demonstrated to be effective.
One aspect that piques my interest is whether the proposed methodology could be extended to address subspace clustering or segmentation problems. I would appreciate it if the authors could offer their insights on this matter.
This paper makes a significant contribution to the field of robust PCA by addressing a crucial problem. The overall quality of the manuscript is excellent, and I strongly recommend its acceptance.
