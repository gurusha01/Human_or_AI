The authors propose a convolutional filter-based approach for preprocessing calcium imaging signals, achieving comparable performance to a top-performing algorithm in a recent competition for predicting neural connectivity. Notably, their method is likely to be more robust than the competition's grid search-based preprocessing, making it particularly relevant to a subset of the NIPS community.
1) To enhance the clarity of the key result, it is suggested that the plots of f, n, and y in Figure 1c be revised for better visualization. Currently, the thick line widths and overlap make it challenging to discern the relationships between f and y, which are the crucial findings of this paper.

On page 6, a typo is present, where "fluoresce" should be corrected to "fluorescence". This paper contributes a valuable method for preprocessing calcium imaging data through learned convolution filters, which is expected to appeal to NIPS community members working with such data.
