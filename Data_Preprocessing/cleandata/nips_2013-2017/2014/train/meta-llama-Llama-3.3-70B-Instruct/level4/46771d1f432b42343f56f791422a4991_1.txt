This manuscript examines the communication cost associated with distributed estimation for a d-dimensional spherical Gaussian distribution characterized by an unknown mean and unitary covariance, with the joint distribution modeled as a product of individual coordinate distributions. By extending prior research on one-dimensional cases, as seen in [4], the authors propose both upper and lower bounds for d-dimensional data under two distinct communication paradigms: interactive and simultaneous communication settings, with the goal of achieving minimax squared loss. These findings elucidate the tradeoffs between data dimensionality and communication costs in distributed estimation scenarios. Furthermore, the authors derive enhanced bounds for instances where the unknown mean exhibits s-sparse characteristics.
While the underlying model may be considered somewhat constrained due to assumptions such as a product distribution for each coordinate and a known covariance matrix, the paper contributes valuable insights into the communication costs and protocol design for distributed estimation. The technical analysis presented is robust, and several heuristic protocols are proposed with the objective of attaining the established communication lower bounds.
One minor critique of this paper is its presentation. Notably, the introduction is overly lengthy, and the absence of a conclusion section is noteworthy. It is recommended that the authors refine the introductory section and incorporate a conclusion to succinctly summarize their contributions. Additionally, the inconsistency in notation between the main manuscript and the supplementary materials was found to be distracting, as it hindered the seamless referencing of the supplementary file for clarification on specific points. For instance, Lemmas 1 and 2 in the main paper are identical to Lemmas 3 and 4 in the supplementary file. This study investigates the bounds on communication costs in distributed estimation and proposes several protocols aimed at achieving these lower bounds. The authors deliver a thorough analysis of the subject matter, yielding significant results.
