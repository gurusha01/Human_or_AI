The authors introduce an expectation loss support vector machine (E-SVM) that effectively handles continuous attributes of positive instances in learning problems, with a specific application to learning visual segmentation classifiers under weak supervision. The proposed methodology is extensively validated through experiments on both semantic segmentation and object detection, yielding promising outcomes. This paper tackles a crucial issue in visual learning under weak supervision, presenting a clear, well-motivated narrative and conducting interesting, well-executed experiments. While the technical approach builds upon the standard multiple instance learning framework by substituting binary weights with soft weighting of positives, its applicability in both observed and latent settings constitutes a meaningful contribution suitable for NIPS. The E-SVM method demonstrates the capability to manage continuous attributes of positive instances and apply this to visual segmentation classifiers under weak supervision, showcasing good motivation, a clear presentation, and relevant results for both semantic segmentation and object detection.
