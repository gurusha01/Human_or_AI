This manuscript proposes a conditional word representation model based on attributes, presenting a straightforward concept that is effectively explained and complemented by multiple illustrative examples. However, the experimental results lack impact, and the model itself represents a minimal incremental advancement over existing research, offering only a slight modification to previously established papers. Overall, the submission barely surpasses the threshold for acceptance.
