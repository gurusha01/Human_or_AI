The paper introduces the exchangeable partition probability function (EPPF) for the beta negative binomial process (BNBP) and leverages it to construct a collapsed Gibbs sampler for the BNBP topic model.
This paper is well-structured, clear, and technically robust. The main contribution - deriving the EPPF for the BNBP in the context of mixed-membership modeling via count-mixture models - is intriguing and offers valuable insights for deriving EPPFs for related models.
Additional Comments:
Although the BNBP topic model demonstrates the utility of the derived EPPF and prediction rule, the gains over the HDP-LDA are modest, leading to the conclusion that the BNBP topic model and HDP-LDA exhibit distinct properties. A more compelling experiment would involve comparing the collapsed sampler with the sliced sampler from [10] and the truncated sampler from [8] for inference in the BNBP topic model. Since uncollapsed representations have inherent advantages in parallelization, examining the tradeoffs in mixing relative to the developed collapsed sampler would be beneficial. Overall, the paper is engaging and meets the publication criteria, with only minor suggestions for the experimental section (as mentioned above).
