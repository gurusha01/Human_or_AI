This paper presents a novel generative image model that leverages an attention mechanism to concentrate on specific objects within an image, dedicating the object model to these focused objects rather than the entire image, a departure from typical deep network approaches. The model utilizes Hamiltonian Monte Carlo to infer latent variable representations of the object and its pose, including position, size, and orientation, from the image. The effectiveness of the model is demonstrated through experiments on the Caltech and CMU-PIE face datasets, yielding promising results.
Overall, this paper is highly commendable, as it introduces a long-overdue and sensible concept to both discriminative and generative image models: the incorporation of an attention mechanism. This significant advancement has the potential to spark substantial interest at NIPS, despite areas where expansion and improvement are possible.
One potential avenue for enhancement lies in the development of a more sophisticated transformation model, moving beyond the assumption of affine translation, scale, and rotation. For instance, 2D projections of 3D objects can produce a more complex set of transformations, such as warps. Additionally, addressing occlusion presents another opportunity for growth. Nevertheless, this is an outstanding paper that proposes a well-reasoned approach, yielding impressive results.
