This paper proposes an extension of low-rank spectrogram-factorization models for sound decomposition, allowing for the generalization of latent factors over any set of bases, including those that are overcomplete and multiresolution, such as tonal and transient bases. This approach is expected to improve source separation and denoising capabilities. The method builds upon the Gaussian Composite Model introduced by Fevotte et al., which utilizes low-rank matrix factorization to model the variance of spectrogram cells. However, it expands the implicit convolution with multiple Gabor impulse responses to provide a time-domain expression that can be adapted for various sets of impulse responses, including non-orthogonal ones. An Expectation-Maximization (EM) analysis procedure is also presented to estimate the model parameters.
Quality: The idea presented is intriguing, although its full implications are not immediately clear. At first glance, it appears to offer an alternative perspective on Fevotte's Gaussian Composite Model, with the added benefit of accommodating overcomplete dictionaries. Nevertheless, it is surprising that the introduction of overcomplete dictionaries does not seem to cause significant complications. The correctness of the estimation procedure is assumed, and the analytical effort is impressive, even if the details are challenging to follow.
Clarity: The paper is well-motivated and clearly explained. However, the evaluation is limited, relying on a single illustrative result and a measurement of SNR improvement. The inclusion of sound examples is appreciated, but they are not convincing. The comparison between the proposed method and OMLSA seems unfair due to the difference in duration, and the quality of the speech in the OMLSA example is perceived as higher. Furthermore, the denoising of the music example introduces significant artifacts, which could be mitigated using conventional methods like wavelet shrinkage or Wiener filtering.
Originality: The work heavily relies on the foundation laid by Fevotte et al., although the time-domain interpretation offers a fresh perspective on the existing model.
Significance: The potential impact of applying matrix-factorization techniques to overcomplete bases appears substantial. However, the evaluation and examples provided are insufficient to demonstrate the significance of this work. The reformulation of probabilistic matrix-factorization sound analysis in terms of time-domain kernels enables EM analysis for multiresolution bases, but the thin evaluation and notable artifacts in the examples fail to substantiate its importance in its current form.
