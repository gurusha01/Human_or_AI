This paper proposes an extension of Locally Weighted Regression (LWR) by introducing a novel weighting scheme, where individual data points are weighted by each local model, rather than combining local models using a weighted loss function. By imposing a Gaussian prior on the model coefficients, the local models are transformed into Gaussian Processes (GP). The authors first present a batch version of the algorithm, assuming fixed centers for the local models, and then introduce an incremental version, which adopts a Bayesian approach by utilizing old posteriors as new priors, allowing for the addition of new models.
Quality and Clarity
The paper is well-structured and clearly written, making it easy to follow the transition from LWR to the proposed Local Gaussian Process (LGP) approach.
The experimental results, obtained from learning the inverse dynamics of a SARCOS arm and a KUKA arm in a robotic setup, demonstrate that LGP outperforms Locally Weighted Projection Regression (LWPR), a state-of-the-art method in inverse dynamics learning. Notably, LGP achieves better performance with fewer local models.
Although the authors reference the article "Local Gaussian process regression for real time" [16], the connection between the presented method and this prior work is not thoroughly discussed. A more in-depth comparison with [16], particularly in the experimental results, would be valuable.
Originality and Significance
The novel weighting scheme for local models appears to be an original contribution, and the experimental results underscore the significance of the proposed method. By extending LWR with this new weighting approach, the authors have developed a method that outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithm, highlighting the potential impact of this work.
