This manuscript presents innovative conditions that are both necessary and sufficient to determine the inferability of a causal query from data when missing observations are present. By integrating the mechanism generating missing data into the causal diagram, it expands on earlier research. The clarity of the writing is notable, and although the work leverages previous studies using a similar methodology, the reviewer believes that the new perspectives offered make a significant addition to the current understanding of causal mechanisms when data is incomplete. Overall, the paper is well-focused and clearly articulated.
