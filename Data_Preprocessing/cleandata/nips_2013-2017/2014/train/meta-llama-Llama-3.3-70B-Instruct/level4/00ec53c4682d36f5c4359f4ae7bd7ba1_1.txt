This paper presents a novel approach to tackling discriminative tasks using video inputs by employing a dual convolutional neural network architecture. One network processes an appearance frame, while the other utilizes a stack of densely computed optical flow features as input. Each network is trained independently to classify its respective input, and the final prediction for a video is derived by computing a weighted average of the predictions from both networks.
The proposed model is evaluated on two datasets, yielding impressive results that are comparable to, or rival, state-of-the-art methods that rely heavily on hand-crafted features.
The strengths of this paper include:
- The simplicity and effectiveness of the convolutional net application, which achieves notable results.
- The innovative use of optical flow features as input for vision tasks, deviating from the conventional approach of learning features directly from pixels. This contribution is particularly significant, as it demonstrates the utility of optical flow fields in action recognition.
However, the model also exhibits some weaknesses:
- The limitation of only considering fixed-length (L=10) adjacent frames, rather than modeling the overall sequence of actions throughout the entire video.
In terms of quality, the experimental design is robust. Nevertheless, it would be beneficial for the authors to provide a more in-depth analysis of error modes, such as identifying specific classes or groups of classes that the model struggles to classify accurately. Additionally, characterizing the types of videos that pose challenges for the model would offer valuable insights.
The paper is well-structured and clearly written, with a concise explanation of the model. The application of a convolutional net to optical flow features is a novel concept. The significance of this approach lies in its potential to substantially impact research in utilizing videos and motion for various vision-related problems. The model's simplicity and promising results make it a notable contribution, and the use of optical flow features as inputs to a convolutional net is a pioneering effort.
