The paper explores the issue of identifiability in the presence of various mechanisms for missing data, building upon the framework established by Mohan and others. It enhances some existing results and provides insightful examples, such as the identifiability of causal distributions even when conditional distributions are not available.
Quality
The technical quality of the paper appears to be high, with complex but seemingly accurate results. Certain results, like Theorem 3, are well-presented and easy to understand. However, some improvements are incremental and do not contribute to a broader understanding of the subject. Section 3 seems disconnected from the rest of the paper, with Theorem 1 being particularly difficult to comprehend, and bears some resemblance to the Markov blanket results found in Richardson (2009). The quality improves in later sections, with Section 5 offering clear answers and Section 6 presenting interesting results on causal queries.

Clarity
This is a significant weakness of the paper. The amount of material presented may be too extensive for a conference paper, as evidenced by the dense text and the substantial 13-page technical appendix. The article lacks a clear flow, making it challenging to follow, and might be more suitable as a longer, more detailed journal paper.
While finding suitable notation for numerous quantities is a challenge, the current notation could be improved. The use of the same capital 'V' to denote different objects can be confusing, and the subscripts are sometimes illegible. For instance, the distinction between Vi as a vertex and Vo as a set of vertices is particularly confusing. The set equation in Corollary 1 exemplifies poor presentation.

Originality and Significance
Sections 5 and 6 are clear, interesting, and potentially significant. The paper addresses an important problem and contains genuinely interesting and useful results. 
It might be beneficial to take a step back and analyze the general case, aiming to develop a comprehensive criterion for identifiability within this framework, similar to what was achieved for finding causal effects without missingness. It is difficult to imagine a statistician searching through a series of papers to find a specific result that demonstrates (non)-identifiability of the causal effect they are interested in, especially if the result is as complex as Theorem 1.
Theorem 2 and Corollary 1 seem to employ a form of inverse probability weighting, likely due to the conditioning sets being Markov blankets for R(i) in the mixed graphs used. The work of Richardson (2003) and (2009) may be relevant.

Other Comments
On page 4, line 214, R^part is a partition of R, not "a set containing partitions." The condition on line 214 should be that Rx and Ry "belong to distinct elements of the partition."
The language is sometimes informal, such as the use of 'oftentimes.' On page 4, line 213, it would be better to use \leftrightarrow instead of <-->.
It is unclear whether Garcia (2013) is incorrect or simply uses a different framework.
A notation for graphs constructed by severing edges is used in Definition 4 and Theorem 4 but is not defined anywhere. The terms Vo and Vm are used before they are defined, which seems unnecessary.
