This paper presents a novel two-stage noisy voting model, theoretically establishing that uniform teams are prone to errors, whereas diverse teams achieve perfection as the number of agents increases. The experimental results in the Computer Go domain align with the theoretical analysis.
The paper is well-structured, and the findings are robust and intriguing, offering both theoretical and methodological contributions:
1. The authors demonstrate that diverse voting can outperform uniform voting under the proposed noise models (PD-alpha, PM-alpha, PPM-alpha), and they show that these assumptions are mild by proving that three classical noise models satisfy all assumptions, making the theorem widely applicable.
2. The experimental approach, which involves automatically generating diverse agents and extracting move rankings from algorithms, is practical and effective.
However, several concerns need to be addressed:
1. The paper's novelty should be clearly stated in comparison to Marcolino et al. (2013), highlighting the technical contributions and distinguishing features of this work.
2. Although the authors acknowledge a potential gap between figure (a) and the main theorem, the noticeable drop in winning rate for diverse+Copeland suggests that diverse voting performance may not be robust under certain voting rules. More comprehensive experimental results would provide valuable insights into this issue. The authors should provide a more detailed explanation of the computational cost and consider employing techniques to mitigate it.
3. The state dependence in Go, which deviates from the i.i.d. assumption, renders the main results of this paper less suitable for the Go domain.
Minor suggestions include:
1. Specifying the domain of phi in the Mallows model.
2. Adding a bullet point for the Plackett-Luce model.
3. Using an alternative notation for the copy number in uniform voting, as "k" is currently used to indicate positions.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the results are interesting. The authors should clearly articulate their technical contribution in relation to a closely related reference to enhance the paper's impact.
