This manuscript presents a novel signal recovery algorithm that integrates the strengths of continuous basis pursuit (CBP) and orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP). The proposed approach selects basis vectors from the left singular vectors of the singular value decomposition (SVD) of a dictionary matrix, enabling more effective interpolation of data points between grid points. Simulation results demonstrate that the SVD basis surpasses the performance of traditional Taylor and Polar bases. Furthermore, drawing inspiration from orthogonal matching pursuit, the algorithm employs a greedy strategy to recover the time bins of occurrence for each waveform and transitions to the Fourier domain to achieve more accurate estimates of time shifts. The paper is well-organized and appears to offer a fresh contribution to the field, with the new algorithm exhibiting superior performance compared to existing methods, representing a significant advancement in signal recovery techniques.
