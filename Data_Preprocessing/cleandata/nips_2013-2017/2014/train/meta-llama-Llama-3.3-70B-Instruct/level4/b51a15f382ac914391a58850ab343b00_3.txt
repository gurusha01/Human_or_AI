This paper addresses the well-established problem of manifold alignment, where two datasets are assumed to reside on a single manifold without known correspondences. Building upon prior work, such as Wang and Mahadevan's study (IJCAI 2009) and subsequent research, the authors introduce a more advanced loss function that combines three key terms: geometry matching, feature matching, and geometry preservation. This approach leads to a complex non-convex optimization problem, which the authors tackle using a convex relaxation technique based on alternating projections, leveraging the Frank-Wolfe algorithm to solve the resulting quadratic integer programming problem.
The paper presents an extensive experimental evaluation, comparing the proposed method to existing techniques, including Wang and Mahadevan's work, and demonstrates substantially improved performance on various synthetic and moderately complex real-world datasets. The results indicate a significant advancement over previous research.
However, a major limitation of this study is the assumption that both datasets lie on a single underlying manifold, which may not accurately represent most real-world datasets that often reside on complex mixtures of manifolds. While techniques for addressing alignment in such scenarios are emerging, they appear to be outside the scope of this paper. It would be intriguing to explore whether the proposed approach can be extended to accommodate more realistic settings. The authors propose a novel method for unsupervised alignment of datasets on a single manifold, showcasing improved performance over prior methods, although the single-manifold assumption remains a restrictive limitation.
