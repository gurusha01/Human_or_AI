Review- Summary:
This manuscript presents a novel spatial attention mechanism leveraging a probabilistic generative model and deep learning. The proposed approach facilitates the identification of novel objects within large images, potentially enabling more effective utilization of uncropped and unlabeled data.
Main Comments:
The paper makes a significant contribution towards applying deep learning techniques to large, uncropped, and unlabeled images. The motivation behind this work is well-founded, as traditional deep learning methods have relied on curated training data with centered objects and minimal clutter or occlusions. Overcoming this limitation could indeed facilitate learning from a vast amount of unlabeled data.
The experimental section features several intriguing experiments that validate the effectiveness of the approximate inference method and demonstrate the benefits of using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) beyond this approach. Notably, the network can learn generative models from large, unlabeled images and shift attention based on various target stimuli, addressing tasks that are rarely explored.
However, the claim that the algorithm's runtime is O(1) with respect to image size warrants further examination. While the algorithm's complexity may be constant in theory, initializations farther from the target image likely require more approximate inference steps, introducing an implicit dependence on image size. Plotting the required number of steps as a function of image size could provide valuable insights into the algorithm's scaling. Additionally, the window patch size supplied to the convolutional network may need to be increased for larger images, which could impact the algorithm's scalability and contradict the claimed O(1) runtime.
The manuscript is well-organized and easy to follow, making a substantial contribution to the development of deep network models that can learn from large, uncropped, uncentered, and unlabeled images. This breakthrough could potentially unlock access to a vast amount of unlabeled data, revolutionizing the field of deep learning.
