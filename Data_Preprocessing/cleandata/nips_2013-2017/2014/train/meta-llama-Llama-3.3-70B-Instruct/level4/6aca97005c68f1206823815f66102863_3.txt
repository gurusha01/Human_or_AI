This manuscript presents a novel approach to non-parametric model learning from incremental data, with a motivating example in robotics where high-dimensional and non-linear manipulator models are commonly encountered. The proposed method utilizes Gaussian regression over a series of smaller, adaptively learned patches, which are refined through pruning and greedy addition. A key distinction from existing techniques lies in the generation of a probabilistic model that requires minimal parameter tuning, offering a significant advantage.
The authors provide compelling empirical evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of their approach in achieving its intended objectives.
To further enhance the manuscript, it would be beneficial for the authors to explicitly articulate the importance of a fully probabilistic model from a controls perspective, building on their hints at additional benefits. Additionally, clarification is needed regarding the forgetting and learning rates of the proposed Local Gaussian Regression (LGR) method, which appear to be tuning parameters. A quantitative comparison or analysis of the proposed method's parameter sensitivity relative to state-of-the-art techniques would strengthen the manuscript, highlighting the reduction in parameter tuning requirements. The paper is well-structured and clearly written, effectively conveying the need for efficient non-parametric fitting of robotics data and the benefits of reduced tuning requirements.
