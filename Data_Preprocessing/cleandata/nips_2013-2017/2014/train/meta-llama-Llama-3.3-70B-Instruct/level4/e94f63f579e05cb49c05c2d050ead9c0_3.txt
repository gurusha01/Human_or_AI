This manuscript proposes a Bayesian quadrature method leveraging a square root transform and active learning technique, alongside two approximation approaches for the Gaussian process prior: linearization and moment matching. Additionally, a straightforward active sampling strategy is employed to enhance computational efficiency.
The paper is clearly and effectively written, serving as a valuable educational resource, particularly for those unfamiliar with Bayesian quadrature like myself. However, the experimental section raises some concerns. Notably, the authors' decision not to compare their method with existing Bayesian quadrature techniques makes it challenging to assess its relative performance. The comparison is limited to slow MCMC methods, which does not provide a comprehensive understanding of the proposed method's superiority. Furthermore, including the number of points required to match the accuracy of MCMC methods, such as BMC and SMC, would be beneficial for a more thorough evaluation.
Overall, while the paper is well-crafted and contributes to the field of Bayesian quadrature, the experimental section would benefit from additional comparisons and detailed analyses to strengthen the manuscript's conclusions.
