This paper introduces a new algorithm for solving the balanced k-cut problem, leveraging the Lovasz extension of a set function to define the k-cut criterion. By utilizing Lovasz extensions of cuts and normalizing constraints, the authors formulate a relaxation of balanced k-cut functionals, highlighting the relationship between convex Lovasz extensions and submodular set functions. The proposed algorithm minimizes a sum of auxiliary variables, which are lower-bounded by ratios, subject to simplex and unique membership constraints.
In terms of clarity, the paper is well-structured and effectively references prior work. 
Regarding originality, while there is substantial prior research in this area, the novel aspect of this paper lies in its modified optimization strategy. Although the originality is somewhat limited, the paper's significance is justified by its experimental success, making it a potential candidate for publication at NIPS.
The significance of this work is notable, as the new method demonstrates clear superiority, which could lead to a substantial impact in the future, despite its similarities to prior art.
Some minor comments include: Figure 1 contains five subfigures, but the caption only explains four of them; it would be helpful to clarify the purpose of the fifth subfigure.
Overall, the paper presents a promising continuous relaxation for balanced k-cuts, accompanied by a descent algorithm, and the experimental results appear to be very encouraging.
