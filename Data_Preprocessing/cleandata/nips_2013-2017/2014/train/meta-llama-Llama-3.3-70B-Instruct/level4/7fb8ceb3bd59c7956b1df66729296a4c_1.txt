Summary: This outstanding paper presents a well-reasoned model for selecting algorithms based on problem characteristics and Bayesian regression, demonstrating computational effectiveness and superior prediction of human performance compared to existing models.
The paper exemplifies a high-quality NIPS submission, boasting clear writing, an engaging problem statement, and a compelling combination of computational results and a cognitively grounded model, supported by a concise experimental evaluation.
One notable concern is the emphasis placed on the rational aspect of the approach, as the success of the model, both computationally and as a cognitive model, can be attributed to a significant extent to the problem space decomposition into features, rather than the rational inference itself. A comparison with a reinforcement learning model incorporating function approximation, rather than the basic RL model currently considered, would provide a more comprehensive evaluation.
Minor suggestions include:
-Figure 1's font size is excessively small.
-Line 38 should be revised to include the indefinite article "a" before "specialized algorithms".
-Equations 11 and 12 were found to be somewhat opaque and not as straightforward as claimed.
-The paper's rigorous comparison with other algorithms is a notable strength, as such thorough evaluations are not typically undertaken and deserve recognition.
Overall, this paper proposes a robust rational model for algorithm selection, leveraging problem features and Bayesian regression to achieve computational efficacy and improved human performance prediction, outperforming comparable models.
