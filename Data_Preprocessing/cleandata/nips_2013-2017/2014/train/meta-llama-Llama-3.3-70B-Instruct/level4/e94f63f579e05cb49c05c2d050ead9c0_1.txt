Overview: This manuscript proposes a rapid alternative to Monte Carlo (MC) methods for approximating intractable integrals by leveraging the underlying structure of the likelihood surface, which is often neglected in traditional MC approaches.
The core concept of Bayesian quadrature, as presented in this paper, involves modeling the square root of the integrand (i.e., the likelihood or prior) as a Gaussian Process (GP). The authors employ an active sampling strategy, where samples are selected based on the location of maximum expected posterior variance of the integrand. This intuitively targets regions where the model has the least knowledge about the integrand's value, thereby maximizing the potential gain in information.
A key emphasis of the paper is on the computational advantages of their Bayesian Quadrature (BQ) active sampling method over conventional Monte Carlo techniques. The authors demonstrate the application of their method to various problems, including the calculation of marginal likelihoods for Gaussian Process (GP) regression and GP classification.
Quality:
The paper is technically sound, with a well-motivated problem statement, a clearly described method, and a thorough comparison with other numerical integration techniques, showcasing its effectiveness.
Clarity:
The manuscript is well-written and organized, effectively conveying all aspects of the analysis. The authors provide a clear introduction to Bayesian Quadrature and numerical integration, as well as a concise overview of existing similar approaches. They clearly differentiate their method by highlighting their unique contributions, including the use of a square root GP and 'fast active sampling', and provide a detailed explanation of their approach and the solution process.
Originality:
The authors position their method as an improvement over existing Bayesian quadrature techniques, both in terms of speed and accuracy. They highlight two primary contributions: the utilization of a square root GP to model positive functions (such as likelihoods) and the development of 'fast active sampling'. The square root GP approach offers an alternative, less explored method for modeling positive functions. Additionally, the authors provide a thorough discussion on coping with the intractability of inference given a non-linear transformation of a GP, including linearization and moment matching techniques.
Significance:
The paper presents an alternative tool for computing marginal likelihoods, a challenging and crucial task. The utility of this tool is evaluated based on its speed, accuracy, and simplicity of implementation. While the paper offers a competitive solution in terms of these metrics, the long-term significance and potential for inspiring follow-up research remain to be seen. Future research directions enabled by this contribution could further enhance its impact.
Questions and Comments:
- Figure 1: Are the hyperparameters of the GP learned in this example? If a squared exponential covariance is used, how does the length-scale parameter handle the complex section of the function?
- Line 208: How does the log transform compare to the square root transform in terms of performance? It is expected that an unconstrained GP would perform poorly; how does another type of constrained GP fare in comparison?
- Line 264: What is the reason behind the worse performance of the log transform in terms of variance, and is this degradation significant enough to impact the overall scheme?
- Line 303: Is the primary task in this section to integrate over a mixture of Gaussians?
- Figures 8 and 9: Consider presenting the converged values in a table for easier comparison among the different methods (L, M, and AIS).
Overall, this is a well-structured, technically sound paper that introduces a novel method for performing Bayesian Quadrature, offering a promising alternative for approximating intractable integrals.
