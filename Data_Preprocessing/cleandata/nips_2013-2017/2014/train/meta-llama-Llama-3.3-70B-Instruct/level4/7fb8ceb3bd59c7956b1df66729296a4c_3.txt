The authors present a novel approach to modeling algorithm selection as a metacognitive process, wherein the value of computation is maximized by comparing the expected utility of acting after computation to the expected utility without computation. This value is approximated through learning to predict algorithm scores and runtimes based on features selected using Bayesian feature selection. The efficacy of this meta-reasoning is demonstrated in the context of sorting list duration minimization, outperforming two existing methods: one employing decision trees and another utilizing recursive algorithm selection with dynamic programming.
The authors also conduct behavioral experiments where human subjects sort lists using either cocktail sort or merge sort, following provided instructions. By estimating the time required for individual sorting actions from behavioral data, the authors apply their model to predict human algorithm choice for sorting new sequences. The results indicate that human behavior is better predicted by the metacognitive strategy than by previous models of human sorting behavior.
This manuscript stands out as one of the most exceptional papers reviewed in the last three years for NIPS. To further enhance the manuscript, the authors are recommended to provide additional details on the following aspects:
- The process of feature selection using Bayesian model choice, including how it enables efficient computation of Bayes factors.
- The method proposed by Lagoudakis et al., as well as an explanation for its relatively poor performance compared to the proposed approach.
On page 6, the phrase "to an descending list" could be clarified for better understanding. Overall, the manuscript is commendable for formalizing algorithm choice in the context of both machine and human sorting performance, showcasing a significant contribution to the field.
