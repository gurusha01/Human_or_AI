The authors have introduced a novel data-dependent kernel, known as Fredholm kernels, which leverages unlabeled datasets in a natural manner. The kernel's uniqueness is demonstrated through several theoretical properties, and experimental results show that it outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.
The paper is well-structured and clearly presented.
Detailed comments:
1. Is there a systematic method for selecting the kernel width for the Fredholm kernel, such as using cross-validation under certain assumptions?
2. Including toy experiments to illustrate scenarios where the proposed method may not be effective would be beneficial, as it would help to identify the settings in which the method is most effective.
Overall, the paper is engaging, well-written, and clearly presented. I recommend acceptance.
