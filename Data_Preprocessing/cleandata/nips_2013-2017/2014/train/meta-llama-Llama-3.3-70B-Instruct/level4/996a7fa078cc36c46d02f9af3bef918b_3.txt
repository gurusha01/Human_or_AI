This manuscript presents a novel methodology for managing "options" - abstract, high-level actions - within the realm of reinforcement learning, positing that this new methodology offers enhanced efficiency and the distinct advantage of yielding models that are not dependent on the reward function. Furthermore, the approach is demonstrated to be extensible to linear function approximation, with experimental validation conducted across two distinct domains.
The findings of this study represent a substantial progression in the management of options, which intuitively appear to be a natural and potentially robust strategy for navigating complex environments. The clarity of the writing is commendable, and the research undertaken is of a high standard and rigor.
To further augment the manuscript, it would be beneficial for the authors to incorporate an analysis of the computational complexity of their proposed approach, specifically in terms of its temporal and spatial requirements. Additionally, a more comprehensive discussion regarding the potential drawbacks of the methodology, or scenarios where its application may not be suitable, would enhance the paper's overall depth and applicability. The results are significant and the writing is exceptionally clear.
