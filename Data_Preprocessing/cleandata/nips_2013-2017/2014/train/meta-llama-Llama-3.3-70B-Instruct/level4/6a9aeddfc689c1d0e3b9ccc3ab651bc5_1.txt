This manuscript explores alternative approaches to Least Squares (LS) for solving linear regression problems, focusing on the concept of influence in down-weighting observations. Unlike classical statistical methods that rely on score functions to weight observations, which are limited to capturing additive errors and assume a Gaussian distribution, this paper considers the impact of influential points. Notably, while statisticians have long identified and excluded influential outliers, this work appears to be the first to propose an automatic procedure utilizing influence for down-weighting in regression analysis.
The probabilistic model presented in the paper serves as an illustrative example rather than the primary driver of the research. The ease of identifying contaminated versus clean points, particularly in high-dimensional settings where the distributions of clean and contaminated points do not overlap, underscores that the estimator's value lies in its natural formulation rather than its ties to a specific model.
Several suggestions are offered to enhance the manuscript:
1. Include a comparison line representing the accuracy of the Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) for the proposed probabilistic model. This provides a more meaningful baseline than the LS line, especially considering the model is used illustratively. Assuming access to the random variables U for the MLE could offer a lower bound on performance, which becomes tighter as the dimensionality increases.
2. Connect the work to the literature on scoring functions, which dates back to the early 1970s. For instance, the adaptive Robust Weighted Sampling (aRWS) can be seen as down-weighting points by a factor of 1/epsilon^2, analogous to L-1 regression if down-weighting were by 1/epsilon. This corresponds to assuming a double exponential distribution for errors. The weighting function proposed is more stringent, suggesting a connection to a specific error distribution, potentially akin to a Cauchy distribution.
3. Clarify the claim of being the first to suggest weighting by influence, as this is a significant assertion that requires thorough verification.
4. Consider testing the hypothesis that the method effectively uses different regression functions for large versus small observations. This could involve interacting the defined variable tilde-l with all X's in the regression, allowing LS methods to potentially improve by having different slopes for pure X observations versus X+W observations.
5. Engage with the extensive literature on errors in variables and robust regressions to identify relevant connections and support the novelty of the proposed method.
6. Examine the referenced 1980s NBER paper, particularly equations (15) and (16), which bear a resemblance to the estimator used. Pursuing modern references and exploring potential connections to the current work would be beneficial.
In conclusion, this paper contributes a novel approach to robust regression by down-weighting observations based on their influence. With a useful theorem and thoughtful empirical considerations, the work provides a promising alternative. Addressing the suggested areas can further strengthen the manuscript's impact and clarity.
