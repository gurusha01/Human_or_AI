The authors present a novel estimator for covariance matrices that corrects for bias in autocorrelated data, demonstrating its superiority over standard, shrinkage, and Sancetta estimators using simulated and real-world brain-computer interfacing data.
I find the problem addressed by the authors to be intriguing and their contribution significant. However, I encountered difficulties in reading the manuscript and found the real-data experimental results to be less convincing than expected:
* The manuscript lacks a clear introduction to the notation used, which, although largely inferable from context, adds unnecessary complexity to the reader's experience.
* The heuristic adjustment to the Sancetta estimator in Section 2 was not entirely clear to me.
* A more detailed explanation of the bias-corrected estimator in equation (6) would be beneficial. Consider reallocating space from the discussion section, which primarily summarizes the authors' work, to Section 2 for this purpose.
* Key details regarding the decoding procedure in Section 4 are missing, including the number of CSP filters used, the frequency band utilized, and the cross-validation method employed.
* My primary concern with this manuscript is the methodology used for estimating CSP filters and selecting filters for plotting in Figures 6 and 7. It appears that only two trials were used for estimation, and only the two most discriminative filters were selected. This approach deviates from typical practices and may have been chosen to accentuate differences between estimators. Furthermore, the performance differences observed in Figure 7 seem to stem more from variations in CSP component ranking rather than improved spatial filter estimation. Typically, the best six CSP filters are used, which likely include filters for both left and right sensorimotor cortices across all estimators. This could render the decoding performance differences between estimators negligible. To convincingly demonstrate the superiority of the bias-corrected estimator, I would like to see decoding performance comparisons based on CSP filters focusing on the same brain regions.
Minor comments and typos:
* Equation (3) seems to be missing a normalization term.
* In Section 2, "rate of p" should presumably be "rate of n".
* The first sentence of the second paragraph in Section 5 is somewhat convoluted. While the theoretical work is compelling, the experimental results on real data appear to have been optimized for presentation, potentially exaggerating their significance in a practical context.
