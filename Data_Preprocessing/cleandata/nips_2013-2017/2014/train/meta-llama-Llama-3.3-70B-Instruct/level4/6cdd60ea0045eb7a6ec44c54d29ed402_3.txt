This paper presents a robust logistic regression approach that can withstand arbitrary outliers, as suggested by its title. The method's robustness to outliers is thoroughly examined from both theoretical and experimental perspectives.
The theoretical analysis of outlier robustness, as outlined in Theorem 1 and Remark 1, is particularly noteworthy. The estimation algorithm, which combines thresholding and linear programming, is also commendable. However, from a practical standpoint, the method has a significant limitation: it requires the user to pre-specify the number of outliers. This constraint undermines the method's practical applicability, as determining the exact number of outliers in advance can be challenging. The paper would benefit from a discussion on potential strategies to address this issue. Furthermore, it would be informative if the authors explored the performance implications of setting an incorrect number of outliers in the method.
Overall, the paper is well-structured and features impressive theoretical contributions. The work has the potential to make a meaningful impact on the machine learning community, and with some additional considerations, its practical value could be further enhanced.
