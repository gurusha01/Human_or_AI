This manuscript offers a nuanced exploration of time/frequency factorizations, deviating from conventional approaches that rely on analysis coefficients derived from STFT transforms. Instead, it proposes a more adaptable framework applicable to any transform, with a direct connection to the time-domain signal.
The paper's clarity and quality make it accessible to specialists in the field. Its originality exceeds average expectations, although the significance of the work could be more effectively conveyed. A notable limitation lies in the presentation of results and evaluation, as the supplementary materials are not entirely persuasive, and the paper lacks a comparative analysis with preceding methods. While this omission is not a critical flaw, given the inherent value of the theoretical contributions, its inclusion would have substantially enhanced the paper. Overall, the manuscript is well-written, with a robust theoretical foundation, making it a compelling read. Although more comprehensive results and comparisons would have been desirable, the theoretical insights presented are sufficiently intriguing to outweigh this deficiency.
