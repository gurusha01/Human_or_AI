This manuscript explores multi-agent systems that utilize a voting mechanism to combine individual agent decisions for problem-solving. The agents can be viewed as sampling from a noisy distribution centered around the true ranking of alternatives in each state. The authors demonstrate that when agents are identical, producing samples from the same distribution, the system is likely to select a sub-optimal alternative. In contrast, a diverse set of agents can lead to the system choosing optimal alternatives in nearly every state. The paper culminates in an experimental study where agents engage in Go games.
The manuscript is well-structured and clearly written. However, the reviewer struggled to discern the novel contributions beyond existing research that shares similar qualitative findings, such as Marcolino's work, which the authors cite. The primary distinction appears to be that agents can provide a preference ordering for alternatives at each stage, rather than voting for a single alternative.
A minor suggestion is that the experimental section, where diverse agents are generated by modifying parameters of an existing Go-playing agent, could be improved. For readers unfamiliar with the system's details, it is unclear whether this parametrization yields a genuinely diverse set of agents. Although the paper addresses this concern in Appendix H and briefly in section 4, it would be beneficial to include this justification or a reference to Appendix H when introducing the agents. The results are intriguing, but a more comprehensive comparison to related work is necessary to contextualize the findings.
