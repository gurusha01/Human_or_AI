I regret the concise nature of this review, as my initial, more detailed assessment, which included several typos, appears to be lost. 
This manuscript explores the novel application of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to identify mathematical identities. While the concept is innovative, my impression is that the work presented seems preliminary and may not fully meet the standards expected of a NIPS publication. Notably, the method's performance in discovering identities is not particularly noteworthy, even with a highly restricted input set. The expressions used for identity discovery were so limited that a straightforward mathematical approach might have been more efficient than employing DNNs, suggesting an overly complex solution to a relatively simple problem. Although the authors might propose that their method could be generalized to a broader range of expressions, it is unclear whether the current approach can be easily scaled up or if such an extension would be justified given the modest initial results.
Despite finding the paper interesting, I believe it falls slightly short of the publication threshold.
