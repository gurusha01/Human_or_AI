The paper "Inferring sparse representations of continuous signals with continuous orthogonal matching pursuit" presents a concise and well-structured approach that is likely to be of interest to researchers involved in spike sorting. Building upon the work of Ekanadham et al. (2011a,b), the authors propose an alternative basis for decompositions and a different optimization method. They provide a comparison with previous results, demonstrating significant improvements in computational time and evidence of enhanced accuracy in detecting and estimating waveform parameters.
One aspect of the comparison warrants further clarification - the authors' decision to prune waveforms with amplitudes less than 0.3. It is unclear whether this value was optimized or if it corresponds to the lower bound on 'a' in the COMP case. Could the CBP method yield better results if this parameter were increased further? Additionally, the selection process for the lambda value of the L1-penalty is not explicitly stated.
It would be beneficial to visualize hits and misses in separate plots to gain a deeper understanding of the nature of typical errors associated with various methods. Furthermore, it is essential to confirm whether all "hit errors" of COMP are calculated using the "Fourier" method.
Regarding Figure 1, the presentation may be confusing for readers, as the observed original waveform is not accompanied by its reconstructed counterpart. The black shapes in panels 2-4 are not immediately recognizable as non-reconstructions, and expanding the legend would improve clarity. Moreover, the average errors listed in the legend appear to be significantly lower than the values plotted in the figure.
Given the paper's overall quality, it is worth noting a few minor suggestions for revision: 
- Line 41 contains a spurious "the".
- Line 85 includes a superfluous "here".
- Line 153 is missing the theta argument from the sinus function.
- Lines 299 and 300 require index corrections, as j' and n are swapped, and (i,j) appears without introduction.
- Lines 311 and 315 also have swapped indices.
- Line 411 mentions eps=1, but it is unclear if 1 Delta is intended. 
Overall, the paper is well-written and presents a valuable method for spike sorting, making it a worthwhile contribution to the field.
