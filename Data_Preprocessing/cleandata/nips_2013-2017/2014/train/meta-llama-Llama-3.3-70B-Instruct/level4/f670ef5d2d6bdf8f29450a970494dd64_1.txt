Summary: The authors present a novel framework for understanding regularization in optimization problems by constraining parameters to a convex set, denoted as "O", which is derived from the convex hull of points obtained by applying a group action to a fixed vector. This framework allows for the reinterpretation of various regularization techniques, including L1 norm, as the convex hull of points resulting from sign flipping and component permutation of a vector.
The main contributions of the paper are as follows: (A) the authors demonstrate how their framework can be used to derive several regularization techniques; (B) they establish a pre-order relationship between a seed vector and the convex set "O_G(v)"; (C) they show that the convex set "O" can be represented as the ball of an atomic norm under certain conditions; (D) they prove that the L1-sorted norm is equivalent to the dual of the norm associated with the signed-permutation orbitope; (E) they reinterpret the conditional and projected gradient algorithms in the context of orbitopes and provide a method for computing projections onto orbitopes; and (F) they propose a heuristic algorithm that iteratively modifies the shape of the ball-norm associated with the regularizer, generalizing the concept of regularization paths.
Quality: The paper is technically sound, with no errors found. The idea of morphing the regularizer's ball-norm is particularly interesting. However, clarification is needed on the stopping criterion for the continuation algorithm, which terminates when regularization no longer has an effect. Additionally, the authors should discuss the performance of the algorithm when the shape of the ball-norm is modified while keeping its size constant. It would also be beneficial to include a pictorial explanation for Proposition 10, which illustrates the relationship between the dual of the norm associated with signed-permutations and the sorted L1-norm. Furthermore, the authors should elaborate on when and how atomic norms can be represented as orbit regularizers, as shown in Proposition 3.
Clarity: The paper is well-written and clear, with some minor suggestions for improvement. These include adding a missing parenthesis in Line 071, incorporating subscripts in the expression $m({\bf w},{\bf v})$ in lines 244-246, enhancing the quality of the images, and using numbered references. Additionally, the scale on the y-axis in Fig. 4 should be clearly labeled.
Significance: The concept of morphing the regularizer's ball-norm has potential, but the numerical results do not convincingly demonstrate the superiority of the continuation algorithm. The analysis in Fig. 5 is limited to a single example, and the results in Fig. 4 are inconclusive. Reporting the number of iterations required for the continuation algorithm to converge would be beneficial.
Originality: The idea of reinterpreting regularization using orbitopes is novel, and the proposed continuation algorithm, which iteratively modifies the shape of ball-norms, is a new contribution. Although the paper is well-written and technically sound, most of the contributions involve rephrasing existing ideas in the context of orbitopes. The continuation algorithm has the potential to lead to improved solutions, but it lacks guarantees and the numerical results are limited.
