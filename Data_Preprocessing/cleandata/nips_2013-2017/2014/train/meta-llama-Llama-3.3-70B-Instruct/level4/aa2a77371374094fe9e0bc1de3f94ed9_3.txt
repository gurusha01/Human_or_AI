The authors propose a unified framework for low-rank tensor learning, addressing two primary tasks in multivariate spatio-temporal analysis: cokriging and forecasting. They also introduce an efficient greedy algorithm applicable to both tasks.
The strengths of the paper include:
* A well-structured presentation with a solid mathematical basis for the approach, providing a clear understanding of the methodology.
* The authors demonstrate positive outcomes on both synthetic and real-world data, outperforming other algorithms in the literature.
However, there are several areas that require improvement:
* The selection process for tuning parameters across different algorithms and datasets is not clearly explained, which could impact the reproducibility of the results.
* The scalability of this approach to higher-dimensional data (beyond three dimensions) is uncertain and warrants further investigation.
* The results presented in Tables 1 and 2, which utilize multiple-fold cross-validation, lack confidence intervals, making it difficult to assess the statistical significance of the findings.
* An interesting potential extension of the forecasting approach could involve anomaly detection in climate data, such as identifying hurricanes or droughts, which would enhance the practical applicability of the method.
* The comparison in Table 2, where the Tucker algorithm outperforms the Ortho algorithm on USHCN data, deserves a more in-depth discussion to understand the underlying reasons and the significance of these results.
Additionally, there are a few minor typographical errors:
- On page 1, "Oftentimes" should be replaced with "Often times".
- Throughout pages 1 and 7, "five folds cross validation" should be corrected to "five-fold cross validation".
The paper provides a robust mathematical foundation for learning low-rank tensors from spatio-temporal data. A valuable addition would be a discussion on the importance of cokriging and forecasting, particularly in the context of the datasets used in the study, to further motivate the research.
