This paper is well-structured and effectively introduces the reader to the domain of DC programming and its potential applications in reinforcement learning. However, the long-term usefulness of this approach remains uncertain. A significant concern is that DC programming is not typically recognized for its computational efficiency. Moreover, the consistency results presented in Section 3 appear to have a narrow scope, including even the discussed application to a specific class of stochastic MDPs. Although the computational experiments demonstrate some promise, they are limited to simple, low-dimensional (2D) problems.
Some minor observations include:
* In the final paragraph of page 3, the correction from "manly" to "mainly" is necessary, and the inconsistent use of "+" in "+\inf" should be addressed.
* In the second paragraph of page 4, it seems more appropriate to use "too large" instead of "too important".
* Section 6 suggests that boosting could be a distinguishing feature of DCA, but it is unclear why boosting cannot be applied to other reinforcement learning algorithms as well.
Overall, this is an early-stage exploration of a novel algorithmic approach in the field of reinforcement learning, and its ultimate utility remains to be seen.
