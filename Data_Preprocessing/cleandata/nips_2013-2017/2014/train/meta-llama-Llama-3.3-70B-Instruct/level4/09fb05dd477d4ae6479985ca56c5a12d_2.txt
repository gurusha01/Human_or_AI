The authors have introduced a framework for adapting deep neural networks, initially trained for image classification tasks, to object detection tasks. The evaluation of this method on the ImageNet LSVRC-2013 dataset shows promising results, with the proposed approach ranking 4th in the object detection challenge. The paper is well-organized, easy to understand, and presents an interesting and straightforward CNN structure. Overall, the paper's quality is satisfactory. However, there are two key areas that require improvement.
Firstly, the adaptation method, which is the primary contribution of this work, lacks comprehensive justification. The underlying motivations and principles are not clearly articulated. For instance, in Section 3.2 (Page 5, Line 231), the rationale behind summing $Wj^c$ and $W{avg}$ to obtain the weights for the adapted detection task is unclear, and the physical significance of the 'offset parameter' is not adequately explained. Consequently, the superiority of the kNN variant over other methods is also not well-justified.
Secondly, the comparison with other methods is compromised by the use of only a portion of the validation set, rather than the test set, which undermines the fairness of the comparison. Although the authors mention in a footnote (Line 322) that RCNN exhibits similar performance on the val2 set, the small size of this set means that the observed performance gain lacks statistical significance. In summary, while the proposed framework demonstrates comparable performance to state-of-the-art models, the comparisons are conducted under different settings, and a more detailed explanation of the adaptation method is necessary to strengthen the paper.
