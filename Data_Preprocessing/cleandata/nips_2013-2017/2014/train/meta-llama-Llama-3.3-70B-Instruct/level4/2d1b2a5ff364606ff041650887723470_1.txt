This manuscript presents a novel approach to blind source separation by formulating the problem as an additive factorial Hidden Markov Model (HMM) with signal aggregate constraints (SACs). The incorporation of additional domain knowledge enables improved separation of time series into components, as demonstrated through the example of energy disaggregation. By leveraging information about total expected usage of each appliance in a time period, the components of domestic energy use can be more accurately separated. The objective function, which maximizes the log of the posterior distribution of the hidden chains given the observed data, is transformed into a convex optimization problem. The efficacy of this method is validated using both a synthetic dataset and real data from domestic energy output readings.
The paper exhibits technical soundness, with a robust simulation section. The proposed method outperforms regular AFMM and AFAMAP, which do not incorporate SACs, with significant improvements confirmed by t-tests. The optimization speed is also shown to be comparable to AFAMAP. However, it is unclear why a low noise variance was used in the toy example; clarification on this point would be beneficial, as it may make the problem setup appear overly simplistic. Additionally, comments on the signal-to-noise ratio between mains readings and aggregate appliance output in the energy application would be appreciated.
The theoretical aspects of the paper are well-presented and structured. Nevertheless, a formal proof confirming the convexity of the final procedure in equation (6) would strengthen the manuscript, as the provided reasoning is not entirely convincing. Theoretical scaling arguments, with respect to data length and number of hidden states, would also complement the simulation findings and provide insight into the method's tractability for larger datasets and state spaces. A comparison with AFAMAP in this regard would be particularly useful.
The manuscript is well-written and structured, with a clear introduction that motivates the problem and provides a concise overview of relevant literature. However, a minor potential error was noted on page 4, line 202, in the unnumbered equation preceding equation (6), where the subscripts proceeding the object p may require revision for consistency with earlier notation. To the best of my knowledge, the work presented is novel and original, although its significance to the HMM community and energy application may require further evaluation by an expert.
The authors' responses to my questions during the feedback phase were satisfactory, and I encourage them to incorporate similar clarifications into the next version of the manuscript. Overall, this paper proposes a highly effective method for blind source separation using additive factorial HMMs with signal aggregate constraints, demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, particularly in the context of energy disaggregation.
