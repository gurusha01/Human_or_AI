This manuscript presents a novel sampling algorithm for Factorial Hidden Markov Models (FHMMs), addressing the limitation of the standard forward filtering backward sampling approach, which becomes computationally infeasible for exact sampling from the joint distribution of all random variables in the hidden chain. A common workaround involves sampling one or a few chains at a time while keeping others fixed, but this method restricts the ability to make multiple changes across several chains in a single sampling pass.
The proposed algorithm, Hamming Ball Auxiliary Sampling, offers a solution by introducing an auxiliary variable U, sampled from the Hamming ball of a specified radius around the current sample X of all hidden chain variables. The Hamming ball is defined as the set of all joint chain variables at any time step within a Hamming distance of m from the current sample. The sample X is then resampled conditionally on U, ensuring that at least 2*m bits are flipped between two samples of X.
The paper is well-structured and clearly explains the algorithm, accompanied by a thorough empirical evaluation. However, it is essential to acknowledge that the proposed sampling algorithm may not alleviate the issue of converging to local maxima when two parallel chains have very similar states, resulting in duplicated features. This concern should be addressed, potentially around line 126.
One notable omission is the lack of detailed algorithmic information on the efficient implementation of the proposed sampler, particularly regarding the sampling process from the Hamming ball. The inclusion of a separate section on implementation, potentially with accompanying code, would strengthen the manuscript (line 197).
The content between lines 215 and 230 could be relocated to an appendix or supplementary material, as it appears somewhat trivial and does not significantly enhance the paper's impact.
In Section 4.1, the comparison of different algorithms' time complexities would benefit from scaling Figure 3 according to real complexity rather than iterations, which currently gives the HB algorithms an unfair advantage.
Overall, this paper makes significant progress in efficiently sampling from FHMMs and is a valuable contribution to the field.
