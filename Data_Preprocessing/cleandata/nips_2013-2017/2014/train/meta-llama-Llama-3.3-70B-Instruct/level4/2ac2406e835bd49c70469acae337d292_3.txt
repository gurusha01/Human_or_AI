The authors introduce a spectral approach to learning a mixture of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), which essentially modifies the standard Hsu, Kakade, and Zhang algorithm. However, the recovered transition matrix is a permuted version of the true one, intermingling the components. To address this, the authors propose a de-permutation algorithm that appears to be reasonably effective.
There are occasional minor errors, such as typographical mistakes, that detract from the overall quality of the paper. For instance, the phrase "For each e, identify of eigenvalues that contain all of the energy" contains a typo. More thorough proofreading is necessary to eliminate such errors.
To enhance the paper's context and relevance, it would be beneficial to discuss related works, such as Chaganty and Liang's "Spectral experts for estimating mixtures of linear regressions" (ICML, 2013), which could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the authors' contributions. The paper's core contribution lies in its spectral method for learning a mixture of HMMs, with a key focus on resolving the "de-permutation" issue, thereby providing a valuable addition to the existing literature.
