The paper presents an enhanced version of the additive factorial HMM model, incorporating additional constraints that ensure the sum of individual chain outputs approximates a known aggregate value. The authors introduce a convex relaxation for MAP inference and demonstrate its application on real-world datasets, including energy disaggregation across 100 UK homes with low-frequency readings and 10 homes with higher-frequency readings, albeit without monitoring individual appliances.
Although the concepts presented are relatively straightforward, utilizing a simple optimization formulation to address these problems, the overall work remains compelling due to its application to sizable real-world datasets and the successful integration of both applied and algorithmic elements. To further enhance the paper, the following suggestions are proposed:
It would be beneficial to discuss whether the SACAFHMM optimization formulation achieves similar improvements in relaxation to attain integer solutions more frequently, as motivated by AFAMAP's constraint that one chain stages state at a time. An examination of this aspect would provide valuable insights into the distinctions between the approaches and help clarify the resulting solutions' error rates despite potential non-integral solutions.
The ideas underlying AFAMAP and SACAFHMM appear to be orthogonal, suggesting that the SACAFHMM constraints could be readily incorporated into the AFAMAP optimization formulation. While not expected to be addressed in the author response, it is strongly recommended that the authors explore this combination for a future version of the paper.
There are instances where the authors seem to conflate models and optimization procedures. For example, comparing the results of "AFHMM" and "AFAMAP" lacks precision, as AFAMAP is an algorithm for approximating MAP solutions to the AFHMM, and it is believed that the authors actually refer to alternating Viterbi optimization when mentioning AFHMM. Clarification on this point would be helpful, as it highlights the potential for combining the strategies of different algorithms presented, which might yield better performance than the current approaches. The paper proposes a straightforward extension and optimization to solve a variant of the AFHMM, and although the results on real-world data are compelling, the overall paper appears reasonable.
