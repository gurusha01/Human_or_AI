This manuscript proposes a multi-class extension of the DeepBoost ensemble learning algorithm, introducing novel data-dependent bounds for convex ensembles in multi-class classification settings. The paper is well-structured, and the technical derivations are accurate. Notably, the provided data-dependent bounds are tighter than existing ones due to their explicit dependence on mixture weights in convex combinations. The special case of the bound derived in Theorem 1 yields a significant result, exhibiting a linear dependency on the number of classes, which improves upon the quadratic dependency found in the bounds of Koltchinskii and Panchenko. This makes the new bound particularly useful for scenarios involving a large number of classes. Furthermore, the authors design optimization objectives and multi-class DeepBoosting algorithms that demonstrate good performance on UCI datasets, outperforming the multi-class versions of Adaboost and logistic regression.
However, certain aspects of the paper require expansion and clarification, particularly the relationship to the existing Deep Boosting paper presented at ICML in 2014, which renders the proposed approach somewhat incremental. The proof techniques, objective function design, and algorithm development bear a strong resemblance to this prior work, limiting the novelty of the current contribution to some extent. Additionally, the statement in Section 3.1 (Line 143) that the generalization error of $f$ and $f/\rho$ is the same is not immediately clear, given that $\rho$ appears to represent the margin based on the definitions in Equation (2). It is also unclear whether the labels from the test set are used to determine the algorithm's hyper-parameters, which contrasts with the experimental setup in the ICML paper on binary classification, where a separate validation set is used for parameter selection. The authors should provide clarification on these points to strengthen their contribution. The key strengths of the paper include the provision of tighter data-dependent bounds and the design of effective multi-class DeepBoosting algorithms, although the incremental nature of the work and the need for clarification on several aspects temper these positives.
