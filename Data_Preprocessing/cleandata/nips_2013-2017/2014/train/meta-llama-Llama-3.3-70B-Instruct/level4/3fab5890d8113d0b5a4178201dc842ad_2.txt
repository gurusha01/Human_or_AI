This paper presents a fully collapsed Gibbs (CG) sampler for the Beta-Negative Binomial Process (BNBP), introducing a novel and interesting approach through Lemma 1 and its derived sampler.
However, the experimental section raises concerns. The motivation behind developing the CG sampler for the BNBP stems from its potential for simple implementation, rapid convergence, efficient mixing, and superior predictive performance. Given that this work concentrates on the sampling algorithm rather than statistical modeling, it is essential to benchmark the proposed CG sampler against other existing sampling algorithms designed specifically for the BNBP.
The inclusion of a fully collapsed Gibbs sampler for the BNBP is a significant contribution. Nonetheless, to comprehensively evaluate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm, experimental results comparing it to other BNBP sampling algorithms are necessary, rather than comparing it to the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Latent Dirichlet Allocation (HDP-LDA) model.
