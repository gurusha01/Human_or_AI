This paper presents an additive factorial hidden Markov model for modeling electricity usage, which integrates a signal aggregate constraint. Although the paper's quality is satisfactory, its readability is compromised due to an overabundance of acronyms, some of which are excessively long. It appears that the authors are seeking to impose a constraint on the posterior density, but instead, they apply this constraint to the prior density. To clarify, the authors should explicitly state that they are introducing an a priori constraint, which subsequently constrains the posterior density.
