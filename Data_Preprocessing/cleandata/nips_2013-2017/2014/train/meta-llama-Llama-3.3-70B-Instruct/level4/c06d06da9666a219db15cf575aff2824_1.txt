This manuscript introduces a novel approach to spike-sorting, with a methodology that is broadly applicable and not exclusive to this specific domain, presented in a general framework.
The authors propose two key innovations. Firstly, they utilize Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to define basis functions and calculate precise spike times through interpolation, a concept that is both elegant and effective. Unlike previous methods that employed Taylor or polar interpolators (Ekanadham et al., 2011), the SVD-based approach is theoretically optimal in terms of Mean Squared Error (MSE).
Secondly, the authors adopt a greedy algorithm as an alternative to convex optimization solvers, drawing parallels with Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP). Furthermore, they propose an additional refinement for determining finer spike times by operating in the Fourier domain, resulting in significantly improved computational efficiency (as illustrated in Figure 3c).
Overall, this is a high-quality paper. 
Some minor suggestions for improvement include:
- Correcting several grammatical errors (notably on lines 51, potentially 195-196, and 429).
- Specifying the unit of noise in Figure 2(g) and (h) for clarity.
- Conducting more comprehensive evaluations of the proposed model on spike-sorting problems, utilizing either simulated or actual recording data, to further demonstrate its efficacy.
The paper presents an innovative spike-sorting algorithm, enhancing both accuracy and computational speed.
