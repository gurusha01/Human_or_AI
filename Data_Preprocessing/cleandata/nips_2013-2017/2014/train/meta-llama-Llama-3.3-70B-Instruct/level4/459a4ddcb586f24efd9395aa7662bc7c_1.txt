This manuscript investigates the approximation of Kernel functions using random features, yielding a key finding that L1 regularization enables the utilization of merely O(1/\epsilon) random features to achieve an \epsilon-accurate approximation of kernel functions.
The authors propose the Sparse Random Features algorithm, drawing parallels with functional gradient descent in boosting, which necessitates O(1/\epsilon) random features. This requirement is notably more efficient than the current state-of-the-art methods, which demand O(1/\epsilon^2) features.
The paper presents rigorous convergence analyses in the form of theorems, which appear to be theoretically sound. The writing is clear and concise, making the content accessible.
The outcome is an elegant and practically relevant result, particularly suited for tackling large-scale problems. By leveraging L1 norm regularization, the proposed Sparse Random Features algorithm achieves substantial improvements over existing approaches, rendering it a valuable contribution to the field.
