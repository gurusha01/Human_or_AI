This manuscript integrates robust PCA and dictionary-based structure-preserving projection to restore corrupted observation matrices, leveraging the insight that robust PCA's guarantees are insufficient for structured data, such as clustered data, and that representing structure via a dictionary yields stronger bounds. Theoretical support is provided through theorems, while the challenge of learning the dictionary is addressed through an empirically justified algorithm: initially applying robust PCA, followed by dictionary representation.
Quality:
The manuscript demonstrates technical soundness, verified up to a reasonable level of scrutiny. Two theorems outline conditions under which reconstruction is feasible, given a dictionary, whereas dictionary learning relies on empirical justification.
Clarity:
The primary issue with the manuscript is its clarity. Although the structure is well-organized, the main contributions and their impact are not clearly articulated, limiting accessibility to a narrow specialist audience. Claims require more precise definition, and the implications of the results need explication. For instance, the concept of coherence is obscure, with indirect interpretation means provided in the appendix. A potential impact of the manuscript could be that utilizing dictionaries allows sidestepping earlier problems. Additionally, the language necessitates review.
Obtaining author feedback on addressing these concerns is essential.
Originality:
The manuscript builds upon a combination of recent techniques, introducing novel theorems and empirical results that support the efficacy of this combination.
Significance:
The manuscript advances the state-of-the-art with rigorous results. Despite the heuristic nature of the proposed dictionary-finding algorithm, clear improvements over alternative algorithms demonstrate the usefulness of the insights presented.

Comment after author rebuttal and reviewer discussion:
The manuscript contains publishable content and interesting contributions. My remaining concern is the substantial effort required to rewrite the manuscript to make it accessible to a broader specialist audience. If a "major revision" option were available, I would support it.
The manuscript combines two recent concepts, presenting both theoretical results and a heuristic yet empirically strong algorithm.
