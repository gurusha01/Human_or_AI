This manuscript presents a multivariate spatio-temporal analysis that leverages cokriging and forecasting techniques, grounded in the low rank tensor learning framework. The authors employ an efficient greedy learning algorithm to facilitate the analysis. The results, derived from both synthetic and real data problems, are thoroughly discussed. I have a few minor suggestions for improvement: 
1) A typographical error is noted on page 2, situated between section 2 and subsection 2.1, where "patio-temporal" should be corrected.
2) In formulae 5 and 6, I recommend replacing the abbreviation "s.t." with the full phrase "subject to" for enhanced clarity.
