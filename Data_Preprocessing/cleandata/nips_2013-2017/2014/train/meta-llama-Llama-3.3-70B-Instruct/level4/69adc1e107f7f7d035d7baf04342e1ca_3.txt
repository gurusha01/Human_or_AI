This paper examines the necessary and sufficient conditions for determining the feasibility of mz-transportability, a property of causal effects that enables the unique computation of relationships in a target domain based on relationships in different domains, thereby providing a foundation for scientific discovery in unexplored domains. The key finding of this paper is the completeness of the do-calculus, which implies that a set of control operations on variables can be used to assess any mz-transportability, and it is shown that an algorithm previously proposed to recognize mz-transportability is indeed complete.
Quality
 The theoretical analysis and its implications presented in this paper appear to be valid. Although this is a theoretical work, the proofs of many theorems are not included in the main body of the paper, which is acceptable given their length. However, the theoretical key points are well-articulated, with the exception that the feasibility and tractability of the actual implementation of the algorithm are not clearly established. Nevertheless, the outcome on the completeness of the do-calculus across multiple domains is a significant result that will provide a basis for future causal inference studies.
Clarity
 The paper is well-written, with the main claims of the authors clearly described, and the theoretical key points are well-articulated. The set of theorems and corollaries presented seems appropriate. However, the notations and explanations may be too specialized for readers unfamiliar with the field of causal inference, which may hinder their understanding. Some descriptions in the paper could be improved, including the following points:
* The notation Mx = (U,V,Fx,P(U)) is introduced in Section 3 without prior explanation, and although an explanation of V is provided on page 5, a comprehensive description of this formulation should be included at the beginning of Section 3.
* In Definition 1, the description "D contains an extra edge from Si to Vi" lacks clarity regarding Si, which appears to refer to unobserved exogenous variables or noise, but requires more comprehensive explanation.
Originality
 The idea presented in this paper seems to build upon the work of J. Pearl et al. recently presented in AAAI, NIPS, and AISTATS, making it somewhat incremental. However, the completeness of the do-calculus in terms of mz-transportability across multiple domains provides a theoretical basis for causal inference, and the content that originally clarifies this feature of the calculus is attractive. Additionally, the proposal of mz*-shedge, which plays a central role in deriving the completeness and associated algorithms, is original.
Significance
 The concept of mz*-shedge and the completeness of the do-calculus in terms of mz-transportability have the potential to make a significant contribution to future causal inference studies. Although the description of the paper is specialized to the field of causal inference, the proposed idea will provide a fundamental basis for many future studies in this area.
