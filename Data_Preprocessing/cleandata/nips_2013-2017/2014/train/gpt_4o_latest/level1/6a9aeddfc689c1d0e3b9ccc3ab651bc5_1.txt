This paper introduces a novel subsampling algorithm, Influence Weighted Subsampling for Least Squares (IWS-LS), designed to address the challenges posed by corrupted observations in large-scale linear regression. The authors leverage the concept of "influence" from regression diagnostics to detect and down-weight the impact of corrupted data points, which traditional subsampling methods based on leverage scores fail to handle effectively. The paper also proposes two scalable approximations, Approximate Influence Weighted Subsampling (aIWS-LS) and Residual Weighted Subsampling (aRWS-LS), which maintain computational efficiency while achieving robust performance. Theoretical analysis and empirical results demonstrate that IWS-LS and its approximations outperform state-of-the-art randomized least squares methods, such as SRHT-LS and ULURU, in terms of bias and variance reduction under the corrupted observation model.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Relevance: The paper addresses a significant gap in the literature by proposing a robust subsampling method for corrupted linear regression, a realistic scenario often overlooked in prior work. The use of influence as a diagnostic tool is innovative and well-motivated.
2. Theoretical Contributions: The authors provide rigorous theoretical guarantees for the proposed methods, including error bounds for IWS-LS under the corrupted observation model. These results are well-aligned with and extend prior work in robust regression diagnostics.
3. Empirical Validation: The experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets (e.g., airline delay data) convincingly demonstrate the superiority of IWS-LS and its approximations over existing methods. The inclusion of scenarios with varying levels of corruption adds depth to the evaluation.
4. Scalability: The proposed approximations (aIWS-LS and aRWS-LS) significantly reduce computational complexity, making the methods practical for large-scale datasets.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity: While the paper is technically sound, the exposition is dense and could benefit from improved organization. For instance, the detailed derivations in the main text could be streamlined, with more intuitive explanations provided upfront. The notation is also complex, which may hinder accessibility for a broader audience.
2. Comparison with Broader Methods: The paper does not compare IWS-LS with robust regression methods outside the randomized least squares framework, such as those based on M-estimators or other robust optimization techniques. This limits the scope of the evaluation.
3. Practicality of Influence Computation: While the approximations (aIWS-LS and aRWS-LS) address the computational challenges of exact influence computation, their performance relative to IWS-LS could be further analyzed, particularly in scenarios with extreme corruption levels.
4. Limited Real-World Datasets: The empirical evaluation relies heavily on synthetic data, with only one real-world dataset (airline delays). Additional datasets from diverse domains would strengthen the generalizability of the results.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper makes a significant theoretical and practical contribution to robust linear regression, addressing a realistic and challenging problem.
- The proposed methods are novel, well-supported by theoretical analysis, and empirically validated.
- The approximations (aIWS-LS and aRWS-LS) ensure scalability, making the approach applicable to large-scale problems.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The paper's clarity and accessibility could be improved, particularly for readers less familiar with regression diagnostics or randomized algorithms.
- The evaluation could be broadened to include comparisons with other robust regression techniques and additional real-world datasets.
Recommendation:
I recommend acceptance with minor revisions. The paper is a strong contribution to the field, but addressing clarity issues and expanding the empirical evaluation would enhance its impact.
