This paper presents a novel framework for solving the balanced k-cut problem in graph-based clustering, addressing limitations in existing methods such as spectral clustering and greedy approaches. The authors propose a tight continuous relaxation for the balanced k-cut problem, which improves upon prior relaxations by ensuring tighter connections to the original objective of minimizing the normalized cut. They introduce a monotonic descent algorithm for optimizing the sum-of-ratios objective, which guarantees convergence to feasible solutions while avoiding degenerate partitions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art clustering techniques across a variety of datasets and balancing functions, including ratio and normalized cuts.
Strengths:
1. Technical Novelty: The paper introduces a tighter continuous relaxation for the balanced k-cut problem, which is a significant improvement over prior relaxations such as those in [13]. The relaxation ensures better alignment with the original objective and avoids degenerate solutions, a common issue in previous approaches.
2. Algorithmic Contribution: The monotonic descent algorithm for the sum-of-ratios minimization problem is a key innovation. Unlike prior methods, such as [13], which lack monotonic descent guarantees, the proposed algorithm ensures convergence and feasibility.
3. Comprehensive Evaluation: The authors conduct extensive experiments on a wide range of datasets, comparing their method against both classical and recent state-of-the-art clustering techniques. The results consistently show superior performance in terms of achieving better balanced k-cuts and competitive clustering error rates.
4. Flexibility: The framework supports various balancing functions, including application-specific ones, and integrates label information for transductive clustering, demonstrating its versatility.
5. Clarity of Results: The paper provides detailed quantitative and qualitative comparisons, highlighting the advantages of the proposed method in both unsupervised and semi-supervised settings.
Weaknesses:
1. Complexity of Presentation: While the paper is technically sound, the dense mathematical exposition and notation (e.g., Lovasz extensions, submodular balancing functions) may hinder accessibility for readers unfamiliar with these concepts. Simplifying or summarizing key ideas could improve clarity.
2. Scalability: The computational complexity of the proposed method, particularly the monotonic descent algorithm, is not thoroughly analyzed. While the experiments suggest practical feasibility, a discussion of scalability to very large graphs would strengthen the paper.
3. Limited Discussion of Limitations: The authors do not explicitly discuss potential limitations of their method, such as sensitivity to graph construction parameters (e.g., k-NN and Gaussian weights) or the impact of initialization strategies.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper makes a substantial contribution to the field by addressing a long-standing challenge in graph-based clustering with a novel relaxation and optimization approach.
- The experimental results are robust and demonstrate clear improvements over competing methods.
- The proposed framework is flexible and applicable to a wide range of clustering problems, including those with prior label information.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The paper's presentation could be more accessible, particularly for readers outside the immediate subfield.
- Scalability to very large datasets is not explicitly addressed, which may limit the practical applicability of the method.
Recommendation:
I recommend acceptance of this paper, as it provides a significant advancement in the balanced k-cut problem and demonstrates strong empirical performance. However, the authors should consider improving the clarity of the presentation and addressing scalability concerns in the final version.
