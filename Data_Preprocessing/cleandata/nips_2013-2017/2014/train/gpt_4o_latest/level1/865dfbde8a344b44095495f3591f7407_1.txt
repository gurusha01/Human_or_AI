The paper presents a novel stochastic variational inference (SVI) algorithm tailored for Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) in time-dependent data settings, addressing the computational challenges posed by large datasets with sequential dependencies. Unlike prior SVI methods, which primarily assume independent or exchangeable data, this work extends SVI to handle the dependencies inherent in HMMs. The authors propose an adaptive buffering mechanism that leverages the memory decay property of Markov chains to mitigate errors introduced by subchain sampling. The algorithm, termed SVIHMM, is rigorously analyzed, with theoretical guarantees for convergence to a local mode. Empirical results on synthetic datasets and a large genomics dataset demonstrate the algorithm's scalability and effectiveness, achieving comparable or superior performance to batch variational Bayes (VB) while significantly reducing computational costs.
Strengths
1. Technical Contribution: The paper addresses a significant gap in the literature by extending SVI to sequential data, which is a non-trivial problem due to the dependencies in HMMs. The proposed buffering mechanism is innovative and well-justified theoretically.
2. Scalability: The algorithm is computationally efficient, enabling Bayesian inference on massive datasets where traditional methods are infeasible. This is particularly evident in the genomics application, where SVIHMM processes 250 million observations in under an hour, compared to days for competing methods.
3. Empirical Validation: The experimental results are thorough, showcasing the algorithm's robustness across synthetic datasets with varying dynamics and its practical utility in real-world genomics data.
4. Clarity of Theoretical Guarantees: The authors provide a clear theoretical analysis, including convergence guarantees and a discussion of the trade-offs between subchain length and minibatch size.
5. Reproducibility: The paper includes detailed algorithmic descriptions, making it easier for practitioners to implement and extend the work.
Weaknesses
1. Limited Comparison to Related Work: While the paper references prior SVI methods and batch VB, it lacks a broader comparison to other scalable Bayesian inference techniques, such as subset-based MCMC or parallelized approaches for HMMs.
2. Generality: Although the authors suggest that the ideas generalize to other time series models, the paper focuses exclusively on HMMs. A brief discussion or preliminary results on extensions to more complex models (e.g., state-space models) would strengthen the paper's impact.
3. Empirical Trade-offs: The choice of subchain length (L) and minibatch size (M) is shown to be critical, but the paper could provide more guidance on how to tune these parameters in practice, especially for datasets with unknown dynamics.
4. Buffering Overhead: While the GrowBuf routine is computationally efficient, its impact on runtime for extremely large datasets is not fully explored. A deeper analysis of this trade-off would be beneficial.
Arguments for Acceptance
- The paper addresses a critical and challenging problem in scalable Bayesian inference for sequential data, making a substantial technical contribution.
- The proposed algorithm is both theoretically grounded and empirically validated, with strong results on real-world data.

Arguments Against Acceptance
- The paper could benefit from a broader comparison to alternative scalable inference methods and a discussion of its limitations in more complex models.
- Practical guidance on parameter tuning and a deeper exploration of the buffering mechanism's computational trade-offs are somewhat lacking.
Recommendation
