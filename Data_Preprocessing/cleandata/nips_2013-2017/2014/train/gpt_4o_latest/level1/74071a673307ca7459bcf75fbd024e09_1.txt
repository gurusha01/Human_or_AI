This paper introduces a novel framework for constructing structured prior distributions in Bayesian models, leveraging the principle of maximum entropy and information projection. The authors focus on sparse structures, demonstrating that while the optimal prior is generally intractable, approximate inference using convex subsets is both computationally feasible and theoretically sound. A key contribution is the formulation of the sparse support estimation problem as a submodular optimization task, enabling efficient greedy forward selection with a guaranteed approximation factor of (1 - 1/e). The framework is validated through experiments on simulated data and high-dimensional functional neuroimaging data, showcasing superior performance in support recovery and predictive accuracy compared to baseline methods.
Strengths:
1. Theoretical Contributions: The paper provides a principled extension of the maximum entropy framework to structured priors, with rigorous theoretical results. The equivalence between information projection and density restriction (Theorem 3) is particularly compelling, as is the submodularity characterization of the sparse support estimation problem (Theorem 8).
2. Practical Relevance: The proposed method addresses a critical challenge in high-dimensional data analysis, where sparsity and other structural constraints are essential for interpretability and computational efficiency. The application to neuroimaging data is timely and impactful, demonstrating the method's utility in a real-world, high-dimensional setting.
3. Empirical Validation: The experiments are thorough, with comparisons to a wide range of baselines (e.g., Lasso, Ridge, Spike and Slab). The results consistently show that the proposed approach outperforms existing methods, particularly in challenging scenarios with limited samples or high noise levels.
4. Scalability: The greedy forward selection algorithm is computationally efficient and well-suited for large-scale problems, as demonstrated by the successful application to 100,000-voxel neuroimaging data.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity: While the theoretical results are strong, the paper is dense and challenging to follow in places. For example, the notation in Section 2.1 could be simplified or clarified for better accessibility. Additionally, the connection between the theoretical framework and the experimental setup could be more explicitly articulated.
2. Limited Scope of Structural Constraints: The paper focuses primarily on sparsity, which, while important, is only one type of structural constraint. The authors briefly mention extensions to low-rank and structured sparsity but do not provide concrete results or examples.
3. Baseline Comparisons: While the inclusion of Bayesian and non-Bayesian baselines is appreciated, the Spike and Slab implementation relies on a mean-field approximation, which may not fully capture the posterior dependencies. This could partially explain the performance gap, as acknowledged by the authors.
4. Neuroscientific Interpretation: The neuroimaging results are promising, but the biological interpretation of the recovered brain regions is only briefly mentioned. A deeper discussion or validation of these findings would strengthen the paper's impact in the neuroscience community.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper makes a significant theoretical contribution by extending the maximum entropy principle to structured priors and providing a tractable solution for sparse structures.
- The experimental results are robust and demonstrate clear advantages over existing methods in both synthetic and real-world settings.
- The proposed approach is scalable and has practical relevance for high-dimensional data analysis, particularly in neuroscience.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The paper's clarity could be improved, particularly in the theoretical sections, which may limit its accessibility to a broader audience.
- The focus on sparsity, while important, limits the generality of the framework's applicability to other structural constraints.
Recommendation:
Overall, this paper represents a strong contribution to the field of Bayesian modeling and structured inference. While there are minor concerns regarding clarity and scope, the strengths in terms of theoretical innovation, empirical validation, and practical relevance outweigh these weaknesses. I recommend acceptance, with suggestions to improve clarity and expand the discussion of extensions in future work.
