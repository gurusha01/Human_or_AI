The paper proposes a novel structured spike and slab prior for sparse signal recovery, which incorporates a priori knowledge of sparsity patterns using a spatial Gaussian process. Unlike traditional sparsity-promoting priors, such as the Laplace prior (LASSO) or the Bernoulli-Gaussian prior, this model encodes structured sparsity through covariance functions, offering greater flexibility. The authors also develop a Bayesian inference scheme based on the expectation propagation (EP) framework, enabling efficient approximation of the posterior distribution. The method is validated through numerical experiments, demonstrating improved performance over existing methods like LARS and BG-AMP, particularly in scenarios with structured sparsity. Applications to EEG source localization and Shepp-Logan Phantom reconstruction further highlight the model's utility.
Strengths
1. Novelty and Originality: The structured spike and slab prior is a significant advancement over existing sparsity-promoting priors, as it enables the incorporation of structured sparsity through Gaussian processes. This is a novel contribution to the field of sparse signal recovery.
2. Theoretical Rigor: The paper provides a thorough mathematical formulation of the model and its inference scheme, including derivations of key equations and computational optimizations.
3. Experimental Validation: The experiments are well-designed, comparing the proposed method against state-of-the-art algorithms (e.g., LARS, BG-AMP). The results convincingly demonstrate the model's superior performance in structured sparsity scenarios.
4. Practical Applications: The application to EEG source localization and Shepp-Logan Phantom reconstruction showcases the model's relevance to real-world problems, enhancing its significance.
5. Clarity of Results: The figures and metrics (e.g., NMSE, F-measure) effectively communicate the performance improvements, and the discussion provides meaningful insights into the results.
Weaknesses
1. Computational Complexity: The proposed method has higher computational complexity (O(DÂ³)) compared to simpler methods like BG-AMP, which may limit its scalability to very high-dimensional problems.
2. Limited Comparison: While the experiments compare the method to LARS and BG-AMP, other recent methods for structured sparsity (e.g., MRF-based approaches) are not included, which could strengthen the evaluation.
3. Hyperparameter Sensitivity: The model relies on hyperparameters such as the covariance structure and kernel parameters. While these are fixed in the experiments, the paper does not discuss strategies for learning or tuning them in practice.
4. Reproducibility: Although the theoretical details are comprehensive, the paper lacks sufficient implementation details (e.g., pseudocode or open-source code) to facilitate reproducibility.
Arguments for Acceptance

Recommendation
Overall, this paper is a strong contribution to the field of sparse signal recovery, particularly in scenarios requiring structured sparsity. While computational complexity and limited comparisons are concerns, the novelty, theoretical rigor, and experimental results outweigh these drawbacks. I recommend acceptance, with minor revisions to address hyperparameter tuning and expand comparisons to other structured sparsity methods.
