The paper proposes a novel generative framework that incorporates an attention mechanism to dynamically route relevant information from high-resolution images to a canonical representation, enabling generative modeling of objects in cluttered scenes without requiring labeled data. The model combines Gaussian Restricted Boltzmann Machines (GRBMs) with a 2D similarity transformation for attention and employs Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) for posterior inference. A convolutional neural network (ConvNet) is used for approximate inference to initialize the attention parameters. The framework is demonstrated on face datasets, showing robust object localization, generative learning without labels, and identity-conditioned attention in multi-object scenes.
Strengths
1. Technical Novelty: The integration of attention mechanisms with generative models is a significant contribution. By dynamically routing information, the model addresses the challenge of background clutter in high-resolution images, which has been largely ignored in prior generative modeling work.
2. Generative Learning Without Labels: The paper demonstrates the ability to learn generative models from unlabeled data, which is a critical step toward scaling generative models to real-world datasets.
3. Robust Inference: The combination of ConvNet-based approximate inference and HMC sampling is well-motivated and effectively handles the complex posterior distribution, as evidenced by the experiments.
4. Identity-Conditioned Attention: The model's ability to selectively attend to specific objects in multi-object scenes based on a canonical representation is a compelling feature with potential applications in object detection and tracking.
5. Experimental Validation: The paper provides extensive experimental results, including quantitative metrics (e.g., Intersection over Union) and qualitative visualizations, to validate the proposed framework.
Weaknesses
1. Limited Scope of Applications: The experiments are restricted to face datasets, which may limit the generalizability of the approach to other object categories or more complex scenes.
2. Supervised Pretraining of ConvNet: The reliance on supervised pretraining for the ConvNet undermines the claim of fully unsupervised generative learning. While the authors mention reinforcement learning as future work, this limitation should be addressed more explicitly.
3. Inference Complexity: The use of HMC, while effective, introduces computational overhead, and the paper does not provide a detailed analysis of runtime performance or scalability to larger datasets.
4. Clarity of Presentation: The paper is dense and could benefit from clearer organization, especially in the inference and learning sections. For example, the derivations in Section 4 are difficult to follow without prior familiarity with the methods.
Arguments for Acceptance
- The paper addresses a significant challenge in generative modeling by introducing an attention mechanism that enables learning from cluttered, unlabeled data.
- The proposed framework is technically sound and demonstrates strong experimental results.
- The identity-conditioned attention mechanism is a novel and impactful contribution.
Arguments Against Acceptance
- The reliance on supervised pretraining for the ConvNet detracts from the claim of unsupervised learning.
- The paper's focus on face datasets limits its broader applicability.
- The presentation could be improved to make the methodology more accessible to readers.
Recommendation
I recommend acceptance of this paper, as it presents a novel and well-executed approach to generative modeling with attention. While there are areas for improvement, particularly in generalizability and clarity, the contributions are significant and align well with the goals of the conference.
