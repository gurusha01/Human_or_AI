This paper addresses the critical problem of determining the recoverability of causal and probabilistic queries from datasets corrupted by missing entries, leveraging graphical models to formalize the missingness process. Building on the foundational work of Mohan et al. [2013], the authors extend the theoretical framework for recoverability by introducing new graphical criteria and algorithms. Notably, they demonstrate that causal queries, such as \(P(y|do(x))\), can sometimes be recovered even when their associated probabilistic relations are not recoverable. This is a significant advancement, as it challenges the traditional assumption that recoverability of causal effects requires recoverability of all underlying probabilistic factors. The paper also applies these results to attrition problems, offering necessary and sufficient conditions for recovering causal effects in such scenarios.
Strengths:
1. Theoretical Contributions: The paper extends the sequential factorization theorem and introduces novel graphical criteria for both recoverability and non-recoverability. These contributions advance the state of the art in handling missing data, particularly in the challenging MNAR (Missing Not At Random) setting.
2. Causal Query Recovery: The demonstration that causal effects can be recovered even when probabilistic queries are not recoverable is both novel and impactful. This result has practical implications for fields like epidemiology and social sciences, where causal inference from incomplete data is common.
3. Clarity of Framework: The use of missingness graphs (m-graphs) provides a clear and formal representation of the missingness process, enabling precise reasoning about recoverability.
4. Application to Attrition: The application of the theoretical results to attrition problems is well-motivated and demonstrates the practical utility of the proposed methods.
5. Thoroughness: The paper is comprehensive, with detailed proofs, examples, and discussions of related work, ensuring that the contributions are well-situated within the broader literature.
Weaknesses:
1. Complexity of Presentation: While the paper is rigorous, the technical density and formalism may make it challenging for readers unfamiliar with graphical models or causal inference. The authors could improve accessibility by including more intuitive explanations or visual aids.
2. Limited Empirical Validation: The paper focuses heavily on theoretical results, with limited empirical demonstrations. Including experiments on real-world datasets would strengthen the practical relevance of the work.
3. Scope of Applications: Although the paper discusses attrition, it does not explore other common missing data scenarios (e.g., imputation-based methods or collaborative filtering) in depth. A broader discussion of practical applications would enhance the paper's impact.
4. Assumption of Correct m-graphs: The framework assumes that the m-graph accurately represents the missingness process. In practice, constructing such graphs can be challenging, and the paper does not address how to handle misspecifications in the m-graph.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper makes significant theoretical advancements in the field of missing data and causal inference.
- The results are novel, particularly the recovery of causal queries when probabilistic queries are non-recoverable.
- The work is rigorous, well-referenced, and builds on prior research, particularly Mohan et al. [2013].
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The technical complexity may limit accessibility to a broader audience.
- The lack of empirical validation raises questions about the practical applicability of the proposed methods.
- The reliance on accurate m-graphs may limit the framework's utility in real-world scenarios where such graphs are difficult to construct.
Recommendation:
Overall, this paper represents a strong theoretical contribution to the field of missing data and causal inference. While there are areas for improvement, particularly in terms of empirical validation and accessibility, the novelty and rigor of the work merit its acceptance. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the clarity and practical applicability concerns.
