This paper addresses the limitations of Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) in recovering low-rank matrices from grossly corrupted data, particularly when the data exhibit high coherence due to clustering structures. The authors propose using Low-Rank Representation (LRR) with a carefully constructed low-rank dictionary to overcome these challenges. They mathematically prove that LRR, when equipped with a low-rank dictionary, is immune to the coherence parameter that degrades RPCA's performance as the number of clusters increases. The paper also introduces a practical algorithm that leverages RPCA to construct the dictionary for LRR in unsupervised environments. Experimental results on synthetic data and real-world motion sequences demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms RPCA, particularly in handling coherent data.
Strengths:
1. Novelty: The paper tackles an important limitation of RPCA by addressing the issue of coherence in clustered data. The proposed integration of dictionary learning into LRR is a novel and well-motivated approach.
2. Theoretical Contributions: The authors provide rigorous mathematical proofs to support their claims, including conditions under which LRR can avoid coherence parameters. This adds significant depth to the work.
3. Practical Algorithm: The proposed algorithm is practical and builds on existing methods (RPCA and LRR), making it accessible to researchers and practitioners.
4. Experimental Validation: The experiments are comprehensive, including both synthetic and real-world datasets. The results convincingly demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over RPCA.
5. Clarity of Motivation: The paper clearly explains the limitations of RPCA and how the proposed method addresses them, making the contributions easy to understand.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity of Presentation: While the theoretical sections are rigorous, some parts of the paper, particularly the algorithm description, could benefit from clearer explanations and additional visual aids (e.g., flowcharts).
2. Limited Exploration of Alternatives: The paper focuses on LRR with a low-rank dictionary but does not explore alternative approaches to address coherence, such as modifications to RPCA or hybrid methods.
3. Scalability: Although the authors claim the computational cost of their algorithm is only marginally higher than RPCA, more detailed analysis of scalability on large datasets would strengthen the paper.
4. Generality: The proposed method assumes that the dictionary can be constructed effectively using RPCA. This assumption may not hold in all scenarios, particularly for highly noisy or complex datasets.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper makes a significant contribution to the field by addressing a well-known limitation of RPCA and proposing a theoretically sound and empirically validated solution.
- The integration of dictionary learning into LRR is a novel idea that has the potential to inspire further research in robust matrix recovery.
- The experimental results are compelling and demonstrate the practical utility of the proposed method.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The clarity of the paper could be improved, particularly in the algorithm description and theoretical sections.
- The exploration of alternative approaches and scalability analysis is limited, leaving some questions about the generalizability of the method.
Recommendation:
Overall, this paper makes a strong contribution to the field of robust matrix recovery and is well-suited for presentation at NIPS. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to improve clarity and address the scalability concerns.
