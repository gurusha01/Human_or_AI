The paper investigates the relationship between dimensionality and communication cost in distributed learning, focusing on estimating the mean of a high-dimensional Gaussian distribution. The authors establish lower bounds for communication costs in both interactive and simultaneous settings, demonstrating that the cost scales linearly with the number of dimensions. They introduce a "direct-sum" theorem, showing that solving a high-dimensional problem requires communication proportional to solving independent one-dimensional problems. Complementing these lower bounds, the authors propose an interactive protocol that achieves the minimax squared loss with reduced communication. Additionally, they explore parameter estimation under sparsity constraints, presenting a thresholding-based protocol that achieves significant communication savings while maintaining estimation accuracy. The paper conjectures that the tradeoff between communication and squared loss in the sparse case is near-optimal.
Strengths:
1. Theoretical Contributions: The direct-sum theorem is a significant theoretical result, providing a generic tool for analyzing communication complexity in high-dimensional statistical problems. Its applicability beyond Gaussian mean estimation is promising.
2. Novel Sparse Estimation Protocol: The thresholding-based protocol for sparse parameters is simple yet effective, offering practical insights into exploiting structure in distributed settings.
3. Improved Bounds: The paper improves upon existing lower bounds for simultaneous communication and provides a tighter upper bound for interactive protocols, advancing the state of the art.
4. Clarity of Results: The paper clearly delineates its contributions, with rigorous proofs and well-defined problem setups. The use of information complexity as a proxy for communication complexity is well-justified and aligns with prior work.
Weaknesses:
1. Limited Empirical Validation: While the theoretical results are robust, the paper lacks experimental validation to demonstrate the practical utility of the proposed protocols in real-world distributed systems.
2. Sparse Estimation Conjecture: The conjecture regarding the optimality of the tradeoff in sparse estimation is intriguing but remains unproven, leaving a key result speculative.
3. Complexity of Interactive Protocols: The interactive protocol achieving the minimax rate is not simultaneous, and the paper does not conclusively address whether a simultaneous protocol could achieve similar performance, leaving a gap in understanding.
4. Scope of Applications: While the direct-sum theorem is broadly applicable, the paper focuses narrowly on Gaussian mean estimation. Extending the results to other statistical models would enhance its impact.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper makes substantial theoretical contributions, particularly the direct-sum theorem and improved bounds, which are highly relevant to the NeurIPS community.
- The sparse estimation protocol addresses a practical challenge in high-dimensional distributed learning and opens avenues for further research.
- The work builds on and extends prior research in communication and information complexity, providing a solid foundation for future studies.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The lack of empirical results limits the paper's practical relevance.
- The unproven conjecture on sparse estimation tradeoffs weakens the completeness of the contribution.
- The paper's focus on Gaussian mean estimation may restrict its appeal to a broader audience.
Recommendation:
I recommend acceptance with minor revisions. The paper offers significant theoretical insights and advances the understanding of communication complexity in distributed learning. Addressing the conjecture and providing empirical validation in future work would further strengthen its contributions.
