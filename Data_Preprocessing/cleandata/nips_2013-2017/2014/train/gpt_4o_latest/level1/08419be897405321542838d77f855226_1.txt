This paper presents a novel framework for discovering computationally efficient mathematical identities using machine learning techniques. The authors leverage an attribute grammar to represent symbolic expressions and propose two learning-based approaches—a simple n-gram model and a recursive neural network (RNN)—to guide the search for efficient expressions. By training these models on simpler expressions, the framework generalizes to more complex ones, enabling the discovery of identities that reduce computational complexity significantly. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach through examples, such as reducing matrix operations from \(O(n^3)\) to \(O(n^2)\), and provides a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed methods against brute-force and random search strategies.
Strengths
1. Novelty and Originality: The paper addresses a relatively unexplored area—using machine learning to discover mathematical identities. The integration of symbolic computation with statistical learning is a unique contribution that bridges two traditionally distinct fields.
2. Technical Soundness: The proposed framework is well-constructed, with clear definitions of the attribute grammar, learning models, and search strategies. The use of both numerical and learned representations for symbolic expressions is innovative and technically robust.
3. Significance: The results demonstrate substantial reductions in computational complexity for various mathematical expressions, which could have practical implications in fields like machine learning and symbolic computation. The potential applications to compiler optimization and efficient computation of RBM partition functions are particularly compelling.
4. Clarity: The paper is well-organized, with detailed explanations of the methods and experiments. The inclusion of examples (e.g., matrix operations) and the availability of code on GitHub enhance reproducibility and accessibility.
Weaknesses
1. Scope and Generalization: The framework is currently limited to homogeneous polynomials and specific grammar rules. While the authors acknowledge this limitation, the applicability to broader mathematical domains (e.g., trigonometric or recursive functions) remains unexplored.
2. Evaluation: Although the experiments are thorough, the reliance on synthetic benchmarks (e.g., \(k\)-degree polynomials) may limit the perceived real-world impact. Additional evaluations on practical problems or datasets would strengthen the paper.
3. RNN Performance: While the RNN-based approach is innovative, it underperforms compared to n-gram models in many cases. The authors could provide more insights into why this occurs and how the RNN could be improved for this task.
4. Computational Cost: The framework's reliance on large-scale enumeration and training raises concerns about scalability for extremely complex expressions, especially in the absence of efficient solutions for higher-degree problems (e.g., \(k > 5\) for RBM-2).
