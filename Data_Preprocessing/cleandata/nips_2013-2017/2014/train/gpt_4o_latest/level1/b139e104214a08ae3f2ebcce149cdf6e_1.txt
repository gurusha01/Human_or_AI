This paper presents a novel extension of Pinsker's theorem by analyzing the tradeoff between storage constraints and statistical risk in nonparametric estimation under the normal means model. The authors derive sharp upper and lower bounds for the minimax risk when estimators are quantized, establishing a Pareto-optimal tradeoff curve between storage (quantization) and risk. The theoretical results are supported by simulations and a proposed adaptive source coding method that asymptotically achieves the lower bound. The work is motivated by practical applications, such as onboard data processing in the Kepler telescope and cloud computing environments, where storage or communication constraints are critical.
Strengths
1. Originality: The paper addresses a novel and timely problem at the intersection of statistical estimation and information theory, extending classical minimax theory to incorporate storage constraints. This is a significant contribution, as it bridges gaps between rate-distortion theory, Pinsker's theorem, and practical considerations in modern data systems.
2. Theoretical Rigor: The authors provide a sharp characterization of the quantized minimax risk, including both lower and upper bounds. The proofs appear technically sound and are grounded in established principles from rate-distortion theory and minimax analysis.
3. Practical Relevance: The motivation for the work is well-articulated, with clear connections to real-world applications such as satellite data processing and distributed computing. This relevance enhances the significance of the results.
4. Simulation Support: The simulation results are thorough and align well with the theoretical findings, demonstrating convergence to the minimax lower bound and validating the proposed adaptive source coding method.
5. Clarity of Presentation: The paper is well-organized, with a logical flow from problem formulation to theoretical results, simulations, and discussion. The use of illustrative figures aids comprehension.
Weaknesses
1. Computational Feasibility: While the proposed adaptive source coding method achieves the minimax lower bound, it is computationally expensive, as acknowledged by the authors. The lack of a practical, efficient algorithm limits the immediate applicability of the results.
2. Scope of Results: The analysis is restricted to the Euclidean ball case, and while the authors mention extensions to Sobolev ellipsoids, these are left for future work. Addressing more general parameter spaces would significantly enhance the impact of the paper.
3. Related Work: While the paper references foundational work in rate-distortion theory and minimax analysis, it could better contextualize its contributions relative to recent advances in distributed estimation under communication constraints (e.g., Zhang et al., 2016).
4. Empirical Validation: The simulations focus on synthetic data, and there is no demonstration of the method on real-world datasets. This limits the practical validation of the proposed approach.
Arguments for Acceptance
- The paper makes a strong theoretical contribution by extending Pinsker's theorem to a new and practically relevant setting.
- The results are rigorous, well-supported by simulations, and address an important problem in modern data science.
- The work is original and aligns well with the scope of NIPS, particularly in advancing the intersection of statistical theory and computational constraints.
Arguments Against Acceptance
- The lack of computationally efficient methods limits the practical utility of the results.
- The scope is somewhat narrow, focusing only on the Euclidean ball case without addressing more general parameter spaces.
- The paper could better position itself within the broader literature on communication-constrained estimation.
Recommendation
Overall, this paper makes a significant theoretical contribution and is well-suited for NIPS. While the practical limitations and narrow scope are notable, the originality and rigor of the work outweigh these concerns. I recommend acceptance, with the suggestion that the authors address computational efficiency and extend their analysis to broader settings in future work.
