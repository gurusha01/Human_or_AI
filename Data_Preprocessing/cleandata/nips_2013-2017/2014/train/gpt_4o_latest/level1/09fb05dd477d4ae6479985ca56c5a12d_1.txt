This paper introduces Large Scale Detection through Adaptation (LSDA), a novel algorithm that bridges the gap between image classification and object detection tasks. The authors address a critical challenge in scaling object detection: the scarcity of bounding box annotations for large numbers of categories. LSDA leverages abundant image-level classification data and limited detection data to adapt classifiers into detectors, enabling detection for thousands of categories without bounding box annotations. The approach is framed as a domain adaptation problem, learning a transformation from classification to detection using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The paper demonstrates significant improvements on the ImageNet LSVRC-2013 detection challenge, achieving a 50% relative mAP boost on held-out categories and scaling to a 7.6K-category detector. The authors also provide models and software for public use.
Strengths:
1. Significance: The paper addresses a pressing issue in object detectionâ€”scaling to tens of thousands of categories without requiring extensive bounding box annotations. This has substantial implications for real-world applications, such as large-scale visual recognition in diverse domains.
2. Originality: The proposed LSDA algorithm is novel in its approach to adapting classifiers into detectors through domain adaptation. Unlike prior methods, it does not require bounding box annotations for all categories, making it highly scalable.
3. Technical Quality: The methodology is well-supported by theoretical insights and experimental results. The ablation study effectively isolates the contributions of different components of the algorithm, and the error analysis provides valuable insights into the system's behavior.
4. Clarity: The paper is clearly written and well-organized, with detailed explanations of the algorithm, experimental setup, and results. The inclusion of visual examples and quantitative analyses enhances understanding.
5. Reproducibility: The authors provide models, code, and detailed implementation details, which facilitate reproducibility and further research.
Weaknesses:
1. Evaluation Scope: While the paper demonstrates strong results on the ImageNet dataset, it would benefit from additional evaluations on other datasets to establish generalizability.
2. Comparison to Related Work: Although the paper references prior work, a more comprehensive comparison with state-of-the-art methods, such as MIL-based approaches or other domain adaptation techniques, would strengthen its claims.
3. Performance Gap: The authors acknowledge a performance gap between LSDA and oracle detectors with full bounding box annotations. While this is expected, further discussion on potential strategies to close this gap (e.g., integrating MIL techniques) would be valuable.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper makes a significant contribution to the field by addressing a critical scalability challenge in object detection.
- The proposed algorithm is novel, technically sound, and demonstrates substantial improvements over baseline methods.
- The work is well-executed, clearly presented, and provides resources for reproducibility.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The evaluation is limited to a single dataset, and broader validation would strengthen the paper's impact.
- The comparison to related work could be more thorough, particularly regarding alternative approaches to weakly supervised detection.
Recommendation:
I recommend acceptance of this paper. Its contributions are both novel and impactful, advancing the state of the art in large-scale object detection. While there are areas for improvement, the strengths of the work outweigh its weaknesses, and it is likely to inspire further research in this important area.
