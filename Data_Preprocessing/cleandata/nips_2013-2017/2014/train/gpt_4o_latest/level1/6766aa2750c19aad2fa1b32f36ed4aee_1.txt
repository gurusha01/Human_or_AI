This paper introduces a hybrid policy search method that combines local linear dynamics modeling with guided policy search (GPS) to efficiently learn policies for complex, high-dimensional, and partially observed tasks. The key contribution is the iterative fitting of time-varying linear-Gaussian controllers, which avoids the challenges of learning a global dynamics model while retaining the sample efficiency of model-based methods. The authors demonstrate that their approach outperforms prior methods in terms of sample complexity and robustness, particularly for tasks with discontinuous dynamics, such as robotic peg insertion, octopus arm control, swimming, and bipedal walking. The paper also extends the method to train general parameterized policies, such as neural networks, enabling the learning of expressive strategies in partially observed environments.
Strengths
1. Technical Innovation: The hybrid approach bridges the gap between model-based and model-free policy search methods, leveraging the strengths of both paradigms. The use of KL-divergence constraints to stabilize trajectory optimization under unknown dynamics is particularly noteworthy.
2. Practical Applicability: The method is shown to handle challenging real-world scenarios, such as contact-rich tasks and underactuated systems, which are typically difficult for both model-based and model-free methods.
3. Experimental Rigor: The paper provides extensive experimental comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, including REPS, RWR, CEM, and PILCO, demonstrating superior performance in terms of sample efficiency and task success rates. The inclusion of diverse tasks (e.g., peg insertion, locomotion) highlights the generality of the approach.
4. Integration with GPS: The extension to train neural network policies within the GPS framework is a significant contribution, enabling the learning of complex, high-dimensional policies that generalize to unseen scenarios.
5. Clarity of Results: The experimental results are well-presented, with clear metrics for evaluation (e.g., distances, task success rates) and insightful comparisons to prior work.
Weaknesses
1. Clarity: While the technical details are thorough, the paper could benefit from a more concise explanation of the key algorithmic steps, particularly in Sections 3 and 4. The dense mathematical exposition may be challenging for readers unfamiliar with trajectory optimization or GPS.
2. Assumptions: The method assumes that time-varying linear-Gaussian controllers are a reasonable local approximation for the dynamics. While this is valid for many physical systems, it may limit applicability to hybrid discrete-continuous tasks or systems with highly nonlinear dynamics.
3. Limited Real-World Validation: The experiments are conducted in simulated environments. While the results are promising, real-world validation on physical robots would strengthen the claims of practical applicability.
4. Computational Overhead: The use of Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) as priors for dynamics fitting introduces additional computational complexity. The scalability of the approach to very high-dimensional systems or real-time applications is not fully addressed.
Arguments for Acceptance
- The paper addresses a critical challenge in reinforcement learning: balancing sample efficiency with robustness to complex dynamics.
- The method demonstrates significant improvements over state-of-the-art techniques, both in terms of sample efficiency and task success rates.
- The integration of trajectory optimization with GPS to train neural network policies is a novel and impactful contribution, enabling the learning of expressive, generalizable policies.
Arguments Against Acceptance
- The reliance on simulated environments leaves open questions about real-world applicability.
- The dense presentation of technical details may hinder accessibility for a broader audience.
Recommendation
I recommend acceptance of this paper. Its contributions to hybrid policy search, particularly the integration of local linear models with GPS, represent a significant advancement in reinforcement learning. While real-world validation and further clarity in presentation would enhance the work, the demonstrated improvements in sample efficiency and task performance make this paper a valuable contribution to the field.
