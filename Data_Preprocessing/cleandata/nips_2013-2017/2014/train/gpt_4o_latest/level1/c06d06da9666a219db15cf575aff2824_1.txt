Review of "Continuous Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (COMP) for Sparse Signal Recovery"
This paper introduces Continuous Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (COMP), a novel greedy algorithm for recovering the identities, amplitudes, and time shifts of waveforms in sparse signal recovery problems. The authors extend the Continuous Basis Pursuit (CBP) framework by incorporating ideas from Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) and introducing a new basis derived from Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). Additionally, they refine timing estimates in the Fourier domain, improving accuracy. The method is evaluated on both simulated and neural data, demonstrating superior performance in terms of speed and accuracy compared to CBP.
The problem of recovering sparse signals composed of shifted and scaled copies of known waveforms is well-studied, with applications in spike sorting for neural recordings. Previous work, such as CBP, has leveraged convex optimization and augmented dictionaries to estimate continuous time shifts. However, CBP suffers from high computational costs and sensitivity to noise. COMP addresses these limitations by adopting a greedy approach, iteratively selecting candidate waveforms and refining their parameters. The authors also propose an SVD-based basis, which outperforms the previously used Taylor and polar bases in terms of accuracy and robustness.
Strengths
1. Technical Contribution: The paper makes significant advancements over CBP by introducing a faster and more accurate greedy algorithm. The use of the SVD basis and Fourier domain refinement are innovative and well-motivated.
2. Experimental Results: The authors provide thorough evaluations on both simulated and real neural data. COMP consistently outperforms CBP in terms of speed, robustness to noise, and accuracy, especially when using the SVD basis.
3. Practical Relevance: The application to neural spike sorting is compelling, and the method's ability to handle waveform similarity (a common challenge in neural data) is a notable strength.
4. Clarity: The paper is well-organized and clearly written, with detailed descriptions of the algorithms and experimental setups. Figures effectively illustrate the performance differences between COMP and CBP.
Weaknesses
1. Computational Complexity: While COMP is faster than CBP, the greedy step (Equation 5) involves a constrained optimization for each candidate waveform, which may still be computationally expensive for large-scale problems. The authors could provide more discussion on scalability.
2. Fourier Domain Refinement: The nonlinear optimization in the Fourier domain (Equation 7) is a key component of COMP, but its computational cost and convergence properties are not thoroughly analyzed. This step may introduce additional complexity.
3. Limited Comparison: The paper primarily compares COMP to CBP. Including comparisons to other sparse recovery methods, such as CoSaMP or Subspace Pursuit, would strengthen the evaluation.
4. Choice of Parameters: The algorithm relies on several hyperparameters (e.g., bin size âˆ†, number of SVD basis vectors K). While these are briefly discussed, a more systematic analysis of their impact on performance would be helpful.
