This paper introduces a novel framework for regularization based on group-induced majorization, leveraging the concept of orbitopes to control model complexity. The authors propose that by confining model parameters to the convex hull of group orbits, a variety of regularizers, including well-known ones like `1, `2, and nuclear norms, can be recovered as special cases. The paper also establishes connections between the hyperoctahedral group and the recently proposed sorted `1-norm, providing a new perspective on structured sparsity. Algorithmically, the authors derive conditions under which groups are amenable to optimization via conditional and projected gradient methods and propose a continuation strategy for orbit exploration. Simulation results demonstrate the framework's efficacy, particularly in sparse recovery tasks, and highlight the potential of the continuation algorithm to improve upon traditional regularizers.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Generality: The framework is highly original, introducing a unifying perspective on regularization through group actions and orbitopes. By subsuming existing regularizers and proposing new ones, the work has the potential to significantly advance structured sparsity research.
2. Connections to Prior Work: The paper builds on majorization theory and atomic norms, areas well-studied in statistics and optimization, and extends them to machine learning. The connection between the sorted `1-norm and the signed permutahedron is particularly insightful.
3. Algorithmic Contributions: The derivation of efficient algorithms for both conditional and projected gradient methods is a strong contribution. The continuation strategy for orbit exploration is an innovative addition that could inspire further research.
4. Clarity of Examples: The paper provides clear examples of how specific groups (e.g., orthogonal, permutation, and signed permutation groups) lead to well-known regularizers, making the abstract framework more accessible.
5. Experimental Validation: The simulation results are well-designed and demonstrate the practical utility of the proposed methods, particularly in sparse recovery tasks.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity and Accessibility: While the paper is mathematically rigorous, some sections (e.g., the derivation of matching functions and region cones) are dense and may be challenging for readers unfamiliar with group theory or convex analysis. Additional intuitive explanations or visual aids could improve accessibility.
2. Scope of Experiments: The experiments, though promising, are limited in scope. For example, the continuation algorithm is only tested on synthetic data, and its performance on real-world tasks remains unexplored.
3. Computational Complexity: While the authors discuss the efficiency of key operations (e.g., matching function evaluation), a more detailed analysis of the computational cost for larger-scale problems would strengthen the paper.
4. Comparison to Baselines: The paper compares its methods to `1 and `2 regularizers but does not benchmark against other state-of-the-art structured sparsity techniques, such as overlapping group norms or deep learning-based approaches.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper introduces a highly original and general framework with significant theoretical contributions.
- It provides a unifying perspective on regularization, connecting well-known and new techniques.
- The proposed algorithms are efficient and practical, with promising experimental results.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The paper's dense presentation may limit its accessibility to a broader audience.
- The experimental validation is somewhat limited, particularly in terms of real-world applications and comparisons to stronger baselines.
Recommendation:
I recommend acceptance of this paper, as its contributions are both novel and significant. However, the authors should consider improving the clarity of the exposition and expanding the experimental evaluation to strengthen the paper further.
