The paper addresses the challenging problem of determining the recoverability of causal and probabilistic queries from datasets corrupted by missing data, given a model of the missingness process. The authors extend the foundational work of Mohan et al. [2013] by presenting more general graphical conditions and algorithms for recovering queries such as \( P(y|x) \), \( P(y, x) \), and \( P(y|do(x)) \). A key contribution is the demonstration that causal queries may be recoverable even when their associated probabilistic relations are not, which has significant implications for handling missing data in causal inference. The paper also applies these results to attrition problems, providing necessary and sufficient conditions for recovering causal effects in such scenarios.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Significance: The paper makes a substantial contribution to the field by extending the recoverability framework to more complex scenarios, including cases where missingness mechanisms interact. The results are particularly impactful for causal inference, as they demonstrate recoverability under conditions previously deemed insurmountable.
2. Theoretical Rigor: The work is grounded in formal graphical models, with clear definitions, theorems, and proofs. The introduction of new concepts such as general ordered factorization and the refinement of existing theorems enhance the theoretical foundation of the field.
3. Practical Applications: The application of the results to attrition problems, a common issue in longitudinal studies, highlights the practical relevance of the work. The graphical criteria for recoverability provide actionable insights for researchers dealing with missing data.
4. Clarity of Contributions: The paper is well-organized, with a clear progression from foundational concepts to advanced results. The examples provided (e.g., for sequential factorization and causal recoverability) effectively illustrate the theoretical findings.
Weaknesses:
1. Experimental Validation: While the theoretical contributions are robust, the paper lacks empirical validation or simulations to demonstrate the practical utility of the proposed methods. Including experiments on real-world or synthetic datasets would strengthen the paper.
2. Accessibility: The paper is dense and assumes a high level of familiarity with causal inference, graphical models, and missing data literature. While appropriate for an expert audience, it may be less accessible to a broader readership.
3. Limited Discussion of Limitations: Although the authors acknowledge some limitations, such as the reliance on assumptions encoded in the m-graph, a more detailed discussion of the practical challenges (e.g., constructing accurate m-graphs) would be beneficial.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper advances the state of the art in recoverability theory, addressing an important and underexplored area in causal inference.
- The results are theoretically sound and have significant implications for both researchers and practitioners working with missing data.
- The extension to attrition problems and the introduction of graphical criteria for non-recoverability are particularly valuable contributions.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The lack of empirical validation leaves open questions about the practical feasibility and robustness of the proposed methods.
- The paper's dense presentation may limit its impact on a broader audience, and additional effort to improve accessibility would be helpful.
Recommendation:
Overall, this paper represents a significant theoretical advancement in the field of causal inference and missing data. While the lack of experimental validation is a notable limitation, the novelty and rigor of the contributions outweigh this concern. I recommend acceptance, with a suggestion to include empirical results and a more detailed discussion of practical challenges in future iterations.
