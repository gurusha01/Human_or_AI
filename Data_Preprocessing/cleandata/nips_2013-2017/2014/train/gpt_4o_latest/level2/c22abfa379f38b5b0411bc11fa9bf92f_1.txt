The paper presents a novel framework for generative modeling using attention mechanisms, inspired by visual neuroscience. The key contribution is the integration of a 2D similarity transformation-based attentional mechanism with Gaussian Deep Belief Networks (GDBNs) to dynamically route relevant object-centered information from high-resolution images to a canonical representation. This approach allows the model to focus on objects of interest while ignoring background clutter, enabling generative modeling of large, unlabeled datasets where object locations are unknown. The authors demonstrate the efficacy of their method using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) for posterior inference and a Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet) for approximate initialization.
Strengths
1. Novelty and Significance: The paper introduces a unique combination of attention mechanisms and generative modeling, addressing a critical limitation of existing generative models that require curated datasets. The ability to localize and model objects in large, unlabeled images is a significant advancement.
2. Technical Soundness: The proposed framework is grounded in well-established probabilistic graphical models and deep learning techniques. The use of HMC for posterior inference and ConvNets for initialization is well-justified and effectively demonstrated.
3. Experimental Validation: The experiments on the Caltech Faces and CMU Multi-PIE datasets provide strong evidence of the model's robustness and generalization capabilities. The results, particularly the Intersection over Union (IOU) metric and generative learning without labels, highlight the practical utility of the approach.
4. Clarity of Presentation: The paper is well-organized, with clear explanations of the model, inference procedures, and experimental setup. The inclusion of visualizations, such as gaze updates and generated samples, enhances understanding.
Weaknesses
1. Limited Scope of Experiments: While the results on face datasets are promising, the paper does not explore the generalizability of the framework to non-face objects or more complex scenes. This limits the broader applicability of the method.
2. Supervised Pretraining Dependency: The ConvNet for approximate inference relies on supervised pretraining with labeled gaze data, which partially undermines the claim of unsupervised generative learning. Exploring reinforcement learning or unsupervised alternatives could strengthen the approach.
3. Computational Complexity: The use of HMC for inference, while effective, is computationally expensive and may not scale well to larger datasets or real-time applications. This limitation is not adequately discussed.
4. Limited Discussion of Limitations: The paper does not explicitly acknowledge potential limitations, such as sensitivity to initialization or challenges in handling occlusions and highly cluttered scenes.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Extend experiments to include diverse object categories and more complex scenes to demonstrate broader applicability.
2. Investigate unsupervised or reinforcement learning-based alternatives for ConvNet pretraining to reduce reliance on labeled data.
3. Provide a detailed analysis of computational costs and potential optimizations for scaling the framework.
4. Include a discussion of limitations and potential failure cases to provide a more balanced evaluation.
Recommendation
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of generative modeling and attention mechanisms. While there are some areas for improvement, the novelty, technical rigor, and experimental results justify acceptance. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the identified weaknesses.
