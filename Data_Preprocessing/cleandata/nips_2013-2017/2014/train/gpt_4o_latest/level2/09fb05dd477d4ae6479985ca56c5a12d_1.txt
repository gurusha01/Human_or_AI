The paper proposes Large Scale Detection through Adaptation (LSDA), an algorithm designed to address the challenge of scaling object detection to thousands of categories without requiring extensive bounding box annotations. The authors leverage the abundance of image-level classification labels and limited detection data to transform classifiers into detectors through domain adaptation techniques. Their approach demonstrates significant improvements in detection performance, achieving a 50% relative mAP boost on held-out categories, and enables the creation of a 7.6K-category detector. The paper also introduces a faster version of the detector, making it practical for large-scale applications.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Significance: The paper tackles a critical bottleneck in object detection—bounding box annotation scarcity—by proposing a novel adaptation technique. The ability to scale detection to thousands of categories using only classification data is a significant contribution to the field.
2. Technical Soundness: The methodology is well-grounded in domain adaptation principles, and the authors provide a detailed explanation of their approach, including category-invariant and category-specific transformations. The experimental results are robust, with statistically significant improvements over baselines.
3. Practical Impact: The release of models and code, along with the demonstration of a fast detector, enhances the paper's practical utility. The potential to apply this method to large-scale datasets, such as videos, is particularly compelling.
4. Comprehensive Evaluation: The paper includes an ablation study, error analysis, and quantitative results on the ILSVRC2013 dataset, providing a thorough evaluation of the proposed method. The analysis of false positives and localization errors is insightful and demonstrates the effectiveness of LSDA in reducing these errors.
Weaknesses:
1. Limited Comparison with Related Work: While the paper references prior work on domain adaptation and weakly supervised detection, it lacks direct experimental comparisons with state-of-the-art methods like Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) approaches. This omission makes it difficult to contextualize the performance gains of LSDA relative to alternative techniques.
2. Reproducibility Concerns: Although the authors provide models and code, some implementation details, such as the choice of nearest neighbors for category-specific adaptation, could be elaborated further to ensure reproducibility.
3. Scalability Limitations: While the paper demonstrates scalability to 7.6K categories, the method's computational efficiency for even larger datasets (e.g., 20K+ categories) is not discussed in detail. Additionally, the reliance on pre-trained CNNs may limit applicability to domains with less pre-existing classification data.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:
Pro:
- The paper addresses a critical problem in object detection and provides a novel, practical solution with significant performance improvements.
- The methodology is technically sound and well-supported by experiments.
- The release of models and code enhances reproducibility and practical impact.
Con:
- Limited experimental comparisons with alternative approaches.
- Some implementation details are insufficiently described, which could hinder reproducibility.
- Scalability to larger datasets and domains with limited classification data remains unclear.
Recommendation:
I recommend acceptance of this paper. Its contributions to scaling object detection through adaptation are both novel and impactful. While there are areas for improvement, such as broader comparisons and additional implementation details, the strengths of the paper outweigh its weaknesses. This work is likely to stimulate further research in large-scale detection and domain adaptation.
