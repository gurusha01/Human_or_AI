This paper investigates the power of voting among diverse, randomized software agents, with a focus on computer Go. The authors propose a novel two-stage noisy voting model to analyze the performance of diverse versus uniform teams of agents. Their key theoretical result demonstrates that diverse teams converge to optimal decisions as the number of agents increases, while uniform teams are prone to suboptimal outcomes. The paper also introduces a method for generating diverse agents by parameterizing a single Go program and presents experimental results showing that diverse teams outperform uniform teams in 9x9 Go games. Additionally, the authors explore ranked voting rules, proposing a novel method for generating ranked votes that improves performance over plurality voting.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Originality: The paper presents a novel theoretical model that extends the Condorcet Jury Theorem to the domain of randomized software agents. The introduction of two-stage noisy voting and the analysis of diverse versus uniform teams is a significant contribution to computational social choice and multi-agent systems.
2. Theoretical Rigor: The authors provide a well-grounded theoretical framework, supported by proofs that demonstrate the mildness of their assumptions and the applicability of their results to various noise models and voting rules.
3. Practical Relevance: The focus on computer Go and the use of Monte Carlo tree search algorithms make the work relevant to real-world AI applications. The methodology for generating diverse agents and ranked votes is a valuable contribution for practitioners.
4. Experimental Validation: The experimental results are comprehensive, showing clear evidence for the superiority of diverse teams over uniform teams. The comparison of voting rules adds depth to the analysis.
5. Clarity and Organization: The paper is well-written and logically structured, with clear explanations of the theoretical model, experimental setup, and results.
Weaknesses:
1. Limited Scope of Experiments: While the experiments focus on computer Go, the broader applicability of the model to other domains is only briefly discussed. Additional experiments in other domains, such as poker or recommendation systems, would strengthen the paper's claims of generality.
2. Sequential Decision-Making: The paper acknowledges that its model does not account for sequential decision-making, which is a critical aspect of many multi-stage games like Go and poker. This limitation reduces the practical applicability of the theoretical results.
3. Ranking Methodology: The ranking method used in the experiments relies on internal data from the search tree, which may not generalize to other domains or agents. The authors' novel sampling-based ranking method is promising but requires further validation.
4. Assumptions on Noise Models: While the assumptions on noise models are shown to be mild, the paper does not explore how deviations from these assumptions might affect the results, leaving some uncertainty about the robustness of the findings.
Recommendation:
This paper makes a strong theoretical and practical contribution to the study of voting among software agents. Its novelty, rigor, and relevance to AI applications make it a valuable addition to the field. However, the authors should address the limitations related to sequential decision-making and expand the experimental scope in future work. I recommend acceptance, as the paper advances the state of the art and provides a foundation for further research.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Novel theoretical model with significant implications for multi-agent systems.
- Strong experimental evidence supporting the claims.
- Practical contributions, including methods for generating diverse agents and ranked votes.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Limited experimental scope beyond computer Go.
- Lack of consideration for sequential decision-making in multi-stage games.
Overall, the strengths outweigh the weaknesses, and the paper is a high-quality contribution to the conference.
