This paper presents a novel framework that leverages machine learning techniques to discover efficient mathematical identities, addressing a challenging problem in symbolic computation. The authors propose an attribute grammar-based representation for symbolic expressions and introduce two learning-based strategies—an n-gram model and a recursive neural network (RNN)—to guide the search for computationally efficient versions of target expressions. The paper demonstrates the framework's capability to discover new mathematical identities that significantly reduce computational complexity, outperforming brute-force and random search methods.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Originality: The application of machine learning, particularly RNNs, to symbolic computation is innovative. The combination of attribute grammars with learning-based search strategies is a fresh approach that bridges symbolic computation and statistical learning.
2. Significant Contributions: The paper makes several important contributions, including the discovery of previously unknown mathematical identities and the introduction of a learned continuous representation for symbolic expressions. The results have potential applications in areas like compiler optimization and efficient computation in machine learning models (e.g., RBMs and dropout).
3. Thorough Evaluation: The authors evaluate their framework on multiple families of expressions, demonstrating its effectiveness across a range of complexity levels. The inclusion of both n-gram models and RNNs provides a comparative analysis of different learning strategies.
4. Reproducibility: The authors provide access to their code and evaluation data, which is commendable and facilitates reproducibility.
Weaknesses:
1. Limited Scope: The framework is restricted to homogeneous polynomials of fixed degree and scalar outputs, which limits its applicability to broader mathematical domains. While the authors acknowledge this limitation, a discussion on how to generalize the approach would strengthen the paper.
2. Performance of RNNs: While RNNs are a key focus of the paper, their performance is often outperformed by simpler n-gram models, particularly for repetitive patterns. This raises questions about the scalability and generalization of the RNN-based approach for more complex expressions.
3. Sparse Discussion of Related Work: Although the paper references prior work in theorem proving, program induction, and probabilistic programming, the discussion could be expanded to better contextualize the contributions within the broader landscape of symbolic computation and AI.
4. Complexity of Grammar Rules: The grammar rules used in the experiments are relatively simple, and the framework does not yet handle recursion or more complex mathematical operations like trigonometric functions. This limits its potential for broader mathematical discovery.
Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Extend the framework to handle a wider variety of mathematical expressions, including non-homogeneous polynomials, recursion, and trigonometric functions.
2. Provide a deeper analysis of why RNNs underperform in certain cases and explore alternative neural architectures that might better capture the structure of symbolic expressions.
3. Expand the discussion of related work to include more recent advances in symbolic computation and AI-guided theorem proving.
4. Include a more detailed analysis of the discovered identities, particularly their potential impact on real-world applications.
Recommendation:
This paper presents a strong and innovative contribution to the intersection of machine learning and symbolic computation. While there are some limitations in scope and generalization, the framework demonstrates significant potential for advancing the state of the art in mathematical identity discovery. I recommend acceptance, provided the authors address the limitations and expand the discussion in the final version.
