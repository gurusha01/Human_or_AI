The paper proposes a novel subsampling algorithm, Influence Weighted Subsampling for Least Squares (IWS-LS), designed to address the limitations of existing randomized least squares methods in the presence of corrupted observations. The authors argue that traditional subsampling approaches, such as those based on leverage scores, fail to account for the influence of outliers or corrupted data points, leading to biased estimates. By leveraging the concept of influence—a measure of a data point's impact on the overall regression estimate—the proposed method selectively avoids sampling highly influential (and potentially corrupted) points. The paper also introduces randomized approximations of IWS-LS, namely aIWS-LS and aRWS-LS, which improve scalability while maintaining performance. Theoretical analysis and empirical results demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform state-of-the-art approaches, such as SRHT-LS and ULURU, in both bias and variance reduction under the corrupted observation model.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Relevance: The paper addresses a significant gap in the literature by proposing a robust subsampling method for corrupted datasets, a scenario often encountered in real-world applications. The use of influence as a diagnostic tool is innovative and well-motivated.
2. Theoretical Rigor: The authors provide a thorough theoretical analysis, including error bounds for IWS-LS and its approximations. The results are well-supported by mathematical proofs and align with existing literature on corrupted observation models.
3. Empirical Validation: The experimental evaluation is comprehensive, including both simulated and real-world datasets (e.g., the airline delay dataset). The results convincingly demonstrate the superiority of IWS-LS and its approximations over competing methods.
4. Scalability: The introduction of randomized approximations (aIWS-LS and aRWS-LS) ensures that the proposed methods are computationally feasible for large-scale datasets, a critical consideration for practical deployment.
Weaknesses:
1. Computational Complexity: While the randomized approximations improve scalability, the exact IWS-LS algorithm remains computationally expensive (O(np²)). This limits its applicability to smaller datasets, as acknowledged by the authors.
2. Limited Real-World Validation: Although the airline delay dataset provides a compelling use case, additional real-world datasets from diverse domains would strengthen the paper's claims about the generalizability of the corrupted observation model.
3. Assumption of Sub-Gaussian Noise: The theoretical analysis relies on the assumption of sub-Gaussian noise, which may not hold in all real-world scenarios. The paper could benefit from a discussion of how the method performs under different noise distributions.
4. Comparison with SGD: The authors dismiss stochastic gradient descent (SGD) due to the lack of a robust convex loss function for the corrupted model. However, a more detailed discussion or empirical comparison with SGD variants could provide additional insights.
Recommendation:
The paper makes a significant contribution to the field of robust regression and randomized algorithms. Its focus on addressing the challenges posed by corrupted observations is both timely and impactful. While there are some limitations, particularly regarding computational complexity and real-world validation, the strengths of the paper outweigh these concerns. I recommend acceptance, provided the authors address the noted weaknesses, particularly by expanding the discussion on practical limitations and exploring additional datasets to validate the proposed methods.
