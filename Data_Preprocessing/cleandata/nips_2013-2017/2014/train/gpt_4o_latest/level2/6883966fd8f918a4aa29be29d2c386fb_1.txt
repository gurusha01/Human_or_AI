The paper presents a novel active learning algorithm for parametric linear regression with random design, offering finite sample convergence guarantees under a potentially misspecified model. The authors claim this is the first active learner for this setting that provably improves over passive learning by reducing the distribution-dependent constant in the convergence rate, even though the passive learning rate of \(O(1/\epsilon)\) cannot generally be surpassed. The algorithm employs a stratification technique inspired by Monte Carlo function integration to approach the optimal oracle risk, and the authors provide theoretical guarantees for its performance.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Significance: The paper addresses an important gap in active learning for regression, providing a provable improvement over passive learning in terms of the distribution-dependent constant. This is a meaningful contribution to the field, as active learning for regression has historically been less explored compared to classification.
2. Theoretical Guarantees: The authors provide rigorous finite sample convergence guarantees, which are a significant improvement over asymptotic results in prior work. The explicit dependence of the convergence rate on the distribution and noise characteristics is particularly compelling.
3. Methodological Innovation: The use of stratification, inspired by Monte Carlo methods, to approximate the oracle risk is a creative approach. The algorithm's ability to adapt to the underlying distribution without prior knowledge of the conditional label distribution is a notable strength.
4. Comprehensive Related Work: The paper situates its contributions well within the context of prior work, referencing key studies in both active learning and regression. The comparison to passive learning and the demonstration of the algorithm's superiority in specific cases (e.g., the 1-dimensional example) are well-executed.
Weaknesses:
1. Practical Applicability: While the theoretical results are strong, the paper lacks an empirical evaluation to demonstrate the algorithm's practical performance. Real-world experiments would provide evidence of its utility and robustness in practical settings.
2. Clarity and Accessibility: The paper is dense and mathematically rigorous, which may limit accessibility for a broader audience. The notation is complex, and some steps in the proofs are only briefly explained, making it challenging to follow without significant effort.
3. Assumptions: The boundedness assumption on the label error relative to the optimal predictor may not hold in all real-world scenarios. While the authors mention that this could be replaced with sub-Gaussian tail assumptions, this alternative is not fully explored.
4. Static Allocation of Samples: The algorithm uses a fixed allocation of samples across stages and partitions, which may not be optimal. The authors acknowledge this limitation and suggest that dynamic allocation could improve performance, but this is left as future work.
Recommendation:
I recommend acceptance of the paper, as it makes a significant theoretical contribution to active learning for regression and addresses a challenging problem with novel techniques. However, the authors are strongly encouraged to include empirical results in a future version to validate the practical utility of their approach. Additionally, improving the clarity of the presentation and exploring dynamic sample allocation would further enhance the paper's impact.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper advances the state of the art in active learning for regression with provable guarantees.
- It introduces a novel approach that is theoretically sound and well-situated within existing literature.
- The potential for significant label complexity reduction is demonstrated both theoretically and through illustrative examples.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The lack of empirical validation limits the paper's practical relevance.
- The dense presentation may hinder accessibility for a broader audience.
Overall, the paper is a strong theoretical contribution and aligns well with the goals of the conference.
