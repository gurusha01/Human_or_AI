This paper presents a novel hybrid policy search method that combines local linear model fitting with guided policy search (GPS) to optimize trajectory distributions for large, continuous control problems. The authors claim that their approach requires fewer samples than model-free methods while handling complex, discontinuous dynamics that challenge traditional model-based techniques. The paper also demonstrates the method's ability to learn neural network policies for tasks like robotic manipulation and locomotion in partially observed environments.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Contribution: The hybrid approach bridges the gap between model-free and model-based methods, leveraging the strengths of both. The use of time-varying linear-Gaussian controllers and KL-divergence constraints is innovative and addresses key limitations in existing methods.
2. Experimental Validation: The paper provides comprehensive experiments across diverse tasks, including peg insertion, octopus arm control, swimming, and walking. The results convincingly demonstrate the method's superiority in terms of sample efficiency and robustness to discontinuities.
3. Practical Relevance: The ability to train neural network policies for partially observed tasks, such as peg insertion without precise hole positions, is particularly impactful for real-world robotics applications.
4. Clarity of Claims: The paper clearly outlines its contributions, including improved sample efficiency, the ability to handle discontinuous dynamics, and the integration of GPS with unknown dynamics.
Weaknesses:
1. Theoretical Analysis: While the empirical results are strong, the theoretical justification for the method's convergence and robustness to discontinuities is limited. A more rigorous analysis would strengthen the paper.
2. Comparisons: Although the paper compares its method to several baselines, some comparisons (e.g., against state-of-the-art reinforcement learning methods like PPO or SAC) are missing, which could provide a broader context for the method's performance.
3. Scalability: The approach relies on local linear models and Gaussian assumptions, which may limit scalability to very high-dimensional or highly stochastic environments. This limitation is not thoroughly discussed.
4. Reproducibility: While the experimental results are detailed, the paper lacks sufficient implementation details (e.g., hyperparameters, computational requirements) to ensure reproducibility.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:
Pros:
- The method addresses a significant gap between model-free and model-based policy search.
- Experimental results are compelling and demonstrate clear advantages over existing methods.
- The approach has practical implications for robotics and other real-world domains.
Cons:
- Limited theoretical analysis and scalability discussion.
- Missing comparisons with some modern reinforcement learning algorithms.
- Reproducibility could be improved with more implementation details.
Recommendation:
Overall, this paper makes a strong contribution to the field of policy search and reinforcement learning, particularly for robotics applications. While there are some areas for improvement, the novelty, practical relevance, and empirical results outweigh the weaknesses. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the theoretical and reproducibility concerns.
