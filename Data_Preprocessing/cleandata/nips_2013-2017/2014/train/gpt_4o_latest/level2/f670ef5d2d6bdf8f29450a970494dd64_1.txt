The paper introduces a novel framework for regularization based on group-induced majorization, leveraging the concept of orbitopes to control model complexity. By defining a group action on the parameter space and confining parameters to the convex hull of group orbits, the authors unify and generalize several existing regularizers, including `1, `2, and nuclear norms, while also introducing new ones such as the permutahedron and signed permutahedron. The paper establishes connections between these orbitopes and the recently proposed sorted `1-norm, providing theoretical insights and practical algorithms for optimization. The authors further propose a continuation strategy for orbit exploration and demonstrate its effectiveness through simulations.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Generalization: The paper presents an innovative framework that unifies existing regularization techniques while introducing new ones. The connection between group theory and regularization is novel and has the potential to inspire further research.
2. Theoretical Rigor: The paper is grounded in solid mathematical foundations, with clear definitions of key concepts such as orbitopes, group actions, and G-majorization. The duality results and connections to atomic norms are particularly compelling.
3. Algorithmic Contributions: The proposed conditional and projected gradient algorithms are well-suited for the framework, and the continuation strategy for orbit exploration is an interesting addition.
4. Practical Relevance: The framework subsumes widely used regularizers, making it accessible to practitioners. The sorted `1-norm connection is a valuable contribution, as it links the framework to recent advances in sparsity-inducing methods.
5. Simulation Results: The experiments demonstrate the practical utility of the proposed methods, showing competitive or superior performance compared to traditional regularizers.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity: While the paper is mathematically rigorous, it is dense and may be challenging for readers unfamiliar with group theory or convex optimization. Simplifying some explanations and providing more intuitive examples would improve accessibility.
2. Limited Practical Demonstrations: The simulations are promising but limited in scope. Real-world applications, such as image reconstruction or natural language processing, would better illustrate the framework's practical impact.
3. Computational Complexity: The paper does not thoroughly discuss the computational overhead of the proposed methods, particularly for large-scale problems or complex groups. A comparison of runtime with traditional regularizers would be helpful.
4. Exploration of Limitations: While the authors acknowledge the framework's exploratory nature, a more detailed discussion of its limitations (e.g., scalability, sensitivity to group choice) would strengthen the paper.
Recommendation:
The paper is a strong contribution to the field, offering a novel perspective on regularization through group-induced majorization. Its theoretical insights and algorithmic innovations are significant, and the framework has the potential to advance the state of the art in structured sparsity. However, the paper would benefit from improved clarity, broader experimental validation, and a more thorough discussion of limitations. I recommend acceptance, contingent on addressing these issues in the final version.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Novel and theoretically sound framework with broad applicability.
- Significant generalization of existing regularizers.
- Promising experimental results and practical algorithms.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Dense presentation may hinder accessibility.
- Limited real-world validation and discussion of computational costs.
Overall, the paper is a valuable scientific contribution and aligns with the conference's focus on advancing machine learning methodologies.
