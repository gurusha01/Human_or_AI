The paper introduces the Parallel Direction Method of Multipliers (PDMM), a randomized block coordinate variant of ADMM, to solve optimization problems involving block-separable convex functions with linear constraints. The authors address the limitations of existing multi-block ADMM methods, particularly their convergence issues and inefficiencies, by proposing PDMM, which updates multiple blocks in parallel using randomized block coordinate descent. The paper establishes global convergence and iteration complexity for PDMM with constant step size and demonstrates its practical utility through applications in robust principal component analysis (RPCA) and overlapping group lasso.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Contribution: The paper presents a significant innovation by generalizing ADMM to multi-block settings with randomized parallel updates. This is a meaningful contribution to optimization and machine learning, as it addresses the scalability and convergence challenges of existing methods.
2. Theoretical Rigor: The authors provide detailed theoretical analysis, including global convergence and iteration complexity proofs, which are essential for establishing the reliability of PDMM. The connection between PDMM and existing methods (e.g., sADMM and PJADMM) is insightful and enhances understanding of the broader ADMM framework.
3. Practical Relevance: The experimental results on RPCA and overlapping group lasso demonstrate that PDMM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of convergence speed and runtime. The consideration of sparsity and randomized block updates makes PDMM well-suited for large-scale problems.
4. Clarity of Presentation: The paper is well-organized, with a clear progression from problem formulation to algorithm development, theoretical analysis, and experimental validation. The inclusion of practical implementation details (e.g., step size selection) is helpful for reproducibility.
Weaknesses:
1. Experimental Scope: While the experiments on RPCA and overlapping group lasso are compelling, the evaluation could be extended to more diverse applications to better demonstrate the generality of PDMM.
2. Parameter Sensitivity: The paper briefly discusses the effect of parameters (e.g., step size, number of blocks) but does not provide a systematic analysis of their impact on performance. This could be critical for practitioners seeking to apply PDMM in real-world scenarios.
3. Comparison with Non-ADMM Methods: The experimental comparisons focus primarily on ADMM-based methods. Including comparisons with other optimization frameworks (e.g., proximal gradient methods) could provide a broader perspective on PDMM's advantages and limitations.
4. Scalability Analysis: Although PDMM is designed for parallelism, the paper does not include a detailed analysis of its scalability on distributed or multi-core systems, which would be valuable given its emphasis on parallel updates.
Recommendation:
The paper makes a strong contribution to the field of optimization and is well-suited for presentation at the conference. The theoretical and experimental results are robust, and the proposed method addresses a relevant and challenging problem. However, the authors could strengthen the paper by expanding the experimental evaluation to include more diverse applications and a deeper analysis of parameter sensitivity and scalability. Overall, I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address these points.
