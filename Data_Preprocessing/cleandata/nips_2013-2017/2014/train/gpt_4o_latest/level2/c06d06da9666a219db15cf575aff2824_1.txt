This paper introduces Continuous Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (COMP), a novel greedy algorithm for recovering the timings and amplitudes of waveforms from signals composed of shifted and scaled copies of known templates. The authors build upon the Continuous Basis Pursuit (CBP) framework, extending it through the use of a singular value decomposition (SVD)-derived basis, a greedy selection process inspired by Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP), and a Fourier domain refinement for time-shift estimation. The method is tested on both simulated and neural data, demonstrating improvements in speed and accuracy over CBP.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Contribution: The paper presents a significant extension to CBP by introducing a new basis (SVD), a greedy recovery process, and Fourier domain refinement. These innovations address key limitations of CBP, such as computational inefficiency and sensitivity to noise.
2. Experimental Validation: The authors provide thorough evaluations on simulated and neural data, demonstrating that COMP achieves superior accuracy and robustness to noise compared to CBP. The use of real-world neural data highlights the practical applicability of the method.
3. Speed Improvements: COMP is shown to be significantly faster than CBP, particularly for small bin sizes (∆), which is critical for real-time applications like spike sorting.
4. Clarity of Results: The paper includes detailed quantitative metrics (e.g., false positives, misses, and hit errors) and visualizations that clearly illustrate the advantages of COMP over CBP.
Weaknesses:
1. Limited Theoretical Analysis: While the empirical results are strong, the paper lacks a deeper theoretical exploration of why the SVD basis and Fourier refinement outperform existing approaches. A more rigorous analysis could strengthen the claims.
2. Scalability Concerns: Although COMP is faster than CBP, the greedy optimization step (Equation 5) could become computationally expensive for large-scale problems with many waveforms or time bins. The authors do not discuss the scalability of their approach in detail.
3. Choice of Parameters: The method relies on several hyperparameters (e.g., K, ∆), but the paper does not provide clear guidelines for selecting these in practice. This could hinder reproducibility and adoption by practitioners.
4. Comparison to Other Methods: The paper primarily compares COMP to CBP. Including comparisons to other state-of-the-art sparse recovery or spike-sorting methods would provide a more comprehensive evaluation.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:
- Pro: The paper introduces a novel and practically useful method that advances the state of the art in sparse recovery and spike sorting. The empirical results are compelling, and the improvements in speed and accuracy are significant.
- Con: The lack of theoretical analysis and limited discussion of scalability and parameter selection leave some questions unanswered. Broader comparisons to other methods would strengthen the paper's impact.
Recommendation: Accept with minor revisions. The paper makes a meaningful contribution to the field and is well-suited for the NIPS audience. However, addressing the theoretical underpinnings, scalability, and parameter selection in a revision would enhance its overall quality.
