This paper addresses the problem of low-rank approximation in the streaming model, specifically focusing on the space complexity of algorithms that output a rank-k approximation matrix \( R \) with a relative error guarantee. The authors establish a lower bound of \( \Omega(dk/\epsilon) \) bits of space for any streaming algorithm in the row-update model, even for randomized algorithms with a constant probability of success. This result matches the upper bound of \( O(dk/\epsilon) \) words of space achieved by the deterministic algorithm of Liberty (2013) with improved analysis by Ghashami and Phillips (2014), up to the word size. The paper uses communication complexity techniques, specifically the Index problem, to derive the lower bound, and provides a detailed technical proof to support the claim.
Strengths:
1. Significant Contribution: The paper resolves an important open question in the field by proving the tightness of the \( O(dk/\epsilon) \) space bound for streaming low-rank approximation algorithms. This result establishes the optimality of existing algorithms and provides a clear theoretical foundation for future work.
2. Technical Rigor: The proof is thorough and well-constructed, leveraging advanced techniques from communication complexity. The authors carefully address the challenges of reducing the problem to the Index problem and provide detailed arguments to support their claims.
3. Clarity of Results: The main theorem is clearly stated, and the implications for the field are well-articulated. The authors also highlight the significance of the \( 1/\epsilon \) factor in the lower bound, particularly for applications requiring high precision.
4. Contextualization: The paper situates its contributions within the broader literature on streaming algorithms and low-rank approximation, referencing relevant prior work and discussing how this result advances the state of the art.
Weaknesses:
1. Accessibility: While the technical content is rigorous, the paper is dense and may be difficult for non-experts to follow. The proofs, while detailed, could benefit from additional high-level explanations or intuitive summaries to aid understanding.
2. Experimental Validation: The paper is purely theoretical and does not include any empirical evaluation or practical demonstrations of the implications of the lower bound. While not strictly necessary, such experiments could strengthen the paper's impact by illustrating real-world scenarios where the bound is relevant.
3. Scope of Results: The focus is limited to the row-update model, and the authors acknowledge that extending these results to multi-pass algorithms or other models remains an open challenge. Addressing these broader cases would further enhance the paper's significance.
Recommendation:
I recommend accepting this paper for its strong theoretical contribution and rigorous analysis. The result is a significant advancement in understanding the space complexity of streaming low-rank approximation algorithms and has clear implications for both theory and practice. However, the authors are encouraged to consider adding more intuitive explanations and discussing potential practical implications in greater detail to make the work more accessible to a broader audience.
Pros for Acceptance:
- Resolves an open question with a tight lower bound.
- Rigorous and technically sound analysis.
- Advances the theoretical understanding of streaming algorithms.
Cons for Acceptance:
- Dense and challenging for non-experts to follow.
- No experimental or practical validation.
- Limited to the row-update model without addressing multi-pass algorithms.
Overall, this paper represents a valuable contribution to the field and should be included in the conference program.
