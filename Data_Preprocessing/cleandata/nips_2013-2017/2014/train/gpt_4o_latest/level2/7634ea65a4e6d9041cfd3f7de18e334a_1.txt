The paper proposes a novel approach to sparse signal recovery by introducing the Structured Spike and Slab Prior, which incorporates a priori knowledge of sparsity patterns using a spatial Gaussian process. This formulation allows the encoding of structural information about sparsity patterns through generic covariance functions, offering a significant improvement over traditional sparsity-promoting priors. The authors also present a Bayesian inference scheme based on the Expectation Propagation (EP) framework and demonstrate the efficacy of their method through numerical experiments on synthetic data.
Strengths:
1. Novelty: The proposed model is innovative, extending traditional spike and slab priors by introducing structured sparsity through Gaussian processes. This approach is a meaningful advancement over existing methods like group LASSO and Markov Random Fields (MRFs).
2. Theoretical Rigor: The derivation of the hierarchical prior and the Bayesian inference scheme is mathematically sound and well-detailed. The use of EP to approximate the intractable posterior distribution is appropriate and builds on prior work effectively.
3. Experimental Validation: The paper provides comprehensive numerical experiments that compare the proposed method against established baselines (e.g., LARS, BG-AMP). The results demonstrate improved performance in terms of phase transition, F-measure, and normalized mean square error (NMSE), particularly in scenarios with structured sparsity.
4. Practical Applicability: The extension of the model to the multiple measurement vector (MMV) formulation and its application to EEG source localization showcases the practical utility of the method in real-world problems.
5. Clarity of Results: Visualizations, such as the posterior mean of activation probabilities and covariance structures, effectively illustrate the advantages of the proposed method.
Weaknesses:
1. Computational Complexity: The algorithm has a high computational cost, scaling as \(O(D^3)\) for large-scale problems. While the authors propose approximations (e.g., low-rank covariance matrices), this remains a limitation compared to faster methods like BG-AMP.
2. Limited Real-World Validation: While the synthetic experiments are thorough, the paper would benefit from more extensive testing on real-world datasets beyond EEG source localization to demonstrate robustness.
3. Assumptions on Covariance Structure: The method relies heavily on the choice of covariance functions (e.g., squared exponential kernels). The performance may degrade if the true underlying structure deviates significantly from these assumptions.
4. Reproducibility: While the theoretical details are well-documented, the paper lacks sufficient implementation details (e.g., hyperparameter tuning, initialization strategies) to ensure reproducibility.
Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Address the computational bottleneck by exploring more efficient approximations or scalable alternatives to EP.
2. Include experiments on additional real-world datasets to validate the method's generalizability.
3. Provide a more detailed discussion on how to select or learn the covariance structure for different applications.
4. Share code or pseudocode to improve reproducibility.
Recommendation:
The paper presents a significant contribution to the field of sparse signal recovery by introducing a novel structured prior and a Bayesian inference scheme. Despite its computational limitations, the method demonstrates clear advantages in leveraging structured sparsity. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address reproducibility and computational concerns. This work is likely to inspire further research in structured sparsity modeling and scalable inference techniques.
