The paper investigates the limitations of Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) in recovering low-rank matrices from corrupted data, particularly when the data exhibit clustering structures that lead to high coherence. It proposes an enhancement using the Low-Rank Representation (LRR) framework, which incorporates a learned dictionary matrix to mitigate the adverse effects of coherence. The authors mathematically prove that when the dictionary is low-rank and appropriately constructed, LRR becomes immune to coherence parameters, outperforming RPCA in such scenarios. The paper introduces a practical algorithm that leverages RPCA to estimate the low-rank component and subsequently constructs a dictionary for LRR. Experiments on synthetic data and real-world motion sequences demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Contribution: The paper addresses a significant limitation of RPCA by introducing a dictionary-based LRR framework. The theoretical insights into coherence parameters and their impact on recovery performance are valuable contributions to the field.
2. Theoretical Rigor: The authors provide clear mathematical proofs supporting their claims, particularly regarding the conditions under which LRR can avoid coherence issues.
3. Practical Algorithm: The proposed algorithm is simple yet effective, combining RPCA and LRR in a way that is computationally efficient and easy to implement.
4. Experimental Validation: The experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets are comprehensive and convincingly demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method over RPCA.
5. Clarity of Results: The paper provides detailed comparisons, such as success regions in synthetic data and clustering error rates in motion sequences, which make the improvements tangible.
Weaknesses:
1. Limited Discussion of Limitations: While the paper acknowledges that the approach is preliminary, it does not sufficiently discuss potential limitations, such as the sensitivity of the algorithm to noise levels or the choice of parameters like Î».
2. Generality of the Dictionary Learning: The proposed dictionary construction relies on RPCA, which may inherit some of RPCA's limitations. The paper could explore alternative dictionary learning strategies to broaden applicability.
3. Scalability: Although the paper claims computational efficiency, the scalability of the method to very large datasets is not thoroughly analyzed.
4. Comparison with Other Methods: The paper primarily compares its method to RPCA. A broader comparison with other robust matrix recovery techniques, such as sparse subspace clustering or matrix factorization approaches, would strengthen the evaluation.
Recommendation:
The paper is a strong contribution to the field of robust matrix recovery and is well-suited for presentation at NIPS. Its theoretical insights, practical algorithm, and experimental results are compelling. However, addressing the identified weaknesses, particularly a more detailed discussion of limitations and broader comparisons, would enhance its impact. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions.
