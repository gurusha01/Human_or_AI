This paper addresses the problem of transportability, which generalizes the issue of identifiability of causal effects based on causal assumptions or knowledge encoded in a causal diagram. A paper by Bareinboim et al., published at NIPS last year, explored a fairly general version of this problem. The setup involves observing a set of variables across multiple domains, including a target domain and one or more source domains, all of which share a (known) qualitative causal structure over the observed and latent variables. However, the structural equations may vary between the source and target domains, as represented by selection variables in the so-called selection diagrams, which are also assumed to be known. Additionally, in each domain, a subset of the observed variables can be actively manipulated to collect interventional data (limited experiments). The central question is whether a specific interventional probability in the target domain can be (non-parametrically) identified using the available observational and interventional distributions across all domains. The paper under review extends this line of work by demonstrating that the sound algorithm introduced by Bareinboim et al. in last year's NIPS is complete and that Pearl's do-calculus is also complete for this problem.
The results presented in the paper are valuable contributions to a well-defined and compelling area of research, touching on significant topics such as "external validity" and "meta-analysis." While parts of the paper are dense and may be challenging for readers unfamiliar with prior work, the main ideas are conveyed with sufficient clarity. I have the following comments and questions:
1. In Definition 1, the paper implicitly adopts Pearl's definition of structural equation models, where each structural equation corresponds to a single U-variable (i.e., the structural equation \(fi\) for variable \(Vi\) is associated with \(U_i\)). This makes it somewhat confusing when multiple U-variables appear in the examples on p. 5 and elsewhere. Could this be clarified?
2. Definition 2 assumes that if a set \(Z\) can be intervened upon in a domain, then any subset of \(Z\) can also be intervened upon (without affecting other variables in \(Z\)) in that domain. Is there any scope for relaxing this assumption?
3. While Theorem 1 is attributed to Bareinboim et al. (2013), its statement is somewhat unclear. Specifically, what does it mean to say that "a do-operator has no \(Si\)-variables"? Does this imply that the do-operator does not act on any \(Si\)-variable? If the do-operator applies to a subset of \(IZ^i\), wouldn't it automatically exclude \(Si\)-variables? Moreover, it seems that any expression in which every do-operator applies to a set other than subsets of \(I_Z^i\) would satisfy condition (1). Could this be clarified?
4. In footnote 5, the paper suggests that causal discovery methods could be used to learn the causal diagrams. It might be worth emphasizing that causal discovery algorithms rarely, if ever, recover the full causal diagram when latent variables are present. Additionally, I am curious about how selection diagrams are expected to be learned from data.
5. Definition 5 is central to the paper, but its presentation and the accompanying remarks are quite dense. It might improve readability if the definition of a "hedge" is introduced separately, followed by the definition of an "mz-shedge" as a collection of hedges meeting specific conditions.
In the subsequent paragraph, it would be helpful to explicitly link conditions 1, 2, and 3 in the definition to conditions (i) and (ii). 
The remark at the bottom of the page—"Also, it might happen that the root set \(R\) must be augmented …"—is somewhat cryptic. A clarification of its meaning would be appreciated.
Overall, the paper establishes new and useful results on an intriguing problem.
