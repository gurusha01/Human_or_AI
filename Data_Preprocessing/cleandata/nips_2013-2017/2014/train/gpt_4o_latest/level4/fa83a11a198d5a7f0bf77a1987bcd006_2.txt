The authors introduce a novel bias-corrected estimator for covariance matrices tailored to autocorrelated data. They validate their approach using both simulated data and a real-world brain-computer interface dataset, demonstrating its superior performance relative to the standard estimator, a shrinkage estimator, and the Sancetta estimator.
The manuscript tackles an important and intriguing problem, and the proposed methodology represents a valuable contribution. However, I found the paper somewhat difficult to follow, and the experimental results on the real-world dataset were not entirely convincing:
* The authors do not adequately introduce their notation. While much of it can be inferred from context, this omission makes the manuscript more challenging to read than necessary.
* The heuristic adjustment to the Sancetta estimator in Section 2 was not entirely clear to me.
* Similarly, I would appreciate a more detailed explanation of the bias-corrected estimator presented in equation (6). The discussion section largely summarizes the authors' work and could potentially be condensed to allow for a more thorough exposition in Section 2.
* Section 4 lacks some critical details about the decoding procedure. Specifically, how many CSP filters were used for decoding? What frequency band was analyzed? How was cross-validation performed?
* My primary concern with this manuscript is the methodology used for evaluating the estimators. It seems that the authors use only two trials to estimate the CSP filters and select only the two most discriminative CSP filters for the plots in Figures 6 and 7. This approach deviates from standard practice in this context and appears to have been chosen to emphasize differences between the estimators. Moreover, Figure 7 suggests that the observed differences in performance arise not from improved spatial filter estimation but from variations in the ranking of the CSP components. Typically, one would use the top six CSP filters rather than just the top two. Based on my experience, this broader set of CSP filters would likely include components corresponding to both the left and right sensorimotor cortices across all estimators. If this is the case, the differences in decoding performance between the estimators would likely diminish. To convincingly demonstrate the superiority of the bias-corrected estimator, I would like to see decoding results based on CSP filters that target the same brain regions.
Typos and minor comments:
* It seems that the normalization term is missing in equation (3).
* In Section 2, "rate of p" should be corrected to "rate of n."
* The first sentence of the second paragraph in Section 5 is difficult to parse and could be rephrased for clarity. Overall, this is a very interesting piece of theoretical work. However, the experimental results on real-world data appear to have been tuned to present the proposed estimator in a more favorable light than would be observed in a more realistic scenario.
