The paper introduces a Bayesian quadrature (BQ) method that incorporates a square root transform and an active learning strategy. Two approximation techniques for the likelihood Gaussian process prior are investigated: linearization and moment matching. Additionally, a straightforward active sampling approach (excluding integration) is employed to enhance computational efficiency.
The manuscript is well written and clear. While I am not a specialist in Bayesian quadrature, I found the paper to be an informative and educational read. My primary concern lies with the experimental section. The authors have not compared their proposed method against other BQ approaches, making it difficult to assess its relative performance. The comparison is limited to slower MCMC methods, which does not fully demonstrate the method's advantages. Furthermore, it would be beneficial for the authors to report the number of points required to achieve the same level of accuracy as MCMC methods (at least Bayesian Monte Carlo and Sequential Monte Carlo).
Overall, this is a well-written contribution to BQ, but the experimental section could be strengthened.
