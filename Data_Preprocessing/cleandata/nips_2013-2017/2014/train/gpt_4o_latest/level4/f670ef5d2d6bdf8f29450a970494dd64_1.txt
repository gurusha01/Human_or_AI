Paraphrased Review
Summary:  
The authors reinterpret regularization in optimization problems as a constraint of the form "the parameters ${\bf w}$ must lie within the convex set $O$", where $O$ is defined as the convex hull of all points of the form $g.v$, with $v$ being a fixed vector, $g$ an element of a group, and $.$ representing a (linear) group action of $g$ on $v$.
More specifically, the paper's main contributions are as follows:  
(A) The authors demonstrate how several regularizations can be derived from their framework. For instance, the L1 norm ball is shown to correspond to the convex hull of points obtained by flipping the signs and permuting the components of the vector $(1,0,0,\dots,0)$.  
(B) They establish that, given a seed vector $v$ and a group action associated with a group $G$, the condition "$w$ belongs to the convex set $O_G(v)$" can be interpreted as "$v$ is smaller than $w$" under a pre-order.  
(C) They prove that if $-v$ is contained within the convex set $O$, then $O$ can be interpreted as the ball of an atomic norm (as defined in Chandra et al.).  
(D) They show that the L1-sorted norm is equivalent to the dual of the norm associated with the signed-permutation orbitope.  
(E) They reinterpret the key steps of conditional and projected gradient algorithms using the language of orbitopes and propose a method for computing projections onto orbitopes.  
(F) They introduce a heuristic algorithm that iteratively modifies the shape of the ball-norm associated with the regularizer, thereby generalizing the concept of regularization paths.
Quality:  
The paper does not contain any technical errors. The most intriguing idea, in my opinion, is the concept of morphing the shape of the regularizer's ball-norm. However, there are a few points that require clarification. Homotopy methods typically compute complete regularization paths, which are then used in conjunction with techniques like cross-validation to determine the optimal level of regularization. I am unclear why the continuation algorithm terminates "at (the) point regularization is not having any effect." Additionally, it would be helpful if the authors could elaborate on the behavior of the continuation algorithm when $\epsilon = 0$. Specifically, when the shape of the ball-norm changes but its size remains constant, does the algorithm converge?
Proposition 10 has a straightforward pictorial explanation that could enhance clarity. Specifically, taking the dual of the norm associated with signed-permutations corresponds to converting the edges of the ball-norm in Fig. 1-right into vertices and vice versa. This transformation directly yields the ball-norm of the sorted L1-norm, which can be viewed as the intersection of the ball-norms of all weighted L1-norms obtained by permuting the coefficients $w$.
In Proposition 3, the authors demonstrate that, under certain conditions, orbit regularizers can be interpreted as atomic norms. It would be beneficial to clarify when and how atomic norms can be understood as orbit regularizers.
Clarity:  
The paper is generally well-written and clear. However, there are a few minor issues that could be addressed:  
- In Line 071, a parenthesis is missing.  
- In Lines 244-246, subscripts are missing in $m({\bf w},{\bf v})$, and including them would improve clarity.  
- The quality of the figures should be improved. Are the images in vector format? When printed, they appear blurred.  
- It would be helpful to include numbered references, e.g., [1], [2], etc.  
- In Fig. 4, the scale of the y-axis is unclearâ€”what does it represent?
Significance:  
The idea of morphing the shape of the regularizer's ball-norm is potentially interesting. However, the numerical results do not convincingly demonstrate that the continuation algorithm, in its current form, leads to significantly improved performance. For example, Fig. 5 analyzes only one simple case, and the results in Fig. 4 appear inconclusive. Additionally, it would be valuable to report the number of iterations required for the continuation algorithm to converge.
Originality:  
The reinterpretation of regularization using orbitopes is novel. Similarly, the continuation algorithm, which iteratively modifies the shape of ball-norms in addition to scaling them, appears to be a new contribution. The paper is well-written and free of technical errors, but many of the contributions involve reinterpreting existing ideas in the context of orbitopes. The continuation algorithm is the most distinct contribution, as it offers a potentially new approach to solving problems. However, the algorithm lacks theoretical guarantees, and the numerical results provided are somewhat limited.
