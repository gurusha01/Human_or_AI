The authors introduced a data-dependent kernel referred to as Fredholm kernels. The key innovation of this kernel lies in its natural utilization of unlabeled datasets. The authors demonstrated several theoretical properties of the kernel and provided experimental evidence showing that it performs competitively against existing state-of-the-art methods.
The paper is well-written and well-structured.
Detailed comments:  
1. Is there a systematic method for selecting the kernel width for the Fredholm kernel? For instance, under certain assumptions, could the kernel width be determined through cross-validation?  
2. Including some toy experiments to illustrate scenarios where the proposed method might fail would be beneficial. This would help clarify the settings in which the proposed approach is most effective.  
Overall, the paper is engaging and clearly presented. I recommend it for acceptance.
