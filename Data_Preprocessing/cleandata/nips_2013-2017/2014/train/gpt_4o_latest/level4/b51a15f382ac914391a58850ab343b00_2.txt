This paper introduces a method for unsupervised manifold alignment, which aims to find a shared embedding space for two different but related datasets such that corresponding data points are mapped to similar locations (e.g., faces from two distinct individuals with the same expression and pose). The proposed approach has potential applications in mapping datasets with significantly different appearances and in recognition tasks.
Unlike prior methods that treat structure matching (ensuring related data points share similar local geometry) and alignment (determining which data points are related) as separate steps, this work highlights the limitations of such a two-step process, particularly for partial matching scenarios. The authors propose a novel approach to jointly learn these two components, addressing the sub-optimality of prior methods.
The idea of simultaneously learning alignment and structure is both intuitive and compelling. The paper is well-written, well-structured, and includes an extensive set of experiments. Notably, the authors extend the Frank-Wolfe integer programming algorithm to optimize the alignment process. It was also insightful to analyze the effects of using only the structure matching term or the feature matching term in isolation.
There appears to be limited prior work on unsupervised manifold alignment (as opposed to semi-supervised approaches), with only two such methods discussed in the introduction. One question that arises is how much user labeling would be required for a semi-supervised approach to achieve performance comparable to the proposed method. This could provide valuable context regarding the significance of the results and the importance of assuming no correspondences. Additionally, it would be interesting to explore whether the proposed method could be extended to scenarios where hard assignments are unsuitable and alignment is better modeled using a mapping approach [19].
In summary, this paper addresses the unsupervised manifold alignment problem by proposing a method that simultaneously learns structure and alignment, improving upon prior two-step methods. The authors also introduce an extension to the Frank-Wolfe integer programming algorithm and conduct thorough evaluations to validate their approach.
