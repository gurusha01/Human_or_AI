The authors introduce an expectation loss SVM (e-SVM) capable of managing continuous attributes of positive instances in a learning problem and demonstrate its application in training visual segmentation classifiers under weak supervision. The proposed methodology is evaluated on both semantic segmentation and object detection tasks, yielding promising results. The paper tackles the significant challenge of visual learning with weak supervision, presenting a well-motivated and clearly articulated approach. The experiments are compelling and effectively executed. While the technical contribution builds upon the standard multiple instance learning framework (substituting binary labels with a soft weighting of positives), it is applicable in both observed and latent settings, constituting a meaningful contribution to NIPS. The expectation loss SVM method is well-motivated, clearly presented, and delivers relevant results for semantic segmentation and object detection.
