This paper presents a strong contribution, offering compelling theoretical insights alongside robust simulated and real-world data results. While the work is impressive, I have identified several major and minor concerns that should be addressed.
Major Concerns
1. The choice of the truncation parameter \( b \) is insufficiently discussed. While \(\lambda\) can be selected via cross-validation (CV) or a theoretical tool, the latter is advantageous if it is parameter-free. However, the proposed method introduces \( b \), and the manuscript does not adequately explain how \( b \) should be chosen or the extent to which the results are robust to this choice. For this method to be widely adopted as a standard, a thorough discussion on selecting \( b \) and its robustness is essential.
2. The primary advantage of this method over CV is its computational efficiency. However, practitioners often balance accuracy against computational time. While this method is faster than CV (assuming a reliable way to choose \( b \)), its accuracy relative to CV is unclear. If the method is significantly less accurate, the computational speedup may not justify its use. For instance, in the real data example, one could simply use the average class covariances from other subjects, which would be both fast and parameter-free, potentially achieving similar accuracy. This trade-off should be explicitly addressed.
Minor Concerns
- In Equation (5), \( b \) is described as a constant satisfying certain properties as a function of \( n \). Please clarify these assumptions more formally and provide a precise definition of the truncation kernel.
- The phrase "we will provide a complementary analysis on the behaviour of the estimator for finite \( n \)" could be misleading. Consider specifying "complementary theoretical analysis" to avoid confusion with purely numerical analysis, which is inherently weaker.
- Line 206 is missing a space.
- Regarding the remarks on Theorem 1, additional explanation of the relative magnitudes of the three biases would be helpful. Since the biases depend on \( b \), \( n \), \( s \), and the covariances, visual aids such as plots or heatmaps would be valuable. For example, a heatmap showing \(\text{bias}(\text{San}) - \text{bias}(\text{BC})\) for fixed \( n \) while varying \( b \) and \( s \), or for fixed \( b_n \) while varying \( n \) and \( s \), would clarify these relationships.
- The simulation setting is unclear and requires more detailed explanation. Please include equations to clarify the setup. The notation for the "parameter matrix" is ambiguous, and the meaning of '/' is unclear. Additionally, the abbreviation "cmp" is not defined. If space is a concern, consider consolidating paragraph breaks to prioritize clarity.
- A supplementary figure supporting the claim in Footnote 4 would be beneficial.
- In the sentence "We average over \( R \) multivariate," please specify the value of \( R \) used in the simulations.
- A stronger justification is needed for why one would estimate a covariance matrix from an AR process rather than the dynamics matrix. While the application presented at the end of the manuscript provides a compelling rationale, this motivation should be introduced earlier to guide the reader.
Conclusion
This is an excellent paper with the potential to become a new standard in the field. However, to achieve this, the authors must provide clear guidance on selecting \( b \), demonstrate that the method's performance is robust to this choice, and show that its accuracy is not significantly worse than cross-validation.
