The problem of aligning two manifolds has been extensively studied in the literature. This paper introduces a method for aligning two datasets under the critical assumption that both datasets reside on a single manifold, without requiring correspondences. This problem was initially addressed by Wang and Mahadevan (IJCAI 2009) and has since been explored by several other researchers. The proposed approach in this paper employs a more advanced loss function compared to prior work, which minimizes a combination of three components: a geometry matching term, a feature matching term, and a geometry preserving term. This formulation leads to a challenging non-convex optimization problem. To address this, the author(s) propose a sophisticated convex relaxation technique inspired by an alternating projection-like strategy, where projections are assumed to be known, and the resulting quadratic integer programming problem is solved using the Frank-Wolfe algorithm.
The paper includes an extensive set of experiments that compare the proposed method with the prior work of Wang and Mahadevan, as well as other approaches. The results demonstrate significantly improved performance on several synthetic datasets and moderately complex real-world datasets. These findings suggest a notable improvement over existing unsupervised alignment methods.
However, the primary limitation of this work lies in the critical assumption that the datasets lie on a single underlying manifold. This assumption is unlikely to hold for most real-world datasets, which often exist on a complex mixture of manifolds. While techniques for addressing alignment in such scenarios are beginning to emerge, they fall outside the scope of this paper. It would be valuable to explore whether the proposed method could be extended to handle this more realistic setting. Overall, the paper presents a novel approach for aligning two datasets on a single underlying manifold without correspondence information, achieving improved performance over prior methods, though the single manifold assumption remains a significant constraint.
