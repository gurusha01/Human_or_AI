This paper presents a robust logistic regression method designed to handle arbitrary outliers. As suggested by the title, the proposed approach demonstrates robustness to outliers, which is thoroughly examined both theoretically and experimentally.
The theoretical contribution regarding outliers (Theorem 1 and Remark 1) is noteworthy. The estimation algorithm is also commendable, relying solely on thresholding and linear programming. However, from a practical standpoint, the method has a limitation: it requires the user to specify the number of outliers in advance. This poses a challenge in real-world scenarios, as determining the exact number of outliers beforehand is often impractical. The paper would be stronger if the author(s) provided strategies to address this limitation. Additionally, the author(s) should discuss how the method's performance is affected when an incorrect number of outliers is specified.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and some of its theoretical contributions are particularly impressive. I believe this work has the potential to make a significant impact on the machine learning community.
