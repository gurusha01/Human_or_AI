This paper addresses the metric labeling problem, a specific instance of MAP/MPE inference in graphical models where the potentials are constrained to be a metric distance function. It is a theoretical work that explores intriguing connections between move-making algorithms (leveraging a reduction to min-cut) and certain rounding schemes employed alongside linear programming relaxations. In particular, the paper demonstrates that specific move-making algorithms can achieve approximation guarantees comparable to those of the rounding schemes, while benefiting from the efficiency of fast min-cut solvers.
The manuscript is exceptionally well-written. Despite its theoretical nature, the authors have succeeded in presenting the concepts in an accessible manner, emphasizing the key ideas without overwhelming the reader with excessive technical details. I appreciate that the paper is largely self-contained, and I found it an engaging read overall. While the focus is primarily theoretical, I also value the inclusion of an experimental section in the supplementary materials, which empirically validates the theoretical findings.
However, I have some concerns regarding the novelty of the results. Several closely related findings appear to have been previously established (e.g., mentioned as corollaries in the supplementary materials). It would be helpful to clearly delineate how Theorems 1, 2, and 3 extend or generalize prior work. Additionally, how do the move-making algorithms proposed in this paper (Algorithms 2, 4, and 6) compare to earlier move-making algorithms (e.g., [14, 15])? Is there a significant distinction that enables improved approximation guarantees?
Another point to clarify is the computational cost of solving the linear program (4) required for move-making. Is this cost accounted for in the runtime reported in the experimental results?
Lastly, is Algorithm 6 the same as the one referred to as HIER in the experimental section of the supplementary materials?
 EDIT   
Thank you for the detailed responsesâ€”they address my concerns effectively.  
This is a well-crafted paper that makes a valuable theoretical contribution by establishing approximation guarantees for move-making algorithms, a class of methods designed to solve the metric labeling problem. The paper tackles an important problem in computer vision, and its analysis has the potential to inspire the development of new inference algorithms for other combinatorial problems.
