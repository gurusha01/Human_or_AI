The authors propose a novel model for multi-armed bandits with non-stationary rewards, which is based on constraining the total variation of changes in the expected rewards of the arms. They establish a lower bound and present a new algorithm (an extension of EXP3) that achieves a matching upper bound with respect to its dependence on the time horizon.
The paper is well-organized and clearly written. The related work is appropriately cited, and the connections to prior research are adequately discussed.
However, I find the motivation for the model to be insufficiently addressed. While bounding the variation in expected rewards is theoretically appealing, it is unclear how such a property could be verified or utilized in practical applications. The authors should enhance their discussion to better justify the relevance of this model. Nevertheless, framing the problem in this way does create an interesting intermediate setting between the stochastic and adversarial bandit frameworks.
Regarding the lower bound, I appreciated the concise and clear presentation of the proof sketch for Theorem 1. The underlying ideas are well-articulated and easy to follow.
A significant concern I have with the paper lies in the definition of Rexp3. The algorithm is designed to achieve an optimal bound in the worst case (as shown in Theorem 1) by restarting an EXP3 instance at the beginning of every epoch. While this approach suffices from a theoretical perspective, it appears highly impractical to discard all prior information at the start of each epoch. Additionally, the algorithm assumes that VT is provided as input. It is unclear why this assumption is reasonable or how VT could be estimated in practice. While I am not asserting that this is infeasible, the authors should explicitly address and discuss this assumption.
I also have a question about Theorem 2: the proof is valid for VT â‰¥ 1/K (as stated in the theorem). What happens when VT approaches 0 (the stationary case) and becomes much smaller than 1/K? While I understand that this scenario is outside the scope of the theorem, it seems like a natural and important case to consider.
[Update] After reviewing the author feedback, I find their responses satisfactory and have increased my score to 6: Marginally above the acceptance threshold. The paper is well-written and addresses an interesting and timely problem. However, due to the concerns raised about the algorithm, I am still inclined to recommend rejection.
