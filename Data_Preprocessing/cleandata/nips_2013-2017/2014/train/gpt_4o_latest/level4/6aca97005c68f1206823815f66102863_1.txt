The paper builds upon Locally Weighted Regression (LWR) by modifying the loss function such that individual data points are weighted by each model, rather than combining weighted local models. By imposing a Gaussian prior on the coefficients of the models, the authors derive local models that are represented as Gaussian Processes (GPs). Initially, the batch version of the algorithm is introduced, where the centers of the local models are fixed. Subsequently, an incremental version is proposed, adopting a Bayesian approach where the posterior from previous iterations serves as the new prior, and new models can be incorporated.
Quality and Clarity
The paper is clearly written and easy to follow. The transition from LWR to Local Gaussian Processes (LGP) is well-motivated and effectively explained.
The experiments involve learning the inverse dynamics of a SARCOS arm and a KUKA arm in a robotic setup. The results demonstrate that LGP outperforms LWPR, a widely regarded state-of-the-art method for inverse dynamics learning, while achieving better performance with fewer local models.
Although the authors reference the article "Local Gaussian Process Regression for Real-Time" [16], the connection between the proposed method and [16] is only briefly discussed. A more detailed comparison, particularly at the experimental level, would enhance the paper.
Originality and Significance
The proposed weighting scheme for local models appears to be novel, and the experimental results underscore the importance of the approach. The paper extends LWR by introducing a new weighting mechanism that leads to local Gaussian models, with experimental evidence showing that the method surpasses a leading state-of-the-art algorithm.
