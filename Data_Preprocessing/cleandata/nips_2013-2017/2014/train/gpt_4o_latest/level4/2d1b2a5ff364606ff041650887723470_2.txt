An additive factorial hidden Markov model is proposed to capture electricity consumption patterns, incorporating the signal aggregate constraint.  
The paper demonstrates good quality but is quite challenging to follow. It contains an excessive number of acronyms, some of which are unusually long (up to 11 letters). The authors appear to aim for a constraint on the posterior density but instead impose it on the prior density. They should clarify that the constraint is applied a priori, which subsequently constrains the posterior.
