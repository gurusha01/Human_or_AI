The paper derives the exchangeable partition probability function (EPPF) for the beta negative binomial process (BNBP) and leverages it to design a collapsed Gibbs sampler for the BNBP topic model.
This is a well-written, fairly clear, and technically robust paper. The main contribution — the derivation of the BNBP's EPPF for mixed-membership modeling (achieved through "count-mixture" models) — is both intriguing in its own right and offers potentially valuable tools for deriving EPPFs in related frameworks.
Additional Comments:
Although the BNBP topic model serves as a reasonable demonstration of the developed EPPF and its associated prediction rule, the performance gains over the HDP-LDA are modest, and the primary takeaway is that the BNBP topic model and the HDP-LDA exhibit distinct characteristics. A more compelling experiment would involve comparing the collapsed sampler against the sliced sampler from [10] and the truncated sampler from [8] for inference in the BNBP topic model. Since uncollapsed representations naturally lend themselves to parallelization, it would be insightful to explore the tradeoffs in mixing performance relative to the collapsed sampler proposed here. Overall, this is an engaging paper that meets the publication criteria. I have only a few minor suggestions regarding the experimental section (see above).
