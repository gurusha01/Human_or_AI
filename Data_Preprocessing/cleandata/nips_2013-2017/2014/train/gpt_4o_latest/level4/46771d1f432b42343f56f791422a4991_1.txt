This paper examines the communication cost associated with distributed estimation for a d-dimensional spherical Gaussian distribution with an unknown mean and unit covariance, under the assumption that the joint distribution is a product distribution across coordinates. Extending prior work on the one-dimensional case in [4], the authors establish both upper and lower bounds for d-dimensional data under two communication frameworks: interactive and simultaneous communication settings, with the goal of achieving minimax squared loss. The findings elucidate the tradeoffs between dimensionality and communication cost in distributed estimation. Furthermore, the authors derive improved bounds for cases where the unknown mean is s-sparse.
While the model has certain limitations (e.g., the joint distribution is assumed to be a product distribution across coordinates, and the covariance matrix is known), this paper provides valuable insights into the communication cost of distributed estimation and the design of communication protocols. The results are technically rigorous, and the authors propose several practical protocols aimed at achieving the communication lower bounds.
A minor concern for this reviewer pertains to the paper's presentation. Specifically, the introduction is overly lengthy, and the absence of a conclusion section detracts from the overall clarity. It is recommended that the authors streamline the introduction and include a conclusion section to succinctly summarize the contributions. Additionally, inconsistencies in notation between the main paper and the supplementary file were somewhat frustrating, as they hindered the use of the supplementary file for clarification. For instance, Lemmas 1 and 2 in the main paper are identical to Lemmas 3 and 4 in the supplementary file. Overall, this paper provides a thorough analysis of communication cost bounds in distributed estimation, and the proposed protocols and results represent a significant contribution to the field.
