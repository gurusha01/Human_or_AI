This paper presents an intriguing approach to discovering more efficient algebraic identities. It is particularly compelling to observe that distributed, recursive neural representations are capable of successfully classifying these identities.
The scope of the problem definition appears to be somewhat narrow.
The following point is not well explained:
"weight tensorW3 (of size lxlxl, so that the output is also size l)."
Does this imply that a neural tensor network is being used instead of a simple linear network? Bowman demonstrated that tensor networks perform significantly better in such cases compared to RNNs.
Section 7.2: Efficient Identity Discovery  
It is unclear whether an RNN is still being used for classification in this section, as the focus seems to shift toward evaluating different search strategies. The explanation of how proposals are generated during the search process is somewhat unclear and could benefit from further elaboration.
Typos:  
- "has contains a single matrix"  
- "listed in table Table 1."  
- "vector is the presented to the next operation"  
- "The final vector is pass to a softmax classifier"  
- "as to how explore space of possible"  
- "The scheduler is is fixed"  
- "The difficulty of the task by be appreciated by looking"  
- "which can easily captured with"  
- Figure 3 should reference an RNN, not a TNN.
