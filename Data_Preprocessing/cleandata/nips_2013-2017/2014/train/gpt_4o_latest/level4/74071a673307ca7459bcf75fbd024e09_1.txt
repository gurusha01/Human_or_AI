Paraphrased Review
Overview  
This paper introduces a framework for incorporating structure into Bayesian models by selecting structured priors guided by the maximum entropy principle. While deriving the optimal prior may not always be computationally feasible, the authors propose an approximation technique leveraging submodule optimization. The construction of priors with structured variables is a significant area of research, and this approach has the potential to make a meaningful contribution.
Quality  
The paper is technically robust. The authors validate their methodology using both simulated datasets and functional MRI data, demonstrating its effectiveness. Additionally, they provide a discussion of the strengths and limitations of their approach.
Clarity  
The paper is well-written and logically structured.  
Minor issues: On Page 4, lines 210 and 211, "Corollary 10" appears to be a typo and should likely read "Corollary 6." Also, please ensure that the references are formatted consistently.
Originality  
The work appears sufficiently novel, assuming all the provided proofs are correct.
Significance  
The paper addresses an important topic and proposes a method that is both computationally practical and conceptually clear.
Recommendation  
This is a solid piece of work. I recommend accepting this paper.
