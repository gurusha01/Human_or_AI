The paper introduces an extension to the additive factorial HMM model by incorporating additional constraints that enforce the sum of individual chain outputs to align closely with a known aggregate value. To address this, the authors propose a convex relaxation for MAP inference and evaluate their algorithm on real-world datasets related to energy disaggregation. These datasets include low-frequency readings from 100 UK homes and higher-frequency readings from 10 homes, though without appliance-level monitoring.
The concepts presented are relatively straightforward, and the authors employ a simple optimization framework to tackle the problem. However, the work remains compelling due to its application to large-scale, real-world datasets. As a combination of applied and algorithmic contributions, the paper is successful overall. Below are some comments that could help improve the manuscript:
A key motivation for AFAMAP is that enforcing the constraint of one chain being active at a time can improve the relaxation, leading to more frequent integer solutions. Does the SACAFHMM optimization framework achieve a similar effect, or do its solutions exhibit lower error despite being non-integral? A discussion on this point would be valuable and could further clarify the distinctions between the approaches.
It appears that the AFAMAP and SACAFHMM ideas are fundamentally orthogonal. In principle, the SACAFHMM constraints could be incorporated into the AFAMAP optimization framework. While I do not expect the authors to address this during the response phase, I strongly encourage them to explore this integration for the final version of the paper.
The paper occasionally conflates models and optimization methods. For example, comparing the results of "AFHMM" and "AFAMAP" is imprecise, as AFAMAP is an algorithm for approximately solving the MAP problem for the AFHMM. I suspect that what the authors refer to as "AFHMM" here actually corresponds to alternating Viterbi optimization. Is this correct? This ties into the earlier point about combining strategies from different algorithms, which could potentially outperform the current approaches. While the paper proposes a straightforward extension and optimization for a variant of the AFHMM, the results on real-world datasets are compelling, and the overall contribution is solid.
