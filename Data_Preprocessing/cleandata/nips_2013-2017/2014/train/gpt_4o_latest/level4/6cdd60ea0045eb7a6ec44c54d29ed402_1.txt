The authors address the problem of logistic regression in the presence of outliers. Notably, no assumptions are imposed on the nature of the outliers; they are not required to follow any specific distribution, which is relevant in scenarios such as video data corrupted by sensor errors.
The paper introduces a novel algorithm, RoLR, accompanied by rigorous performance guarantees. While the algorithm itself is straightforward to describe, it leverages advanced concepts, and the mathematical framework supporting the performance guarantees is highly commendable. The simulation results are encouraging.  
 
Specific comments:  
L135: Could you clarify why $\beta^*$ is assumed to have unit length?  
Line 157: Since $X_i$ is p-dimensional, how are the square and absolute value operations defined in this context?  
Overall, the paper is well-written and of high quality. Although the practical performance of the method on real-world data remains to be explored, the theoretical contributions are significant.  
This work is both innovative and demonstrates a high level of mathematical rigor.
