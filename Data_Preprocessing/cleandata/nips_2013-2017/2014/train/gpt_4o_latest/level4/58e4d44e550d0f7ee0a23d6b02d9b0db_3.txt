The primary focus of the paper is on computing a k-rank approximation of an $n \times d$ matrix $A$ when its rows are provided sequentially in a streaming manner, one at a time.
In particular, the algorithm proposed by Ghashami and Phillips (SODA, 2014) is demonstrated to be optimal (up to word size), with a space lower bound of $\Omega(dk/\epsilon)$.
Theoretical contributions are established through a reduction to the well-known Index problem in communication complexity. The subsequent exposition is clear, well-structured, and technically robust. Once the problem is framed within the authors' framework, the mathematical tools used to prove the claims are fairly standard.
My primary concern with the paper lies in the significance of the presented results, especially when compared to the findings already available in the aforementioned SODA paper. In this work, the $O(dk/\epsilon)$ space requirement for the streaming low-rank matrix approximation algorithm of Ghashami and Phillips is shown to be tight. Overall, the paper is well-written and appears to be technically sound.
