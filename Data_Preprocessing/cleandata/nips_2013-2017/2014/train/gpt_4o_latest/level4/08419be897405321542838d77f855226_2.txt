This paper presents two approaches for searching simpler symbolic expression trees. The first approach leverages ngrams computed over sequences of sub-expressions, while the second employs a recursive neural network to generate continuous space representations of symbolic expression trees. These representations are subsequently used to predict the likely rule for combining subtrees. Based on Figure 3, the ngram-based method outperforms the RNN on two out of the three tasks.
Comments with respect to specific review criteria:  
Quality - High.  
Clarity - The paper is somewhat difficult to follow, particularly in Section 7.2.  
Originality - High.  
Significance - Low. The practical utility of these methods is questionable, as it is unlikely that anyone aiming for efficient computations would adopt this approach. The problem itself feels somewhat artificial. While the paper explores techniques for identifying more computationally efficient symbolic expression trees, the broader significance of these methods remains unclear.
