This paper presents a framework that is particularly beneficial for semi-supervised learning, leveraging Fredholm kernels. The standard supervised learning optimization problem, typically addressed in kernel-based methods, is extended here to incorporate unlabeled data, resulting in a discretized form of the Fredholm integral equation.
Quality
The technical quality of the paper is high, with its claims well-supported by rigorous theoretical analysis and compelling experimental results. The proposed approach introduces a novel data-dependent kernel that effectively integrates unlabeled information. While the resulting classifying function deviates from the classical representer theorem solution, it remains elegant and computationally efficient.
I have a few comments: First, regarding Equation 3, which describes the solution to the proposed optimization problem. Since the authors note that the associated kernel is not necessarily positive semi-definite (PSD), does Equation 3 still hold in such cases? Including a proof of how Equation 3 was derived would have been helpful. Second, in the experimental section, the authors mention selecting an "optimal" parameter for all methods in the benchmark. How were these parameters determined, and what exactly is meant by "optimal"?
Clarity
The paper is generally well-written and well-structured, making it easy to follow. The main ideas are clearly explained. However, there are a few typographical errors that should be addressed:
- Line 82: "... will a Euclidean ..." → "... will be a Euclidean ..."
- Line 83: Missing "or."
- Section 4 title: "Fredhom" → "Fredholm"
- Line 247: "porportional" → "proportional"
- Line 283: "That is, or..." → "That is, for..."
- Line 352: The sentence requires rewriting for clarity.
Originality
The proposed method is related to a recent NIPS publication ([9]), but it is fundamentally novel. The distinctions between this work and prior publications are clearly articulated.
Significance
The results presented are both meaningful and impactful. The authors have made a commendable effort to evaluate their method across multiple datasets spanning various application domains. This is a well-written paper with a solid theoretical foundation and a convincing experimental evaluation.
