This paper introduces a fully collapsed Gibbs (CG) sampler for the BNBP.  
Lemma 1 and the proposed sampler are both novel and compelling.  
Nevertheless, I have concerns regarding the experimental evaluation.  
The primary motivation of this work is to develop the CG sampler for the BNBP due to its simplicity in implementation, rapid convergence, effective mixing, and state-of-the-art predictive performance.  
In other words, the focus of this study is on the sampling algorithm rather than statistical modeling.  
As such, it is essential to compare the proposed algorithm with other sampling algorithms designed for the BNBP, rather than with HDP-LDA.  
While a fully collapsed Gibbs sampler for the BNBP has been presented, experimental results comparing the proposed method with other sampling algorithms for the BNBP are necessary.
