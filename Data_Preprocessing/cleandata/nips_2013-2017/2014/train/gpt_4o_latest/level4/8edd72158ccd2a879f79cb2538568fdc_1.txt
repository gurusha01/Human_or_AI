The paper examines multi-agent systems where a voting rule is employed to aggregate the decisions of individual agents to address a given problem. The agents can be viewed as sampling from a noisy distribution centered around the true ranking of alternatives at each state. The authors demonstrate that when the agents are identical—meaning they generate samples (preferences for alternatives) from the same distribution—the system is prone to selecting a sub-optimal alternative. Conversely, when the system comprises a diverse set of agents, it is highly likely to vote for the optimal alternatives across nearly all states. The paper concludes with an experimental evaluation involving agents playing Go games.
The paper is clearly written and easy to follow. However, the reviewer found it unclear what the novel contributions of this work are compared to existing results, which appear qualitatively similar to the findings presented here (e.g., Marcolino's work cited in the paper). The primary distinction in the setting seems to be that agents provide a preference ordering over alternatives at each stage, as opposed to voting for a single alternative.
Minor: In the experimental section, diverse agents are created by varying parameters within an existing Go-playing agent. For readers unfamiliar with the specifics of the system, it is not immediately evident that such parameter variations would indeed yield a diverse set of agents. While the paper addresses this concern in Appendix H and towards the end of Section 4, it would improve clarity if this justification (or a reference to Appendix H) were provided earlier when the agents are first introduced. The results are compelling, but a more thorough comparison to related work is necessary. [Revised, following author feedback].
