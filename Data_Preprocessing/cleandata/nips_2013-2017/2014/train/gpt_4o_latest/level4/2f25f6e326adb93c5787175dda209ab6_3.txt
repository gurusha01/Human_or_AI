This paper offers an insightful interpretation of time/frequency factorizations. Rather than relying on existing formulations based on the analysis coefficients of STFT transforms, it introduces a more adaptable framework that can be applied to any arbitrary transform and maintains a direct connection to the time-domain signal.
The paper is well-written, accessible to experts in the field, and of high quality. Its originality is above average, though the significance of the work is not fully conveyed within the paper. The most underwhelming aspect lies in the results and evaluation. The supplemental material is not particularly compelling, and the paper does not compare its approach to the methods it builds upon. While this is not a major weakness (as the theoretical development alone makes the paper intriguing), it would have significantly enhanced the work. Overall, this is a strong paper with solid theory and clear writing. Although more results and comparisons would have been desirable, this omission does not critically undermine the paper, given the value of its theoretical contribution.
