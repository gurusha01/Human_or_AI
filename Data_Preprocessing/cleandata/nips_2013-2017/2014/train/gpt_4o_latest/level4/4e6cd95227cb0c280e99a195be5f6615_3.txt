This paper presents a novel sampling algorithm tailored for Factorial Hidden Markov Models (FHMMs). The conventional approach for sampling hidden chains in any HMM-type model is the forward filtering backward sampling (FFBS) algorithm. While this method performs effectively for many HMM-like models, it becomes computationally prohibitive for FHMMs, as exact sampling from the joint distribution of all hidden chain variables requires exponential time. A potential workaround involves sampling one or a few chains at a time while keeping the others fixed. However, this approach has a significant limitation: it does not facilitate simultaneous updates to multiple chains in a single sampling pass.
The authors propose a new method called Hamming Ball Auxiliary Sampling. The core idea of this algorithm is to begin with the current sample \( X \) of all hidden chain variables and introduce an auxiliary variable \( U \), which is sampled from the Hamming ball of a specified radius around \( X \). The Hamming ball is defined such that, at any time step, all joint chain variables are within a Hamming distance \( m \) from the current sample. Subsequently, \( X \) is resampled conditional on \( U \), ensuring that the new sample remains within a Hamming distance \( m \) of \( U \). This mechanism guarantees that between two successive samples of \( X \), at least \( 2m \) bits can be flipped.
The paper is well-written and provides a clear explanation of the proposed algorithm. Additionally, the empirical evaluation is thorough and convincing.
From prior experience, a common challenge in sampling from FHMMs arises when two parallel chains exhibit highly similar states, leading to their parameters converging to nearly identical values. This phenomenon often results in the duplication of what should ideally be a single feature. Unfortunately, the proposed sampling algorithm does not inherently increase the likelihood of escaping such local maxima. It would be valuable to explicitly acknowledge this limitation in the paper (e.g., around line 126).
Line 197: My primary critique of the paper is the lack of algorithmic details regarding the efficient implementation of the proposed sampler. Specifically, I am curious whether the authors employ an optimized approach to sample from the Hamming ball. Including a dedicated section on implementation details would enhance the paper significantly. Moreover, publishing the code would be a welcome addition.
Lines 215â€“230: This section feels somewhat trivial and does not substantially enhance the paper's impact. It could be moved to an appendix or treated as an extension.
Section 4.1: As noted, the different algorithms exhibit varying time complexities. I recommend scaling Figure 3 with respect to actual computational complexity rather than iterations, as the current presentation unfairly advantages the HB algorithms.
Overall, this is an excellent piece of work. It represents a meaningful advancement in efficiently sampling from FHMMs and addresses a challenging problem in the field.
