The manuscript introduces a random feature-based approximation algorithm aimed at solving the l1-regularized problem within a (potentially infinite-dimensional) Hilbert space.
The paper is well-structured and clearly written, making it accessible to readers. Theorem 2, along with its corollaries, represents a significant and intriguing technical contribution.
While the l1-regularized problem in Hilbert spaces has been previously studied (e.g., [1*], which should likely be cited), the proposed random feature algorithm, along with its rigorous theoretical analysis, is novel and non-trivial.
Comments:
1. A summary and citation of prior work on solving the l1-regularized problem in Hilbert spaces would be beneficial. For instance, [1] could be cited, and alternative approaches such as [2] could be discussed where relevant.
2. The empirical evaluation could be enhanced by including comparisons with [1*].
3. The current selection of \(\lambda\) appears arbitrary. Why not perform cross-validation to optimize accuracy across all algorithms and report metrics such as support vectors or sparsity? The current choice makes the plots difficult to compare. Alternatively, consider providing plots that illustrate the impact of varying \(\lambda\).
4. Additional discussion of the results is warranted. For example, why does the algorithm perform better in regression tasks compared to classification? Insights into such observations would strengthen the paper.

In conclusion, the paper presents compelling theoretical results that establish the efficacy of a randomized feature-based approximation algorithm for solving the l1-regularized problem in a Hilbert space. However, the empirical section requires substantial improvement.
