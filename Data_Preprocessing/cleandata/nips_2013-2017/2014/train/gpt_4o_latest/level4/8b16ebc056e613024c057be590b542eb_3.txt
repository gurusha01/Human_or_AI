This paper explores the reconstruction of network topology from calcium imaging data using inverse covariance matrix estimation. The authors demonstrate empirically that a simple convolution filter, which is learned once and applied to calcium traces, significantly enhances reconstruction performance and reduces the time required to infer connectivity on new datasets.

QUALITY
The work presented appears robust overall, though there are a few points that require clarification.
First, the authors limit the convolution filter's length to 10 time steps. The learned filter peaks at time step 8, raising the question of whether this length provides sufficient room for the filter to "converge" in terms of time lag. For instance, if the filter length had been restricted to 5 time steps, the authors might have missed this critical peak. Was this limitation due to computational constraints? Alternatively, is there a biophysical or empirical justification for assuming that correlations decay beyond 10 time steps? The authors should address this.
Second, while the study focuses on improving the inverse covariance method, a deeper discussion of its inherent limitations would be valuable. For example, the method's inability to recover directed graphs is a significant constraint, particularly in the context of neural circuits.
Third, the importance of accurately setting the value of $\chi$ in Eq. 7 is unclear. Specifically, how does the reconstruction generalize to datasets with sparsity levels that differ substantially from those used during training?

CLARITY
The paper is well-written and well-organized.
It would be helpful to briefly describe the Kaggle dataset (e.g., the availability of ground truth connectivity) early in the methods section in one or two sentences.
Additionally, the authors should clarify the timescales for non-expert readers. For instance, what does "one time step" in the convolution filter correspond to? In the x-axis labels, does "time (20 ms)" indicate a total of 20 ms or 20 seconds (1000 Ã— 20 ms)? Providing this context would help readers better understand the complexity of the task.
Finally, the term "AUC" is not defined in the manuscript. It should be explicitly stated (e.g., Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve).

ORIGINALITY
Although I am not deeply familiar with the calcium imaging literature, it is surprising that convolution filters (even heuristic ones) have not been applied to calcium traces prior to covariance estimation. Regardless, the work presented here is original and clearly improves upon the current leaderboard for the Kaggle dataset.

SIGNIFICANCE
Reconstructing network topology is a critical problem in neuroscience, especially with the emergence of whole-network imaging techniques. There is a clear need for statistical methods in this domain. While this study achieves state-of-the-art performance and speed, it represents a relatively straightforward enhancement to an existing algorithm (L2-regularized inverse covariance estimation) and does not address some of the method's fundamental limitations (e.g., the implicit Gaussian assumption and the restriction to undirected graphs).
This paper is technically sound, well-written, and achieves state-of-the-art performance in a specific case of topology extraction from calcium imaging data, an important problem in neuroscience. However, my primary concern lies in the lack of a deeper understanding of why the learned convolution filter improves performance and why it generalizes well to other datasets. Additionally, the contribution feels somewhat incremental relative to the existing algorithm.
