Review - Summary:  
This paper introduces a model designed to address discriminative tasks using video inputs. The model is composed of two convolutional networks. One network processes an appearance frame as its input, while the other network takes a stack of densely computed optical flow features. Each network is trained independently to classify its respective input. The final prediction for a video is obtained by computing a (weighted) average of the predictions from both networks.
The model is evaluated on two datasets, yielding impressive results that either match or closely approach the performance of state-of-the-art methods relying on extensively hand-crafted features.
Strengths:  
- The model is a straightforward application of convolutional networks that achieves strong performance.  
- Unlike prior deep learning approaches, which typically avoid using optical flow or other hand-crafted features in favor of learning features directly from pixels, this paper demonstrates that optical flow fields can serve as a valuable input representationâ€”at least for action recognition. This is a noteworthy contribution.  
Weaknesses:  
- The model does not account for the overall sequence of actions across the entire video, as it only processes fixed-length (L=10) adjacent frames.  
Quality:  
The experiments are well-executed. However, the paper would benefit from additional analysis of the error modes. For instance, are there specific classes or groups of classes that the model struggles to classify accurately? Can the authors characterize the types of videos where the model performs poorly?  
Clarity:  
The paper is clearly written, and the model is described in a comprehensible manner.  
Originality:  
The use of convolutional networks to process optical flow features is an innovative contribution.  
Significance:  
This approach has the potential to significantly influence research on leveraging videos and motion for various vision tasks. The model represents a simple yet effective application of convolutional networks to video data, achieving highly promising results. The incorporation of optical flow features as inputs to a convolutional network is a novel and impactful idea.
