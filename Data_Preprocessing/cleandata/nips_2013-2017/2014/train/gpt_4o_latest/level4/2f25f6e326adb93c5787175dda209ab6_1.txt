This paper introduces an extension to the family of low-rank spectrogram-factorization models for sound decomposition, which generalizes the latent factors to operate over an arbitrary (and potentially overcomplete) set of bases. This enables decomposition on "multiresolution" bases, such as those combining tonal and transient components, which is argued to improve tasks like source separation and denoising. The work builds on the Gaussian Composite Model (GCM) of Fevotte et al., which models the variance of each spectrogram cell using low-rank matrix factorization. The authors extend this by incorporating implicit convolution with multiple Gabor impulse responses corresponding to each spectrogram row, ultimately providing a purely time-domain formulation. This formulation can be adapted to accommodate different sets of impulse responses, including nonorthogonal ones. An EM-based procedure for local optimization is also presented.
Quality: The paper provides an intriguing insight, though the broader implications are not immediately clear. At first glance, it appears to offer an alternative perspective on Fevotte's GCM, but the inclusion of overcomplete dictionaries is a notable addition. However, this approach seems like it could introduce complications, and it is not entirely clear why these do not pose significant challenges. While I assume the estimation procedure is sound (and I appreciate the depth of the analysis), I was unable to follow all the details.
Clarity: The paper is well-written and provides clear motivation for the work. However, the evaluation is quite limited. The authors present one illustrative example and a single SNR improvement measurement, which are insufficient to draw meaningful conclusions. While the inclusion of sound examples is appreciated, they were not particularly convincing. For instance, the OMLSA-enhanced example appears to be much longer (7 seconds compared to 2 seconds) than the new result, raising concerns about the fairness of the comparison. Additionally, while the OMLSA example retains more background noise (partly due to its longer duration), the speech quality is noticeably higher. In the music example, the denoising introduces significant artifacts, and I suspect that conventional methods like wavelet shrinkage or Wiener filtering might achieve better perceived quality in this case.
Originality: The work heavily builds on the foundation laid by Fevotte et al., but the time-domain interpretation offers a fresh perspective and prompted me to think about the problem in a new way.
Significance: The ability to apply matrix-factorization techniques to overcomplete bases has the potential for significant impact. However, the limited and superficial evaluation presented in this paper does not convincingly demonstrate this potential. As it stands, the significance of the work remains speculative. Reformulating probabilistic matrix-factorization sound analysis in terms of time-domain kernels enables an EM-based analysis for multiresolution (overcomplete) bases. However, the thin evaluation and the presence of significant artifacts in the provided examples fail to substantiate the importance of the approach in its current form.
