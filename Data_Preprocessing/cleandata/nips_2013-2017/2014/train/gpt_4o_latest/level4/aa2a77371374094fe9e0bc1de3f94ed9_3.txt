Review:  
The authors propose a unified low-rank tensor learning framework aimed at addressing two key tasks in multivariate spatio-temporal analysis: cokriging and forecasting. They introduce an efficient greedy algorithm applicable to both tasks.
Strengths:  
* The paper is well-written and provides a solid mathematical foundation for the proposed approach to solving the stated tasks.  
* The authors demonstrate positive results on both synthetic and real-world datasets, showing improvements compared to existing algorithms in the literature.  
Areas for Improvement:  
* The methodology for selecting tuning parameters across different algorithms and datasets is not clearly explained.  
* It is unclear whether the proposed approach generalizes effectively to data with more than three dimensions.  
* Tables 1 and 2 present multiple-fold cross-validation results, but confidence intervals are not provided.  
* Can the forecasting method be extended to classify anomalies in climate data, such as hurricanes, droughts, etc.?  
* Table 2 indicates that the Tucker algorithm outperforms the Ortho algorithm on the USHCN dataset. Why is this the case? Are the results statistically significant? A discussion on the implications of these findings would be beneficial.

The paper presents a strong mathematical foundation for learning low-rank tensors from spatio-temporal data. However, it would have been helpful to include a discussion on the importance of cokriging and forecasting, particularly in the context of the datasets analyzed in the study.
