The authors extend a recent Bayesian SVM by "kernelizing" it through the use of Gaussian Processes. For the resulting hierarchical GP model, they propose two forms of approximate inference: an MCMC sampler and an EM algorithm. Additionally, a sparse (FITC) approximation is introduced to further improve computational efficiency. Another notable contribution is the development of a GPLVM model tailored for the Bayesian kernel SVM.
The paper is generally well-written and clear in most sections.
From a conceptual standpoint, many of the proposed extensions to the Bayesian SVM are relatively standard. However, when combined, they form an intriguing set of contributions. Given the breadth of contributions and extensions, the experimental evaluation for each aspect feels somewhat limited. While prediction performance is evaluated across various datasets, additional empirical analysis beyond basic prediction errors and runtime comparisons would be valuable to better understand the model's properties in terms of both modeling and inference. The topic and the proposed Bayesian kernel SVM are both interesting and fairly relevant. That said, the paper would benefit from providing stronger intuition and more comprehensive empirical validation to highlight the model's properties and its distinctions from related approaches.
