The authors tackle the challenge of inferring a causal relationship \( R \) in a target domain, termed mz-transportability, by leveraging causal knowledge derived from multiple source domains with limited experimental data. In the target domain, only passive observations (or limited causal knowledge) are available, which alone are insufficient for inferring \( R \).
The paper makes the following contributions:
1. A necessary and sufficient condition for determining when causal effects in the target domain can be estimated from the given information.
2. A proof establishing the completeness of a previously proposed algorithm (TR\(^\text{mz}\)) for computing the transport formula.
3. A proof demonstrating that the do-calculus is complete for verifying mz-transportability of causal effects.
Quality & Clarity:  
This is primarily a theoretical paper, and the authors provide strong support for their claims. The paper is well-structured and presented. However, as acknowledged by the authors, the claims and proofs are often intricate. I found certain sections, such as page 6, challenging to follow and fully comprehend. That said, this difficulty likely stems more from the advanced theoretical nature of the work than from any shortcomings in the paper's presentation.
Suggestions for Improvement:  
- Provide a definition of "a maximal root set" in Definition 4, as done in [21].  
- In Definition 5, revise "(called an hedge)" to "(called an hedge for \( P_x(y) \))".  
- The explanation of an "hedge" following Definition 4 is unclear. Consider including a more rigorous definition there instead of embedding it within Definition 5.  
- Clarify what is meant by "separable."  
- Simplify certain sections, where feasible, to enhance readability for the audience.
Originality & Significance:  
The paper builds on the NIPS 2013 work "[1] Transportability from Multiple Environments with Limited Experiments," which is appropriately cited. While [1] provided necessary or sufficient conditions for transportability and demonstrated only the soundness of TR\(^\text{mz}\), the current paper advances the field by offering a complete characterization of transportability, proving the completeness of TR\(^\text{mz}\), and establishing the completeness of the do-calculus for mz-transportability. These contributions are significant.  
For clarity, consider explicitly stating at the beginning of Section 3 that the first part of this section (page 4) revisits material from [1] or other prior publications, rather than only referencing them on page 4. Additionally, for Equation (2), include a reference to [1], where the derivation of this equation is explained.
Additional Comments:  
- Abstract, line 3: "limited experimental data" seems to refer only to the target domain and not the sources. Consider revising for clarity.  
- Motivation, line 1: Consider adding "that" after "experiments" for improved readability.  
- Page 2, paragraph 4: Revise "the goal of...conditions the causal effect" to "...conditions causal effects in the target domain."  
- First bullet before Section 2: Replace "in the domains" with "in the source domains."  
- Section 2, line 2: The node \( S \) in Fig. 1(a) is referenced but missing. Add the label \( S \) to the square node in the figure.  
- Footnote 1: Replace "..exclusively, on.." with "..exclusively, of..".  
- Footnote 1: Alongside references [13,14], consider citing the following works:  
  - Ben-David et al., Analysis of representations for domain adaptation  
  - Mansour et al., Domain adaptation: learning bounds and algorithms  
  - Mansour et al., Domain adaptation with multiple sources  
  - Ben-David et al., A theory of learning from different domains  
- Page 3, last line of the first paragraph: Add a period before "our goal is."  
- Define \( V \), \( U \), etc., in \( M_x \).  
- Clarify what "IS" refers to after Definition 2.  
- After Theorem 1: Add a reference to [1] for "It is not difficult to see..."  
- Middle of page 5: Add a period before "the result follows."  
- First line after Definition 4: Remove "and" before "rooted."  
- Page 7, middle: Add a period before "refer to Appendix 2..."  
- Theorem 4, last line: Revise "contain" to "contains," "spans" to "span," and "a" to "an." Clarify what "sC-forests" are.  
- Proof of Theorem 4: Should "c-forest" use a capital \( C \)? Revise "shows" to "showed."  
- After Theorem 4: Indicate that the proof is provided in the supplementary material.  
- Consider using \( \pic \) instead of \( \pia \) for the source in Fig. 1(c).  
Supplementary Material:  
- Proof of Theorem 5: Remove one "the" in the first line and one full stop in the last line.  
- Proof of Corollary 1: Replace "...from the previous Corollary" with "...from the previous Theorem," if applicable.  
In conclusion, despite the complexity of the definitions, theorems, and proofs, this paper makes a significant contribution to the field and is a strong candidate for NIPS.
