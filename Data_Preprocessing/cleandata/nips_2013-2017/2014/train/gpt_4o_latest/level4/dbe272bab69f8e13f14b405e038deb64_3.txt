The authors have enhanced a state-space approach for inferring synaptic conductance. This method was initially introduced as a GLM relying on a linear assumption in reference [8]. The key advancement in this work is the integration of nonlinear stimulus-induced variations in synaptic conductance into a dynamic model of the neuronal membrane potential. The proposed approach provides an interpretation of the GLM within the framework of a conductance-based model, enabling the inference of synaptic conductance and the reconstruction of input time series. The methodology appears robust, and I believe this paper merits publication, contingent upon the authors addressing the following concerns in their revised manuscript.
Major Comment  
The temporal filters used in the simulations exhibit time scales of 30â€“50 ms, which seem considerably longer than the commonly observed time scales of biological conductance. The authors are requested to justify this choice or to repeat the analysis using shorter time scales.

- p7: "this this" should be revised.  
In summary, this work represents an improvement to a state-space method for inferring synaptic conductance, offering a valuable interpretation of the GLM within a conductance-based framework. It has the potential to make a significant contribution, provided the issue of time scales is adequately addressed.
