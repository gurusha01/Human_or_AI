This paper tackles the challenge of robustly estimating the low-dimensional subspace from contaminated observations, particularly when the observations exhibit inherent coherence. A standard theoretical limitation of prior RPCA methods is their degraded performance as data coherence increases. However, this paper overcomes this issue in an innovative way. Given that such cluster structures are quite common in real-world data, addressing this problem is undoubtedly highly significant. The proposed approach is both theoretically well-founded and empirically demonstrated to perform effectively.
I do have a curious question regarding the submission:
Could the proposed method also be applicable to the subspace clustering/segmentation problem? It would be helpful if the authors could provide some insights on this aspect.
This paper addresses an important challenge in robust PCA research. The overall quality of the work is excellent, and I recommend it for acceptance.
