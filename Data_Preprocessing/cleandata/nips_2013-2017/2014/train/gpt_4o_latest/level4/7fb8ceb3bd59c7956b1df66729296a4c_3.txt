The authors present a novel approach to modeling the selection of an appropriate algorithm for a task as a metacognitive process, achieved by maximizing the value of computation. This value is defined as the difference between the expected utility of acting after performing a computation and the expected utility of acting without performing the computation. To approximate this value, the authors propose learning to predict both the score and runtime of an algorithm based on features selected through Bayesian feature selection. When applied to the problem of selecting an algorithm to minimize the duration of sorting lists, the proposed method outperforms two prior approaches: one based on decision trees and another utilizing recursive algorithm selection via dynamic programming.
The paper further includes a set of behavioral experiments where human participants were instructed to sort lists using either cocktail sort or merge sort. By estimating the time required for individual sorting actions for each algorithm based on behavioral data, the authors extended their model to predict human algorithm selection for sorting new sequences. Remarkably, the metacognitive strategy provided a better fit to human behavior compared to previous models of algorithm selection in humans.
This is one of the most impressive papers I have reviewed for NIPS in the past three years. My only suggestions for improvement are as follows:
- Include more details on feature selection via Bayesian model choice.
- Elaborate on how Bayes factors are efficiently computed.
- Provide additional context on Lagoudakis et al.'s method.
- Offer an explanation for the significantly poorer performance of Lagoudakis et al.'s method.
Minor correction on page 6:  
"to an descending list" should be revised.  
Overall, this is an excellent manuscript that formalizes the process of selecting an algorithm for sorting, with applications to both machine sorting and human performance.
