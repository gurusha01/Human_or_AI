The paper proposes an approach to identify and filter out adversarial voters in crowdsourcing systems to enhance the quality of aggregated voting outcomes. Two distinct algorithms, soft penalty assignment and hard penalty assignment, are introduced for this purpose. Theoretical analysis supports the validity of the proposed algorithms, and the experimental results appear promising.
The problem addressed is intriguing, and it would be beneficial to include more details about the practical applications of this work.
A brief explanation of the optimal semi-matching algorithm, which serves as a key component in the hard penalty assignment algorithm, would be helpful for better understanding.
It is unclear why the hard penalty assignment consistently outperforms the soft penalty assignment on real datasets compared to synthetic datasets. This discrepancy warrants further clarification.
Overall, the problem is compelling, and the paper is well-written. However, a more detailed discussion on the potential applications of the proposed approach would be valuable.
