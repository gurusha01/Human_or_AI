The conventional NMF framework models the generative process of the TF analysis coefficients of a signal, whereas the proposed approach shifts the focus to modeling the time-domain signal directly by defining a generative model for the TF synthesis coefficients. This novel perspective enables the exploration of multi-resolution representations, which are unattainable within the constraints of the traditional NMF framework.
This paper presents an intriguing contribution. I am particularly impressed by the concept of extending the framework to support multi-resolution representations.
Although the authors provide some results on multi-resolution signal decompositions, I am curious about the performance of the proposed method in the single-resolution scenario when compared to IS-NMF. Does it produce comparable W and H matrices? Additionally, is the proposed algorithm as efficient and robust as the multiplicative update algorithm used in IS-NMF?
