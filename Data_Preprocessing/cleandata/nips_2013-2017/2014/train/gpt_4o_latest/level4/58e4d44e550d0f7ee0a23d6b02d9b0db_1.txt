The paper is well-written and presents a result that appears novel, though it may be less surprising to experts in streaming algorithms. The theoretical contributions, particularly Theorem 4, seem to be correct.  
Summary:  
This paper addresses the problem of low-rank "k" approximation of a matrix when its rows are provided in a streaming manner. In recent work (SODA 2014), an algorithm was introduced for this task that requires O(dk/epsilon) words of space. An open question remained as to whether this bound is tight. This paper establishes a \Omega(dk/epsilon) lower bound, demonstrating that the bound is indeed optimal and that the task requires \Theta(dk/epsilon) words of space.
