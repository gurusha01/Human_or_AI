The paper addresses the challenge of approximating kernel functions using random features.  
The primary contribution demonstrates that leveraging L1 regularization enables the use of only O(1/ε) random features to achieve an ε-accurate approximation of kernel functions.  
The authors propose the Sparse Random Features algorithm, which is conceptually similar to functional gradient descent in boosting.  
This algorithm requires O(1/ε) random features, representing a significant improvement over the current state-of-the-art methods, which necessitate O(1/ε²) features.  
The paper includes a rigorous convergence analysis presented through theorems, which appear to be correct upon review.  
The manuscript is well-written and clear.  
Overall, this is an elegant and impactful result with potential practical applications for addressing large-scale problems.  
The Sparse Random Features algorithm, grounded in the use of L1 norm regularization, offers a substantial advancement over prior work in the field.
