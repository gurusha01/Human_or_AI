This paper introduces an unsupervised approach for aligning manifold structures across different datasets and identifying correspondences between objects within these datasets. The proposed framework integrates three objective functions: (1) a geometry matching term, (2) a feature matching term, and (3) a geometry preserving term. During the learning process, the method alternates between matching objects and estimating projection matrices to maximize the overall objective function. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in comparison to existing unsupervised manifold alignment techniques.
The proposed approach combines elements from three related methodologies, as detailed below. Consequently, the novelty of the method is somewhat limited. However, the integration of these related frameworks to address the challenging problem of unsupervised manifold alignment is an interesting and valuable contribution. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method achieves strong performance.
The geometry preserving term in the objective function is identical to that used in existing unsupervised manifold alignment methods, as noted in the paper. The geometry matching term is closely related to unsupervised object matching techniques, such as kernelized sorting and least square object matching. Notably, Equation (3) is equivalent to that of convex kernelized sorting. A discussion of these unsupervised object matching methods should be included. The feature matching term, on the other hand, is connected to CCA (canonical correlation analysis)-based unsupervised matching methods, such as matching CCA and many-to-many matching latent variable models. These methods aim to learn linear projection matrices and establish object correspondences.

In the face pose experiments, it appears that the similarity between datasets can be computed. This raises the possibility of solving the task using (supervised) manifold alignment methods. Please clarify whether this task is specifically designed for unsupervised methods.  
While the proposed method is a combination of three related approaches, the integration of these frameworks to tackle the difficult problem of unsupervised manifold alignment is an intriguing and worthwhile effort.
