This paper presents an engaging exploration of an important problem: determining when a distribution can be recovered based on knowledge of the generating process and the mechanism responsible for missing data.
The authors extend the scope of prior work by Mohan et al. by considering a broader class of missingness processes. This generalization leads to the derivation of a novel identification formula.
Furthermore, the paper addresses the identification of causal queries, demonstrating that these queries can be identified even in scenarios where the (observational) joint distribution is not identifiable.
Overall, the paper is well-written, though there are some issues and areas for improvement that I outline below.

MAIN COMMENTS:
1. Knowledge of Censoring Process: The results rely on knowledge of the mechanism by which observations are censored. Is such knowledge typically available in machine learning applications? Additionally, it would be beneficial to include more detailed discussion of Figure 1 in the main text. This could be achieved by reducing the figure's size.
2. Assumptions in Section 2: It should be clarified that the missing data processes discussed in this paper assume the full population is known. For example, even if \( Vo = \emptyset \) and \( Rv = 1 \) for all \( V \in V_m \) (i.e., no variables are observed for a given individual), it is still assumed that the existence of the individual is known. This assumption excludes certain missing data problems, such as estimating the size of an animal population.
3. Ambiguity in the Use of "mgraph": The term "mgraph" appears to be used inconsistently. For instance, in some cases (e.g., Figure 1), the graphs include the \( V^ \) variables, while in others (e.g., Figure 2), they do not. If the \( V^ \) variables are intentionally omitted in certain graphs, this should be explicitly clarified.
4. Restriction on \( R \) Variables as Parents: The paper assumes that \( R \) variables cannot serve as parents of variables in \( V \) or \( U \). Since the authors treat \( R \) variables as real quantities rather than mere indicators, they should justify this restriction or clarify whether it is primarily for convenience.
5. Definition of "Neighbor": The term "neighbor," which is introduced at the bottom of page 4, is not formally defined. A precise definition would be helpful.
6. Positivity Assumption in Rectification: On page 8, the first paragraph mentions the "rectification" of observations by García. The authors' definition of recoverability assumes positivity. Do García et al. also assume positivity? If not, it would be worth discussing whether their approach requires a stronger condition.
7. Application of Maximum Likelihood: On page 8, the second paragraph states that the "Maximum Likelihood method is known to yield consistent estimates under the MAR assumption." This statement is too vague. Why couldn't maximum likelihood be applied to any of the missingness processes described in this paper?

MINOR COMMENTS:
- Page 1, Line 33: "can bias outcomes" – consider rephrasing for clarity.
- Page 2, Figure 1: Typo in "Qualifications."
- Page 2, Example 1 (Page 3, Line 158): The equation \( P(Y \mid X, Z, R_y) = P(X, Z) \) should have the RHS corrected to \( P(Y \mid X, Z) \).
- Page 3, Line 168: The independence statement \( Y \perp\!\!\!\perp R \mid X, Z \) should be corrected to \( Y \perp\!\!\!\perp R_y \mid X, Z \).
- Page 3, Line 214: Condition (ii) lists \( R^{\text{part}} = \{R^{(1)}, R^{(2)}, \ldots, R^N\} \). The last term should be \( R^{(N)} \).
- Page 3, Line 215: "R^j respectively" should be corrected to "R^{(j)} respectively."
- Page 4, Corollary 1: The statement "does not contain a partially observed variables" should be revised for grammatical accuracy.
- Page 6, Footnote 2: Please provide a reference for the variable-level definition.

In summary, this is a technically sound and interesting paper that builds on prior work. While the breadth of its applicability remains somewhat unclear, the contributions are novel and significant.
