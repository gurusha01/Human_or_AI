The paper addresses the issue of identifiability under various mechanisms of missing data generation, utilizing a framework proposed by Mohan et al. It extends some existing results and provides illustrative examples, such as demonstrating identifiability of causal distributions even when conditional distributions are unavailable.

Quality
The technical quality of the paper appears to be high. The results are intricate but seem to be correct. For instance, Theorem 3 is both clear and interpretable. However, some of the contributions represent incremental improvements on existing results and do not seem to significantly advance the broader understanding of the problem.
Section 3 appears somewhat disconnected from the rest of the paper, and its primary result (Theorem 1) is challenging to interpret. It seems to have a close connection to the Markov blanket results presented in Richardson (2009). The paper's quality improves in later sections, with Section 5 offering clear and concise answers, and Section 6 presenting intriguing findings related to causal queries.

Clarity
Clarity is the paper's main shortcoming. There is likely too much content for a conference paper, as evidenced by the dense writing and the inclusion of a 13-page technical appendix. The paper lacks a clear narrative flow, making it difficult to follow. It might be more suitable as an extended journal article with a more deliberate structure.
While finding suitable notation for the numerous quantities involved is undoubtedly challenging, the current notation could be significantly improved. The repeated use of the capital 'V' to represent different objects is confusing, and in some cases, the subscripts are difficult to read. For example, the distinction between \(Vi\) as a vertex and \(Vo\) as a set of vertices is particularly unclear. Corollary 1's set equation exemplifies the poor presentation most acutely.

Originality and Significance
Sections 5 and 6 are both well-written and potentially impactful. The paper tackles an important problem and presents results that are both interesting and practical.
However, it might be more effective to take a step back and aim to develop a comprehensive criterion for identifiability within this framework, similar to what has been achieved for causal effect identification without missing data. It is hard to envision a statistician sifting through multiple papers to locate the specific (non)-identifiability result they need, especially if the result is as complex as Theorem 1.
Theorem 2 and Corollary 1 seem to align with inverse probability weighting. The underlying reason these results hold likely relates to the conditioning sets functioning as Markov blankets for \(R(i)\) in the mixed graphs employed by the authors. Richardson (2003, 2009) may provide relevant context.

Other Comments
- p4, l214: \(R^{\text{part}}\) is a partition of \(R\), not "a set containing partitions." The condition on line 214 should specify that \(Rx\) and \(Ry\) "belong to distinct elements of the partition."
- The language is occasionally too informal, e.g., "oftentimes."
- p4, l213: Use \(\leftrightarrow\) instead of "<-->".
- Clarify whether Garcia (2013) is incorrect or simply employs a different framework.
- The notation for graphs with severed edges, introduced in Definition 4 and Theorem 4, is not explicitly defined.
- \(Vo\) and \(Vm\) are referenced before being defined, seemingly without necessity.

Summary
The paper addresses an important problem and employs a promising approach, but its impact is diminished by unclear presentation and suboptimal notation.
