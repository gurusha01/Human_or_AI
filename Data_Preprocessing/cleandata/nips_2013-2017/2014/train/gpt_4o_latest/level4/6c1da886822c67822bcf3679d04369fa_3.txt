This paper introduces an EM-like algorithm for matrix completion tailored for recommendation systems, where parameter estimation is constrained to ensure privacy guarantees. The authors adapt the standard matrix completion approach with trace-norm regularization to focus solely on estimating the item features.
Quality:  
The paper demonstrates a thoughtful application of privacy-aware learning in the context of recommendation systems. It highlights that a small subset of public users with extensive ratings can provide sufficient overlap with private data to achieve good accuracy. The method leverages private data to estimate covariances while preserving a specific marginal distribution that upholds privacy.
Clarity:  
The manuscript is well-written overall. However, a few aspects could be clarified:  
- The comparison with prior methods, such as [10], is not fully addressed, either in terms of experimental results or privacy guarantees.  
- Including summary statistics or visualizations of the marginal distributions would better illustrate the effects of the proposed technique.
Significance:  
This work contributes to an important class of algorithms that balance privacy and accuracy. Given the growing emphasis on data privacy in public discourse, this paper could serve as a valuable addition to the field.
Originality:  
To the best of this reviewer's knowledge, the proposed approach is novel, drawing on established techniques in privacy-aware learning. The paper provides a compelling application of these techniques to recommendation systems. Additional experiments would enhance the reader's understanding of the algorithm's performance, its ability to meet privacy objectives, and its comparative standing against prior methods.
