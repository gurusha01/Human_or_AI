The paper introduces an approach that leverages Low Rank Representation (LRR) with a learned dictionary \( A \) to enhance the performance of Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA). Specifically, the authors demonstrate that the incoherence parameter \( \mu \), traditionally considered a limiting factor in RPCA's recovery guarantees, can instead reflect an underlying clustering structure in the data. By imposing certain conditions on the dictionary \( A \), the authors show that this structure can be exploited through LRR, thereby reducing the dependence on \( \mu \) and achieving stronger theoretical guarantees for both exact low-rank and sparse decomposition as well as its noisy variant.
The proposed method is both novel and impactful for the field. It builds on the union-of-subspace framework commonly assumed in prior subspace clustering works such as "Wang and Xu: Noisy Sparse Subspace Clustering & Provable subspace clustering: When LRR meets SSC" and "Soltanolkotabi and Candes: A geometric analysis of subspace clustering with outliers" and "Soltanolkotabi et al: Robust subspace clustering." However, unlike these works, the current paper is less explicit about the clustering assumption, which is arguably more general and reasonable. The theoretical findings are supported by simulations and real-world experiments, and the proposed structure is likely applicable to other domains, such as text data, as noted in the paper.
In conclusion, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of compressed sensing and merits acceptance at NIPS. However, I have several suggestions and points for discussion, which are detailed below:
1. Lines 80-82: The description needs to be clarified. What is meant by "our data"? Additionally, even if the problem captures all the structures, there appears to be an additional condition required for "perfect recovery." Please elaborate.
2. Line 88: The phrase "is no longer a method of perfect (WHAT?)" is unclear. Please specify what is being referred to.
3. The paper would benefit from more careful proofreading to address issues like the ones mentioned above. The authors should strive for greater clarity and precision in their claims and references throughout the text.
4. Wang and Xu, in their paper "Noisy Sparse Subspace Clustering," discuss how a higher coherence parameter can be advantageous for subspace clustering (in contrast to RPCA and matrix completion). The key distinction here is that the data need not be globally low-rank; rather, each cluster must exhibit low-rank structure. The structure utilized in this paper can be interpreted as a combination of low-rank and union-of-subspace clustering structures.
5. It would be interesting to compare the proposed algorithm with an alternative approach that first performs noisy subspace clustering using an \( \ell_1 \)-penalty and then applies PCA to each subspace. However, it is worth noting that no provable guarantees currently exist for this alternative method.
6. Section 4.2 effectively introduces a novel method for addressing the subspace clustering problem with sparse corruptions in the data. This method achieves notable improvements over the standard RPCA+SSC approach on the Hopkins155 dataset. This contribution is somewhat understated in the paper, and the authors should highlight it more explicitly. 
In summary, this paper makes at least three key contributions to the field: (1) describing a clustering structure that leads to high coherence, (2) demonstrating how such structure can be implicitly exploited using a dictionary in LRR, and (3) partially addressing the problem of sparse corruptions in subspace clustering. For these reasons, I strongly recommend its acceptance.
