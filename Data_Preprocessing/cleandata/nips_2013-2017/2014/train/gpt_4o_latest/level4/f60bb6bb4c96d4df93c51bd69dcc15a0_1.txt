The paper introduces a novel algorithm for addressing the balanced k-cut problem. The k-cut criterion is defined using the Lovasz extension of a set function. A relaxation of the balanced k-cut functionals is formulated by leveraging Lovasz extensions of both cuts and normalizing constraints. A key strength of this relaxation lies in its ability to connect convex Lovasz extensions with submodular set functions. The authors develop an algorithm that minimizes a sum of auxiliary variables, each constrained to be lower-bounded by ratios. This minimization is further subject to simplex constraints and unique membership constraints.
Clarity: The manuscript is well-written and appropriately cites relevant prior work.
Originality: While there is substantial prior work in this area, the novel contribution lies in modifying the optimization strategy. The originality and novelty of the approach are somewhat limited, but the strong experimental results may justify the paper's acceptance at NIPS.
Significance: Despite its close resemblance to existing methods, the clear and significant performance improvements demonstrated by the proposed approach suggest that this work could have a notable impact in the future.
Minor comments:
- Figure 1 contains five subfigures, but the caption only explains four. Please clarify the purpose of the fifth subfigure.
- The paper introduces a novel continuous relaxation for balanced k-cuts alongside a descent algorithm, and the experimental results are highly promising.
