This paper introduces a novel method for spike-sorting, though the approach itself is general and applicable beyond spike-sorting, as it is presented in a generic framework.
The authors propose two key innovations. First, they utilize SVD to define basis functions and determine precise spike times through interpolation, which I find to be an elegant approach. While prior methods, such as Taylor or polar interpolators (Ekanadham et al., 2011), have been employed for this purpose, the authors argue that the SVD-based method is theoretically optimal in terms of minimizing mean squared error (MSE).
Second, they replace a convex optimization solver with a greedy algorithm. This approach is reminiscent of OMP, but the authors introduce an additional refinement for achieving more precise spike timing by leveraging the Fourier domain. Consequently, the computational efficiency is significantly enhanced (Figure 3c).
Overall, I believe this is an excellent paper.
Minor comments:
- There are a few grammatical errors or unclear sentences (e.g., line 51; possibly lines 195-196; line 429).
- What is the unit of noise in Figure 2(g) and (h)?
- A more comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method on spike-sorting tasks, using either simulated or real recording data, would strengthen the paper.
  
This paper presents a spike-sorting algorithm that achieves notable improvements in both performance and computational efficiency.
