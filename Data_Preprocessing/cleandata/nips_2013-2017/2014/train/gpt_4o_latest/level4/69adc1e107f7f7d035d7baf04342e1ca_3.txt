This paper addresses the necessary and sufficient condition for determining the feasibility of mz-transportability. Mz-transportability refers to a property of a causal effect where its relationship in a target domain can be uniquely derived from its relationships in other domains. This concept is considered foundational for enabling scientific discovery in unexplored domains based on knowledge from well-studied domains. The primary contribution of this paper is the demonstration of the completeness of the do-calculus, which establishes that there exists a set of control operations on variables capable of determining any mz-transportability. Furthermore, the authors show that an algorithm proposed in prior work for recognizing mz-transportability is complete.
Quality  
The theoretical analysis and conclusions presented in this paper appear to be valid. While this is a theoretical study, the proofs of many theorems are not included in the main body of the paper. However, this omission is acceptable, as the proofs are too lengthy to fit within the constraints of the paper. Aside from this, the theoretical contributions are clearly articulated.  
One limitation is that the feasibility and tractability of implementing the algorithm in practice remain unclear. Nevertheless, the result on the completeness of the do-calculus across multiple domains is a significant contribution and provides a strong foundation for future research in causal inference.
Clarity  
The paper is well-written, and the authors' main claims are clearly presented. As noted earlier, the theoretical contributions are well-articulated, and the provided theorems and corollaries are appropriate.  
However, the notations and explanations in the paper are highly specialized and may be difficult for readers unfamiliar with the field of causal inference to follow. In this regard, some descriptions could be further refined. For example:  
- In the 4th line of Section 3, the notation `Mx = (U, V, Fx, P(U))` is introduced without any prior explanation. While there is some clarification of `V` on page 5 ("Let V be the set of observable ..."), the entire formulation should be comprehensively described at the beginning of Section 3.  
- In Definition 1, the phrase "D contains an extra edge from Si to Vi" is used without explaining what `Si` represents. The term "S-variables" is unclear. Based on later explanations, it seems to refer to unobserved exogenous variables or noise, but this should be explicitly clarified near the definition.  
Originality  
The ideas in this paper build on recent work by J. Pearl et al., as presented at conferences such as AAAI, NeurIPS, and AISTATS. In this sense, the contribution is somewhat incremental. However, the completeness of the do-calculus in the context of mz-transportability across multiple domains provides a novel theoretical foundation for causal inference. The paper's original contribution lies in formally establishing this feature of the calculus. Additionally, the introduction of the mz*-shedge, which is central to deriving completeness and the associated algorithms, is an innovative aspect of the work.
Significance  
The concepts of mz*-shedge and the completeness of the do-calculus for mz-transportability have the potential to make a significant impact on future research in causal inference.  
While the paper's presentation is highly specialized and may be challenging for readers outside the field, the ideas proposed in this work are likely to serve as a fundamental basis for many future studies in causal inference.
