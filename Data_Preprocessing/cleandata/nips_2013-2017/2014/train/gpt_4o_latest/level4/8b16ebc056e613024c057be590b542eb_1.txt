The authors propose a method to learn a convolution filter for preprocessing calcium imaging signals, which achieves comparable effectiveness in predicting neural connectivity from calcium imaging data to the winning algorithm of a recent competition addressing this problem. While the winning algorithm employed a grid search approach for preprocessing, the method presented in this paper is likely to be more robust, making it particularly relevant to a subset of the NIPS community.
1) Please revise the visualization of f, n, and y in Figure 1c to make the relationships among these variables clearer, as this represents a key result of the paper. Currently, while f and y are plotted, they are difficult to discern due to the thick line-width and overlap.
Minor:
On page 6, there is a typo: "fluoresce" should be corrected to "fluorescence."  
This paper introduces a promising approach for preprocessing calcium imaging data through learning a convolution filter, which is likely to appeal to NIPS community members working with such data.
