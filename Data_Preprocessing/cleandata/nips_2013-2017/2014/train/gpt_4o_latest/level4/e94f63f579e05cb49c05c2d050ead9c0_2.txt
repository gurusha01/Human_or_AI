This paper investigates the use of Bayesian quadrature within the context of Bayesian inference, employing a doubly Bayesian framework originally introduced by Osborne et al. (NIPS 2012). Building on these foundational ideas, the authors propose additional innovations. The core methodology involves constructing a probabilistic model of the posterior surface for a given Bayesian inference problem, enabling "meta" inference over key quantities of interest, such as the partition function. The first notable contribution is the use of a squared Gaussian Process to model the likelihood, in contrast to the exponentiated Gaussian Process employed by Osborne et al. The second contribution is the strategy of evaluating the posterior at points of high uncertainty. As with prior work, certain approximations are necessary to ensure tractable inference.
These contributions are valid and are shown to be effective through the authors' experiments. However, given the clear and acknowledged precedent set by Osborne et al., it would have been valuable to see "WSABI" experimentally compared against an exponentiated Gaussian Process, rather than solely against the un-warped Bayesian Monte Carlo.
A minor but important point: the use of the term "95% confidence interval" to describe a region containing 95% of the posterior mass may cause confusion, as it can be mistaken for a frequentist confidence interval. Consider rephrasing to avoid potential misinterpretation. Additionally, the paper's title could be clearer and less ambiguous. The term "sampling" is used in a non-standard way relative to its typical meaning in Bayesian inference. A more explicit title, such as "Squared Gaussian Processes for Fast Bayesian Quadrature," might better convey the paper's focus.
Overall, this work presents meaningful innovations that advance recent developments in applying Bayesian quadrature to Bayesian inference.
