This paper addresses the problem of minimizing block-separable functions under linear constraints. The authors propose a variant of ADMM, referred to as PDMM, to handle the multiple-blocks case. In this method, K blocks of the primal variable are randomly selected for updates, while a backward step is employed to refine the dual variable. Additionally, the primal variable updates can be executed in parallel. The authors establish a sublinear convergence rate for the proposed method, which generalizes several existing ADMM variants.
The paper is well-written and easy to understand. I am inclined to recommend acceptance. My questions and comments are as follows:
1) The algorithm description in equations (5) and (6) lacks clarity. Are all coordinates of \( y^{t+1} \) and \( \hat{y}^{t+1} \) updated, or is only a single block "i" updated? My interpretation is that only one block of the dual variable "y" is updated, but the paper does not specify how "i" is selected. This should be clarified in the revised version.
2) In Theorem 2, I believe the term "\(\sum_{i=1}^I\)" is missing after the opening brace "{", based on your proof.
3) Additional discussion regarding Theorem 2 is warranted. Theorem 2, which is the main result of this paper, establishes the convergence rate of the proposed PDMM method. First, since PDMM generalizes several ADMM variants, it would be natural to ask whether Theorem 2 (with appropriate parameter choices for \( K \) and \( J \)) aligns with the convergence rates of these variants. Second, given that the transformation matrix \( A \) is split into multiple blocks, what does your theorem suggest about the optimal way to perform this splitting?
4) I am curious about a comparison with the tensor completion problem ("Tensor completion for estimating missing values in visual data, 2012"), which also involves a multiple-block structure. Do you have any insight into which ADMM variant would be optimal for such a problem?
Minor comments:
1) In equation (9), a space is missing after "min."
2) On line 217, remove the space before "Section."  
I am inclined to recommend acceptance of this paper, but I expect more discussion following Theorem 2 in the revised version.
