This paper presents a novel spike-and-slab sparse prior, where the sparse variables are permitted to exhibit correlations, and this dependency is captured using generic covariance functions. Consequently, the work introduces a new spike-and-slab prior tailored for modeling structured sparsity patterns. The authors also develop an inference algorithm for the spike-and-slab variables under the proposed prior, leveraging the expectation propagation framework. To address computational challenges, approximations to the inverse of the covariance matrix are introduced, significantly reducing the algorithm's complexity. Numerical experiments highlight that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches in sparse recovery tasks that involve structured sparsity.
This work represents an original contribution to the field of sparse recovery, addressing a critical challenge in inference for structured sparsity—a problem that has remained unresolved for many researchers over the past decade. While the paper does not provide a solution for arbitrary joint distributions of sparse variables, it offers a practical approach for a broad class of distributions. As such, I believe this paper will appeal to a wide audience and prove valuable to researchers working in this domain.
The manuscript is well-written overall, though there is room for improvement in the notation (see detailed suggestions below). Additionally, some acronyms, such as MMV, are not consistently defined.
One key improvement I would recommend for the revised version (in addition to the detailed comments below) is the inclusion of real-world data examples where the structure in the sparse variables aligns with the distributions considered in the paper. The current example, which uses an EEG measurement matrix, is unconvincing because the sparse variables are still sampled from a distribution defined by the authors. This does not constitute a true real-world example, as the only real data involved is the measurement matrix, which is not the primary focus of the paper. Incorporating such examples would significantly strengthen the paper and broaden the impact of the proposed method.
Another aspect that warrants further discussion in the paper is the attenuation of the correlation among sparse variables relative to the correlation of the parameters gamma (Fig. 1c). What factors influence this attenuation? Is there a way to control this dependency? How do the curvature and behavior of the curves in Fig. 1c vary with other parameters? Addressing these questions would be particularly relevant for practical applications.
Detailed comments:
- Section 2 title: Typo—should read "slab" instead of "slap."
- Line 093: Replace "easy the generate" with "easy to generate."
- Section 3: When replacing f1 with f1 tilde, it would be helpful to clarify the transition from the conditional distribution of y given x to the conditional distribution of x given m1 and V1 (where m1 depends on y).
- Section 3: The role of the function d(x, y) in equations 18–21 is unclear.
- Section 3.1: The notation tilde(f)a,i should be explained, as only tilde(f)a was previously introduced. Consider placing the subscript i as a superscript or defining it explicitly in the text.
- Using bold A and regular A for different variables is confusing; please consider revising one of them.
- Section 3.2: What does N represent? Is it the rank of V1?
- Line 306: Replace "slap" with "slab."
In summary, this is a technically sound and engaging paper that introduces a novel structured sparsity prior and provides an effective inference algorithm under this prior. The numerical results convincingly demonstrate the method's superiority in structured sparse recovery tasks.
