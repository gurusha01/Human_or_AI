The author(s) explore social choice mechanisms through the lens of statistical decision theory. Leveraging this perspective, they propose two novel voting mechanisms grounded in the principle of Bayesian risk minimization. The remainder of the paper investigates the properties of the rankings generated by these mechanisms, alongside a detailed analysis of the computational complexity involved in implementing them. Specifically, the authors demonstrate that determining optimal winning candidates under one of the proposed schemes is NP-hard, whereas the other can be solved in polynomial time. The paper concludes with an asymptotic comparison between the outcomes of their mechanisms and the Kemeny voting rule, complemented by an experimental validation of the asymptotic findings.
The results presented are original, and the paper is well-written, though it is dense with technical content.
Minor comments:
* Definition 4: The definition of the loss function \( L{0-1}(\theta, c) \) is missing, which caused some confusion as it differs from the function in Example 1. It seems the definition should be \( L{0-1}(\theta, c) = 0 \) if \( \theta \in \mathcal{L}c(C) \) (resp. \( \mathcal{B}c(C) \)) and 1 otherwise.
* Lemma 2: The quantities referenced outside the lemma (lines 249-251) are implicitly used within the lemma's statement, which I found slightly confusing. It would be helpful to make the lemma self-contained by explicitly including these quantities.
* Regarding the definition of the \( P_\parallel^{NP} \)-hard problem, it seems like truth-table reductions might be more appropriate than many-one reductions. However, this is a minor observation and does not impact the validity of the results, so feel free to disregard this comment.
* Typo on Page 7, line 343: "where d is not ranked" should be corrected to "where b is not ranked."
* Typo on Page 7, line 346: "BETTER DECISION" should be replaced with "OPTIMAL BAYESIAN DECISION."
The reviewer believes the author(s) have successfully approached a well-established area with a novel perspective, offering fresh insights and raising intriguing open questions for future exploration.
