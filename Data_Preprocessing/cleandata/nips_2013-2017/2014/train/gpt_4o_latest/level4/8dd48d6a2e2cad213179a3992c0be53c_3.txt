This paper introduces a fully Bayesian framework that incorporates max-margin constraints into clustering models. The proposed method builds upon the Regularized Bayesian inference technique by Zhu et al., extending it to unsupervised settings. The authors validate the effectiveness of their approach using two clustering models: a DP-based Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and a cluster-topic model, both enhanced with integrated max-margin constraints.
The paper is well-written, providing a clear and detailed explanation of the proposed max-margin clustering framework and its model variants. However, it would be beneficial to elaborate further on the posterior inference process, particularly regarding the sampling complexity, as the practical performance of the method heavily depends on the efficiency of the sampler. The authors also compare the proposed models to baseline systems and conduct a sensitivity analysis of the hyperparameters, which is a valuable addition.
Instead of relying on the heuristic for model selection, could the authors explore making this process non-parametric and estimating it during inference? Perhaps the heuristic could serve as an informative prior in such a setup.
For clarification, does "p" refer to the dimensionality of the latent space? If so, it appears that the time complexity for the DPGMM includes an additional cubic factor in p.
It is promising to observe that incorporating max-margin constraints enhances clustering quality in unsupervised Bayesian models. However, the datasets in Table 1 are relatively small, raising the question of whether the proposed method can scale effectively to practical scenarios with significantly larger datasets and higher dimensionality. Recent advancements in fast sampling techniques, such as randomization and approximation methods, might help accelerate inference. It would be helpful to address this point in the paper, either in the future work section or as part of the related work discussion.
Additionally, are the accuracy differences reported in Table 2 statistically significant (e.g., S3VM vs. MMCTM for L=5,10)? Please provide statistical significance results to support these comparisons.
Overall, the paper is well-executed and successfully extends the Regularized Bayesian framework to unsupervised settings. The authors demonstrate the utility of their approach through two distinct clustering models, showing that the inclusion of max-margin constraints leads to improved clustering performance.
