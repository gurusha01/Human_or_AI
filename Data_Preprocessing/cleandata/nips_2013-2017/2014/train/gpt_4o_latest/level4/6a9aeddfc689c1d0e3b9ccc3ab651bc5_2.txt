- Summary:  
This paper proposes a method to accelerate least squares linear regression while claiming improved robustness against outliers or corrupted predictors when compared to existing approaches.
- Quality:  
The paper appears to be technically sound, with its claims well-supported from a theoretical standpoint. However, the experimental evaluation is somewhat underwhelming. While the authors utilize reasonably large artificial datasets (n=100,000; p=500), the single real-world dataset used (n=13,000; p=170) falls short of what is typically considered large-scale by current standards. Furthermore, the reliance on just one real-world dataset limits the experimental scope, especially considering the initial motivation stated in the abstract. That said, the theoretical contributions are thorough and well-documented, particularly when factoring in the supplemental material provided.
- Clarity:  
The paper is well-written, and the algorithms and methodology are clearly presented, making it likely that the results could be reproduced. However, additional details about the Airline Delay dataset would be helpful, even though a URL is provided. Additionally, the label on the X-axis of Figure 2 (n_{subs}) is unclearâ€”its meaning should be clarified. On page 5, near Equation 7, there also appears to be a typo ("... $4 and $4 ...").
- Originality:  
The proposal appears to be novel, though it is primarily a combination of prior works ([8] and [14], as cited in Section 5), which limits its degree of originality. The authors are transparent about this and appropriately reference related work.
- Significance:  
The significance of the paper is constrained by its focus on a specific regression method. Additionally, the limitations of the experimental evaluation make it difficult to fully assess the practical impact of the proposed approach. While the work represents a step forward in the state of the art for least squares linear regression, the lack of comprehensive experimental validation diminishes its overall significance, which was already limited by its narrow focus on a single regression technique.
In summary, this paper provides a theoretically robust but narrowly focused contribution. Its impact is constrained by its emphasis on a specific technique and by a limited experimental evaluation.
