This paper introduces a novel sampling algorithm for the state posterior distribution within a multi-chain model framework.
The primary contribution of the work lies in adapting the slice sampling technique to the domain of multi-chain hidden Markov models (HMMs).
My main concerns are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item It is unclear whether the proposed method can be generalized to factorial hidden Markov models (FHMMs) with transition matrices that are more general than the one specified in eq. (1).
\item The example provided in Section 2 (refer to panel a in Figure 2) demonstrates that a pairwise blocked Gibbs sampler cannot transition in a single step from the initial multi-chain configuration to the true configuration. The authors argue that this illustrates how standard Gibbs sampling can become trapped in local modes. I disagree with this interpretation. Instead, I believe the example highlights that the mixing rate of the standard Gibbs sampler is slower compared to the proposed Hamming ball sampler.
\item Previous research has shown that the mixing performance of the basic FFBS sampler for HMMs can be enhanced using permutation sampling (Fr\"uhwirth-Schnatter, 2001) or antithetic sampling (Billio et al., 2014). It would be valuable to investigate whether the performance of both the GB and HB samplers could be further improved by integrating these strategies. Additional simulation results or, at the very least, a discussion on this topic would strengthen the paper.
\end{enumerate}
Minor remarks:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Line 152: Please provide a formal definition or a reference for the Hamming distance.
\item Line 168: The authors state that "This Hamming ball, centered at $X$, is simply the union of all $i$-th location Hamming balls of radius $m$." However, based on the decomposition in equation (6), it appears to be an intersection rather than a union.
\item Line 171: Is $I(\cdot)$ intended to represent the indicator (or characteristic) function? If so, it is unclear why the authors describe it as the identity function.
\item The bibliography requires careful proofreading. For instance: line 434, "Markov" should replace "markov"; line 452, "Monte Carlo" should replace "monte carlo"; line 467, "Indian" should replace "indian."

This paper addresses a complex problem and presents an innovative sampler for the hidden states of a multi-chain HMM. While some minor revisions are necessary, I strongly recommend accepting the paper after these revisions are addressed.
