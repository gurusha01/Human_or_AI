The paper presents max-margin Bayesian clustering (BMC), an extension of Bayesian clustering methods that incorporates the max-margin criterion. This includes, for instance, the Dirichlet process max-margin Gaussian mixture (DPMMGM), which relaxes the Gaussian assumption of Dirichlet process Gaussian mixtures by integrating max-margin posterior constraints. This approach allows the model to infer the number of clusters directly from the data. The proposed techniques, including DPMMGM and another method termed MMCTM, are evaluated against a range of alternative techniques in several numerical experiments.
The paper bridges two clustering paradigms: deterministic and Bayesian clustering. Deterministic methods are adept at handling constraints but cannot infer the number of clusters, whereas Bayesian methods can infer the number of clusters but struggle to incorporate constraints such as max-margin.
Quality:
The BMC algorithm is claimed to be the first application of regularized Bayesian inference to unsupervised clustering. Additionally, the DPMMGM algorithm introduces a novel capability by leveraging max-margin constraints to relax the Gaussian assumptions inherent in standard DPGMM.
Clarity:
- (pg 4, 184) The statement, "The max-margin constraints take effects in the model via \(\tilde\phi_i\)'s in (8)," lacks sufficient explanation in this paper. While this may have been elaborated in prior work, the authors need to provide clearer justification for this claim within the current manuscript.
- (pg 4, 208) The phrase "Gausses in the pseudo likelihood" seems inappropriate. Additionally, the statement "to some extent" is vague and imprecise for a publication of this nature.
- (pg 6, 298) The word "controll" is misspelled.
- (pg 6, 284) Figure 2 highlights differences between the two algorithms, but the discussion does not adequately explain why the DPMMGM results are superior. While DPGMM is described as more fragmented, the significance of this observation is unclear. In fact, DPGMM appears to fit the data better in some cases, raising questions about what is sacrificed when transitioning to DPMMGM.
- (pg 6, 295) The statement "thus driving the data points to collapse as well" requires clarification. Furthermore, the authors should expand their discussion to better connect their intuition to Figure 3 (a)-(j). The figures are dense, with numerous trends, and the interpretation of lines and clusters is challenging. The conclusion that "the results indeed follow our intuition" is far less evident than the authors suggest.
Originality:
While the ideas appear to be original, much of Section 3 on robust Bayesian max-margin clustering closely mirrors [17]. Specifically, the key steps between equations (6)-(7)-(8) reuse techniques introduced in [17]. This raises concerns that the core contributions may already exist in prior work, with the authors primarily adapting them to a new model formulation. This lack of clarity impacts the perceived novelty and significance of the work.
Significance:
The numerical experiments demonstrate that DPMMGM outperforms DPGMM, and similarly, MMCTM outperforms SVM and S3VM, which are noteworthy results. However, while the paper provides substantial material on model development, it offers few theoretical guarantees regarding the performance or convergence of the algorithms.
In summary, the paper addresses an interesting topic, and the proposed algorithms perform well in extensive numerical comparisons. However, further clarification is needed regarding the technical contributions relative to [17]. This clarification is critical to fully assess the novelty and impact of the work.
