This paper integrates two contemporary techniques—robust PCA and dictionary-based structure-preserving projection—for the task of restoring corrupted observation matrices. The central insight is that for structured data (e.g., clustered data), the guarantees provided by robust PCA alone are insufficient. By incorporating a dictionary to represent the structure, stronger theoretical bounds can be established. The paper provides theorems to substantiate these claims. The remaining challenge lies in learning the dictionary, for which the authors propose an algorithm supported by empirical results: first applying robust PCA, followed by representing the output using a dictionary.
Quality:  
The paper is technically sound within the bounds of reasonable verification. The two theorems detail the conditions under which reconstruction is feasible, given a dictionary. However, the justification for the dictionary learning process is primarily empirical.
Clarity:  
The primary weakness of the paper lies in its clarity. While the structure is logically organized, the main contributions and broader implications of the work are not articulated clearly enough to be accessible to a wider audience beyond a narrow group of specialists. The claims require more precise definitions, and the impact of the results needs to be better explained. For example, the concept of coherence is difficult to grasp, and the methods for interpreting it are indirect and relegated to the appendix. One potential contribution of the work is the possibility of addressing several earlier problems by leveraging dictionaries, but this is not sufficiently emphasized.  
Additionally, the language requires refinement. It would be helpful to receive feedback from the authors on how these clarity issues could be addressed.
Originality:  
The work builds on a combination of recent techniques but introduces new theorems and empirical evidence to demonstrate the value of this combination.
Significance:  
The paper advances the state of the art with rigorous theoretical results. Although the proposed algorithm for dictionary learning is heuristic, the demonstrated improvements over alternative methods highlight the practical utility of the insights presented in this work.

Comment after the author rebuttal and reviewer discussion:  
The paper contains publishable material and makes interesting contributions. My remaining concern is that significant effort will be required to rewrite the paper to make it accessible to a broader audience, even among specialists. If a "major revision" option were available, I would recommend it.  
This paper combines two recent techniques, offering both theoretical results and a heuristic yet empirically effective algorithm.
