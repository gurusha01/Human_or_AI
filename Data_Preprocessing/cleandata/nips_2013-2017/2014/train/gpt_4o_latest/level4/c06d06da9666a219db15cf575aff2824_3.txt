"Inferring sparse representations of continuous signals with continuous orthogonal matching pursuit" is a concise, well-structured, and well-written paper presenting a method that holds significant relevance for researchers working on spike sorting. The authors build upon the work of Ekanadham et al. (2011a,b) by exploring an alternative basis for signal decomposition and employing a different optimization approach. They compare their method to previous techniques, demonstrating notable improvements in computational efficiency and providing evidence for enhanced accuracy in detecting and estimating waveform parameters.
One concern regarding the comparison: to ensure fairness to the older method, the authors pruned waveforms with amplitudes below 0.3. Was this threshold optimized (e.g., was it equivalent to the lower bound on "a" in the COMP case)? Could CBP achieve better performance if this parameter were increased further? Additionally, how was the λ parameter for the L1-penalty determined? 
Another suggestion: would it be possible to present separate plots for hits and misses? Would such visualizations provide more insight into the typical error characteristics of the various methods?
Are all "hit errors" for COMP derived from the "Fourier" method?
Figure 1  
This figure might be somewhat confusing for readers. Upon observing the original waveform, I initially expected to see the reconstructed waveform. It took some time to realize that the black shapes in panels 2–4 were not reconstructions. Expanding the legend could help clarify this for readers. Additionally, the average errors listed in the legend appear to be significantly lower than the values shown in the figure.
Since the paper is already well-written, I offer the following minor suggestions for double-checking specific lines:
- Line 41: Remove the spurious "the."
- Line 85: Remove the spurious "here."
- Line 153: Include θ in the argument of the sinus function.
- Lines 299/300: Correct all indices (j' and n are swapped; (i,j) appears without prior explanation).
- Lines 311 and 315: Indices appear to be swapped.
- Line 411: Clarify whether eps=1 refers to 1 Δ.
Overall, this is a concise, well-structured, and well-written paper presenting a method of significant relevance to spike sorting research.
