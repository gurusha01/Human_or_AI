The paper is well-written and makes a significant contribution to the inference of synaptic conductance from recorded spike trains, supported by validation using physiological data.
How can this approach be expanded to also infer the network connectivity structure, beyond synaptic conductances, using spike data from a limited subset of neurons within the network? For relevant examples in this area, please refer to Abarbanel et al. and other recent studies.
