The paper introduces a straightforward yet innovative model for structured sparsity within spike-and-slab frameworks, along with an expectation propagation algorithm for performing Bayesian inference. The manuscript is well-written, featuring compelling examples and comparisons with alternative methods. While there is prior research in this domain, the proposed approach stands out for its simplicity and originality.
