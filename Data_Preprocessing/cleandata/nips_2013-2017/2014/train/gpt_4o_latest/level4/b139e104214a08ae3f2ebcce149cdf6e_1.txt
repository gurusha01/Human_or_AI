The paper establishes a version of Pinsker's theorem for the normal means model (minimax lower bound) in the context where a quantized version of the data is observed instead of the original data. Additionally, it proposes an encoding and decoding strategy (for estimating the mean parameters from the quantized data) that achieves the derived lower bound.
The paper is well-written, and the results are undoubtedly valuable from a practical perspective as well. I carefully reviewed the proofs, and they appear to be correct. However, as the authors acknowledge, the proposed encoding-decoding method is computationally prohibitive. It would be intriguing to explore whether the results from [12] (and subsequent related work) could be applied in this setting to develop computationally efficient schemes.
Finally, I am not entirely convinced by the title "quantized non-parametric estimation." A title such as "quantized infinite Gaussian sequence model" or "quantized normal means model" might better reflect the content of the work. This suggestion stems from the fact that the paper does not provide a rigorous proof of equivalence (in the Le Cam sense, akin to Brown and Low, 1996 for the unquantized case) between the quantized normal means model and non-parametric estimation problems. Overall, the paper delivers a version of Pinsker's theorem for the normal means model under quantized observations, is clearly presented, and offers substantial theoretical contributions to a practically significant problem.
