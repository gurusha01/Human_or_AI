This paper integrates a coarse-to-fine cascade with pruning classifiers to accelerate the optimization of Markov Random Fields (MRFs).
While the greedy pruning method for reducing the solution space appears intriguing, the paper lacks adequate theoretical and empirical evidence to substantiate the claim that the heuristic is effective. Furthermore, the applicability of the method is restricted to MRFs whose solutions exhibit piecewise smoothness.
Certain sections of the paper are insufficiently clear. For instance, in the explanation of the pruning matrix, the term "active" is not well-defined. Additionally, the process for updating the pruning matrix in the algorithm is ambiguous. To improve clarity, the authors could include a toy example to better illustrate the algorithm. Conversely, the "proposed approach" subsection in Section 1 is overly lengthy, with some content appearing redundant. Moreover, Figure 2 does not provide significant insights.
The experimental results are intriguing but lack sufficient clarity. Firstly, although three algorithms are compared, Figure 1 only presents a single curve (since three algorithms are being compared, showing only the ratio is inadequate). Secondly, given that the energy ratio is defined as the ratio between the current energy and the lowest energy computed by any strategy, it is unclear why the ratio is less than 1 in many instances.
After author feedback:
The authors have addressed some of the ambiguities in the original submission. I expect the authors to correct all typographical errors and resolve the reviewers' concerns. I am increasing my rating from 4 to 5, as there is still no theoretical justification for the pruning method.
Additional comments on the experiments:
- In column (d) of Figure 1, both curves in the third row show less than 96% agreement, despite the paper stating that "the agreement is never worse than 96%."
- Consider relocating Figure 2 to the appendix. Include additional experiments or analyses related to hyperparameter selection.
Overall, the paper presents interesting heuristics but suffers from a lack of clarity and remains weak in both theoretical and empirical support.
