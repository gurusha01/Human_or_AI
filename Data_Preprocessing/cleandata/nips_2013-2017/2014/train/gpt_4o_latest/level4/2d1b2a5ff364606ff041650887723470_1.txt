This paper introduces a novel approach to blind source separation by framing the problem as an additive factorial hidden Markov model (AFHMM) and incorporating signal aggregate constraints (SACs). The rationale behind this approach is that leveraging additional domain knowledge can enhance the decomposition of time series into their constituent components. The authors illustrate their method using the example of energy disaggregation, where the goal is to separate domestic energy usage into individual appliance contributions. By integrating information about the total (expected) usage of each appliance over a given time period, the separation process is improved. The paper reformulates the objective function—maximizing the log-posterior distribution of the hidden chains given the observed data—into a convex optimization problem. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated using both a toy dataset and real-world data from domestic energy consumption.
The paper is technically robust and features a strong simulation section. As anticipated, the proposed method outperforms both standard AFHMM and AFAMAP (a recently developed alternative) in terms of separation quality, as neither of these methods incorporate SACs. The improvements are statistically significant, as evidenced by t-tests. Additionally, the authors demonstrate that the optimization speed of their method is comparable to that of AFAMAP. However, one question arises regarding the results section: why was a low noise variance chosen for the toy example? Is this intended to make Figure 2 more illustrative by clearly showing the method's ability to separate signals better than competing approaches? This should be clarified, as the setup might otherwise appear overly simplistic. Alternatively, are such signal-to-noise ratios representative of real-world data? The authors could also provide commentary on the signal-to-noise ratio between the mains readings and the aggregate appliance outputs in the energy disaggregation application.
The theoretical aspects of the paper are generally well-structured and clearly presented. However, the paper would benefit from a formal proof that the final procedure in equation (6) is indeed convex, as the reasoning provided is not entirely convincing. Additionally, theoretical scaling arguments regarding data length and the number of hidden states would enhance the paper and complement the simulation results. Specifically, it would be helpful to discuss the tractability of the method for larger datasets and state spaces, and how this compares to AFAMAP.
The paper is well-written and well-organized. The introduction effectively motivates the problem and provides a clear overview of the relevant literature, though I cannot definitively confirm that no significant references are missing, as I am not deeply familiar with this specific problem domain. I did notice a potential minor error on page 4 (line 202), in the unnumbered equation preceding (6), where the subscripts following the object p appear to include commas. This seems inconsistent with earlier notation on page 3 unless new notation is being introduced here.
To the best of my knowledge, the work is both novel and original. However, as I am not an expert in this specific area, I cannot fully assess the significance of the results for the HMM community or the energy disaggregation application.
Addendum: The authors addressed my questions satisfactorily during the feedback phase, and I encourage them to incorporate similar clarifications in the revised version of the paper. This work presents a method for blind source separation using Additive Factorial HMMs with Signal Aggregate Constraints, which performs exceptionally well compared to state-of-the-art methods, particularly in the energy disaggregation application with real-world data.
