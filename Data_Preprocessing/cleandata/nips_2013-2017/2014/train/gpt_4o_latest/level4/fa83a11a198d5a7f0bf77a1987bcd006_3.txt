The objective of this paper is to introduce an unbiased and consistent methodology for accurately estimating covariance matrices in scenarios involving high-dimensional datasets with a limited number of samples, compounded by internal autocorrelation that further diminishes the effective dataset size. The proposed solution builds upon the state-of-the-art approach by Sancetta [San08], wherein the covariance matrix is shrunk toward a diagonal matrix, with the shrinkage intensity determined in proportion to the variance of the covariance matrix. Within this framework, the paper introduces an analytical estimation of shrinkage intensity that incorporates a bias correction, linking the coefficient to the effective size of the dataset.
The proposed unbiased variance estimator represents an incremental contribution to the work of Sancetta ([San08]) and does not offer significant theoretical novelty. However, the strength of the proposed solution lies in its theoretical soundness, as well as its empirical performance. Experiments conducted on synthetic examples and a real EEG dataset demonstrate that the proposed estimator performs comparably to the original method and even outperforms it in cases involving small, high-dimensional datasets. That said, a more comprehensive comparison with cross-validation (beyond just computational cost) would have been highly beneficial.
From a technical perspective, while the paper is relatively clear, it contains several issues. Notably, the notation is often introduced without explanation, making it challenging at times to follow the mathematical formulations. Additionally, inconsistencies in the notation are observed throughout the paper, such as the inversion of indices, and it appears that the organization of matrix \( X \) alternates between rows and columns without clarification. Furthermore, the figures are frequently difficult to interpret due to insufficient descriptions in both the captions and the main text. While the paper presents an incremental contribution with limited originality, the proposed solution offers theoretical and empirical advantages. Overall, the paper is technically well-written but requires further refinement, particularly in addressing the indexing errors and ensuring that formal notation is properly introduced when first used.
