This paper explores the lower bound of space complexity for a specific streaming algorithm. The algorithm aims to compute a matrix \( R \) such that the matrix \( A \) can be approximated by \( A R^\dagger R \), where \( R^\dagger \) represents the pseudo-inverse of \( R \). In the streaming model, the rows of matrix \( A \) are presented sequentially in an arbitrary order.
The problem addressed in this paper is compelling. The authors establish a lower bound on the space required to compute the matrix \( R \). Compared to prior work, the improvement in the space lower bound is significant and noteworthy.
As the primary contribution of this paper is the improved lower bound, it is highly theoretical in nature. I found the paper challenging to follow in its entirety. Many of the proofs are included in the supplementary material. While I reviewed the paper, I did not verify all the details. However, the arguments and proofs presented appear sound to me.
Regarding quality and significance, I believe this paper is above the acceptance threshold for NeurIPS. My main concern is that the inclusion of numerous proofs in the supplementary material makes the paper less accessible, and its readability could be enhanced. 
Minor comment: The proof of Lemma 6 could be revised for clarity. For instance, the phrase "expanding the square" could be omitted from the lengthy equation.
Overall, this is a strong theoretical contribution that advances the lower bound of space complexity for the low-rank approximation problem in the streaming setting. However, the readability could be improved by integrating more of the proofs into the main text.
