The authors introduce a spectral method for learning a mixture of HMMs. The proposed algorithm is essentially a straightforward adaptation of the standard Hsu, Kakade, and Zhang algorithm, with the key distinction being that the recovered transition matrix is an arbitrary permutation of the true one, thereby mixing the components. To address this, the authors develop a depermutation algorithm, which appears to perform reasonably well in practice.
There are occasional minor errors or typos in the manuscript. For instance:
"For each e, identify of eigenvalues that contain all of the energy."
The authors are encouraged to proofread the paper more thoroughly.
Additionally, the paper could benefit from better contextualization of its contributions, particularly by relating the work to prior research such as:
Chaganty and Liang. Spectral experts for estimating mixtures of linear regressions. In International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), 2013.  
The authors focus on the critical challenge of "de-permuting" the results, which is a central aspect of this work.
