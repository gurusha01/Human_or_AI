This paper introduces a novel algorithm for the balanced k-cut objective function through continuous relaxation, applicable to both the classical clustering scenario without labeled data and the transductive setting. Comprehensive experimental evaluations compare the proposed method against various spectral clustering variants, demonstrating that the new approach frequently outperforms existing methods. Notably, the algorithm consistently achieves superior balanced k-cuts and, somewhat unexpectedly, produces better partitions for other related objective functions, even outperforming algorithms specifically designed for those functions.
Minor comments:
- Page 1, at the end of the first paragraph of the introduction, consider reversing the order of the words "outperform" and "frequently."  
- Ensure the bibliography is alphabetized.
A continuous relaxation approach for balanced k-cut is proposed, with experimental results showing significant qualitative improvements over prior related methods.
