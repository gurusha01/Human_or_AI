This paper introduces a novel signal recovery algorithm that integrates the strengths of continuous basis pursuit (CBP) and orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP). The proposed algorithm selects basis vectors from the left singular vectors obtained through the SVD of the dictionary matrix, enabling improved interpolation of data points between the grid. Simulation results demonstrate that the SVD basis surpasses the performance of previously used Taylor and Polar bases. Subsequently, inspired by orthogonal matching pursuit, the algorithm greedily identifies the time bins corresponding to the occurrence of each waveform and transitions to the Fourier domain for more accurate estimation of time shifts.
The manuscript is well-written and appears to present a novel contribution to the field. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods, representing a significant advancement in signal recovery techniques.
