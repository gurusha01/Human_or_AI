This paper investigates a structured spike-and-slab prior, where a Gaussian process is utilized to enforce spatial contiguity in the sparsity pattern. Prior work by (Cevher et al., 2008) explored a related approach by employing an Ising model to capture between-element correlations. The key distinction between this work and (Cevher et al., 2008) lies in the substitution of the Ising model with a Gaussian process combined with a Probit link function. The proposed spike-and-slab prior is applied to a linear inverse problem as a prior for the unknown signal, and an EP algorithm is developed to perform inference under this prior. The experiments are conducted using synthetic data.
The primary novelty of this work is the use of a Gaussian process-based correlation structure in the spike-and-slab prior. However, the paper does not adequately discuss how this correlation structure compares to the Ising model from (Cevher et al., 2008), nor does it include experimental comparisons between the two approaches. Beyond this significant omission, several additional issues are noted, as outlined below:
(1) In Figure 1(c), the method for computing the correlation between z1 and z2 is not explained.
(2) The shorthand notation "MMV" is introduced but never defined.
(3) The experiments rely solely on synthetic data, with no real data included.
(4) In Experiment 2, the paper excludes BG-AMP from the comparison, despite acknowledging (in the text) that "Note, that the BG-AMP algorithm is expected to perform poorly on this problem due to the violation of the assumption of Aij being Gaussian i.i.d."
In summary, this paper proposes a correlated spike-and-slab prior with a Gaussian process-based correlation structure, but it does not sufficiently discuss or compare its approach to the Ising model-based prior from (Cevher et al., 2008). Additional concerns include the lack of a BG-AMP comparison in Experiment 2 and the exclusive reliance on synthetic data for the experiments.
