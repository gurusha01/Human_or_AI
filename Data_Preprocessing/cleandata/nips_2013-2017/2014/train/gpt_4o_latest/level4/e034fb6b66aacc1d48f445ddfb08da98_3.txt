This paper presents a word representation model that incorporates conditioning on attributes.  
The concept is straightforward, clearly explained, and supported by multiple examples.  
However, the experimental results are not particularly compelling, and the model represents only a minor variation from prior work.  
Slightly above the acceptance threshold.
