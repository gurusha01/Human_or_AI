The authors present a framework for adapting deep neural networks originally trained for image classification tasks to object detection tasks. Their evaluation on the ImageNet LSVRC-2013 dataset shows that the proposed method achieves 4th place in the object detection challenge. The paper is well-organized, generally easy to understand, and introduces a CNN structure that is both interesting and straightforward to implement. Overall, the paper is of good quality. However, there are two areas where improvements are needed.
First, the primary contribution of this work—the proposed adaptation method—requires stronger justification. The underlying motivations are not explained in a systematic manner. For instance, in Section 3.2 (Page 5, Line 231), it is unclear why the weights for the adapted detection task are defined as the summation of \( Wj^c \) and \( W{avg} \). The physical interpretation of this "offset parameter" is not provided, making it difficult to understand its purpose. Consequently, it is also unclear why the kNN variant performs better.
Second, the comparison with other methods is problematic because the authors used part of the validation set instead of the test set, leading to an unfair comparison. While the authors note in a footnote (Line 322) that RCNN exhibits similar performance on the val2 set, the small size of this set makes the reported performance gains statistically unreliable.
In summary, the authors propose a framework for adapting deep neural networks from image classification to object detection tasks. While the method achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art models, the comparisons are conducted under different settings, and the proposed adaptation technique requires clearer explanation.
