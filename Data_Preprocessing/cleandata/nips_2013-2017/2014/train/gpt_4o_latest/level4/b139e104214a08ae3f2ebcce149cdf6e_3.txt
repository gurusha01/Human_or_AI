The authors establish a lower bound on the minimax risk for estimating normal means under a "communication constraint," which imposes a limit on the number of bits available to represent an estimate. They introduce a theoretical (though not practically implementable) discretized estimator that attains this bound and provide performance results through small-scale simulations.
The paper is well written, with a clear and organized presentation. The results are compelling and, to the best of my knowledge, novel.
However, the authors do not propose a practical encoding scheme that achieves their bound, nor do they analyze the performance of existing encoding methods in relation to their bound. Additionally, the model used to derive the bound could be significantly generalized. The lack of immediate practical applicability somewhat limits the scope of the results. Nonetheless, this paper represents an intriguing theoretical contribution toward understanding the tradeoff between statistical efficiency and storage constraints.
