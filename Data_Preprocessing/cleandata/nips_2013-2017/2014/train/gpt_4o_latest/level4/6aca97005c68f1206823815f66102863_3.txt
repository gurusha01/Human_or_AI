This paper introduces a method for non-parametric model learning from incremental data. The motivating example is the learning of manipulator models in robotics, which are typically high-dimensional and highly non-linear. The proposed approach employs Gaussian regression over a sequence of smaller patches, with these patches being adaptively refined through pruning and greedy addition. The primary innovation compared to existing methods is that the proposed technique yields a generative probabilistic model while requiring minimal parameter tuning.
The paper provides compelling test results demonstrating that the proposed method effectively achieves its objectives.
As minor suggestions for improvement, while the authors allude to additional advantages of adopting a fully probabilistic/generative model, it would be beneficial to explicitly articulate why such a probabilistic approach is significant from a controls perspective. Furthermore, the forgetting and learning rates of LGR appear to be tuning parameters. Could the authors provide an analysis or quantification of how the proposed method involves fewer or less sensitive parameters compared to state-of-the-art techniques? 
Overall, this paper is well-written and well-structured. The necessity for efficient non-parametric fitting of robotics data is clearly established, as is the argument regarding the reduced need for parameter tuning.
