The paper introduces a novel approach that leverages neural networks, functioning as generic function approximators, to learn the mapping derived from UCT. UCT, a Monte Carlo method, evaluates multiple trajectories within a game. Monte Carlo methods are computationally expensive due to the exponential growth in the number of trajectories considered. By training neural networks on this mapping, the proposed method achieves results with significantly reduced computation time, improving efficiency by several orders of magnitude.
The paper, however, is challenging to follow due to the excessive use of abbreviations. Despite this, the core idea is relatively straightforward. The proposed technique appears to have the potential to accelerate any Monte Carlo-based game-playing algorithm, but the authors have only demonstrated its application to UCT. It would strengthen the paper if the authors could provide evidence that this approach generalizes to other Monte Carlo methods.
To enhance clarity, the inclusion of mathematical equations is strongly recommended. These would help formalize the concepts and make the methodology more accessible to readers.
Additionally, the authors might consider exploring whether a single model could be trained to play multiple games. Would such a model exhibit cross-game benefits? While the results presented are compelling, the overall presentation requires improvement. Specifically, mathematical formulas should be incorporated, and the figures need refinement. For instance, Figure 4 is difficult to interpret and should be revised for better readability and comprehension.
