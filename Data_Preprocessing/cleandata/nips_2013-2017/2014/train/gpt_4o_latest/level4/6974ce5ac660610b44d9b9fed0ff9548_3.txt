Review - Summary:  
This paper tackles the semi-metric labeling problem, a discrete optimization challenge characterized by an objective function that decomposes according to a second-order Markov Random Field (MRF), where the second-order terms are proportional to a semi-metric. It builds upon recent advancements [14,15,20] that introduced (primal) move-making algorithms for specific semi-metrics, achieving the best-known multiplicative bounds for rounded solutions of the LP relaxation. The authors extend these findings by proposing move-making algorithms applicable to various rounding procedures and arbitrary semi-metrics.
Quality:  
- The paper is technically sound.  
- The references are appropriate and relevant.  
- The authors clearly delineate the problems they address and distinguish them from previously solved problems.
Clarity:  
- The paper is well-written, logically organized, and easy to follow.
Originality:  
- The introduction of the Interval Move Algorithm and the Hierarchical Move Algorithm, along with the demonstration that their multiplicative bounds align with those of related rounding procedures, represents a novel contribution.
Significance:  
- This work provides a meaningful contribution to the understanding of the relationship between (primal) move-making algorithms and algorithms that round LP relaxation solutions in the context of the semi-metric labeling problem. It is a technically robust, well-written, and well-structured paper that significantly enhances our comprehension of this connection.
