The paper explores a group-theoretic perspective on penalized likelihood functions within vector spaces. It demonstrates that several widely used regularization terms, such as the L1-, L2-, and L_infty-norms, can be interpreted as specific cases of what the authors term "orbit regularization." This generalized framework also suggests novel forms of regularization that exhibit favorable properties when optimized using conditional and projected gradient algorithms.
Quality:
The quality of the work is high. The authors have thoroughly cited both foundational and recent literature relevant to the topic.
Clarity:
The paper is presented exceptionally well. The notation is thoughtfully chosen and aligns with standard conventions. Definitions are precise, and the writing is clear and engaging, even though the subject matter is inherently abstract. 
However, the paper does not conform to the NIPS section headings and referencing styles. Additionally, there is a typographical error on line 035: "klowledge." In Def 5, Prop 6, and similar instances, consider placing the period (in bold) outside the parentheses or omitting it altogether.
Originality:
The proposed perspective appears novel within the machine learning community. That said, much of the underlying mathematics is not entirely new; for instance, Propositions 11 and 12 are attributed to earlier works, such as Eaton (1984) and Hardy et al. (1952). The paper could more clearly articulate its unique contributions to distinguish its novelty.
Significance:
The significance of the work is somewhat ambiguous. Specifically, it is unclear how this framework advances the practical application of machine learning. While having multiple computationally efficient regularization methods is valuable, there is no established objective criterion for selecting the "best" regularization approach for a given problem. Consequently, merely proposing new forms of regularization may not lead to substantial progress in the field. 
Overall, this is a well-written and carefully prepared paper that offers a perspective that could enhance the understanding of likelihood regularization in machine learning problems with a "linear flavor."
