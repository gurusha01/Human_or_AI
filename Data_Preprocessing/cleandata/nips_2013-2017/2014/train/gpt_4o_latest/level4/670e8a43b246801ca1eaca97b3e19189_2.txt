In this work, the authors address the problem of bipartite ranking, focusing specifically on optimizing the ranking at the top. They introduce a loss function that penalizes a positive example whenever its predicted score is lower than that of the highest-scoring negative example. The primary technical contribution lies in formulating a regularized optimization problem based on this loss and demonstrating that it can be efficiently solved using a dual formulation. The authors present an optimization algorithm to solve the proposed problem and provide a theoretical result that establishes an upper bound on the probability of any positive example being ranked below a delta fraction of negative examples. A key advantage of the proposed approach is its ability to reduce the computational complexity of rank optimization to linear in the number of examples. 
The paper also includes experimental results comparing the proposed method with several existing approaches. The results clearly demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms most alternatives in terms of both speed and accuracy.
Minor comment:  
The definitions of loss functions used in this paper are non-standard. For instance, \( e^{-z} \) is typically referred to as the exponential loss, while \( [1-z]_+^2 \) is known as the truncated exponential loss. However, this does not pose an issue since the authors have also inverted the sign of the argument in Eqn (3). For better clarity, it might be preferable to align the terminology with standard definitions.
Overall, the paper appears to be quite novel, and the contributions are significant. I do not have any major concerns. The authors propose an elegant method to reduce the time complexity of bipartite ranking to linear in the number of examples, and the experimental results are highly compelling. I strongly recommend accepting this paper.
