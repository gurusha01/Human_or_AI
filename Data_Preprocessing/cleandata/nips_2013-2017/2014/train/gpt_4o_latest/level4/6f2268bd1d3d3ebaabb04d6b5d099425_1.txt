The paper addresses the challenge of integrating clustering with outlier detection. It is well-written, clear, and easy to follow. The authors build upon the earlier facility location with outliers (FLO) formulation by Charikar et al., with their primary contribution being the proposed solution to this problem formulation.
The FLO problem was demonstrated to be intractable in the original paper, with no known approximation algorithm that is both i) scalable and ii) provides guarantees. The FLO paper has garnered over 100 citations, and a brief review of these citations corroborates this claim. The Lagrange relaxation proposed by the authors is straightforward and appears reasonable. The analysis of the Lagrange relaxation is particularly compelling, with the key result—that the LP relaxation of FLO is equivalent to the Lagrange relaxation—being non-intuitive and noteworthy.
The experimental results are a valuable addition, as they highlight the practical utility of the formulation, especially in terms of the speedup achieved over the LP relaxation. However, the absence of absolute runtime values in the experimental section raises some concerns. For instance, in Figure 3, while the results illustrate the speedup relative to the LP relaxation, they do not provide information on the absolute runtime of the Lagrange relaxation method.
In summary, the authors extend the existing FLO formulation to demonstrate its applicability for simultaneous outlier detection and clustering. Their key contribution lies in the Lagrange relaxation for the existing objective function, supported by experimental results that underscore its effectiveness.
