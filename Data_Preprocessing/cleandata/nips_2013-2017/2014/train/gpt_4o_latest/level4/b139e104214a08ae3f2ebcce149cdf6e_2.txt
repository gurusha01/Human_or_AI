The authors investigate Pinsker's theorem concerning the minimax rate in nonparametric estimation with squared error risk for normal means within an L2 ball. They extend this result to a rate-distortion-like framework, where the estimation process is constrained by a limit on the number of bits used. For bitrates (number of bits per outcome) bounded by B, the authors derive exact expressions for the minimax risk in the asymptotic regime as n → ∞. As expected, the derived formula reduces to Pinsker's formula when B → ∞ and degenerates to the radius of the L2 ball when B → 0.
QUALITY  
The paper appears to be technically sound, though I did not verify all details. While the methods employed are ultimately adaptations of standard techniques from rate-distortion theory (Theorem 2) and the literature on minimax risk lower bounds (Theorem 1), the specific details are novel, nontrivial, and quite challenging.
CLARITY  
The paper is well-written and accessible, given the technical nature of the topic. Although it assumes some prior knowledge from the reader, the authors have made a commendable effort to present the material clearly.
ORIGINALITY  
To the best of my knowledge (noting that I am not deeply familiar with the most recent literature), the results presented are new. However, I have a reservation regarding the originality of the techniques. The methods on which the authors build are not new, and the paper provides limited discussion on how much of the current work is a natural extension of or expected from prior results. In this regard, I find the third paragraph of Section 5, Discussion, insufficiently detailed. If the paper is accepted, this section should be significantly expanded, even at the expense of other material.  
For example, upon reviewing the Yang and Barron (YB) paper cited in Section 5, I noticed deeper connections than the authors acknowledge. Specifically, the proof of YB Theorem 1 shares notable similarities with the authors' approach to proving Theorem 1. To elaborate, while YB's classical minimax risk lower bounds do not impose constraints on the number of bits used for storing or communicating the estimator, their proof involves restricting potential "truths" (via an ε-net on Θ_n) and assigning a discrete prior w. Using Fano's inequality, they derive a lower bound on the risk of estimators optimal with respect to w. These estimators are inherently representable with a limited number of bits (proportional to the log of the ε-net size) and thus implicitly satisfy a bit constraint similar to the one imposed by the authors. This raises the question of whether classical minimax risk lower bounds already contain an implicit rate-distortion element and whether the results in this paper could be derived more directly as corollaries of existing results. It is surprising that this connection is not discussed in the paper.
In summary, while the details of the paper are undoubtedly original—the results are new, and the proofs are intricate and nontrivial—the general type of result is less novel than the authors imply. This is not necessarily a reason for rejection but warrants more thorough discussion.
SIGNIFICANCE  
For similar reasons as outlined under originality, the paper holds reasonable significance, though perhaps not to the extent suggested by the authors.
PRO/CON-Analysis  
PRO: The paper is well-written, presents a technically sound and nontrivial result, and provides precise asymptotics.  
CON: The work heavily builds on prior results, and the connections to existing methods are not discussed in sufficient depth.
COMMENT ON IMPACT SCORE:  
I found it challenging to assign an impact score given the binary options available. Ultimately, I selected "incremental" because, while the setting is novel (combining rate-distortion theory with minimax nonparametric analysis), the methods used are very similar to existing approaches in both fields. Furthermore, the interrelation between these methods was already reasonably well-understood. From a mathematical perspective, the term "incremental" seems appropriate. The paper's strength lies in its precise asymptotics, but the fact that "something like this" would hold is not particularly surprising.
