First, I apologize for the brevity of this review—I had previously written a more detailed version with specific comments and noted a few typos, but unfortunately, I am unable to locate it now.
This paper explores the application of deep neural networks (DNNs) to a novel domain: discovering mathematical identities. While the ideas presented are innovative, my impression is that this work feels somewhat preliminary and may not fully meet the standard for a NeurIPS publication. In particular, the performance of your method in identifying mathematical identities does not appear especially compelling, even though the inputs provided were highly constrained. The expressions used for identity discovery were drawn from such a narrow set that it seems it might have been more straightforward to derive a mathematical rule for this task rather than employing DNNs—an approach that feels akin to using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. While you could argue that your method has the potential to generalize to a broader class of expressions, it is unclear to me whether your current approach would scale effectively in that direction or whether such an extension would even be worthwhile given the modest results presented.
Overall, I find this paper interesting, but I believe it falls slightly below the bar for publication.
