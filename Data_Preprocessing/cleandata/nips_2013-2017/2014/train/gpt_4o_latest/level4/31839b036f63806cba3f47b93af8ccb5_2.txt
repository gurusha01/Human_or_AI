This paper introduces innovative necessary and sufficient conditions to determine whether a causal query can be identified from data when faced with missing observations. It advances prior research by explicitly incorporating the missing data generating mechanism into the causal diagram. The manuscript is well-written, and although it builds upon earlier contributions employing this approach, the new insights offered represent, in this reviewer's opinion, a significant advancement to the state of the art in understanding causal mechanisms under conditions of missing data. The paper is concise, focused, and clearly articulated.
