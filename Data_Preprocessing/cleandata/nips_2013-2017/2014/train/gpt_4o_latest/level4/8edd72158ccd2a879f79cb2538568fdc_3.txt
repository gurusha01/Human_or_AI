In this paper, the authors introduce a novel two-stage noisy voting model and theoretically demonstrate that a uniform team is bound to make some errors, whereas a diverse team achieves perfection as the number of agents increases. The experimental results, conducted in the Computer Go domain, align well with the theoretical analysis.
This paper is well-structured, and the findings are both robust and intriguing. The work makes contributions in both theoretical and methodological aspects:
1. The authors prove that diverse voting outperforms uniform voting under their proposed constraints on noise models, namely PD-alpha, PM-alpha, and PPM-alpha. Moreover, they show that the assumptions in their theorem are mild by demonstrating that three classical noise models satisfy all the required conditions. Consequently, the theorem has broad applicability.
2. In the experimental setup, the authors' approach to automatically generating a large number of diverse agents and extracting move rankings from algorithms is practical and effective.
However, the following concerns should be addressed:
1. Novelty: The paper's technical contributions should be clearly delineated in comparison to the work of Marcolino et al., 2013. A more explicit statement highlighting the differences and advancements made in this paper is necessary.
2. Experimentation: Although the authors acknowledge the potential gap between Figure (a) and the main theorem, the noticeable drop in the winning rate for diverse+Copeland suggests that the performance of diverse voting may lack robustness under certain voting rules. More comprehensive experimental results would provide deeper insights into this issue. While the authors mention that presenting diverse + all voting rules is computationally expensive, further clarification on the computational cost is needed. Additionally, it would strengthen the paper if the authors could explore potential solutions or optimizations to address this limitation.
3. Applicability to Go: The state dependencies in Go mean that the states are not i.i.d., which makes the main results of this paper less directly applicable to the Go domain. This limitation should be addressed or clarified.
Minor comments:
1. Please specify the domain of phi in the Mallows model.
2. Add a separate bullet point for the Plackett-Luce model.
3. The notation "k" is used to indicate positions. Consider using a different symbol for the copy number in uniform voting to avoid confusion.
Overall, this paper is well-written, and the results are compelling. However, the authors need to clearly articulate their technical contributions in relation to closely related prior work.
