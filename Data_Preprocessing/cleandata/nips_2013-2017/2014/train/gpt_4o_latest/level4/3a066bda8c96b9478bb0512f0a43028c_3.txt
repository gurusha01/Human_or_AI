Review - Summary:  
The authors propose a method for semantic labeling and object detection. Semantic labeling is achieved by generating candidate segments, extracting features from them, and regressing on the Intersection-over-Union overlap ratio between a candidate segment and pixel-accurate ground truth. For object detection, where only bounding box annotations are available, the precise spatial extent is treated as a latent variable. Regression is carried out using a weighted SVM and a weighted transductive SVM, respectively. The results are competitive with the state of the art for semantic labeling and represent the best performance currently reported for object detection on VOC 2007.
Originality:  
The paper offers limited algorithmic innovation and fails to cite key prior work. Specifically, the weighted SVM is a well-established approach (e.g., [R1, R2, R4], none of which are cited). The authors introduce a sum constraint on the weights, which could be novel, though this has not been thoroughly verified. The "latent e-SVM" proposed by the authors is essentially a weighted version of a transductive SVM (e.g., [R3], also not cited).

Significance:  
Achieving results that surpass recent CNN-based approaches using a "conventional" learning method is a noteworthy accomplishment and of significant interest to the research community.  
Quality:  
The paper omits critical references to prior work (as noted above). While the object detection framework involves a substantial amount of engineering, it remains within the norm for this field. Regularized logistic regression is the standard method for regression on the unit interval, and the authors should report results using this baseline to justify their use of a sum-constrained weighted SVM. Additionally, more details are needed regarding the selection of regularization coefficients \(\lambdaW\) and \(\lambdaR\). The paper's primary strength lies in its strong empirical results.  
Clarity:  
The title and abstract do not effectively convey the paper's main contributions. Furthermore, the abstract incorrectly implies that regression targets from the unit interval are less informative than binary class memberships, which is misleading since binary labels can always be derived from regression outputs via thresholding. For an audience such as NIPS, the paper devotes excessive space (up to and including page 4) to minor variations of well-known algorithms, while providing insufficient detail on the critical feature engineering aspects (lines 254 and onward).  
Minor Comments:  
- Line 19: "continues" → "continuous"  
- Line 94: "boxes" → "box"  
- Line 98: AP: Abbreviation not introduced  
- Line 350: "SVM" → "SVC"  
- Line 350: "with every different values" → "for all threshold values"  
-----
I have increased my quality score by one, assuming the authors will address the lack of citations to prior work and provide extensive commentary on their connections to it. While the paper demonstrates impressive results, it suffers from insufficient references, limited algorithmic novelty, and some clarity issues. Nonetheless, it is a strong candidate for publication, potentially after revisions, and may be better suited for a computer vision conference.
