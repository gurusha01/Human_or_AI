The paper presents a convolutional network with feedback connections designed to learn visual attention, where the feedback mechanism operates by gating the activation of specific filters. The model is trained using reinforcement learning on top of a convolutional network. While the individual components are not particularly novel, the overall approach is, in my view, an excellent and promising direction. This is further validated by achieving state-of-the-art results on CIFAR, which is significant in demonstrating that feedback and attention mechanisms are indeed a promising path forward. The quality and clarity of the work are strong. Overall, this is a well-executed approach to vision, yielding impressive results by integrating reinforcement learning-driven feedback attention into convnets. If feasible, the authors should consider extending their work to larger-scale datasets like ImageNet to further validate their findings.
