The authors introduce a conductance-based spiking model (CBSM) that offers a more biophysically realistic alternative to the widely used generalized linear model (GLM). Additionally, they present CBSM as a generalization of the GLM, outlining a set of constraints that can simplify CBSM into a GLM or a GLM variant with adaptive properties comparable to CBSM.
This model represents an intriguing extension to existing spiking models, as it provides a more descriptive parameterization of the spiking process while largely retaining the mathematical tractability of the GLM. 
However, a potential concern arises from the discussion in the last paragraph of page 6. Specifically, the behavior of the inhibitory filter mentioned in line 322 appears to resemble overfitting. The authors address this issue by incorporating the regularization penalty described in Eq. 22. Nevertheless, it seems that cross-validation is not employed in the experimental results, which would have demonstrated the model's applicability in more realistic settings.
Minor corrections to consider:
- Line 121: Should the fourth subscript be "i"?  
- Line 214: Should this read "chose our an"?  
Overall, this is a high-quality paper that makes a significant contribution to the state of the art. I would, however, recommend including additional experiments to further strengthen the work.
