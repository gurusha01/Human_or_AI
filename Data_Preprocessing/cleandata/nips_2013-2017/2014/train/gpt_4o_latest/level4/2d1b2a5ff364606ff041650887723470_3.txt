The paper introduces an additive factorial hidden Markov model (AFHMM) with signal aggregate constraints (SAC) to address the blind source separation problem. The authors formulate a convex quadratic optimization problem for a relaxed version of AFHMM with SAC. The proposed method demonstrates promising performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets.
Pros:
- The paper is well-written and grounded in strong mathematical principles.
- The problem is well-motivated.
- The evaluation results show significant improvements in performance metrics, specifically NDE and SAE.
Areas of improvement:
- The results are presented as improvements over AFHMM without SAC and AFAMAP. However, both of these methods utilize less data compared to SACAFHMM, which raises concerns about the fairness of the comparison. Are there alternative approaches that could leverage SAC but are less computationally efficient?
- The results in Figure 1 lack clarity. For instance, it appears that for distances greater than \(10^4\), AFAMAP outperforms SACAFHMM. Does this suggest that poorly chosen constraints can lead to significantly worse performance? The discussion implies that the results are consistently better, which could be misleading.
- The algorithm seems to focus on a specific type of constraint. It would be interesting to see more complex constraints incorporated. For example, constraints such as a person not using both a heater and a cooler simultaneously, limiting the number of active bulbs in a house to no more than 3 out of 10, or ensuring that grinders operate for less than 10 minutes. These represent a variety of possible constraints. Can the algorithm be extended to accommodate such diverse constraints? The paper is well-structured and provides strong motivation for the problem. Future work could explore extending the model to handle a broader range of constraints.
