This paper tackles the issue of high sparsity in user-item ratings within recommendation systems when employing matrix factorization techniques. It highlights the disparity between users with a large number of ratings (referred to as public users) and those with very few ratings (referred to as private users). The latter group often has limited ratings due to privacy concerns.
Initially, the authors presented theoretical guarantees demonstrating that recommendation systems can achieve reasonably good performance even when only a small subset of public users is available. Subsequently, they proposed privacy-preserving mechanisms for both discrete and continuous rating values, aimed at leveraging private users to enhance models initially trained on public users' ratings. These mechanisms incorporate private users while preserving the second-order statistics of their ratings.
Lastly, the authors evaluated the proposed privacy-preserving mechanisms using the MovieLens 10M dataset. The experimental results validated the theoretical guarantees and showed performance improvements by incorporating private users into the model.
The paper is well-written, with its novelty stemming from the theoretical performance guarantees and the design of the privacy-preserving mechanisms. While the experiments are somewhat limited, the paper presents innovative ideas supported by both theoretical proofs and experimental validation.
