This paper introduces a method for modeling object categories, supercategories, and attributes within a unified shared space. This is achieved through the use of a suitably annotated dataset: Animals with Attributes (AWA). The primary motivation lies in leveraging the relationships between category-supercategory and category-attribute to provide generative regularization for otherwise category-only discriminative learning.
[strength] The introduction and related work sections are well written and provide a strong motivation for the study. I suggest incorporating a brief discussion of recent deep learning methods in the "sparse coding" subsection.
[suggestion] Figure 1 could make better use of the available space by placing the text to the right of the figure.
[strength] The methodology is presented in a clear, step-by-step manner, with precise mathematical notation, an appropriate level of detail, and sufficient explanation of the numerical implementation.
[strength] The evaluation is thorough, comparing the proposed method against a reasonable set of baselines and employing two different feature types to demonstrate that the approach is not overly dependent on a specific feature space. While it is unfortunate that only the AWA dataset is used, this may be due to the lack of alternative datasets suitable for such a complex task.
[weakness] There is limited discussion of the computational aspects of the proposed method. The optimization process appears challenging, and additional details on training and testing runtimes would be valuable. While the unified semantic embedding model is well motivated, systematically formulated, and effectively evaluated—showing superior performance on a single super-labeled dataset—the paper would benefit from a deeper discussion of computational considerations.
