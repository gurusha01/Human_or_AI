The authors propose a novel approach to learning to rank. Unlike traditional methods, their approach emphasizes the number of positive instances ranked ahead of the first negative instance. By adopting a large-margin framework, the method yields both primal and dual representations. In comparison to similar techniques, the computational complexity remains linear with respect to the number of instances.
This is a well-executed paper, with a particularly strong technical contribution.
However, aside from the URL dataset, the experiments are conducted on relatively small-scale datasets. Incorporating experiments on larger-scale datasets would significantly enhance the paper, as baseline methods are likely to fail at higher scales. It would be beneficial to include a figure illustrating performance as a function of the number of training instances to highlight the advantage of handling larger datasets compared to the baselines. A similar figure plotting time versus performance would also provide valuable insights.
The divide-and-conquer schema should be at least briefly outlined in the final version of the paper.  
Overall, this is a strong technical contribution and a solid paper.
