The authors extend the Stochastic Variational Inference (SVI) framework of Hoffman, Blei, Wang, and Paisley (2013) to Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). Unlike prior applications of SVI that use minibatches of complete data items, SVIHMM introduces the novel idea of using minibatches composed of subsequences. This approach is intriguing, as it leverages external observations to initialize the messages on either side of the subsequences. The authors also propose a heuristic for determining the number of observations to include on each side of a subsequence. It is somewhat unexpected that this approach is effective, given the potential for long-term dependencies in the messages. A few questions arise: Does the GrowBuf algorithm terminate immediately if \( S^{\text{new}} = S^{\text{old}} \)? Additionally, is there a connection between the optimal value of \( \tau \) and the second-largest eigenvalue of matrix \( A \)?
Unfortunately, the quality of the paper is lacking in several areas. Key figures and tables from the experiments are missing (e.g., Table 4 referenced on line 355 and the timing experiments). The introduction and literature review are overly lengthy, with the core material of the paper not introduced until page 4. As a result, too much critical content is relegated to the supplementary material. For instance, GrowBuf, which appears central to the paper's methodology, is only described in the supplement.
The reported False Discovery Rate (FDR) results are also difficult to interpret. For example, the Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) achieves an FDR of 0.999038, while SVIHMM yields 0.999026â€”a marginal difference that seems negligible. Perhaps SVIHMM offers a speed advantage over DBN, but no timing results are provided to support this claim. Additionally, it is unclear how much noise is present in the FDR estimates.
Overall, this work represents a relatively straightforward adaptation of SVI to HMMs, incorporating a heuristic for training on subsequences. However, the presentation is incomplete and leaves several important aspects unexplored.
