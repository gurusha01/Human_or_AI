The paper focuses on accelerating optimization for the graphical model MAP problem. The authors propose a coarse-to-fine approach and provide clear motivation for their work. Their method combines label pruning for each variable with sequential optimization of the pruned but increasingly refined problem.
To the best of my understanding, the work appears to be both original and correct. However, one aspect that I believe was not explicitly addressed is whether the proposed method can be applied to graph structures lacking apparent regularity (as opposed to grid graphs typically derived from images).
Another intriguing question I have is whether this approach could potentially be incorporated into a learning procedure.
Given my limited familiarity with the related literature, it is challenging for me to fully assess the significance of this contribution. Nonetheless, the paper introduces a coarse-to-fine approach to accelerate MAP inference, and the method appears both interesting and well-founded. Furthermore, the experimental results provided are supportive of the proposed approach.
