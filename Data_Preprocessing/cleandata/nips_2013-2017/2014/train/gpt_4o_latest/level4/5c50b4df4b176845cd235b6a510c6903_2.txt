The paper formulates the problem of designing voting rules (determining an order over a set of alternatives) for multiple agents as a decision-making process that minimizes the expected loss with respect to the posterior distribution over parameters, i.e., Bayesian risk.
Based on my evaluation, the results are technically correct, novel, and engaging.
My sole comment or concern is that the paper primarily focuses on the normative properties and asymptotic behavior (as the number of voters becomes large) of the Bayesian estimators. However, the NIPS audience generally shows greater interest in learning dynamics. While I consider the results to be of high quality, I am uncertain whether NIPS is the most suitable venue for this work. The paper's formulation of the problem and its exploration of normative and asymptotic results are both innovative and compelling.
