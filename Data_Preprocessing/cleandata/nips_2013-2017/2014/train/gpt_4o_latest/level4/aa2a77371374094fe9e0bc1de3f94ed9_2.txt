The paper presents a multivariate spatio-temporal analysis leveraging cokriging and forecasting techniques. The methodology is grounded in the low-rank tensor learning framework, with an efficient greedy learning algorithm employed. Results are demonstrated on both synthetic and real-world datasets. I have only a couple of minor comments: 1) There is a typo on page 2, between Section 2 and Subsection 2.1: "of patio-temporal." 2) I suggest replacing "s.t." with "subject to" in formulas 5 and 6 for improved clarity.
