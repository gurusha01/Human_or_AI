Summary: This excellent paper introduces a rational model for algorithm selection grounded in problem features and Bayesian regression. The proposed model demonstrates computational efficiency and surpasses comparable models in predicting human performance.
This paper exemplifies the qualities of a strong NIPS submission. It is well-written, tackles an engaging problem, and combines a compelling computational result with a cognitive model validated through a concise experiment.
My primary concern is that the paper overemphasizes the rational aspect of the approach. Much of its success—both computationally and as a cognitive model—stems from the decomposition of the problem space into features rather than the rational inference itself. It would strengthen the paper to compare this approach against an RL model with function approximation, rather than the relatively simple RL model currently used.
Minor comments:
- The font size in Fig. 1 is too small.
- Line 38: Replace "by specialized algorithms" with "by a specialized algorithm."
- Equations 11-12 are somewhat difficult to follow and do not appear straightforward.
- One of the paper's standout strengths is the rigorous comparison with other algorithms, which is not commonly seen and deserves recognition.
