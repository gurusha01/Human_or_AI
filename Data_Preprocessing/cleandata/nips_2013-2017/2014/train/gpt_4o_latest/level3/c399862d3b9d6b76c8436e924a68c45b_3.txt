The paper introduces a novel algorithm for Bandit Convex Optimization (BCO) under the setting of strongly-convex and smooth loss functions, achieving a significant improvement in regret bounds. Specifically, the proposed algorithm employs a time-shrinking exploration scheme, enabling it to achieve a regret of \(\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})\), which matches the best-known lower bound up to logarithmic factors. This result improves upon the previous upper bound of \(\tilde{O}(T^{2/3})\), aligning the achievable regret with the theoretical lower bound established by Shamir (2013). The algorithm leverages self-concordant barriers and a shrinking exploration mechanism, which are central to its performance.
Strengths:  
The paper makes a significant theoretical contribution to the field of online learning and optimization by closing the gap between the upper and lower bounds for regret in the specific setting of strongly-convex and smooth losses. This advancement is likely to influence future research in bandit optimization and related areas. The use of time-shrinking exploration is novel and well-motivated, and the theoretical analysis appears sound, with detailed proofs provided. The algorithm is efficient and practical, making it a valuable addition to the BCO literature.
Weaknesses:  
The paper suffers from several clarity and presentation issues that hinder its accessibility. First, the distinction between prior work and the novel contributions of this paper is not clearly delineated, making it challenging to assess the originality of the results. For example, Lemma 9 and the symbol \(\delta\) in Equation (4) are not adequately defined, leaving gaps in the technical exposition. Additionally, Algorithm 2 is unnecessarily convoluted, with redundant loops and unclear inputs, which detracts from its readability. The paper also devotes excessive space to reviewing existing results, delaying the introduction of its main contributions until later sections. This imbalance in content organization reduces the overall impact of the paper.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:  
Pros:  
1. The paper achieves a significant theoretical milestone by improving the regret bound for BCO with strongly-convex and smooth losses.  
2. The proposed algorithm is efficient and introduces a novel time-shrinking exploration scheme.  
3. The results are well-supported by rigorous theoretical analysis.  
Cons:  
1. The paper is poorly written, with unclear definitions, excessive background material, and disorganized presentation.  
2. Some technical aspects, such as the role of certain symbols and lemmas, are not adequately explained.  
3. Algorithm 2 requires rewriting for clarity and conciseness.  
Overall Assessment:  
While the paper makes a significant theoretical contribution to the field, its poor writing and lack of clarity detract from its accessibility and impact. A thorough revision is necessary to improve the organization, clarify the technical details, and streamline the presentation of the algorithms. Given the importance of the results, I recommend marginal acceptance, contingent on the authors addressing these issues in a revised version.
