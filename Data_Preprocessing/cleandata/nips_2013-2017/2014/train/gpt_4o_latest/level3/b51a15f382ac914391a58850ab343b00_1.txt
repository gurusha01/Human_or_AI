The paper proposes a Generalized Unsupervised Manifold Alignment (GUMA) method to align manifold structures across datasets without pre-specified correspondences. The authors integrate three objective functions—geometry matching, feature matching, and geometry preserving—into a unified optimization framework. The optimization alternates between estimating correspondences and projection matrices, leveraging an extended Frank-Wolfe algorithm for efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate the method's effectiveness in tasks like dataset matching, video-based face verification, and visual domain adaptation.
Strengths:  
The paper addresses a challenging and relevant problem in unsupervised manifold alignment. The proposed method is well-motivated, combining global structure matching and feature alignment to improve performance over existing methods. The iterative optimization strategy is computationally efficient, avoiding the combinatorial explosion of direct permutation-based approaches. Experimental results are thorough, covering diverse applications such as face pose alignment, protein sequence matching, and domain adaptation, which showcase the method's versatility. The quantitative comparisons with state-of-the-art methods highlight the proposed method's superior performance in most cases. Additionally, the paper is well-organized and provides sufficient technical details, including algorithmic steps, to enable reproducibility.
Weaknesses:  
The novelty of the method is somewhat limited, as it primarily combines existing frameworks like kernelized sorting, least square object matching, and CCA-based approaches. The geometry preserving term is identical to those used in prior unsupervised manifold alignment methods, and the geometry matching term is closely related to convex kernelized sorting. While the authors acknowledge these connections, a deeper discussion of how their approach fundamentally advances beyond these methods would strengthen the contribution. Furthermore, the unsupervised nature of the method is questioned in the face pose experiments, as supervised manifold alignment methods might also solve the task. Clarification on why unsupervised alignment is critical in these scenarios would be beneficial. Lastly, while the optimization is efficient, the reliance on integer constraints could limit scalability to very large datasets.
