This paper investigates the problem of low-rank approximation in the streaming model, where rows of a matrix are presented sequentially. The authors address a fundamental question: whether the space complexity of \(O(dk/\epsilon)\) achieved by prior work (Liberty, 2013; Ghashami and Phillips, 2014) is optimal. The paper proves a matching lower bound of \(\Omega(dk/\epsilon)\), demonstrating that no algorithm, even randomized ones with constant success probability, can achieve better space complexity. This result resolves an open question and establishes the space complexity for this problem as \(\Theta(dk/\epsilon)\). The proof leverages communication complexity techniques, specifically the Index problem, and introduces novel reductions tailored to the row-update streaming model.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Significance: The paper addresses a long-standing open question in the field of streaming algorithms, providing a definitive answer. The result has significant implications for both theoretical understanding and practical applications of low-rank approximation in resource-constrained environments.
2. Technical Rigor: The proof of the main theorem is detailed and appears to be correct. The authors carefully construct reductions from the Index problem and navigate technical challenges unique to the row-update model. The use of communication complexity is well-motivated and elegant.
3. Clarity of Writing: The paper is well-written and organized. The introduction provides a clear overview of the problem, prior work, and the paper's contributions. The technical sections are dense but sufficiently detailed for an expert audience to follow.
4. Relevance: Low-rank approximation is a fundamental problem in numerical linear algebra and machine learning. The results are likely to influence future work in streaming algorithms and related areas.
Weaknesses:
1. Limited Novelty for Experts: While the result is novel and impactful, experts in streaming algorithms may find the techniques somewhat incremental, as they build on well-established tools like the Index problem and prior lower bounds in related models.
2. Accessibility: The technical depth and reliance on advanced concepts in communication complexity may make the paper less accessible to a broader audience, including practitioners who may benefit from the results.
3. Experimental Validation: The paper is purely theoretical. While this is appropriate for the scope, a discussion of practical implications or experimental results demonstrating the tightness of the bounds in real-world scenarios would have strengthened the work.
Recommendation:
The paper makes a significant theoretical contribution by resolving an open question and establishing optimal space bounds for low-rank approximation in the streaming model. Despite its limited accessibility and incremental nature for experts, the result is important and advances the state of the art. I recommend acceptance.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Resolves a fundamental open question with a tight lower bound.
- Builds on and extends prior work in a meaningful way.
- Technically sound and well-written.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Limited novelty for experts familiar with the area.
- Lack of experimental or practical validation.
Overall, the paper is a valuable contribution to the field and merits inclusion in the conference.
