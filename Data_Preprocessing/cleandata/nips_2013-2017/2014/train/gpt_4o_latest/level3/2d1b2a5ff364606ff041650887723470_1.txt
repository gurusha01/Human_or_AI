The paper presents a novel approach to blind source separation (BSS) through the integration of Signal Aggregate Constraints (SACs) into Additive Factorial Hidden Markov Models (AFHMM). This method, termed AFHMM+SAC, leverages domain knowledge to improve the separation of time series data, with a focus on energy disaggregation as a case study. By transforming the objective function into a convex quadratic program, the authors address the computational challenges posed by SACs, achieving efficient and effective optimization. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in disaggregation performance over baseline AFHMM and the state-of-the-art AFAMAP, with comparable computational efficiency.
Strengths
1. Novelty and Originality: The introduction of SACs into the AFHMM framework is a novel contribution to the BSS domain. The paper effectively demonstrates how domain-specific constraints can address the identifiability problem inherent in BSS tasks.
2. Technical Soundness: The transformation of the optimization problem into a convex quadratic program is well-motivated and rigorously derived. The connection to posterior regularization further solidifies the theoretical foundation.
3. Results and Impact: The method achieves a 45% reduction in normalized disaggregation error compared to AFHMM and a 29% improvement over AFAMAP on real-world energy data. These results highlight the practical significance of the proposed approach.
4. Clarity and Writing: The paper is well-written, with a clear introduction, thorough literature review, and detailed experimental evaluation. The inclusion of both toy and real-world datasets strengthens the empirical validation.
5. Reproducibility: The detailed mathematical formulation and use of standard tools like CVX for solving convex programs enhance reproducibility.
Weaknesses
1. Convexity Proof: While the authors claim the objective function is convex, a formal proof of convexity for equation (6) is missing. This omission weakens the theoretical rigor of the paper.
2. Scalability: The paper does not provide sufficient discussion on the scalability of the method to larger datasets or higher-dimensional problems. This is critical for real-world applications beyond the energy disaggregation domain.
3. Noise Assumptions: The toy example uses a low noise variance (σ² = 0.01), which may not reflect realistic conditions. Clarifications on signal-to-noise ratios in real-world data would strengthen the evaluation.
4. Notation Inconsistencies: Minor inconsistencies in notation (e.g., between equations and text) could confuse readers and should be addressed in a revision.
5. Community Impact: While the method appears novel, its broader significance to the HMM and BSS communities is unclear. A deeper discussion on potential applications beyond energy disaggregation would enhance the paper's appeal.
Arguments for Acceptance
- The paper addresses a challenging and relevant problem in BSS with a novel and theoretically grounded approach.
- The empirical results demonstrate clear improvements over existing methods, with practical implications for energy disaggregation.
- The writing and organization are strong, making the paper accessible to a broad audience.
Arguments Against Acceptance
- The lack of a formal convexity proof and limited discussion on scalability are notable gaps.
- The evaluation could benefit from more realistic noise scenarios and broader application domains.
Recommendation
Overall, this paper represents a strong contribution to the field of BSS and energy disaggregation. While there are areas for improvement, particularly in theoretical rigor and scalability, the novelty and practical impact of the proposed method justify acceptance. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the noted weaknesses.
