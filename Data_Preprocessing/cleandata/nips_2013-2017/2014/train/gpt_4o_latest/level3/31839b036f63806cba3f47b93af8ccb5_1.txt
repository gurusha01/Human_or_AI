This paper addresses the challenging problem of identifiability in the presence of missing data mechanisms, extending the framework of Missingness Graphs (m-graphs) introduced by Mohan et al. [2013]. It provides new graphical conditions for recovering probabilistic queries such as \(P(y|x)\) and \(P(y, x)\), as well as causal queries like \(P(y|do(x))\). A key contribution is demonstrating that causal queries can be recoverable even when their identifying estimands are not, which is particularly relevant for handling data corrupted by attrition. The paper's results are well-motivated and address an important problem in causal inference and statistical modeling.
Strengths:
1. Technical Quality: The paper is technically rigorous, with clear theoretical contributions such as Theorem 3, which introduces non-recoverability criteria for joint and conditional distributions. Sections 5 and 6 are particularly strong, offering significant insights into the recovery of causal queries and their practical implications for attrition problems.
2. Originality: The extension of Mohan's framework to handle more complex missing data scenarios, such as interactions between missingness mechanisms, is novel. The results on recovering \(P(y|do(x))\) even when \(Y\) and its missingness mechanism are not d-separable are especially impactful.
3. Significance: The work advances the state of the art in handling missing data, providing tools that could be valuable for researchers in fields like epidemiology, social science, and machine learning. The graphical conditions for both recoverability and non-recoverability are practical and theoretically grounded.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity: The paper is dense and challenging to follow, with notation that is overly complex and inconsistently introduced (e.g., premature use of terms like \(Vo\) and \(Vm\)). Theorem 1 in Section 3 is particularly difficult to comprehend and feels tangential to the main narrative, lacking clear connections to the rest of the paper.
2. Incremental Results: While the paper provides valuable extensions, some results (e.g., Theorem 2 and Corollary 1) resemble existing techniques like inverse probability weighting and could benefit from a clearer contextualization within the broader literature.
3. Presentation Issues: Key terms and notations, such as severed-edge graphs, are undefined, and casual language (e.g., "oftentimes") detracts from the paper's professionalism. Specific errors, such as the misuse of "a set containing partitions" on p4 l214 and inconsistent notation (e.g., \(<-->\) instead of \(\leftrightarrow\)), need correction.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper addresses an important and underexplored problem, making significant theoretical contributions.
- The results on causal query recoverability are novel and impactful, with potential applications in real-world scenarios like attrition.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The paper's dense presentation and poor clarity make it difficult to follow, potentially limiting its accessibility to a broader audience.
- Some results feel incremental, and the lack of a general criterion for identifiability reduces the paper's practical utility.
Recommendation:
While the paper is technically strong and addresses an important problem, its clarity and presentation issues make it better suited for a journal format, where space constraints are less restrictive. I recommend acceptance conditional on revisions to improve clarity, streamline notation, and address presentation issues.
