The paper presents a novel approach to robust low-rank matrix recovery by integrating Low Rank Representation (LRR) with a learned dictionary, addressing limitations of the widely used Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA). The authors identify a key weakness of RPCA: its reliance on the incoherence parameter \(\mu\), which degrades performance when data exhibit clustering structures. By leveraging LRR with a low-rank dictionary, the proposed method reduces dependence on \(\mu\), providing stronger theoretical guarantees for low-rank and sparse decomposition, even in noisy scenarios. This work generalizes prior subspace clustering assumptions, making it applicable to a broader range of data.
The paper's contributions are significant. First, it introduces a principled method to handle coherent data by learning dictionaries that exploit clustering structures. Second, it extends the theoretical understanding of coherence parameters, demonstrating how LRR can bypass the limitations of RPCA. Third, the authors propose a practical algorithm that combines RPCA and LRR, showing superior performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets, such as the Hopkins155 motion segmentation benchmark. Notably, the method outperforms RPCA+SSC in subspace clustering tasks, reducing clustering error rates by 40% in some cases.
The strengths of the paper lie in its theoretical rigor and practical impact. The authors provide clear mathematical proofs supporting their claims and validate their approach through extensive experiments. The results demonstrate meaningful improvements over baseline methods, particularly in handling coherent data and sparse corruptions. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm is computationally efficient, requiring only 1.2 times the runtime of RPCA.
However, the paper has some weaknesses. While the theoretical contributions are robust, certain sections, such as lines 80-82 and 88, lack clarity and could benefit from rephrasing. Additionally, the writing occasionally assumes familiarity with advanced concepts, which may hinder accessibility for a broader audience. A comparison with noisy subspace clustering followed by PCA would also strengthen the experimental evaluation, even if theoretical guarantees for the latter are unavailable.
In summary, this paper makes a substantial contribution to the fields of compressed sensing and subspace clustering. Its novel integration of LRR with learned dictionaries addresses a critical limitation of RPCA, advancing the state of the art in low-rank matrix recovery. While minor improvements in clarity and additional comparisons would enhance the work, the paper is well-suited for acceptance at NIPS.
