This paper introduces a novel framework for regularization based on group-induced majorization, leveraging the concept of orbitopes to constrain model parameters. The authors demonstrate how this framework subsumes several well-known regularizers, such as L1, L2, and nuclear norms, while also introducing new ones, such as the permutahedron and signed permutahedron. A key contribution is the connection established between the signed-permutation orbitope and the recently proposed sorted L1-norm. The paper also provides algorithmic insights, showing how conditional and projected gradient methods can be adapted to this framework, and proposes a continuation algorithm for orbit exploration.
Strengths:
1. Novelty: The reinterpretation of regularization through group actions and orbitopes is a fresh perspective. The connection between the signed-permutation orbitope and the sorted L1-norm is particularly intriguing and could inspire further research.
2. Theoretical Contributions: The paper rigorously establishes several properties of the proposed framework, including the pre-order relationship between vectors, the interpretation of convex sets as atomic norm balls, and dual norm relationships.
3. Algorithmic Insights: The adaptation of conditional and projected gradient methods to this framework is well-motivated, and the continuation algorithm provides a heuristic for exploring regularization paths.
4. Clarity of Mathematical Framework: The paper is mathematically rigorous, with clear definitions and proofs for key propositions (e.g., Proposition 3 on atomic norms and Proposition 10 on dual norms).
Weaknesses:
1. Numerical Results: The experimental section is underwhelming. The continuation algorithm's performance is inconclusive, with limited examples and no significant improvement over traditional regularizers. This weakens the practical impact of the proposed method.
2. Algorithmic Guarantees: While the continuation algorithm is novel, it lacks theoretical guarantees or a clear explanation of why it stops when regularization has no effect. This heuristic nature limits its reliability.
3. Clarity Issues: The paper suffers from minor clarity issues, such as missing parentheses, unclear subscripts, and blurred images. Figures also lack proper axis scales, which hinders understanding.
4. Propositions Needing Elaboration: Proposition 10 would benefit from a pictorial explanation to clarify the dual transformation of the norm. Similarly, Proposition 3 requires a more detailed discussion on when atomic norms can be interpreted as orbit regularizers.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper introduces a novel and theoretically sound framework with potential for significant impact in structured regularization.
- The reinterpretation of regularization through group actions is a valuable conceptual contribution.
- The connection to sorted L1-norms and the exploration of orbitopes are innovative.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The experimental results are insufficient to demonstrate the practical utility of the proposed methods.
- The continuation algorithm lacks guarantees and requires further clarification.
- Minor clarity and presentation issues detract from the overall readability.
Recommendation:
This paper makes a strong theoretical contribution and introduces novel ideas that could inspire future research. However, its practical impact is limited by weak experimental results and the heuristic nature of the continuation algorithm. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions, contingent on improving the clarity of the figures and elaborating on the experimental results and algorithmic guarantees.
