The paper presents a novel generative model for images that incorporates an attentional mechanism to focus on objects of interest, rather than processing the entire image. This approach is inspired by visual neuroscience and aims to address challenges in generative modeling for high-resolution, cluttered images. The model uses Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) to infer latent variables representing objects and their poses, and demonstrates strong performance on the Caltech and CMU-PIE face datasets. By dynamically routing relevant information to a canonical representation, the model effectively learns generative representations of faces without requiring labeled data. This is a significant contribution to the field, as it bridges the gap between generative modeling and attention mechanisms, areas that have been relatively underexplored in recent literature.
Strengths:
1. Innovative Use of Attention: The attentional mechanism is a major highlight of the paper, representing a meaningful advancement in generative modeling. By focusing on objects of interest, the model avoids the computational inefficiencies and noise associated with processing entire images.
2. Robust Inference: The combination of HMC and a convolutional neural network (ConvNet) for approximate inference is well-justified and effectively addresses the intractability of the posterior distribution. The experiments demonstrate that this hybrid approach yields robust results, even in challenging scenarios with occlusions and cluttered backgrounds.
3. Generative Learning Without Labels: The ability to learn generative models from unlabeled data is a significant achievement, as it reduces reliance on expensive and time-consuming manual annotations.
4. Empirical Validation: The strong performance on the Caltech and CMU-PIE datasets, including the ability to generalize to unseen subjects and diverse backgrounds, underscores the model's practical utility.
Weaknesses:
1. Limited Transformation Models: The paper primarily focuses on affine transformations (scaling, rotation, and translation). Extending the model to learn richer, non-linear transformations could enhance its applicability to more complex scenarios.
2. Occlusion Handling: While the model performs well in cluttered scenes, the paper does not explicitly address how it handles severe occlusions, which are common in real-world settings. This is an area that could benefit from further exploration.
3. Supervised Pretraining of ConvNet: The reliance on supervised pretraining for the ConvNet limits the model's fully unsupervised potential. Exploring reinforcement learning or other unsupervised methods for this component could make the approach more generalizable.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:
Pro: The paper introduces a novel and impactful approach to generative modeling, leveraging attention in a way that is both biologically inspired and computationally effective. The results are compelling, and the methodology is well-grounded in theory and prior work.
Con: The model's reliance on affine transformations and supervised pretraining are limitations that could restrict its applicability to more complex or fully unsupervised tasks. Additionally, the handling of occlusions remains underexplored.
Recommendation:
Overall, this paper makes a strong scientific contribution by advancing the state of the art in generative modeling with attention mechanisms. Despite some areas for improvement, the proposed framework is innovative, well-executed, and likely to generate significant interest at NIPS. I recommend acceptance, with the suggestion that future work address richer transformation models and occlusion challenges.
