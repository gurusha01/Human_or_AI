The paper addresses the problem of learning a tensor for linear multi-task learning (MLMTL) by introducing a novel scaled latent trace norm, which improves upon existing tensor norms like the overlapped trace norm and the latent trace norm. The authors argue that existing norms are suboptimal in scenarios with heterogeneous dimensions or multilinear ranks, a common occurrence in MLMTL. By rescaling the latent trace norm with weights proportional to the inverse square root of the dimensions, the proposed method achieves better excess risk bounds and recovery performance, as supported by both theoretical analysis and empirical results.
The paper is well-written, clearly organized, and provides a thorough theoretical foundation. The authors rigorously analyze the Rademacher complexities of the proposed norm and compare its performance with existing norms in various settings, including matrix completion, multitask learning, and tensor completion. The technical results are sound and correctly proven, with sufficient coverage of prior literature, including connections to the tensor penalties studied by Argyriou and Dinuzzo (ICML 2014). The scaled latent trace norm is shown to adapt to heterogeneous dimensions and ranks, addressing a significant limitation of prior approaches. This is a notable contribution to the field, as it advances the state of the art in tensor-based multitask learning.
The empirical evaluation demonstrates the practical significance of the proposed method. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, such as the Restaurant and School datasets, highlight the advantages of the scaled latent trace norm, particularly in heterogeneous settings. However, the experimental section could benefit from more extensive evaluations, including additional datasets and comparisons with alternative state-of-the-art methods. This would strengthen the empirical claims and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the method's robustness.
Strengths of the paper include its theoretical rigor, clarity of presentation, and the practical significance of the proposed norm. The connection to broader tensor penalties and the demonstration of both theoretical and empirical advantages are commendable. Weaknesses include the relatively limited scope of experiments and the lack of exploration of potential limitations or failure cases of the proposed method.
Arguments for acceptance:
1. The paper addresses an important problem in MLMTL and proposes a novel, theoretically grounded solution.
2. The scaled latent trace norm is shown to outperform existing norms in heterogeneous settings, both theoretically and empirically.
3. The paper is well-written, with clear exposition and rigorous proofs.
Arguments against acceptance:
1. The experimental evaluation is limited and could be expanded to include more datasets and baselines.
2. The paper does not explore potential limitations or scenarios where the proposed method might underperform.
In conclusion, this paper makes a significant contribution to tensor-based multitask learning and is recommended for acceptance, provided the authors address the need for more extensive empirical validation in future work.
