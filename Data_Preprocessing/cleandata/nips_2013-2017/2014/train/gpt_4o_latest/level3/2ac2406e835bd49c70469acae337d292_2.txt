This paper introduces a spectral algorithm for learning a Mixture of Hidden Markov Models (MHMM), leveraging the Method of Moments (MoM) to address computational challenges associated with Expectation-Maximization (EM). The authors formulate MHMM as a special case of HMM with a block-diagonal transition matrix, enabling the use of spectral learning techniques. A stabilization-based solution is proposed to resolve parameter permutation issues, assuming that each HMM's transition matrix has a single eigenvalue of 1. The paper demonstrates the algorithm's validity on synthetic and real datasets, highlighting its computational efficiency compared to EM.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Intuition: The proposed stabilization scheme for resolving parameter permutation is both innovative and intuitive. The use of spectral properties, particularly eigenvalues, to estimate de-permutation mappings is a notable contribution.
2. Computational Efficiency: The MoM-based approach offers significant computational advantages over EM, making it suitable for large datasets.
3. Clarity of Spectral Analysis: The analysis of eigenvalues and their role in the algorithm is intriguing, particularly the derivation of Corollary 1 and the spectral longevity metric (Equation 7).
4. Real-World Applicability: The real data experiment on the UCI handwritten character dataset demonstrates the algorithm's potential as a practical initialization scheme for EM.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity and Notation: The paper suffers from unclear notation. Vectors and matrices are not consistently defined with dimensions when first introduced, making the mathematical exposition harder to follow. Adopting established notation (e.g., Hsu et al., 2009) could improve readability.
2. Related Work: The paper lacks sufficient references to prior work, particularly on initializing EM with spectral estimates (e.g., Chaganty and Liang, 2013). This omission weakens the contextualization of the contribution.
3. Experimental Results: The experiments are basic and lack depth. Graphical results, such as Figure 4, are difficult to interpret and should be replaced with tables for clarity. Additionally, the surprising poor performance of EM in Table 1 raises questions about whether the best accuracy of EM was reported.
4. Explanation of Corollary 1: Corollary 1 requires better explanation, particularly the structure of \( \lim_{e \to \infty} \bar{A}^e \) and the definition of \( 1J^T \), which are critical to understanding the stabilization scheme.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:
Pro:
- The algorithm addresses a computationally challenging problem with a novel and efficient approach.
- The stabilization scheme and spectral analysis are theoretically interesting and could inspire future research.
- The method has practical utility as an initialization scheme for EM.
Con:
- The paper's clarity and organization need improvement, particularly in notation and explanation of key results.
- Insufficient experimental depth and lack of rigorous comparison to prior work limit the paper's impact.
- Missing references to related work reduce the originality claim.
Recommendation:
While the paper presents an interesting and potentially impactful contribution, the weaknesses in clarity, experimental rigor, and related work contextualization cannot be overlooked. I recommend weak acceptance, contingent on addressing the clarity issues and improving the experimental section in a revision.
