This paper presents a novel framework for discovering efficient mathematical identities by leveraging machine learning techniques. Specifically, it introduces an attribute grammar for representing symbolic expressions and proposes two methods for guiding the search for simpler symbolic expression trees: an n-gram model and a recursive neural network (RNN). The n-gram model learns patterns from previously discovered solutions, while the RNN learns a continuous representation of symbolic expressions to predict the next grammar rule. The authors demonstrate the ability of these methods to discover computationally efficient versions of complex mathematical expressions, which are otherwise intractable via brute-force search or manual derivation.
Strengths:
The paper is technically sound and offers a high degree of originality. The use of machine learning to guide symbolic computation is an underexplored area, and the proposed methods are innovative. The n-gram model is simple yet effective, while the application of RNNs to symbolic grammar trees is novel and demonstrates the potential for continuous representations in symbolic domains. The results, particularly for the n-gram model, are compelling, as it outperforms the RNN on two out of three tasks. The discovery of new mathematical identities with reduced computational complexity is a valuable contribution, and the authors provide open-source code, which enhances reproducibility.
Weaknesses:
The paper's clarity is a notable limitation, particularly in Section 7.2, where the experimental setup and results are difficult to follow. The dense technical descriptions and lack of intuitive explanations may hinder accessibility for a broader audience. Additionally, while the originality of the approach is high, the significance of the work is limited. The problem addressed—finding efficient symbolic expressions—feels somewhat contrived and lacks immediate practical applicability. The scope of the grammar rules is also restrictive, and the methods struggle with more complex families of expressions, such as RBM-2, where no solutions are found for higher degrees.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- High originality and technical quality.
- Demonstrates a novel application of machine learning to symbolic computation.
- Provides open-source code and reproducible results.
- N-gram models perform well on most tasks.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Limited practical significance and applicability of the problem.
- Clarity issues, particularly in experimental sections.
- RNN underperforms compared to simpler n-gram models, raising questions about its utility.
Recommendation:
This paper is a strong candidate for acceptance due to its originality and technical contributions. However, improvements in clarity and a stronger case for the practical significance of the work would enhance its impact.
