This paper presents a novel framework for Bayesian quadrature (BQ) in probabilistic inference, introducing two key innovations: the use of a squared Gaussian Process (GP) model and an uncertainty-based active sampling scheme. These advancements aim to address the inefficiencies of traditional Monte Carlo methods and the computational costs of earlier BQ approaches. The squared GP replaces the exponentiated GP model used in Osborne et al. (NIPS 2012), enforcing non-negativity of the integrand while improving computational efficiency. The authors also propose two approximations—linearisation (WSABI-L) and moment matching (WSABI-M)—to handle the intractable posterior introduced by the square-root transformation. Their active sampling strategy further optimises the reduction of uncertainty in the integral or integrand, enabling faster convergence in wall-clock time compared to standard Monte Carlo techniques.
Strengths:  
The paper makes significant contributions to Bayesian quadrature by addressing key limitations of prior methods. The squared GP model is a thoughtful and well-motivated improvement over the exponentiated GP, offering a practical way to enforce non-negativity while reducing the dynamic range of the likelihood. The active sampling scheme is computationally efficient and aligns well with the proposed model, balancing exploration and exploitation effectively. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed WSABI framework over Monte Carlo methods and other BQ approaches on both synthetic and real-world tasks, including regression and classification problems. The authors provide detailed theoretical derivations and empirical evaluations, which strengthen the credibility of their claims.
Weaknesses:  
One notable limitation is the lack of direct experimental comparison with the exponentiated GP model ("WSABI") introduced by Osborne et al. (2012). Such a comparison would provide a clearer understanding of the incremental benefits of the squared GP model. Additionally, the use of the term "95% confidence interval" may confuse readers, as it is not standard terminology in Bayesian inference; replacing it with "credible interval" would improve clarity. The title of the paper could also be revised to better reflect its focus on Bayesian quadrature innovations rather than general probabilistic inference. Finally, while the paper demonstrates the effectiveness of its methods, it does not explore scalability to higher-dimensional problems in detail, which could be a concern for real-world applications.
Pro/Con Arguments for Acceptance:  
- Pro: The paper introduces novel and impactful methods that advance the state of the art in Bayesian quadrature. The squared GP model and active sampling scheme are well-motivated, theoretically sound, and empirically validated.  
- Con: The absence of a direct comparison with the exponentiated GP model limits the contextualisation of the proposed innovations. The title and terminology could also be refined for clarity.  
Recommendation:  
This paper presents a meaningful contribution to Bayesian quadrature and probabilistic inference. While there are minor issues with experimental comparisons and clarity, the overall quality, originality, and significance of the work warrant acceptance. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions.
