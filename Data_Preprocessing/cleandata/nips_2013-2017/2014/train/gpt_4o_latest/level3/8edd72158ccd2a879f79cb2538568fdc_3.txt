The paper presents a novel two-stage noisy voting model and demonstrates the superiority of diverse teams over uniform teams as the number of agents increases. Theoretical contributions include proofs that diverse voting outperforms uniform voting under three widely applicable noise models (PD-alpha, PM-alpha, PPM-alpha). Experimentally, the authors propose practical methods for generating diverse agents and extracting move rankings in the Computer Go domain, showing that diverse teams achieve higher performance than uniform teams under various voting rules.
Strengths:
1. Theoretical Contributions: The paper extends the Condorcet Jury Theorem to noisy voting among software agents, providing rigorous proofs under well-defined noise models. The inclusion of three prominent noise models (Mallows-φ, Thurstone-Mosteller, and Plackett-Luce) enhances the generality and applicability of the results.
2. Experimental Contributions: The authors propose a novel methodology for generating diverse agents by parameterizing a single Go program (Fuego) and extracting rankings from agents not originally designed for ranked voting. These practical contributions are significant for advancing research in multi-agent systems.
3. Clarity and Writing: The paper is well-written and logically organized, making a complex theoretical framework accessible. The experimental results are clearly presented with appropriate statistical analysis.
4. Significance: The work addresses an important problem in multi-agent systems and voting theory, with potential applications in other domains such as poker and recommendation systems. The findings provide a strong case for diversity in team-based decision-making.
Weaknesses:
1. Relation to Prior Work: The paper builds on Marcolino et al. (2013), but the differentiation between this work and prior contributions is insufficiently articulated. While the authors extend the theoretical model and introduce ranked voting, the novelty relative to Marcolino et al.'s empirical findings needs clearer emphasis.
2. Robustness and Scope: The robustness of diverse voting under different voting rules is not fully explored. The experimental results focus heavily on plurality voting, with limited insights into the performance of ranked voting rules. Additionally, the computational costs of generating rankings and diverse agents are not discussed in detail.
3. Assumptions and Applicability: The paper assumes a flat state space, which may not align with the sequential nature of decision-making in games like Go. This limitation reduces the applicability of the theoretical model to real-world multi-stage decision processes.
4. Minor Issues: The domain of φ in the Mallows model should be clarified, and the notation for "k" in uniform voting could be revised for consistency. Adding a bullet for the Plackett-Luce model would improve readability.
Recommendation:
The paper makes significant theoretical and experimental contributions to the study of voting among diverse agents. However, to strengthen its impact, the authors should better differentiate their work from prior research, provide more comprehensive experimental results (including computational costs), and address the limitations of their assumptions. Despite these concerns, the paper is a valuable contribution to the field and merits acceptance after revisions.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Strong theoretical contributions with rigorous proofs.
- Practical and innovative experimental methodology.
- Clear writing and significant implications for multi-agent systems.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Insufficient differentiation from prior work.
- Limited exploration of robustness and computational costs.
- Assumptions may not fully align with real-world applications.
Overall, the paper is a strong candidate for acceptance, provided the authors address the outlined concerns.
