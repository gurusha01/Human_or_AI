The paper introduces a novel sample-efficient policy search algorithm for reinforcement learning (RL) in large, continuous domains, leveraging local linear Gaussian models to train global nonlinear policies. The approach, termed Guided Policy Search (GPS), alternates between local trajectory optimization and global policy search iteratively. This hybrid methodology bridges the gap between model-based and model-free RL techniques, offering a middle ground that combines the sample efficiency of the former with the flexibility of the latter.
Strengths:
The proposed algorithm is innovative in its use of local linear Gaussian models to guide the training of global policies. This hybrid approach allows the method to handle complex, discontinuous dynamics, such as contact-rich tasks, which are challenging for traditional model-based methods. The flexibility to train policies with arbitrary parameterizations, including complex neural networks, is a significant advantage. The experimental results are compelling, demonstrating superior performance over state-of-the-art methods like REPS and PILCO in tasks such as peg insertion, octopus arm control, swimming, and walking. The ability to generalize policies to partially observed environments, as shown in the peg insertion task, is particularly noteworthy. The paper is well-written, with clear explanations, detailed methodology, and sufficient information for reproducibility.
Weaknesses:
While the experimental results are promising, the novelty of the tasks makes it difficult to evaluate the broader applicability of the method. The paper does not sufficiently address potential conflicts between local models during the iterative optimization process, which could impact stability in more complex scenarios. Additionally, while the use of a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) as a prior for dynamics estimation is effective, the reliance on this prior may limit the method's applicability to tasks where such priors are difficult to construct.
Evaluation:
- Quality: The paper is technically sound, with claims well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The approach is complete and carefully evaluated, though further discussion on limitations would strengthen the work.
- Clarity: The paper is well-organized and clearly written, providing sufficient detail for reproduction. Suggestions for improvement include elaborating on how conflicts between local models are mitigated.
- Originality: The work is highly original, presenting a novel combination of local trajectory optimization and global policy search. While it builds on existing methods like REPS and PILCO, the use of supervised learning-based policy training is a significant departure.
- Significance: The paper makes a valuable contribution to RL, particularly in handling complex, discontinuous dynamics and partially observed tasks. The insights provided are likely to inspire further research in hybrid RL methods.
Recommendation:
I recommend this paper for acceptance. Its originality, clarity, and significant contributions to policy search and reinforcement learning make it a strong candidate for publication. However, addressing the noted weaknesses in future work would further enhance its impact.
