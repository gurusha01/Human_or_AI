This paper introduces the expectation loss SVM (e-SVM), a novel algorithm designed for scenarios where training labels are continuous values (positiveness) within a bounded interval, rather than binary labels. The e-SVM is particularly effective for segment proposal classification under both strong and weak supervision. The authors demonstrate its applicability to semantic segmentation and object detection tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results on the PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset. The paper also highlights the potential of combining e-SVM features with existing object detection frameworks, such as RCNN, to improve performance.
Strengths:  
The empirical results are a significant strength of this paper. The proposed e-SVM method outperforms baseline approaches like Support Vector Classification (SVC) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) in segment proposal classification. Furthermore, the integration of e-SVM features with RCNN yields a notable improvement in object detection performance, demonstrating the practical utility of the method. The paper's focus on weakly supervised learning is timely and relevant, addressing the growing need for scalable methods that reduce reliance on expensive pixel-level annotations. The results on semantic segmentation and object detection tasks are compelling, and the introduction of new evaluation metrics, such as TAPC and NDCG, adds value to the field.
Weaknesses:  
The paper's originality is limited, as it primarily extends existing SVM frameworks rather than introducing fundamentally new concepts. Additionally, key prior works on weighted SVMs and transductive SVMs are not adequately cited, which weakens the contextual positioning of the research. The clarity of the paper is another concern. The title and abstract fail to succinctly convey the core contributions, and the overemphasis on minor algorithmic variations detracts from the main narrative. The feature engineering process, a critical component of the method, is underexplained, leaving readers with insufficient details to reproduce the results. Baseline comparisons and parameter selection strategies are also inadequately discussed, which undermines the rigor of the experimental evaluation. Minor issues, such as typographical errors and unclear abbreviations, further detract from the paper's polish.
Recommendation:  
While the paper demonstrates strong empirical results and addresses a significant problem in computer vision, the deficiencies in originality, clarity, and references need to be addressed. The paper would be better suited for a computer vision-focused conference rather than NIPS, given its application-oriented contributions. I recommend acceptance conditional on the following revisions: (1) inclusion of missing references to related work, (2) improved clarity in the title, abstract, and feature engineering explanations, (3) detailed discussion of baseline comparisons and parameter selection, and (4) correction of typographical errors and unclear abbreviations.
Pro and Con Arguments:  
- Pro: Strong empirical results, practical relevance, and state-of-the-art performance in object detection.  
- Con: Limited algorithmic novelty, missing references, and lack of clarity in key sections.  
Overall, this paper makes a valuable contribution to weakly supervised learning and object detection, but revisions are necessary to enhance its clarity and contextual grounding.
