The paper addresses the problem of logistic regression (LR) in the presence of adversarial outliers in the covariate matrix, without assuming any specific distribution for the outliers. The authors propose a novel algorithm, RoLR, which estimates the LR parameter through a robust linear programming-based procedure. The paper makes a significant theoretical contribution by providing performance guarantees for RoLR, demonstrating its robustness to a constant fraction of outliers. Additionally, the authors extend the algorithm to binary classification tasks and validate its efficacy through simulations.
Strengths:  
The paper is technically sound and well-grounded in rigorous mathematical analysis. The authors provide theoretical guarantees for the robustness of RoLR, including bounds on parameter recovery, empirical risk, and population risk. The use of linear programming for parameter estimation is computationally efficient and scalable, making the algorithm practical for large-scale datasets. The simulations convincingly demonstrate that RoLR outperforms standard LR in the presence of outliers, with the algorithm maintaining robustness even when up to 45% of the samples are corrupted. The work is innovative, leveraging sophisticated ideas like trimmed correlation and sub-Gaussian concentration properties, and represents a clear advancement over prior methods, which often fail under high-dimensional settings or require boundedness assumptions on outliers.
Weaknesses:  
While the theoretical contributions are strong, the paper lacks empirical validation on real-world datasets, which would better demonstrate the practical applicability of RoLR. The authors acknowledge that RoLR performs slightly worse than standard LR in the absence of outliers, which is a trade-off for robustness. However, further discussion on how this trade-off impacts real-world scenarios would be valuable. Additionally, certain aspects of the paper require clarification. For instance, the assumption that the ground truth parameter $\beta^*$ has unit length (Line 135) is not adequately justified, and the definition of square/absolute value for p-dimensional $X_i$ (Line 157) is ambiguous. Addressing these points would improve the clarity of the manuscript.
Pro/Con Arguments for Acceptance:  
- Pro: The paper addresses an important and challenging problem, proposing a novel and theoretically sound solution. The algorithm is computationally efficient and scalable, with strong empirical performance in simulations.  
- Con: The lack of real-world experiments limits the practical impact of the work. Some notational and conceptual clarifications are needed to enhance readability.
Recommendation:  
Overall, this is a high-quality paper with significant theoretical contributions and innovative methodology. While the lack of real-world validation is a limitation, the strong theoretical guarantees and promising simulation results justify its acceptance. I recommend accepting the paper, with minor revisions to address clarity issues and encourage the authors to include real-world experiments in future work.
