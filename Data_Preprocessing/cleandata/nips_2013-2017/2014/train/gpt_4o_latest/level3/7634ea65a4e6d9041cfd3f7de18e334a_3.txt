The paper introduces a novel structured spike-and-slab prior that incorporates Gaussian process-based correlation structures to model structured sparsity patterns in sparse signal recovery problems. This approach replaces the Ising model used in prior work, offering a flexible framework to encode prior knowledge of sparsity patterns using covariance functions. The authors also propose a Bayesian inference scheme based on expectation propagation (EP) and demonstrate the model's performance through experiments on synthetic data.
Strengths  
The paper presents a technically sound and novel contribution to the field of sparse signal recovery by leveraging Gaussian processes to model structured sparsity. This is a significant improvement over the Ising model, as the Gaussian process formulation provides a more flexible and interpretable way to encode spatial correlations. The use of expectation propagation for inference is well-motivated and aligns with the probabilistic framework. The experiments demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method, particularly in improving phase transition points and capturing structured sparsity patterns. The inclusion of computational optimizations, such as low-rank approximations and the Woodbury matrix identity, is a practical and commendable addition for scaling the method to high-dimensional problems.
Weaknesses  
1. Lack of Discussion on Prior Work: The relationship between the proposed Gaussian process prior and the Ising model (Cevher et al., 2008) is not adequately discussed. A theoretical or experimental comparison would strengthen the paper by clarifying the advantages of the proposed approach.  
2. Clarity Issues: Figure 1(c) lacks clarity regarding how the correlation between \(z1\) and \(z2\) is computed. This could confuse readers unfamiliar with the technical details. Additionally, the shorthand "MMV" is introduced but never defined, which detracts from the paper's accessibility.  
3. Limited Experimental Validation: The experiments are conducted solely on synthetic data, with no validation on real-world datasets. This limits the practical significance of the results and raises concerns about the generalizability of the proposed method.  
4. Exclusion of Relevant Baselines: BG-AMP, a relevant baseline for comparison, is excluded from Experiment 2. This omission weakens the experimental rigor and makes it difficult to assess the relative performance of the proposed method.  
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance  
Pros:  
- Novel and technically sound contribution to structured sparsity modeling.  
- Flexible Gaussian process formulation with clear advantages over prior Ising-based models.  
- Well-motivated use of expectation propagation and computational optimizations.  
Cons:  
- Insufficient discussion and comparison with prior work (e.g., Ising model).  
- Lack of real-world data validation and exclusion of relevant baselines.  
- Clarity issues in figures and terminology.  
Recommendation  
While the paper introduces a promising approach with theoretical and computational innovations, the lack of real-world validation, incomplete discussion of prior work, and clarity issues detract from its overall impact. I recommend weak rejection with encouragement to address these concerns in a future submission.
