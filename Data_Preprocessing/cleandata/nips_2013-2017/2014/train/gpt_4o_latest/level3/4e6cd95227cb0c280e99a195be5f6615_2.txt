The paper presents a novel sampling algorithm for Bayesian inference in factorial hidden Markov models (FHMMs) using a Hamming ball auxiliary variable construction. This approach addresses the inefficiencies of standard Gibbs sampling, which suffers from slow mixing and local mode trapping due to its locally asymmetric updates. By employing symmetric moves, the proposed method allows joint updating of latent sequences, improving mixing and computational efficiency. The authors demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness through experiments on simulated and real-world datasets, including energy disaggregation tasks.
Strengths:  
The paper makes an original contribution by introducing a novel sampling method that generalizes slice sampling and the Swendsen-Wang algorithm to FHMMs. The proposed Hamming ball sampler is a significant improvement over existing Gibbs sampling approaches, as it mitigates local mode trapping and enhances mixing. The authors provide a clear theoretical foundation for their method, including extensions to non-binary state spaces and adaptive radius selection. The experimental results convincingly demonstrate the superiority of the Hamming ball sampler in both simulated and real-world scenarios, particularly in escaping local modes and achieving lower mean squared error (MSE) during prediction tasks. The paper also highlights potential applications of the method beyond FHMMs, broadening its relevance to other statistical models.
Weaknesses:  
While the paper introduces a promising method, there are areas that require clarification or further exploration. First, the reviewer raises concerns about the method's scalability to more general FHMMs with complex transition matrices. The authors should explicitly discuss whether their approach can be extended to such cases. Second, the illustrative example claiming that Gibbs sampling gets trapped in local modes could be more accurately described as slower mixing, as the reviewer disagrees with the authors' interpretation. Third, the paper lacks a formal definition or reference for the Hamming distance (line 152), and there is a discrepancy in describing the Hamming ball as a union versus an intersection (line 168). Additionally, the ambiguity in the indicator function \(I(\cdot)\) (line 171) needs resolution. Finally, the bibliography contains capitalization errors that require careful revision.
Suggestions for Improvement:  
1. Address the scalability of the proposed method to more general FHMMs with complex transition matrices.  
2. Revise the illustrative example to accurately reflect the difference between local mode trapping and slower mixing.  
3. Provide a formal definition or reference for the Hamming distance and clarify the description of the Hamming ball.  
4. Resolve the ambiguity regarding the indicator function \(I(\cdot)\).  
5. Revise the bibliography to correct capitalization errors and ensure consistency.
Overall Assessment:  
The paper tackles a challenging problem in Bayesian inference for FHMMs and presents an innovative solution with strong theoretical and experimental support. The proposed method advances the state of the art and has the potential for broader applicability. The paper is recommended for acceptance after minor revisions to address the identified concerns and improve clarity.
