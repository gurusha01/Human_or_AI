The paper investigates the communication cost of distributed estimation for \(d\)-dimensional spherical Gaussian distributions with unknown mean and unitary covariance, extending prior work on the one-dimensional case. It establishes both upper and lower bounds for communication costs in interactive and simultaneous communication settings, revealing a linear scaling with dimensionality. Notably, the authors introduce a "direct-sum" theorem, showing that the \(d\)-dimensional problem can be decomposed into \(d\) independent one-dimensional problems, with communication cost scaling proportionally. For sparse parameters, the paper proposes a thresholding-based protocol that reduces communication costs by exploiting sparsity, achieving a tradeoff between communication and squared loss. These results are complemented by an interactive protocol that achieves improved communication efficiency in the general case.
Strengths:
1. Technical Depth: The theoretical analysis is rigorous, leveraging tools from information complexity and communication complexity. The direct-sum theorem is a significant contribution that generalizes the one-dimensional case to higher dimensions.
2. Novelty: The study of sparse parameter estimation in distributed settings is a fresh perspective, and the proposed thresholding protocol provides practical insights into exploiting structure in data.
3. Impact: The results advance understanding of the tradeoffs between dimensionality, communication cost, and estimation accuracy, with potential applications in distributed machine learning and statistical estimation.
4. Protocols and Bounds: The paper not only derives lower bounds but also proposes protocols that achieve these bounds (up to logarithmic factors), demonstrating practical relevance.
Weaknesses:
1. Presentation: The introduction is overly lengthy and could be streamlined to focus on the main contributions. Additionally, the lack of a conclusion section makes it harder to synthesize the key takeaways.
2. Clarity: Notations are inconsistent between the main paper and supplementary material, which may confuse readers. A clearer organization of proofs and results would enhance readability.
3. Scope of Evaluation: While the theoretical contributions are strong, the paper lacks empirical validation or simulations to illustrate the practical implications of the proposed protocols.
4. Restrictive Assumptions: The model assumes a spherical Gaussian distribution with unitary covariance, which may limit applicability to real-world datasets with more complex structures.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper addresses a fundamental problem in distributed learning and provides significant theoretical contributions.
- The direct-sum theorem and sparse estimation protocol are novel and impactful, with potential for broader applicability.
- The technical rigor and depth of analysis are commendable.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Presentation issues, including the absence of a conclusion and inconsistent notations, hinder accessibility.
- The restrictive assumptions and lack of empirical validation limit the paper's practical relevance.
Recommendation:
Overall, the paper makes a strong theoretical contribution to the field of distributed statistical estimation. While presentation and clarity could be improved, the significance of the results outweighs these shortcomings. I recommend acceptance, provided the authors address the clarity and organization issues in a revision.
