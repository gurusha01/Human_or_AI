The paper presents a novel approach to sparse signal recovery by introducing the structured spike and slab prior, which models structured sparsity patterns using a spatial Gaussian process. This formulation allows for encoding prior knowledge of sparsity patterns via generic covariance functions, addressing a key limitation in existing sparsity-promoting priors. The authors further develop a Bayesian inference algorithm based on expectation propagation (EP), with computational efficiency achieved through covariance matrix inverse approximations. Numerical experiments demonstrate the method's superiority over existing approaches, particularly in structured sparse recovery tasks.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Significance: The proposed structured spike and slab prior is a significant advancement in structured sparsity modeling, offering a flexible framework that generalizes existing methods like group sparsity and Markov random fields. This addresses a long-standing challenge in the field and has broad applicability across domains such as neuroimaging and signal processing.
2. Technical Soundness: The paper is technically rigorous, with a well-justified derivation of the EP-based inference algorithm. The use of covariance matrix approximations to reduce computational complexity is a practical and thoughtful addition.
3. Empirical Validation: The numerical experiments convincingly demonstrate the method's advantages, particularly in improving phase transition points and handling challenging scenarios like EEG source localization. The results show significant performance gains over baseline methods such as BG-AMP and LARS.
4. Clarity of Writing: The paper is generally well-written and organized, with clear explanations of the proposed model and algorithm.
Weaknesses:
1. Notation and Acronyms: The paper could benefit from improved clarity in notation and definitions. For instance, acronyms like MMV are not defined early, which may confuse readers unfamiliar with the term.
2. Limited Real-World Validation: While the synthetic experiments are thorough, the lack of real-world data examples limits the practical impact of the work. Including such examples would strengthen the paper's applicability and relevance.
3. Parameter Sensitivity: The paper does not sufficiently discuss the practical implications of parameter choices (e.g., the effect of hyperparameters like Î³ on sparsity correlations). A deeper exploration of this would enhance the method's usability.
4. Computational Complexity: Although the authors address computational challenges, the proposed method remains computationally intensive compared to simpler alternatives like BG-AMP. This trade-off should be discussed more explicitly.
Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Define all acronyms and symbols clearly in the introduction or a dedicated notation section.
2. Include at least one real-world dataset to demonstrate the method's practical applicability.
3. Add a discussion on the sensitivity of the model to hyperparameters and their impact on performance.
4. Address minor corrections, such as typos and notation inconsistencies, to improve readability.
Recommendation:
The paper makes a substantial contribution to the field of structured sparse recovery and is technically sound and original. While there are areas for improvement, particularly in real-world validation and clarity, the strengths outweigh the weaknesses. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the issues outlined above.
