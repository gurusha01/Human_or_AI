This paper introduces a novel approach to sparse signal recovery by proposing a structured spike-and-slab prior model that incorporates a priori knowledge of sparsity patterns using spatial Gaussian processes. The authors also present a Bayesian inference algorithm based on expectation propagation (EP) to solve the proposed model. The paper is well-written, clearly organized, and provides engaging examples and comparisons to existing methods, making it accessible to readers with varying levels of expertise in the field.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Originality: The structured spike-and-slab prior model is a significant extension of traditional sparsity-promoting priors. By leveraging Gaussian processes, the model allows for encoding richer sparsity structures, which is a clear advancement over conventional methods like LASSO or group spike-and-slab models. The use of generic covariance functions to encode prior knowledge is particularly innovative.
   
2. Technical Quality: The paper is technically sound, with detailed derivations of the hierarchical prior and the EP-based inference algorithm. The authors provide a thorough explanation of the computational aspects, including the use of the Woodbury matrix identity to reduce complexity and the handling of numerical issues in EP implementations.
3. Clarity: The paper is well-organized, with a logical flow from problem formulation to experimental validation. The inclusion of illustrative examples, such as the impact of covariance structures on sparsity patterns, enhances understanding. The experiments are well-designed and demonstrate the practical utility of the proposed method.
4. Significance: The results indicate that the proposed model outperforms existing methods like BG-AMP and LARS in terms of phase transition and reconstruction accuracy, particularly in scenarios with structured sparsity. The application to EEG source localization highlights the method's potential for real-world problems.
Weaknesses:
1. Computational Complexity: While the authors address computational challenges using approximations, the proposed algorithm remains computationally expensive, scaling as \(O(D^3)\) in the worst case. This limits its applicability to very high-dimensional problems.
   
2. Limited Discussion on Limitations: The paper could benefit from a more explicit discussion of the limitations of the proposed approach, such as sensitivity to hyperparameter choices (e.g., kernel parameters) and potential challenges in extending the method to non-Gaussian noise models.
3. Comparisons to Related Work: Although the paper compares its method to BG-AMP and LARS, it does not provide a detailed comparison to other structured sparsity models, such as Markov random field-based priors. A broader evaluation would strengthen the claims of novelty and superiority.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper introduces a novel and well-motivated approach to structured sparsity, advancing the state of the art.
- The EP-based inference algorithm is a significant technical contribution and demonstrates strong empirical performance.
- The work is relevant to the NIPS community, addressing a challenging problem with applications in diverse fields like neuroimaging and signal processing.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The computational complexity may hinder practical adoption for large-scale problems.
- The paper does not fully explore its limitations or compare to a broader range of related methods.
Recommendation:
This paper makes a strong scientific contribution and is well-suited for the NIPS audience. While there are some limitations, the novelty, technical rigor, and significance of the results outweigh these concerns. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the weaknesses outlined above.
