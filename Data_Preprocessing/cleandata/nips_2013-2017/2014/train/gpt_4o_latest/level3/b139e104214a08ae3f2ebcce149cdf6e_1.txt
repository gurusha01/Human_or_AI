This paper extends Pinsker's theorem to the normal means model with quantized data, establishing a minimax lower bound that characterizes the tradeoff between statistical risk and storage constraints. The authors propose an encoding-decoding strategy that asymptotically achieves this lower bound, demonstrating its theoretical optimality. The work is motivated by practical applications, such as data compression in resource-constrained environments like satellite communication or cloud storage. By bridging minimax theory and rate-distortion concepts, the paper contributes to both statistical theory and information theory.
Strengths:
1. Theoretical Contribution: The derivation of a minimax lower bound for quantized estimation in the normal means model is a significant theoretical advancement. The results are rigorous and well-supported, with clear connections to classical rate-distortion theory and Pinsker's theorem.
2. Encoding-Decoding Strategy: The proposed method achieves the derived lower bound, providing a constructive demonstration of the theoretical results. This highlights the practical relevance of the work, even if the method is computationally prohibitive.
3. Clarity: The paper is well-written and organized, with clear explanations of the problem, methodology, and results. The proofs are correct and detailed, and the simulations effectively illustrate the theoretical findings.
4. Significance: The work addresses a fundamental problem in nonparametric estimation under communication constraints, which has implications for modern applications like distributed learning and resource-constrained statistical inference.
Weaknesses:
1. Computational Complexity: The proposed encoding-decoding method, while theoretically optimal, is computationally infeasible for practical use. The authors acknowledge this but do not provide concrete alternatives or efficient approximations. Leveraging prior work, such as sparse regression-based lossy compression, could lead to more practical schemes.
2. Title Misalignment: The title "Quantized Non-Parametric Estimation" is misleading, as the paper focuses specifically on the normal means model. A more accurate title, such as "Quantized Infinite Gaussian Sequence Model" or "Quantized Normal Means Model," would better reflect the content.
3. Lack of Equivalence Proof: The paper does not rigorously establish the equivalence between the quantized normal means model and broader nonparametric estimation problems. This limits the generalizability of the results to other nonparametric settings.
Recommendation:
While the paper makes a strong theoretical contribution, the computational infeasibility of the proposed method and the lack of a rigorous equivalence proof slightly diminish its practical impact. If the authors address these issues in a revision, the paper would be significantly strengthened. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions, emphasizing the need for a more accurate title and a discussion of computationally efficient alternatives.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Novel theoretical insights into quantized estimation and minimax risk.
- Clear and rigorous presentation of results.
- Relevance to modern applications in communication-constrained environments.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Computational impracticality of the proposed method.
- Misleading title and limited generalizability to broader nonparametric problems.
