The paper addresses an extension of Pinsker's theorem to a rate-distortion-like setting, focusing on minimax risk under bounded bitrate constraints. The authors derive sharp upper and lower bounds for the quantized minimax risk in the normal means model, providing a Pareto-optimal tradeoff between storage and risk. The problem is motivated by practical applications, such as data compression in astronomy and cloud computing, and builds on connections between minimax theory and rate-distortion concepts.
Strengths:
The paper's primary strength lies in its precise asymptotic characterization of the quantized minimax risk, which is both nontrivial and practically relevant. The authors successfully combine rate-distortion theory with minimax nonparametric analysis, offering a novel perspective on the tradeoff between storage and estimation accuracy. The results are technically sound, with rigorous proofs and simulations that validate the theoretical findings. The adaptive source coding method proposed in the paper achieves the minimax lower bound asymptotically, demonstrating the feasibility of the theoretical results. The inclusion of simulations further enhances the paper's credibility by illustrating the convergence of the quantized estimator to the theoretical bounds.
Weaknesses:
Despite its strengths, the paper has several notable weaknesses. First, while the results are new, the techniques employed are largely variations of existing methods in rate-distortion and minimax risk literature. The paper does not sufficiently discuss its connections to prior work, particularly the minimax risk bounds established by Yang and Barron, or related work in distributed estimation under communication constraints. This oversight limits the reader's ability to contextualize the contribution within the broader literature. Additionally, the paper assumes significant prior knowledge from the reader, which may hinder accessibility for a broader audience. The proposed coding method, while theoretically optimal, is computationally impractical, and the discussion on practical alternatives is limited to future work. Lastly, the results, though useful, are incremental rather than groundbreaking, as the general form of the tradeoff is somewhat expected.
Impact Assessment:
The paper makes a meaningful contribution to the intersection of rate-distortion theory and minimax analysis, particularly in the context of storage-constrained estimation. However, its impact is likely to be incremental, as the mathematical techniques and their interrelation are already well-established. The work is relevant to researchers in statistical theory and information theory but may have limited appeal outside these domains due to its theoretical focus and computational impracticality.
Recommendation:
While the paper is technically sound and provides a novel combination of ideas, its over-reliance on existing methods, insufficient discussion of prior work, and limited practical applicability temper its significance. I recommend acceptance conditional on revisions that address the connections to prior work and improve the clarity of exposition for a broader audience.
