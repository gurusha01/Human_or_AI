The paper presents a novel and biophysically inspired conductance-based spiking model (CBSM) for inferring synaptic conductances from extracellularly recorded spike trains, extending the widely used generalized linear model (GLM). The authors reinterpret the GLM as a constrained conductance-based model and propose a more flexible alternative that allows for independent excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs with nonlinear stimulus-conductance mappings. The CBSM is validated using both simulated and physiological data from macaque retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), demonstrating its ability to infer synaptic conductances with high accuracy and to outperform the GLM in predicting spike responses.
Strengths:  
The paper makes significant theoretical and practical contributions. The reinterpretation of the GLM as a constrained biophysical model is insightful and bridges the gap between statistical and biophysical approaches to neural modeling. The CBSM's ability to infer synaptic conductances from spike trains is a noteworthy advance, validated rigorously through both simulations and intracellular recordings. The authors demonstrate that the CBSM captures key biophysical properties, such as distinct excitatory and inhibitory tuning and stimulus-dependent gain control, which are absent in the GLM. The model's improved predictive performance for spike trains and its ability to account for a substantial proportion of variance in synaptic conductances highlight its practical utility. The manuscript is well-written, clearly organized, and provides sufficient methodological detail to enable reproducibility.
Weaknesses:  
While the CBSM is a compelling extension of the GLM, its computational complexity and reliance on non-concave optimization may limit its scalability to larger datasets or more complex neural circuits. The authors acknowledge this limitation but do not explore alternative optimization strategies or initialization methods that could mitigate these challenges. Additionally, the model's reliance on a penalty term to balance excitatory and inhibitory filters suggests potential overfitting issues when data are limited. The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of these limitations and potential solutions. Finally, while the CBSM focuses on inferring synaptic conductances, it does not address the broader question of inferring network connectivity, which could be a natural extension of this work.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:  
Pro:  
- The CBSM is a significant methodological advance, providing a biophysically interpretable and accurate model for neural encoding.  
- The validation using both simulated and physiological data is rigorous and convincing.  
- The work bridges statistical and biophysical modeling, making it relevant to a broad audience.  
Con:  
- The computational demands and non-concave optimization may limit the model's applicability.  
- Extensions to infer network connectivity are not explored, leaving room for further development.  
Recommendations:  
The paper is of high quality and makes a meaningful contribution to the field. However, the authors should consider discussing the potential for extending the CBSM to infer network connectivity, as suggested by related work (e.g., Abarbanel et al.). Additionally, addressing the computational challenges and exploring alternative optimization strategies could enhance the model's applicability. Overall, I recommend acceptance with minor revisions.
