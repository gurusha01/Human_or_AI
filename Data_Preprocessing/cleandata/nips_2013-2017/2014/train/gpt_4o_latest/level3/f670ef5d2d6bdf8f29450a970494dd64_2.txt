The paper presents a novel framework for sparsity-inducing regularizations using group-induced majorization, introducing the concept of orbitopes as convex hulls of group orbits. This approach generalizes several well-known regularizers, such as `1, `2, and `âˆž norms, and connects to recent developments like the sorted `1-norm. The authors propose gradient-based optimization methods and a continuation strategy for orbit exploration, with simulation results demonstrating the framework's potential. While the paper is well-written and contributes to the understanding of sparsity in machine learning, there are areas that require further clarification and exploration.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Theoretical Contribution: The introduction of orbitopes and their connection to group-induced majorization provides a fresh perspective on sparsity-inducing regularizations. The framework unifies existing regularizers and motivates new ones, such as the permutahedron and signed permutahedron.
2. Algorithmic Contributions: The paper derives efficient conditional and projected gradient algorithms for optimization, leveraging group-specific properties. The continuation strategy for orbit exploration is particularly interesting, as it enables adaptive regularization tuning.
3. Clarity and Organization: The paper is well-structured, with clear explanations of the theoretical framework, algorithmic details, and experimental results. The connection to atomic norms and sorted `1-norms is well-articulated and grounded in prior work.
4. Potential Impact: The framework has the potential to inspire new regularizers tailored to specific machine learning problems, leveraging the rich mathematical theory of groups and their representations.
Weaknesses:
1. Practical Utility of Orbitopes: While the use of orbitopes is theoretically appealing, their practical advantages over existing atomic norms remain unclear. The paper would benefit from a more detailed discussion of scenarios where orbitopes outperform traditional regularizers in real-world applications.
2. Experimental Validation: The experiments are limited to synthetic data and do not provide a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed methods on diverse, real-world datasets. This limits the ability to assess the practical utility and robustness of the framework.
3. Continuation Strategy: The continuation algorithm is heuristic-based, and its convergence properties are only briefly discussed. A deeper theoretical analysis or empirical comparison with other continuation methods would strengthen the paper.
4. Accessibility: While the paper is clear for experts, it may be challenging for non-specialists to follow due to the heavy reliance on group theory and convex analysis. A more intuitive explanation of key concepts could broaden its accessibility.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper introduces a novel and theoretically sound framework that unifies and extends existing regularization techniques.
- The proposed algorithms and continuation strategy are innovative and have the potential to influence future research in structured sparsity.
- The connection to sorted `1-norms and atomic norms provides a strong theoretical foundation.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The practical advantages of orbitopes over existing methods are not convincingly demonstrated.
- The experimental evaluation is limited and does not provide sufficient evidence of the framework's effectiveness in real-world scenarios.
- The continuation strategy lacks rigorous theoretical justification and comparative analysis.
Recommendation:
Overall, the paper makes a valuable theoretical contribution and proposes interesting algorithms. However, the lack of practical validation and limited discussion of the advantages of orbitopes reduce its immediate impact. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions, focusing on expanding the experimental section and providing a clearer discussion of the practical benefits of the proposed framework.
