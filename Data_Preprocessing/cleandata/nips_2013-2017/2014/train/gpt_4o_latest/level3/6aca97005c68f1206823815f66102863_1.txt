This paper presents an innovative extension of Locally Weighted Regression (LWR) by introducing Local Gaussian Regression (LGR), which combines the computational efficiency of LWR with the probabilistic rigor of Gaussian Processes (GP). The authors propose a novel weighting mechanism that allows local models to collaborate during training, resulting in a unified generative model. Two versions of the algorithm are introduced: a batch version with fixed local model centers and an incremental Bayesian version capable of adapting to streaming data. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of LGR through experiments on robotic systems, including the SARCOS and KUKA arms, where it outperforms state-of-the-art methods like LWPR with fewer local models.
Strengths:  
The paper is technically sound and well-written, with clear explanations of the transition from LWR to LGR. The proposed approach is original, addressing the limitations of LWR (e.g., lack of a generative model and sensitivity to manual tuning) while retaining its computational efficiency. The incremental Bayesian formulation is particularly noteworthy, as it enables real-time learning in high-dimensional, non-stationary environmentsâ€”a critical requirement for robotics. The experimental results are compelling, showing that LGR achieves superior or comparable accuracy to LWPR while using fewer local models and requiring minimal manual tuning. The inclusion of diverse datasets (e.g., SARCOS, KUKA1, KUKA2, and KUKAsim) strengthens the empirical validation of the method.
Weaknesses:  
While the paper is strong overall, there are a few areas for improvement. The connection to prior work, specifically the referenced article [16], is only loosely discussed. A more detailed comparison, both theoretical and experimental, with [16] would provide additional context and help position the contribution more clearly within the literature. Additionally, while the paper emphasizes the reduced need for manual tuning, the choice of certain hyperparameters (e.g., the threshold for adding new local models) could benefit from further justification or sensitivity analysis. Finally, the computational cost of the incremental algorithm is briefly mentioned but not analyzed in depth, particularly in comparison to LWPR and I-SSGPR.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:  
- Pro: The paper introduces a novel and principled approach to localized regression, with significant improvements over LWR and competitive performance against I-SSGPR. The method is well-suited for real-time robotics applications and addresses a critical gap in the field.  
- Con: The discussion of related work, particularly [16], is insufficient, and the computational cost analysis could be more thorough.  
Recommendation:  
I recommend accepting this paper, as it makes a substantial contribution to the field of machine learning for robotics. The method is innovative, well-validated, and addresses a practical problem with clear implications for real-world applications. Addressing the aforementioned weaknesses in the final version would further strengthen the paper.
