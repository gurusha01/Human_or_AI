This paper introduces a novel fully collapsed Gibbs (CG) sampler for the beta-negative binomial process (BNBP), addressing a significant gap in the literature by deriving an exchangeable partition probability function (EPPF) for mixed-membership modeling. The authors propose a method to explicitly describe how the BNBP clusters data into exchangeable partitions shared across groups, which is a notable advancement over prior approaches that relied on truncation or alternative representations. The derivation of Lemma 1 and the construction of the CG sampler are innovative and technically sound, showcasing the authors' deep understanding of the underlying stochastic processes.
The strengths of the paper lie in its originality and technical contributions. The fully collapsed Gibbs sampler is a significant improvement over existing methods, offering faster convergence, better mixing, and state-of-the-art predictive performance. The authors also provide a clear theoretical foundation for their approach, including the derivation of the EPPF and a prediction rule, which are both valuable contributions to the field. Furthermore, the application of the BNBP to topic modeling demonstrates the practical utility of the proposed method, particularly in achieving compact representations of corpora.
However, the paper has notable weaknesses. The primary concern is the lack of relevant experimental comparisons. While the authors compare their method to HDP-LDA, this is not the most appropriate benchmark. The proposed algorithm should be compared against other BNBP sampling algorithms, such as those using finite truncation or slice sampling, to validate its advantages. The absence of such comparisons makes it difficult to assess the true significance of the proposed sampler. Additionally, while the focus on the sampling algorithm is clear, the paper does not sufficiently address statistical modeling aspects, which could provide a more holistic evaluation of the method.
In terms of clarity, the paper is well-organized and detailed, but certain sections, such as the derivation of the EPPF, are mathematically dense and may be challenging for readers unfamiliar with the topic. Including more intuitive explanations or visual aids could improve accessibility.
Arguments for Acceptance:
1. The paper introduces a novel and technically sound CG sampler for the BNBP.
2. Lemma 1 and the derived EPPF are innovative contributions to mixed-membership modeling.
3. The proposed method demonstrates strong predictive performance and practical utility in topic modeling.
Arguments against Acceptance:
1. The lack of experimental comparisons with other BNBP sampling algorithms limits the validation of the proposed method.
2. The focus on the sampling algorithm overlooks broader statistical modeling considerations.
3. Certain sections are overly dense, which may hinder comprehension for a broader audience.
Overall, while the paper makes significant theoretical and practical contributions, addressing the experimental and comparative gaps would strengthen its impact.
