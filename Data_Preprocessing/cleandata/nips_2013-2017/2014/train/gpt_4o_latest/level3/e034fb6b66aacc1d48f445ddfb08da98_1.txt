The paper introduces a novel framework for learning distributed representations of attributes, which are characteristics of text that can be jointly learned with word embeddings. The authors propose a third-order multiplicative model where word context and attribute vectors interact to predict the next word in a sequence. This approach enables conditional word similarity, where the meaning of words changes depending on the attributes being conditioned on. The framework is applied to tasks such as sentiment classification, cross-lingual document classification, and blog authorship attribution, with qualitative evaluations of conditional word neighbors and attribute-conditioned text generation.
Strengths:
The paper presents an innovative idea by extending word embeddings to incorporate attribute vectors, which allows for more nuanced representations of text. The theoretical framework is well-articulated, with clear connections to prior work on distributed representations and multiplicative neural language models. The notion of conditional word similarity is particularly compelling, as it provides a new way to analyze how word meanings shift across contexts. The qualitative results, such as attribute-conditioned text generation and nearest neighbor comparisons, demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach. Additionally, the cross-lingual experiments highlight the model's ability to share statistical strength across languages, which is a valuable contribution to multilingual NLP research.
Weaknesses:
The experimental section lacks depth and clarity, undermining the paper's claims. Early experiments (Tables 2 & 3) fail to convincingly showcase the unique strengths of the proposed model, as the generated samples and POS-conditioned completions are not rigorously evaluated. Key hyperparameters such as learning rate, decay factor, and momentum are not reported, making it difficult to reproduce the results. The motivation and definition of attributes in Section 3.1 are vague, and the notation in Section 3.2 is confusing, particularly in Figure 1, where the distinction between language-id and attribute vectors is unclear. The use of a 100-dimensional attribute vector for 234 unique attributes in Section 3.3 is not well-justified, raising concerns about the model's capacity to capture fine-grained distinctions. Furthermore, the distance between "Germany" and "Deutschland" in embeddings suggests potential errors or unaddressed nuances in the model's handling of cross-lingual semantics.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:
Pros:
- The paper introduces a promising and original idea with potential applications in various NLP tasks.
- The theoretical framework is well-developed and connects to existing literature.
- The qualitative results demonstrate interesting properties of the model, such as conditional word similarity.
Cons:
- The experimental design and analysis are insufficient to substantiate the claims.
- Key hyperparameters and implementation details are missing, hindering reproducibility.
- The motivation and definition of attributes are unclear, and some design choices lack justification.
- Quantitative results are not consistently competitive with state-of-the-art baselines.
Recommendation:
While the paper presents an intriguing idea with significant potential, the lack of rigorous experimental validation and clarity in key sections limits its impact. I recommend a weak reject. The authors are encouraged to improve the experimental design, provide clearer definitions and justifications for their choices, and include a more thorough analysis of results in a future submission.
