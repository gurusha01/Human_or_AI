This paper introduces an extension to the Additive Factorial Hidden Markov Model (AFHMM) by incorporating Signal Aggregate Constraints (SACs) to address blind source separation problems, particularly in the domain of energy disaggregation. The authors propose a convex quadratic programming (CQP) relaxation for maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference and demonstrate its efficacy on real-world energy data from UK households. The results show significant improvements over the baseline AFHMM and a state-of-the-art method, AFAMAP.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Practical Relevance: The introduction of SACs is a creative and practical approach to address the identifiability issues in blind source separation. The application to energy disaggregation, a problem with real-world impact, underscores the significance of the work.
2. Technical Soundness: The derivation of the CQP relaxation for MAP inference is rigorous, and the connection to posterior regularization is well-articulated. The authors demonstrate computational efficiency, with the proposed method scaling similarly to AFHMM and AFAMAP.
3. Empirical Validation: The paper provides extensive experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets, showing substantial improvements in normalized disaggregation error (NDE) and signal aggregate error (SAE). The use of real-world data from the UK Household Electricity Survey adds credibility to the findings.
4. Clarity of Results: The results are presented in a clear and interpretable manner, with comparisons to both AFHMM and AFAMAP. The authors also analyze the robustness of their method to errors in SAC specification, which is a valuable insight for practical applications.
Weaknesses:
1. Conflation of Models and Optimization Procedures: The paper conflates the AFHMM model with the AFAMAP optimization procedure, which could confuse readers. A clearer distinction between the model and the optimization techniques would improve clarity.
2. Discussion of Non-Integral Solutions: The paper does not adequately discuss whether the SACAFHMM achieves lower error despite non-integral solutions arising from the convex relaxation. This is a critical point for understanding the trade-offs of the proposed approach.
3. Orthogonality of Ideas: While the paper mentions that AFAMAP and SACAFHMM are orthogonal approaches, it does not explore the potential for combining these methods. This could be a promising avenue for future work and would strengthen the contribution.
4. Limited Exploration of SAC Specification: The paper assumes that SAC values are known or can be derived from prior knowledge, but it does not explore the sensitivity of the method to inaccuracies in these values in depth. This could limit the applicability of the method in scenarios where such prior knowledge is unavailable or unreliable.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper addresses a significant real-world problem and demonstrates clear improvements over existing methods.
- The technical contributions, particularly the use of SACs and the CQP relaxation, are novel and well-supported by theoretical and empirical evidence.
- The results are compelling, with substantial error reductions on both synthetic and real-world datasets.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The conflation of models and optimization procedures could confuse readers and detracts from the clarity of the contribution.
- The lack of discussion on non-integral solutions and the potential integration of AFAMAP and SACAFHMM leaves some questions unanswered.
Recommendation:
Overall, this paper makes a strong contribution to the field of blind source separation and energy disaggregation. While there are areas for improvement, particularly in clarifying distinctions between models and optimization techniques and exploring the interplay with AFAMAP, the strengths outweigh the weaknesses. I recommend acceptance, with minor revisions to address the clarity and discussion points raised.
