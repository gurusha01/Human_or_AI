The paper introduces a novel low-rank time-frequency synthesis (LRTFS) framework that directly models the time-domain signal using synthesis coefficients, in contrast to traditional nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) approaches that operate on time-frequency (TF) analysis coefficients. This shift enables the modeling of raw signals rather than their spectrograms, bridging a significant gap in the field. The authors propose two expectation-maximization (EM) algorithms for parameter estimation and demonstrate the framework's ability to handle multi-resolution representations, which are not feasible with traditional NMF. Applications in music decomposition and speech enhancement are presented, showcasing the framework's potential.
Strengths:  
The paper's primary contribution lies in its innovative approach to signal modeling, which allows for multi-resolution representations. This is a significant advancement over traditional NMF frameworks, as multi-resolution modeling is particularly relevant for audio signals with diverse temporal characteristics (e.g., transients and tonal components). The multi-resolution extension is both novel and practical, as demonstrated in the experiments. The authors provide a thorough theoretical foundation, connecting their work to sparse Bayesian learning and probabilistic latent factor models, and offer detailed derivations of their algorithms. The experimental results, particularly in speech enhancement, show competitive performance compared to baseline methods like IS-NMF and OMLSA, highlighting the framework's practical utility.
Weaknesses:  
While the multi-resolution extension is compelling, the paper raises questions about the performance of the proposed framework in single-resolution settings. Specifically, it would be useful to see a direct comparison of LRTFS with IS-NMF in such cases, including an analysis of the similarity between the W and H matrices. Additionally, concerns about the computational efficiency and stability of the proposed algorithms are valid. The MJLE algorithm, while computationally feasible, relies on iterative updates that may converge to local minima. The MMLE algorithm, though theoretically promising, is currently impractical for large-scale problems due to its reliance on matrix inversions. The authors acknowledge this limitation but do not provide a scalable alternative, leaving a gap in the framework's applicability to high-dimensional signals.
Clarity:  
The paper is well-written and organized, with a clear exposition of the problem, methodology, and experimental results. However, the inclusion of supplementary material (e.g., sound examples) is essential to fully appreciate the qualitative aspects of the results. Additionally, a more explicit discussion of the computational trade-offs between MJLE and MMLE would enhance the paper's clarity.
Originality and Significance:  
The work is highly original, addressing a long-standing limitation of NMF-based approaches by modeling the raw signal directly. The multi-resolution capability is a significant contribution that advances the state of the art in audio signal processing. The framework has the potential to inspire further research in generative modeling for audio and other time-series data.
Recommendation:  
The paper makes a strong scientific contribution and should be accepted. However, the authors are encouraged to address the concerns regarding single-resolution performance and computational scalability in future work.
