This paper explores the minimax risk for estimating normal means under a communication constraint, extending classical statistical results such as Pinsker's theorem. The authors derive a lower bound on the quantized minimax risk and propose a theoretical estimator that asymptotically achieves this bound. The problem is motivated by practical applications, such as data compression in resource-constrained environments (e.g., space telescopes or cloud computing). The authors' results provide a sharp characterization of the tradeoff between storage (quantization) and statistical risk, demonstrated through simulations.
The paper is technically sound and well-written, with clear exposition and rigorous proofs. The derivation of the lower bound is novel and insightful, requiring a blend of minimax theory and rate-distortion ideas. The proposed estimator, while not computationally practical, serves as a proof of concept for achieving the theoretical bound. The simulations effectively validate the theoretical results, showing convergence to the derived lower bound with increasing data dimensions.
However, the paper has some limitations. While the theoretical contributions are significant, the lack of a practical encoding method limits its immediate applicability. The proposed estimator is computationally prohibitive, and no alternative practical methods are explored. Additionally, the paper does not evaluate existing quantization techniques against the derived bound, which would have provided a useful benchmark for practitioners. The scope of the results is also somewhat narrow, focusing on the Euclidean ball case. Generalizing to other parameter spaces, such as Sobolev ellipsoids, is mentioned as future work but not addressed here.
In terms of originality, the paper makes a novel contribution by bridging minimax theory and rate-distortion concepts under communication constraints. The results are distinct from prior work, such as Draper and Wornell (2004) and Zhang et al. (2013), by addressing fixed but unknown mean vectors in a nonparametric setting. The connections to classical statistical theory and information theory are well-articulated, and the related work is adequately cited.
The significance of the work lies in its theoretical insights into the tradeoff between statistical efficiency and storage constraints. While the immediate practical impact is limited, the results could inspire future research on computationally efficient methods for quantized estimation.
Pros for acceptance:
- Novel theoretical contributions with rigorous proofs.
- Clear exposition and well-motivated problem.
- Insightful simulations validating the theoretical results.
Cons for acceptance:
- Lack of practical encoding methods or benchmarks against existing techniques.
- Limited scope and generalizability of the results.
- No immediate practical applications.
Overall, this paper represents a valuable theoretical contribution to the field of statistical estimation under resource constraints. While its practical impact is limited, it advances our understanding of fundamental tradeoffs and provides a solid foundation for future work. I recommend acceptance, with the caveat that the authors address the practical limitations in future research.
