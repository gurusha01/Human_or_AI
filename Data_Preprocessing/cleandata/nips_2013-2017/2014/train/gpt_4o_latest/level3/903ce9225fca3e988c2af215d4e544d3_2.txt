This paper addresses the critical problem of non-stationarity in multi-armed bandit (MAB) problems by introducing a variation budget \(VT\) to quantify temporal uncertainty in rewards. The authors provide tight upper and lower bounds on the regret, establishing a minimax regret rate of \((K VT)^{1/3} T^{2/3}\), and propose the Rexp3 algorithm, which achieves near-optimal performance. The work bridges adversarial and stochastic MAB frameworks, offering a significant theoretical contribution to the field.
Strengths:  
The paper makes an original and significant contribution by formulating a general and mathematically tractable model for non-stationary MAB problems. The introduction of \(V_T\) as a variation budget is novel and provides a flexible way to model temporal changes in rewards. The theoretical results, including the tight regret bounds and the proposed Rexp3 algorithm, are rigorous and well-supported. The connection between adversarial and stochastic MAB settings is insightful, and the discussion on the "price of non-stationarity" is compelling. The work is likely to stimulate further research in non-stationary decision-making problems.
Weaknesses:  
Despite its strengths, the paper has several areas for improvement. First, while the authors addressed concerns about Theorem 1's proof, one inequality in the derivation appears unnecessary, and a potential mistake in the appendix raises questions about its rigor. Similarly, reconstructing a key bound in Theorem 2's proof proved challenging, casting doubt on the tightness of the results. The exclusion of the \(T^{1/3}\) term on line 424 is puzzling, as it provides valuable insights into initial performance. Additionally, the paper's clarity suffers due to complex proofs and unconventional notation, making it difficult to follow for readers unfamiliar with the topic. Standardizing the notation and moving Theorem 2's proof to the main body would improve readability. Finally, the relationship with prior work, particularly Reference [27], is only briefly mentioned and requires more detailed consolidation.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:  
Pro:  
- Original and significant contribution to non-stationary MAB problems.  
- Rigorous theoretical results with tight regret bounds.  
- Novel introduction of \(V_T\) and its implications for regret analysis.  
- Bridges adversarial and stochastic MAB frameworks.  
Con:  
- Clarity issues due to complex proofs and unconventional notation.  
- Potential errors in Theorem 1 and difficulty reconstructing Theorem 2's bounds.  
- Insufficient emphasis on key results and their implications.  
- Limited discussion of real-world applications of \(V_T\).  
Conclusion:  
This paper is a valuable theoretical contribution to the study of non-stationary MAB problems. However, the clarity and rigor of the proofs, as well as the exposition of key results, need improvement. I recommend acceptance conditional on revisions to address the noted weaknesses, particularly the clarity of proofs, standardization of notation, and a more detailed discussion of connections to prior work.
