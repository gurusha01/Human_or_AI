This paper investigates the problem of computing a \( k \)-rank approximation of an \( n \times d \) matrix \( A \) in a streaming setting, where rows of the matrix are presented sequentially. The authors establish a lower bound of \( \Omega(dk/\epsilon) \) bits of space for any streaming algorithm that guarantees a relative error approximation, even when randomization is allowed. This result matches the upper bound achieved by the deterministic algorithm of Ghashami and Phillips (SODA, 2014) up to word size, thereby proving its optimality. The authors derive their theoretical results through a reduction to the Index problem in communication complexity, which is a well-established technique for proving lower bounds.
Strengths:
1. Technical Soundness: The paper is technically rigorous and provides a detailed proof of the lower bound. The use of the Index problem to establish the result is well-motivated and carefully executed.
2. Clarity: The exposition is clear and well-organized. The authors provide sufficient background on streaming algorithms, low-rank approximation, and prior work, making the paper accessible to readers familiar with the field.
3. Completeness: The paper thoroughly addresses the problem it sets out to solve, providing a comprehensive proof of the lower bound and situating the result within the broader context of streaming algorithms for numerical linear algebra.
4. Writing Quality: The technical proofs are well-written and make effective use of standard mathematical tools. The authors also provide intuition behind their results, which aids understanding.
Weaknesses:
1. Limited Novelty: While the result is significant in confirming the optimality of the Ghashami and Phillips algorithm, it primarily tightens an already established lower bound. The contribution, though technically strong, may lack the novelty expected for a top-tier conference.
2. Significance of Results: The practical implications of the result are somewhat limited, as it primarily serves to validate the tightness of an existing bound rather than introducing new techniques or algorithms. The authors do not explore potential extensions, such as multi-pass lower bounds, which could have added more depth to the work.
3. Scope of Impact: The result is narrowly focused on a specific streaming model and does not generalize to other settings, such as multi-pass or distributed models, which could have broadened its relevance.
Recommendation:
While the paper is technically sound and well-written, its contribution is incremental, as it mainly confirms the tightness of an existing bound. For acceptance, the paper would benefit from a stronger discussion of its broader impact and potential extensions, such as multi-pass or distributed settings. 
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Technically rigorous and mathematically precise.
- Provides a definitive answer to a natural and well-motivated question.
- Clear and well-organized exposition.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Limited novelty, as the result primarily confirms an existing bound.
- Narrow scope, with limited exploration of broader implications or extensions.
- Incremental contribution compared to prior work.
Overall, the paper is a solid theoretical contribution but may not meet the threshold for acceptance at a highly competitive venue due to its incremental nature.
