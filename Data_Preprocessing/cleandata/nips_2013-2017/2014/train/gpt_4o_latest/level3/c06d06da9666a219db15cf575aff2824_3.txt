The paper presents a novel method, Continuous Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (COMP), for spike sorting, which builds upon the Continuous Basis Pursuit (CBP) framework introduced by Ekanadham et al. (2011a,b). The authors propose an alternative basis derived from Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and a greedy optimization approach inspired by Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP). The method is further enhanced by leveraging the Fourier domain to refine time-shift estimates. The paper demonstrates significant improvements in computational efficiency and accuracy over CBP, making it a valuable contribution to the field of neural signal processing.
Strengths:
1. Technical Quality: The method is technically sound, with clear mathematical formulations and well-supported claims. The use of the SVD basis is particularly innovative, as it reduces interpolation error and improves robustness to noise and bin size variations. The Fourier-based refinement of time shifts is another strong contribution that enhances accuracy.
2. Significance: The proposed COMP method addresses a critical challenge in spike sorting by achieving faster and more accurate recovery of spike timings and amplitudes. Its application to both simulated and neural data demonstrates its practical utility and potential for real-world adoption.
3. Clarity: The paper is well-organized, with a logical flow from problem formulation to methodology and results. The inclusion of detailed comparisons with CBP across various parameter regimes provides a comprehensive evaluation.
4. Originality: The combination of a greedy approach with a novel SVD basis and Fourier domain refinement represents a unique contribution. The authors also highlight how their SVD basis can improve CBP, showcasing the broader applicability of their work.
Weaknesses:
1. Fairness of Comparisons: Concerns arise regarding the pruning of waveforms with amplitudes <0.3 and the choice of the L1-penalty parameter Î» in CBP. These choices may bias the comparisons in favor of COMP, and further clarification or justification is needed.
2. Error Analysis: The paper would benefit from separating plots for hits and misses to provide a clearer understanding of the nature of errors across methods. This would help elucidate whether COMP's improvements stem from better detection, fewer false positives, or both.
3. Figure 1 Issues: The legend in Figure 1 is confusing, with discrepancies between the average errors in the legend and the plotted values. Expanding the legend and addressing these inconsistencies would improve clarity.
4. Textual Issues: Minor textual errors (e.g., spurious words, swapped indices, and unclear notation) detract from the overall polish of the paper. Specific examples include lines 41, 85, 153, 299/300, 311, 315, and 411.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:
- Pro: The paper introduces a novel and impactful method with clear improvements in speed and accuracy over existing approaches. The SVD basis and Fourier refinement are significant contributions to the field.
- Con: Concerns about the fairness of comparisons and minor issues in clarity and presentation slightly weaken the paper's overall rigor.
Recommendation:
I recommend acceptance with minor revisions. Addressing the fairness of comparisons, improving error analysis, and resolving textual and figure-related issues would further strengthen the paper. Overall, COMP represents a meaningful advancement in spike sorting and neural data analysis.
