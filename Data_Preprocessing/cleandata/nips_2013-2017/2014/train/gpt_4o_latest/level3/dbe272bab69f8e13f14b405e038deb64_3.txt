This paper presents a novel conductance-based spiking model (CBSM) that extends the generalized linear model (GLM) to incorporate biophysically realistic dynamics of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic conductances. The authors reinterpret the GLM as a constrained conductance-based model and propose a more flexible framework that allows for independent excitatory and inhibitory inputs, nonlinear stimulus-conductance relationships, and dynamic changes in membrane properties. The CBSM is validated using both simulated and experimental data, demonstrating its ability to infer synaptic conductances from extracellular spike trains with high accuracy. This work represents an important step forward in bridging statistical and biophysical modeling approaches, offering improved interpretability and predictive power.
Strengths
1. Technical Innovation: The reinterpretation of the GLM as a constrained conductance-based model is insightful, and the proposed CBSM provides a significant theoretical and practical advancement. The ability to infer synaptic conductances from extracellular recordings is particularly compelling.
2. Experimental Validation: The model is rigorously validated using both simulated data and real recordings from macaque retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). The comparison of inferred conductances with intracellular measurements is a strong point.
3. Biophysical Relevance: By relaxing the GLM's constraints, the CBSM captures key biophysical properties, such as distinct excitatory and inhibitory tuning and stimulus-dependent gain control, which are absent in traditional GLMs.
4. Significance: The method addresses a critical gap in neural modeling by providing a biophysically interpretable framework that retains the tractability of statistical models. Its potential applications in sensory neuroscience are substantial.
Weaknesses
1. Temporal Filter Timescales: The use of unusually long temporal filter timescales (30-50 ms) in simulations raises concerns about biological plausibility. The authors must justify these choices or repeat the analysis with shorter, more realistic timescales.
2. Data Limitations: The model's performance on real data is constrained by the limited duration of unique stimulus recordings. While the authors address this with regularization, the issue highlights the need for additional data to fully validate the approach.
3. Non-concave Log-Likelihood: The lack of concavity in the log-likelihood function complicates parameter optimization. Although the authors mitigate this with careful initialization, the robustness of the method under different conditions could be further explored.
Minor Issues
- Correct "ge(t) Ei" to "gi(t) Ei" on p.3.
- Remove the duplicate "this" on p.7.
Recommendation
This paper is a high-quality contribution that advances the state of the art in neural modeling. Its theoretical insights, practical utility, and experimental validation make it publication-worthy. However, addressing the major concern regarding temporal filter timescales is essential. If this issue is resolved, the paper will make a significant impact on the field.
Arguments for Acceptance
- Novel and biophysically grounded model.
- Strong validation with both simulated and experimental data.
- Addresses a critical gap in neural modeling.
Arguments Against Acceptance
- Temporal filter timescales require justification or revision.
- Limited experimental data constrains validation.
In summary, this paper is technically sound, original, and significant, but requires minor revisions to address the temporal filter issue and improve clarity.
