This paper introduces a novel sampling algorithm, Hamming Ball Auxiliary Sampling (HBAS), for efficient Bayesian inference in Factorial Hidden Markov Models (FHMMs). FHMMs, while powerful for modeling parallel hidden chains, face computational challenges due to the exponential complexity of joint sampling using the standard forward-filtering-backward-sampling (FF-BS) algorithm. The proposed HBAS algorithm addresses this limitation by leveraging an auxiliary variable sampled from a Hamming ball, enabling joint updates of latent sequences with polynomial complexity. This symmetric sampling approach improves mixing and avoids the inefficiencies of locally asymmetric updates in traditional Gibbs samplers. The authors demonstrate the efficacy of HBAS with strong empirical evaluations on both simulated and real-world datasets, including energy disaggregation tasks.
Strengths
The paper is well-written and provides clear explanations of the algorithm, including its theoretical foundations and practical implementation. The use of auxiliary variables to define restricted sampling spaces is an elegant solution to the computational bottlenecks of FHMMs. The authors effectively highlight the advantages of symmetric moves in escaping local modes, a significant improvement over block Gibbs sampling. The empirical results, particularly in the energy disaggregation example, convincingly demonstrate the superiority of HBAS in terms of mixing efficiency and predictive accuracy. The discussion of extensions, such as varying Hamming ball radii or applying the method to other models, adds depth and broadens the potential impact of the work.
Weaknesses
One notable limitation is that the algorithm does not explicitly address escaping local maxima caused by similar states in parallel chains. While the authors mention potential extensions, such as adaptive radius tuning, these are not explored in detail. Additionally, the paper could benefit from a more thorough discussion of the computational trade-offs involved in choosing the Hamming ball radius \(m\). Efficient implementation details, particularly for sampling from the Hamming ball, are sparse and should be elaborated to aid reproducibility. Sections l215-l230, which are relatively trivial, could be moved to an appendix to streamline the main text. Lastly, the comparison in Figure 3 should be scaled by real computational complexity rather than iterations for a fairer evaluation of algorithmic efficiency.
Recommendation
Overall, this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of efficient sampling for FHMMs and related models. The proposed HBAS algorithm addresses a critical bottleneck in FHMM inference and demonstrates clear advantages over existing methods. Despite some minor weaknesses, the paper is technically sound, original, and impactful. I recommend acceptance, provided the authors address the suggested revisions, particularly regarding implementation details and fairer empirical comparisons.
