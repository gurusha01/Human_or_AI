This paper addresses the critical problem of aggregating noisy labels in crowdsourcing systems, particularly under adversarial conditions, which extends beyond the random worker paradigm explored in prior work. The authors propose novel reputation-based algorithms leveraging user disagreements and optimal semi-matchings to identify and filter adversarial workers. These algorithms are shown to improve the accuracy of three widely-used label aggregation methods, demonstrating both theoretical guarantees and empirical effectiveness on real-world datasets.
Strengths:
1. Originality and Scope: The paper tackles a broader class of adversarial strategies than prior work, including deterministic and sophisticated adversaries. This generalization is significant, as it aligns with real-world scenarios where adversarial behavior is diverse and unpredictable.
2. Novel Algorithmic Contributions: The proposed reputation algorithms (soft and hard penalty schemes) are innovative and computationally efficient. The use of optimal semi-matchings to distribute penalties in a load-balanced manner is particularly noteworthy.
3. Theoretical Rigor: The authors establish strong theoretical guarantees, including bounds on the minimum damage caused by sophisticated adversaries. The results provide a fundamental understanding of the limits of adversarial impact in crowdsourcing systems.
4. Empirical Validation: The algorithms are evaluated on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating significant improvements in vote aggregation quality. The ability to enhance simpler aggregation methods like majority voting to match the performance of more complex algorithms is a practical contribution.
5. Adversary Detection: The reputation scores align well with worker reliability, effectively identifying various adversarial strategies, including uniform, malicious, and random labeling patterns.
Weaknesses:
1. Assumptions on User Behavior: The paper relies on strong assumptions, such as honest workers having consistent reliability and adversaries having full knowledge of honest worker labels. These assumptions may not hold in practical scenarios, limiting the generalizability of the results.
2. Motivation for Ignoring Agreement: The decision to penalize disagreements without giving credit for agreements is unclear, especially in cases where adversaries lack knowledge of voting patterns. This could lead to over-penalizing honest workers in some settings.
3. Dependency on Thresholds: The empirical results depend on the removal of a fixed percentage (e.g., 20%) of workers. Exploring the sensitivity of the results to this threshold would strengthen the conclusions.
4. Limited Analysis of Real-World Applicability: While the algorithms perform well on datasets, the paper could benefit from a deeper discussion of practical deployment challenges, such as scalability to larger crowdsourcing systems or dynamic worker behavior.
Recommendation:
Overall, this paper makes a strong contribution to the field of crowdsourcing and adversarial learning. Its theoretical and empirical results are promising, and the proposed algorithms are both novel and practical. However, the reliance on potentially unrealistic assumptions and the lack of exploration of threshold sensitivity are notable limitations. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address these concerns.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Novel and generalizable approach to adversarial crowdsourcing.
- Strong theoretical guarantees and practical improvements in aggregation accuracy.
- Empirical validation across diverse datasets.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Reliance on strong assumptions about user behavior and adversary knowledge.
- Limited exploration of parameter sensitivity and practical deployment challenges.
Final Rating: Accept with Minor Revisions
