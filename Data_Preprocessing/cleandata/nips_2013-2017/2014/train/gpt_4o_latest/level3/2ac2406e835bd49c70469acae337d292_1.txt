The paper presents a novel spectral learning approach for Mixtures of Hidden Markov Models (MHMMs), leveraging the Method of Moments (MoM) to address computational inefficiencies of traditional Expectation-Maximization (EM) methods. The authors propose a method to resolve the permutation ambiguity inherent in MoM-based learning by exploiting the spectral properties of a global transition matrix, enabling recovery of block-diagonal structure and individual HMM parameters. The paper demonstrates the approach on synthetic and real-world datasets, emphasizing computational efficiency and potential as an initialization scheme for EM.
Strengths:
1. Theoretical Contribution: The paper provides a clear theoretical foundation for viewing MHMMs as single HMMs with block-diagonal transition matrices. This insight is leveraged to develop a novel depermutation algorithm, which is a valuable contribution to the field.
2. Computational Efficiency: The proposed method is computationally cheaper than EM, making it suitable for large datasets. This is a significant advantage for practical applications.
3. Real-World Applicability: The inclusion of experiments on real data (e.g., handwritten character trajectories) demonstrates the method's potential in practical scenarios.
4. Clarity of Methodology: The paper is generally well-written, with a clear explanation of the spectral learning algorithm and its steps, including the depermutation process.
Weaknesses:
1. Algorithm Feasibility: The reliance on accurately estimating full HMM parameters before recovering the block-diagonal structure seems impractical for noisy, real-world data. The authors should clarify the conditions under which their method is expected to perform well.
2. Sparse Transition Matrix: The paper lacks guarantees that the learned transition matrix will be sparse, which raises concerns about robustness in noisy scenarios. This limitation should be addressed or discussed in more detail.
3. Noise in Experiments: The experiments focus on depermuting matrices rather than learning parameters from noisy observed data, limiting the evaluation's realism. Future work should include experiments with more realistic noise levels in the transition matrices.
4. Experimental Details: Section 4.2 lacks sufficient information about the specifics of the transition and observation matrix parameters, making it difficult to assess reproducibility and the generalizability of results.
5. EM Initialization: The observation that EM initialized with spectral learning performs worse than spectral learning alone (Table 1) is counterintuitive and requires further explanation.
6. Minor Errors: There is a subscript error in Section 3.2.1, and some figures have text and numbers that are too small to read clearly.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper provides a novel and computationally efficient approach to MHMM learning, which is a challenging problem in machine learning.
- The theoretical insights and spectral depermutation algorithm are significant contributions that could inspire further research.
- The method has potential as a practical initialization scheme for EM, as demonstrated in real-world experiments.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The method's feasibility in noisy, real-world scenarios is questionable, and the experiments do not adequately address this concern.
- Lack of guarantees for sparsity in the learned transition matrix limits its applicability to certain domains.
- Insufficient experimental details and unclear results regarding EM initialization reduce confidence in the findings.
Recommendation:
While the paper makes a valuable theoretical contribution and proposes a computationally efficient method, its practical applicability and experimental rigor leave room for improvement. I recommend acceptance with major revisions, focusing on addressing noise robustness, providing guarantees for sparsity, and clarifying experimental details.
