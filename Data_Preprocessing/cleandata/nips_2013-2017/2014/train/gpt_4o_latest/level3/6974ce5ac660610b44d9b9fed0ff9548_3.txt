The paper addresses the semi-metric labeling problem, a challenging optimization task central to energy minimization in Markov Random Fields (MRFs). By leveraging second-order MRFs and semi-metric proportional functions, the authors propose a novel framework that bridges the gap between move-making algorithms and linear programming (LP) relaxation-based rounding procedures. The work generalizes prior research by introducing move-making algorithms that match the approximation guarantees of a broad class of parallel randomized rounding procedures for arbitrary semi-metrics. This contribution is significant, as it unifies and extends existing results while providing a deeper theoretical understanding of the problem.
Strengths:
1. Technical Quality: The paper is technically sound, with rigorous proofs and clear theoretical guarantees. The authors demonstrate that their proposed move-making algorithms achieve multiplicative bounds that exactly match the approximation factors of corresponding rounding procedures. This tightness is a notable advancement over prior work, which often focused on specific distance functions or lacked generality.
2. Originality: The introduction of the Interval Move and Hierarchical Move algorithms is novel. These algorithms generalize existing methods, such as range expansion, to arbitrary semi-metrics. The hierarchical move-making algorithm, in particular, extends the applicability of hierarchical graph cuts to non-HST metrics, which is a meaningful innovation.
3. Clarity: The paper is well-written and well-structured, with a logical progression from problem definition to theoretical results. The algorithms are described in sufficient detail, making it easier for readers to follow and potentially reproduce the results.
4. Significance: The work provides a significant contribution to the field by establishing a theoretical link between move-making algorithms and LP relaxation rounding. This connection not only advances the state of the art in semi-metric labeling but also has practical implications, as the proposed algorithms are computationally efficient and scalable.
Weaknesses:
1. Experimental Validation: While the theoretical contributions are robust, the paper defers experimental results to a technical report. Including empirical comparisons within the main text would strengthen the paper by demonstrating the practical advantages of the proposed algorithms.
2. Generality of Rounding Procedures: Although the paper focuses on parallel rounding procedures, it does not fully explore whether similar guarantees can be extended to other types of rounding methods. This limitation leaves room for further exploration.
3. Complexity Analysis: While the authors highlight the computational efficiency of their algorithms compared to LP relaxation, a more detailed empirical analysis of runtime performance across diverse problem instances would be beneficial.
Recommendation:
This paper makes a strong theoretical contribution to the field of semi-metric labeling and energy minimization. Its generalization of move-making algorithms and the tight guarantees it provides are both novel and impactful. While the lack of experimental results in the main text is a drawback, the theoretical insights alone justify acceptance. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to include a brief summary of experimental findings or runtime comparisons to strengthen the practical relevance of the work.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Novel and generalizable algorithms with tight theoretical guarantees.
- Significant contribution to understanding the relationship between move-making and LP relaxation.
- Clear and well-structured presentation of technical results.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Lack of experimental results in the main text.
- Limited exploration of other rounding procedures beyond parallel rounding.
Overall, the paper is a valuable addition to the conference and will likely stimulate further research in this area.
