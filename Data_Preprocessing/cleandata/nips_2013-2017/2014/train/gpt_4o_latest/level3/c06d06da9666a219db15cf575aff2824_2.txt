The paper introduces a novel signal recovery algorithm, Continuous Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (COMP), which combines elements of Continuous Basis Pursuit (CBP) and Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP). COMP addresses the problem of recovering sparse signals composed of time-shifted and scaled copies of known waveforms, with applications such as spike sorting in neural data. The authors extend CBP by incorporating a singular value decomposition (SVD)-based basis, employing a greedy recovery strategy inspired by OMP, and refining time-shift estimates in the Fourier domain. Simulation results demonstrate that COMP outperforms CBP in both speed and accuracy, particularly when using the SVD basis.
Strengths
1. Technical Quality: The paper is technically sound and well-supported by theoretical insights and experimental results. The use of SVD-derived bases is a significant innovation, as it optimally captures the structure of shifted waveforms, outperforming previously used Taylor and polar bases. The Fourier domain refinement further enhances the precision of time-shift estimates.
2. Clarity: The paper is well-written and logically organized. The authors provide detailed explanations of both CBP and COMP, making the contributions and improvements clear. The inclusion of simulation and neural data results effectively demonstrates the algorithm's advantages.
3. Originality: The work is novel in its combination of CBP and OMP methodologies, as well as its introduction of the SVD basis and Fourier domain refinement. These innovations represent meaningful advancements over prior methods in sparse signal recovery.
4. Significance: The results are impactful, showing substantial improvements in both speed and accuracy over CBP. The algorithm's robustness to noise and its ability to handle wide time bins make it highly practical for real-world applications, particularly in neuroscience.
Weaknesses
1. Computational Complexity: While COMP is faster than CBP, the constrained optimization step during the greedy selection process can still be computationally intensive, especially for large-scale problems. The authors could provide more details on how this step scales with the size of the dictionary.
2. Evaluation Scope: The paper focuses primarily on simulated and neural data. While these are compelling use cases, additional experiments on other types of sparse signals could further validate the algorithm's generalizability.
3. Comparison with Other Methods: The paper compares COMP primarily with CBP. A broader comparison with other state-of-the-art sparse recovery techniques, such as CoSaMP or Subspace Pursuit, would strengthen the evaluation.
