Review of the Paper
This paper proposes a novel active learning algorithm for parametric linear regression with random design, aiming to improve the convergence rate over passive learning by reducing the distribution-dependent risk constant. The authors leverage a stratification technique inspired by Monte Carlo function integration to approach the optimal risk via piecewise constant approximations. The paper builds on prior work, particularly Hsu et al. (2012) and Hsu and Sabato (2014), and claims to provide finite sample convergence guarantees for general distributions under a potentially misspecified model.
Strengths:
1. Motivation and Context: The paper addresses an important problem in active learning for regression, where the potential for improvement over passive learning lies in reducing the constant in the convergence rate. This is a meaningful contribution to the field, as active learning for regression has been less explored compared to classification.
2. Theoretical Ambition: The authors attempt to provide finite sample guarantees and explicitly consider the impact of heteroscedasticity and heavy-tailed distributions, which are practical concerns in real-world regression problems.
3. Novelty: The use of stratification techniques from Monte Carlo integration in the context of active learning is an interesting and novel approach. The idea of approximating the oracle risk through increasingly refined partitions is conceptually appealing.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity and Organization: The paper is difficult to follow due to unclear writing and poor organization. Key terms, such as `||X||_*` in Equation (1), are not defined earlier, making the mathematical exposition hard to parse. The derivations of the main theorems, particularly Theorem 2.1 and the transition from Lemma 3.1 to Theorem 5.1, are unclear and possibly incorrect.
2. Technical Soundness: The theorem from Hsu et al. (2014) is misquoted, which undermines the foundation of the proposed work. Additionally, the derivation of \(L(W, P) = L(W, D)\) on page 3 seems flawed, even though the result might still hold.
3. Empirical Validation: The paper lacks experimental results to validate its claims. Without empirical evidence, it is difficult to assess the practical benefits of the proposed active learning algorithm, particularly in real-world scenarios.
4. Heavy-Tailed Distributions: The impact of an unbounded \(\Lambda_D\) on the main theorem is not adequately addressed, leaving a significant gap in the analysis for heavy-tailed distributions. Similarly, the gap between Lemma 3.1 and Theorem 5.1 could be substantial in such cases.
5. Significance: While the theoretical framework is interesting, the lack of real-world experiments and empirical validation diminishes the practical significance of the work. The claims remain speculative without concrete evidence.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper tackles an underexplored problem in active learning for regression.
- The use of stratification techniques is novel and could inspire future research.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The paper is technically unsound in parts, with unclear derivations and misquoted prior work.
- The lack of empirical validation severely limits the impact and credibility of the claims.
- The writing and organization need significant improvement for clarity and accessibility.
Recommendation: Reject. While the paper presents an interesting idea, the lack of clarity, technical issues, and absence of empirical validation make it unsuitable for acceptance in its current form. The authors are encouraged to revise the paper, address the technical flaws, and provide experimental results to support their claims.
