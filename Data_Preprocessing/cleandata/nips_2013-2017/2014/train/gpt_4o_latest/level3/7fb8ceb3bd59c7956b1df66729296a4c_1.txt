This paper presents a rational model for algorithm selection, leveraging problem features and Bayesian regression, and applies it to both computational and cognitive domains. The authors frame algorithm selection as a metareasoning problem, proposing a value-of-computation (VOC) metric to optimize algorithm choice. Their model demonstrates superior performance in sorting algorithm selection compared to state-of-the-art methods, such as Guo's decision-tree approach and Lagoudakis et al.'s recursive method. Additionally, the paper extends its framework to model human cognitive strategy selection, showing that human behavior aligns more closely with their model than with existing psychological theories like RELACS, SSL, or SCADS.
Strengths:
The paper addresses an important and interdisciplinary problem, bridging algorithm selection in computer science and cognitive strategy selection in psychology. It is well-written, clearly structured, and provides both theoretical insights and empirical validation. The computational results are robust, with rigorous comparisons against other methods, which is commendable given that such comparisons are often lacking in similar works. The experimental validation of the cognitive model is another highlight, as it demonstrates the applicability of the proposed framework beyond computational tasks. The authors also provide detailed evaluations, such as feature-based learning and runtime performance, which strengthen the scientific contribution.
Weaknesses:
One concern is that the model's success may rely more heavily on the feature-based problem decomposition than on the rational inference framework itself. While the authors justify their use of Bayesian regression for VOC estimation, it would be valuable to compare their approach against more sophisticated reinforcement learning (RL) models with function approximation, rather than the simpler RL models used. This would help clarify whether the performance gains are due to the rational metareasoning framework or the specific implementation choices. Additionally, some parts of the paper, such as Equations 11-12, are complex and could benefit from clearer explanations or supplementary materials. Minor issues include the use of tiny fonts in Figure 1 and a grammatical error on line 38.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:
Pros:
- Novel and interdisciplinary approach combining AI and cognitive science.
- Strong computational results with rigorous comparisons.
- Experimental validation of the cognitive model.
- Clear writing and organization, with a well-motivated problem statement.
Cons:
- Potential over-reliance on feature-based decomposition.
- Lack of comparison with advanced RL models.
- Some complex sections could hinder accessibility for readers.
Recommendation:
This paper makes a significant contribution to both AI and cognitive science by proposing a novel framework for algorithm and strategy selection. While there are areas for improvement, such as additional comparisons and clearer explanations, the strengths outweigh the weaknesses. I recommend acceptance, with minor revisions to address the noted concerns.
