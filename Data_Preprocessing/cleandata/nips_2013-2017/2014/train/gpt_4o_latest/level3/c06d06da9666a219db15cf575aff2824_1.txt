The paper introduces a novel method, Continuous Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (COMP), for recovering the timings and amplitudes of waveforms in signals composed of shifted and scaled copies of known waveforms. Building upon the Continuous Basis Pursuit (CBP) framework, the authors propose two key innovations: (1) using a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)-derived basis to optimally represent translated waveforms and achieve theoretical mean squared error (MSE) optimality, and (2) replacing the convex optimization solver in CBP with a greedy algorithm inspired by Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP). The latter is further enhanced with Fourier domain refinements for more precise spike timing and faster computation. The proposed method demonstrates significant improvements in computational efficiency and accuracy, particularly when applied to spike-sorting tasks in both simulated and neural data.
Strengths:
1. Technical Novelty and Originality: The combination of SVD-based basis selection and a greedy algorithm with Fourier domain refinements is a novel contribution to sparse recovery and spike-sorting. The method leverages the strengths of CBP while addressing its computational inefficiencies.
2. Theoretical Soundness: The use of SVD to define basis functions is well-motivated and theoretically justified, offering optimal representation of waveform translations.
3. Computational Efficiency: The greedy COMP algorithm is shown to be significantly faster than CBP, particularly for small bin sizes (âˆ†), as demonstrated in Figure 3c. This improvement is critical for real-time applications such as neural data processing.
4. Empirical Validation: The method is rigorously tested on both simulated and real neural data, showing robustness to noise and outperforming CBP in accuracy and speed. The use of neural data further highlights the practical applicability of COMP to spike-sorting tasks.
5. Clarity of Results: The paper provides clear and detailed comparisons of COMP and CBP across multiple metrics (e.g., hit error, false positives, computational time), strengthening the empirical claims.
Weaknesses:
1. Limited Evaluation Scope: While the results are promising, the evaluation is primarily focused on two waveforms in simulated data and a single neural dataset. Broader testing on diverse datasets and more complex spike-sorting scenarios would strengthen the paper's claims.
2. Unclear Noise Units: The noise units in Figures 2(g) and (h) are not clearly defined, which may hinder reproducibility and interpretation of the results.
3. Minor Writing Issues: There are some erroneous or unclear sentences (e.g., lines 51, 195-196, 429) that detract from the clarity of the manuscript.
4. Mapping to Broader Applications: While the method is tailored to spike-sorting, the paper does not sufficiently discuss its potential applicability to other sparse recovery problems, which could broaden its impact.
Pro/Con Arguments for Acceptance:
Pros:
- Novel and theoretically grounded method with clear improvements over CBP.
- Significant computational speedup, making it suitable for real-time applications.
- Strong empirical results demonstrating robustness and accuracy.
Cons:
- Limited evaluation scope and unclear noise units in some figures.
- Minor clarity and writing issues.
Recommendation:
Overall, the paper presents a significant and well-executed contribution to spike-sorting and sparse recovery. Despite minor issues, the strengths outweigh the weaknesses, and the method has the potential to advance the state of the art in both computational efficiency and accuracy. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the clarity and evaluation concerns.
