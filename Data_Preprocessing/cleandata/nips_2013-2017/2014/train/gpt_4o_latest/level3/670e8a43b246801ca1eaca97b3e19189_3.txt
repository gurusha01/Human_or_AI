The paper addresses the computational challenges of bipartite ranking, specifically focusing on optimizing ranking accuracy at the top of the ranked list. The proposed algorithm, TopPush, introduces a novel approach with computational complexity linear in the number of training instances, contrasting with existing methods that scale with the number of positive-negative instance pairs. The authors provide a theoretical analysis, including a new generalization bound, and demonstrate the algorithm's empirical performance across various datasets.
Strengths:
The paper is well-written and clearly organized, making it accessible to readers. The introduction of a novel generalization bound is a significant theoretical contribution, as it shifts the focus from ranking a positive instance above any negative instance to ranking it above most negative instances. This approach is more aligned with practical applications. The use of a smooth convex surrogate and Nesterov's accelerated gradient method is computationally efficient, and the linear time complexity is a notable improvement over existing methods. The experimental section is thorough, comparing TopPush against state-of-the-art algorithms across multiple datasets and metrics, such as Pos@Top, AP, and NDCG. The scalability of TopPush, especially on large datasets, is a key advantage.
Weaknesses:
Despite its strengths, the paper has several limitations. The scope of bipartite ranking is somewhat narrow, and the lack of query handling raises questions about its broader applicability. The practical value of the proposed algorithm is unclear, given the availability of well-established methods like SVM-based approaches, which also scale linearly. The choice of a new target loss function, while theoretically justified, may not effectively promote good ranking at the top due to the absence of a position-based discount factor. Furthermore, the rationale for optimizing an upper bound on rank loss is debatable, as AUC optimization itself is not ideal for prioritizing positives at the top. The novelty of the technique, while elegant, is incremental, as it builds on existing methods like InfinitePush. Empirical results show mixed performance, with no significant gains in popular metrics like AP and NDCG compared to baselines like logistic regression.
Decision and Suggestions:
After revisions, the paper demonstrates improved clarity and addresses some concerns. However, critical issues remain, such as the practical relevance of the new loss function and the lack of significant computational advantage over logistic regression. While the paper is interesting and provides a valuable contribution to the theory of bipartite ranking, its practical impact is limited. Acceptance is recommended, but further revisions are needed to strengthen the case for its practical utility and address the concerns about the target loss function and comparisons with simpler baselines.
Overall Impression:
The paper is a solid contribution to the field of bipartite ranking, with a novel theoretical perspective and efficient algorithmic design. However, its practical significance and novelty are somewhat limited. It will likely be of interest to researchers in ranking and optimization but would benefit from additional work to broaden its applicability and demonstrate clearer advantages over existing methods.
