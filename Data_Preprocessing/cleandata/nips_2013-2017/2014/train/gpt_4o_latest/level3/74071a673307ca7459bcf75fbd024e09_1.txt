The paper introduces a novel framework for constructing structured priors in Bayesian models using the maximum entropy principle, which is a significant contribution to the field of probabilistic modeling. The authors address the challenge of intractability in optimal prior computation by proposing a parameterized approximation method based on submodular optimization. This approach is particularly relevant for high-dimensional data, such as functional neuroimaging, where sparsity and structural constraints are critical for meaningful inference.
The proposed framework is technically sound, with rigorous theoretical analysis and experimental validation. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method on both simulated and real-world fMRI data, showing superior performance in support recovery and predictive accuracy compared to baseline models like Lasso, Ridge, and Spike-and-Slab priors. The use of submodular optimization, which guarantees a (1 - 1/e) approximation to the global optimum, is a notable strength, as it ensures computational feasibility while maintaining theoretical guarantees.
The paper is well-written and organized, with clear explanations of the methodology and its implications. The authors discuss both the strengths and limitations of their approach, such as the reliance on convex subsets for tractable inference and the mean-field assumption in certain cases. This balanced discussion enhances the credibility of the work. However, minor typographical errors were noted on Page 4, lines 210 and 211, where "Corollary 10" should be "Corollary 6." Additionally, the references require formatting consistency.
The originality of the work is evident, as it extends the maximum entropy principle to structured priors in a novel way and introduces a computationally efficient approximation method. The paper adequately references related work and situates its contributions within the broader context of Bayesian modeling and sparse inference.
The significance of the proposed approach is high, as it addresses a critical problem in high-dimensional data analysis and has potential applications in neuroscience and beyond. The experimental results on fMRI data are particularly compelling, as they demonstrate the method's ability to recover biologically plausible brain regions and achieve positive predictive performance where baseline models fail.
Recommendation:
I recommend acceptance of this paper. Its technical rigor, originality, and potential impact make it a valuable contribution to the field. Minor revisions to address typographical errors and reference formatting are suggested.
