The paper introduces a novel approach to blind source separation (BSS) by incorporating signal aggregate constraints (SACs) into an additive factorial hidden Markov model (AFHMM). This method, termed AFHMM+SAC, addresses the inherent unidentifiability of BSS problems by leveraging domain knowledge about the aggregate signal values of sources. The authors reformulate the problem as a convex quadratic program (CQP) for efficient inference, demonstrating its utility in energy disaggregation tasks. The proposed method is evaluated on synthetic and real-world datasets, showing significant improvements over baseline AFHMM and state-of-the-art AFAMAP methods.
Strengths:
The paper is well-written, with a clear problem motivation and a strong mathematical foundation. The introduction of SACs is a novel contribution to the BSS literature, offering a practical way to incorporate domain knowledge. The use of a CQP for relaxed MAP inference is technically sound and computationally efficient. The experimental results are compelling, showing substantial performance improvements in normalized disaggregation error (NDE) and signal aggregate error (SAE) metrics. The authors also provide a robust theoretical justification for their approach, linking it to posterior regularization frameworks. The evaluation on both synthetic and real-world energy disaggregation datasets demonstrates the method's practical applicability and robustness.
Weaknesses:
While the results are promising, the paper has some limitations. The comparison with AFHMM without SAC and AFAMAP may be unfair due to differing data usage, as the SACs rely on additional domain knowledge. Alternative approaches that incorporate SACs should be explored for a more equitable comparison. Figure 1 lacks clarity and could be improved to better convey the relationship between constraint accuracy and performance. Additionally, the results suggest potential performance degradation with poorly specified constraints, which contradicts the claim of consistent improvement. The authors could also explore more complex and practical constraints, such as appliance usage rules, to enhance the model's generalizability. Finally, the paper does not discuss how the method could handle diverse constraint types, which limits its applicability to other domains.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:
Pros:
1. Novel and practical contribution to BSS through the introduction of SACs.
2. Significant performance improvements on real-world energy disaggregation tasks.
3. Strong theoretical grounding and efficient computational implementation.
4. Clear problem motivation and relevance to real-world applications.
Cons:
1. Potentially unfair comparisons due to differing data assumptions.
2. Limited exploration of alternative SAC-based methods and diverse constraints.
3. Lack of clarity in some result visualizations and contradictory claims about constraint robustness.
Recommendation:
Overall, the paper makes a valuable contribution to the field of BSS and energy disaggregation. Despite some limitations in comparison methodology and result clarity, the proposed AFHMM+SAC demonstrates significant advancements in performance and practical applicability. I recommend acceptance, with minor revisions to address the issues of comparison fairness, result clarity, and exploration of more complex constraints.
