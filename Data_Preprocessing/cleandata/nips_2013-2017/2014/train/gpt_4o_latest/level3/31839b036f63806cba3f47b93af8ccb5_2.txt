This paper addresses the challenging problem of inferring causal and probabilistic queries from datasets corrupted by missing observations, introducing novel necessary and sufficient conditions for recoverability. Building on the foundational work of Mohan et al. [2013], the authors extend the framework of Missingness Graphs (m-graphs) by incorporating the missing data generating mechanism into the causal diagram. This extension allows for a more comprehensive analysis of recoverability, particularly in scenarios where missingness mechanisms interact or influence one another. The paper also provides new graphical criteria for identifying non-recoverability, which is a valuable addition to the existing literature.
The paper is clearly written and well-organized, with a logical progression from foundational concepts to novel contributions. It systematically refines prior results, such as the sequential factorization theorem, and generalizes them to a broader class of problems, including those with interacting missingness mechanisms. The authors also introduce new algorithms and graphical conditions for recoverability, which are rigorously supported by theoretical proofs. Notably, the paper demonstrates that causal queries, such as \(P(y|do(x))\), can be recoverable even when probabilistic queries like \(P(y, x)\) are not, a significant insight with practical implications for causal inference in the presence of missing data.
The originality of the work is evident in its extension of existing frameworks and its focus on previously unexplored scenarios, such as the recovery of causal effects when variables and their missingness mechanisms are not d-separable. The application of these results to attrition problems in longitudinal studies further highlights the practical relevance of the contributions. The paper also situates its work within the broader context of related methodologies, including imputation-based methods, inverse probability weighting, and coarsened data frameworks, while clearly delineating its novel contributions.
In terms of significance, the results presented in this paper advance the state of the art in analyzing causal mechanisms with missing data. The graphical conditions and algorithms introduced here are likely to be of interest to both researchers and practitioners working on causal inference, particularly in fields where missing data is a pervasive issue, such as social sciences, healthcare, and longitudinal studies.
Strengths:
1. The paper introduces novel and generalizable conditions for recoverability, extending prior work.
2. It rigorously addresses both recoverability and non-recoverability, filling a gap in the literature.
3. The application to attrition problems demonstrates practical utility.
4. The writing is clear, and the theoretical contributions are well-supported by proofs.
Weaknesses:
1. While the theoretical contributions are strong, the paper could benefit from empirical validation or simulations to demonstrate the practical performance of the proposed methods.
2. Some of the technical details, such as the definitions of d*-separation and inducing paths, may be challenging for readers unfamiliar with advanced causal inference concepts.
Arguments for acceptance:
- The paper makes a significant theoretical contribution to the field of causal inference with missing data.
- It extends and generalizes existing frameworks, addressing previously unexplored scenarios.
- The results are well-supported by rigorous proofs and have practical implications.
Arguments against acceptance:
- The lack of empirical validation limits the immediate applicability of the results.
- The technical depth may make the paper less accessible to a broader audience.
Overall, this paper represents a valuable advancement in the field of causal inference and is recommended for acceptance, provided the authors consider adding empirical demonstrations to complement their theoretical contributions.
