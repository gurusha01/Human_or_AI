This paper addresses the multitask learning problem by proposing a new norm, the scaled latent trace norm, to improve performance in tensor-based learning settings with heterogeneous dimensions. The authors provide theoretical analysis, including error bounds and sample complexity comparisons, and validate their approach through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets. The scaled latent trace norm is shown to outperform existing norms, particularly in settings where tensor dimensions or ranks are inhomogeneous.
Strengths:
The paper is well-written and clearly presented, making it accessible to readers with varying levels of expertise in tensor-based learning. The theoretical contributions are significant, with rigorous derivations of error bounds for empirical and true risks across different norms. The authors also provide a comprehensive comparison of sample complexities for matrix completion, multitask learning, and multilinear multitask learning, which enhances the paper's relevance to a broad audience. The experimental results are compelling, demonstrating the scaled latent trace norm's advantage in multitask learning scenarios with inhomogeneous dimensions. The use of both synthetic and real-world datasets strengthens the empirical validation and highlights the practical utility of the proposed method.
Weaknesses:
While the scaled latent trace norm addresses specific limitations of existing norms, its contribution is incremental relative to prior work. The improvement in sample complexity over the latent trace norm is marginal and highly context-dependent, which may limit its broader applicability. Additionally, the error bounds for all norms are proportional to the number of training samples raised to -1/2, which reduces the distinction between the norms in terms of theoretical guarantees. The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of these limitations and their implications for practical applications.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:
Pro:
1. The paper provides a clear and rigorous theoretical framework, advancing the understanding of tensor-based multitask learning.
2. The scaled latent trace norm demonstrates empirical advantages in scenarios with heterogeneous dimensions, addressing a practical challenge in multitask learning.
3. The inclusion of both synthetic and real-world experiments enhances the paper's credibility and relevance.
Con:
1. The contribution of the scaled latent trace norm is incremental, with marginal improvements over existing norms in certain settings.
2. The theoretical distinction between the norms is limited, as error bounds scale similarly with the number of training samples.
3. The paper does not fully explore the broader implications or limitations of the proposed norm, leaving some questions about its generalizability.
Recommendation:
Overall, this paper makes a meaningful contribution to the field of multitask learning, particularly in scenarios involving tensors with heterogeneous dimensions. While the contribution is incremental, the combination of theoretical rigor and empirical validation makes it a valuable addition to the literature. I recommend acceptance, with the suggestion that the authors address the limitations and provide a more thorough discussion of the practical implications of their work.
