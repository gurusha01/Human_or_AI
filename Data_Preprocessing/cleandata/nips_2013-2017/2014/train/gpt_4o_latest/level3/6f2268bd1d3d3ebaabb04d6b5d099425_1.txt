The paper addresses the challenging problem of combining clustering and outlier detection, extending the Facility Location with Outliers (FLO) formulation introduced by Charikar et al. While FLO is known to be NP-hard with no scalable approximation algorithms offering guarantees, the authors propose a novel Lagrangian Relaxation (LR) approach. This method is both theoretically intriguing and practically relevant, offering a subgradient-based algorithm that is scalable and memory-efficient. A key theoretical contribution is the demonstration of equivalence between the LP relaxation and the LR relaxation of FLO, which is both non-intuitive and significant. The experimental results validate the method's scalability and effectiveness, although the lack of absolute runtime values raises concerns about its practical deployment.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Originality: The paper introduces a novel LR formulation for the FLO problem, which is a significant advancement over prior work. The equivalence between LP and LR relaxation is a particularly noteworthy theoretical result.
2. Scalability: The proposed method is shown to scale well to large datasets, with a small memory footprint and the ability to handle large-scale clustering and outlier detection tasks effectively.
3. Practical Relevance: The algorithm automatically determines the number of clusters and identifies outliers, making it highly applicable to real-world problems.
4. Experimental Validation: The authors provide extensive experiments on synthetic and real datasets (e.g., MNIST), demonstrating the method's robustness and interpretability. The comparison with state-of-the-art methods (e.g., k-means-- and APOC) highlights its competitive performance.
5. Clarity of Contributions: The paper is well-organized, with clear problem formulation, algorithmic details, and theoretical analysis.
Weaknesses:
1. Runtime Analysis: While the paper emphasizes the scalability of the LR method, the absence of absolute runtime values in the experiments makes it difficult to assess its practical efficiency compared to other methods.
2. Step Size Optimization: The subgradient method used for optimization could benefit from a more sophisticated step-size selection strategy, as the current approach requires many iterations to converge.
3. Limited Real-World Applications: Although MNIST results are promising, the paper could strengthen its impact by demonstrating the method's utility on more diverse real-world datasets.
4. Comparative Analysis: While the method is compared to k-means-- and APOC, additional comparisons with other robust clustering and outlier detection methods would provide a more comprehensive evaluation.
Pro Acceptance Arguments:
- The paper makes a significant theoretical and practical contribution to the field of clustering and outlier detection.
- The LR formulation is novel, and the equivalence with LP relaxation is a strong theoretical result.
