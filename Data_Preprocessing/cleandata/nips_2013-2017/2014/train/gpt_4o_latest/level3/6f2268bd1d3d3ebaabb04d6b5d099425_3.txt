The paper presents a novel approach to joint clustering and outlier detection by extending the Facility Location with Outliers (FLO) problem. The authors propose a Lagrangian relaxation of the FLO problem and employ a subgradient method to solve it. This formulation is notable for its ability to automatically determine the number of clusters while simultaneously identifying outliers. The paper is well-written and organized, with a clear exposition of the problem formulation, theoretical analysis, and experimental evaluation.
Strengths:  
The primary strength of this work lies in its originality. While clustering and outlier detection have traditionally been treated as separate problems, this paper proposes a unified framework that integrates both tasks. The use of Lagrangian relaxation to solve the FLO problem is novel within the machine learning community, and the theoretical analysis of the method, including its equivalence to a linear programming relaxation and convergence properties, is rigorous and well-founded. The proposed method is scalable, memory-efficient, and easily parallelizable, making it suitable for large datasets. Additionally, the authors provide a detailed comparison with existing methods, such as k-means-- and an affinity propagation-based approach (APOC), and highlight the advantages of their method in terms of memory usage and interpretability.
Weaknesses:  
Despite its theoretical contributions, the experimental results are underwhelming. On both synthetic datasets and MNIST, the proposed method does not demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods like k-means--. While the method is robust to the misspecification of the number of outliers, its performance gains are marginal. Furthermore, the approach requires the user to specify the number of outliers and cluster creation costs, which can be challenging to define in practice. This limits the method's applicability in real-world scenarios where such parameters are not readily available. The reviewer also notes that the experimental evaluation could benefit from additional baselines and datasets to strengthen the empirical claims. Lastly, Definition 2 in the paper should be relabeled as a Proposition for consistency with mathematical conventions.
Suggestions for Improvement:  
The authors are encouraged to explore non-partitional clustering approaches where clustering and outlier detection are inherently unified, potentially eliminating the need for user-defined parameters like the number of outliers. Additionally, incorporating more diverse datasets and baselines in the experimental section could provide a stronger case for the method's practical utility. Refining the step-size computation in the subgradient method may also improve convergence speed and overall performance.
Recommendation:  
While the experimental results are not groundbreaking, the paper introduces a novel and theoretically sound approach to a challenging problem. The ideas presented are interesting and have the potential to inspire further research in this area. I recommend accepting the paper for a poster presentation, provided the authors address the experimental limitations and parameter dependency in future work.
