This paper presents a novel algorithm for solving the balanced k-cut problem using a tight continuous relaxation, applicable in both classical and transductive clustering settings. The authors address limitations of existing methods, such as spectral clustering, by proposing a relaxation that is theoretically tighter and empirically more effective. They also introduce a monotonic descent optimization algorithm for the challenging sum-of-ratios minimization problem, which ensures convergence to feasible solutions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, including spectral clustering, Graclus, and recent nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF)-based methods, across a variety of datasets and balancing functions.
The paper builds on prior work in spectral clustering and continuous relaxations for graph cuts, such as those by [11] and [13]. While spectral clustering has been a popular approach, it is known to yield loose relaxations, particularly for k > 2. The authors improve upon these by introducing membership and size constraints, which ensure that the continuous relaxation yields valid partitions. The proposed method also generalizes to asymmetric and application-specific balancing functions, making it versatile for diverse clustering tasks.
Strengths:
1. Technical Novelty: The paper introduces a tighter continuous relaxation for the balanced k-cut problem, addressing key limitations of prior relaxations. The inclusion of membership and size constraints is a significant improvement over existing methods.
2. Algorithmic Contribution: The monotonic descent algorithm for sum-of-ratios minimization is a notable contribution, ensuring convergence and providing a robust optimization framework.
3. Empirical Performance: The method consistently achieves superior results in terms of balanced k-cuts and clustering error across a wide range of datasets, outperforming both classical and recent approaches.
4. Flexibility: The ability to handle various balancing functions, including asymmetric ones, and the integration of label information in transductive settings are valuable extensions.
5. Reproducibility: The authors provide detailed experimental setups and comparisons, making it easier for others to replicate their results.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity: While the paper is technically sound, the presentation is dense and may be challenging for readers unfamiliar with the mathematical background. Simplifying some sections or providing more intuitive explanations could improve accessibility.
2. Minor Issues: The introduction could be improved by reordering "frequently" and "outperform" for better readability. Additionally, the bibliography should be alphabetized to align with standard formatting guidelines.
3. Limited Discussion of Failure Cases: While the method performs well overall, the paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of scenarios where it fails or underperforms (e.g., high clustering error in some datasets despite achieving the best cuts).
