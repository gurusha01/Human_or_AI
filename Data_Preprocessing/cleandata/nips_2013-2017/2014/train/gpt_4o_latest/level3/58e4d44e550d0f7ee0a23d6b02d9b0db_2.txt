This paper investigates the fundamental limits of space complexity for streaming algorithms solving the low-rank matrix approximation problem. Specifically, it establishes a nearly tight lower bound of Ω(dk/ε) bits of space for any randomized streaming algorithm that outputs a k × d matrix \( R \) satisfying \( \|A - AR^\dagger R\|F \leq (1 + \epsilon)\|A - Ak\|_F \) with constant probability. This result significantly improves upon the previously known simple Ω(dk) lower bound by introducing an additional \( 1/\epsilon \) factor, which is particularly impactful for small values of \( \epsilon \). The authors demonstrate that their lower bound matches the upper bound of the deterministic algorithm by Ghashami and Phillips (SODA, 2014) up to the word size, thereby proving the optimality of the latter.
The paper is highly theoretical and builds on advanced techniques from communication complexity, specifically leveraging the Index problem to construct its lower bound proof. The main technical contribution lies in carefully designing a reduction that shows how the output of a streaming algorithm can be used to solve the Index problem, even when the algorithm outputs only the projection matrix \( R \) rather than the full approximation \( AR^\dagger R \). This distinction introduces significant technical challenges, which the authors address rigorously.
Strengths:
1. Significance and Originality: The result is a strong theoretical contribution to the field of streaming algorithms and low-rank approximation. By proving the optimality of existing algorithms, the paper advances our understanding of the space complexity limits in this domain.
2. Technical Depth: The proofs are well-constructed and convincing, demonstrating a deep understanding of both streaming algorithms and communication complexity.
3. Impact: The results are likely to influence future work in streaming numerical linear algebra, particularly in designing algorithms or proving bounds for related problems.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity and Readability: The paper is dense and challenging to follow, even for an expert audience. Many key proofs are relegated to the supplementary material, which detracts from the readability of the main text. Integrating at least the proof of the main theorem into the main paper would improve accessibility.
2. Minor Proof Ambiguity: The proof of Lemma 6 could benefit from additional clarification to ensure it is fully transparent to readers.
3. Limited Practical Implications: While the theoretical contribution is significant, the paper does not discuss potential practical applications or implications of the lower bound, which could broaden its appeal.
Recommendation:
The paper is above the borderline for NeurIPS in terms of quality and significance. It addresses a fundamental and challenging problem, providing a definitive result that will likely have lasting impact in the field. However, the readability issues and the lack of integration of proofs into the main text slightly detract from its overall presentation. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions, particularly to improve the clarity of Lemma 6 and to integrate more of the proofs into the main paper. 
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Strong theoretical contribution with a novel and significant result.
- Advances the state of the art in streaming low-rank approximation.
- Convincing and rigorous proofs.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Dense and difficult to follow, with key proofs relegated to the supplementary material.
- Limited discussion of practical implications.
Overall, this is a strong submission that merits inclusion in the conference, provided minor revisions are made to improve clarity.
