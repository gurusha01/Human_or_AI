The paper presents an ambitious and refreshing approach to algorithm selection by leveraging rational metareasoning (RM) as a framework for both artificial intelligence (AI) and cognitive science. The authors propose a Bayesian learning-based model for algorithm selection, evaluate it against state-of-the-art methods in sorting, and extend it to model human cognitive strategy selection. While the work addresses an important problem and achieves sensible results in a limited domain, several issues undermine its contributions.
Strengths:  
The paper tackles the underexplored intersection of algorithm selection and human strategy selection, which is a key area in AI and cognitive science. The proposed RM framework is theoretically sound and demonstrates competitive performance in sorting algorithm selection, outperforming Guo's decision-tree method and Lagoudakis et al.'s recursive approach. The behavioral experiment is well-designed, showing that human strategy selection aligns with RM predictions better than prior psychological models. The feature representation for runtime and accuracy is sensible, and the results suggest that RM could be a promising framework for adaptive strategy selection in broader domains.
Weaknesses:  
The paper leans too heavily on breadth over depth, attempting to bridge AI and cognitive science without fully addressing the nuances of either field. The choice of sorting algorithms as the evaluation domain is questionable for RM, as sorting algorithms typically exhibit perfect accuracy, limiting the relevance of RM's trade-off between runtime and correctness. The cognitive science contribution is further weakened by the unsuitability of sorting tasks for studying human strategy selection, as these tasks lack ecological validity. Additionally, the authors fail to cite foundational cognitive architectures like SOAR and ACT-R, which could provide valuable context and comparisons for their work.
The use of Bayesian linear regression over simpler alternatives like ridge regression is not well-justified, especially given the limited complexity of the feature space. While the experimental results show that RM and humans perform well, the findings lack depth in validating RM as a cognitive model. Cognitive models should ideally be trained on the same data and trials as humans to ensure better validity, which is not the case here. Minor issues include Gaussian runtime assumptions, unclear performance measures, and inconsistencies in equations and interpretations.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:  
Pro:  
- Addresses an important and underexplored problem.  
- The RM framework is theoretically sound and achieves competitive results.  
- Behavioral experiments are well-designed and provide valuable insights into human strategy selection.  
Con:  
- Limited AI contribution, with weak or unclear comparisons to existing models.  
- Cognitive science contribution undermined by the unsuitability of sorting tasks.  
- Lack of depth in validating RM as a cognitive model.  
- Failure to cite relevant prior work and justify methodological choices.  
Recommendation:  
While the paper is ambitious and provides a refreshing perspective, its contributions are limited by the choice of domain, lack of depth, and insufficient engagement with prior work. It is a promising starting point but requires significant revisions to strengthen its contributions to both AI and cognitive science. I recommend rejection in its current form but encourage resubmission after addressing these issues.
