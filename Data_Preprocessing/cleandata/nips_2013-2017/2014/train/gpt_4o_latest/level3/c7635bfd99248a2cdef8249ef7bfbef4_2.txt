The manuscript presents a novel framework, "Inference by Learning" (IbyL), for optimizing Markov Random Fields (MRFs) using a coarse-to-fine cascade of pruning classifiers. This approach addresses the computational challenges of MRF optimization by progressively reducing the solution space through a learned pruning mechanism. The authors demonstrate that their method achieves significant speed-ups while maintaining or even improving solution accuracy compared to direct optimization techniques. The framework is evaluated on three computer vision tasks—stereo matching, image restoration, and optical flow estimation—showing promising results in terms of energy minimization, labeling accuracy, and computational efficiency.
The proposed pruning scheme is innovative and practical, leveraging trained classifiers to intelligently discard labels at each scale. This is a notable departure from heuristic-based pruning methods, which often struggle with generalization and accuracy near solution discontinuities. The use of generic, energy-based features for classifier training enhances the framework's applicability across various MRF problems, a strength that aligns well with the goals of advancing general-purpose optimization techniques. The experimental results convincingly demonstrate the framework's effectiveness, with speed-up factors ranging from 3 to over 10, depending on the task, and minimal degradation in labeling accuracy.
However, the robustness of the framework's parameters, particularly the pruning aggressiveness factor (λ), remains somewhat unclear. While the authors report consistent parameter settings across datasets, further analysis of parameter sensitivity would strengthen the claims of generalizability. Additionally, the reliance on linear classifiers, though computationally efficient, may limit the pruning precision in more complex scenarios. Exploring alternative classifier architectures could be a valuable direction for future work. Minor typos on lines 90, 102-103, 155, 363, and 370 should also be addressed to improve the manuscript's polish.
Strengths:
1. Innovation: The use of learned pruning classifiers in a coarse-to-fine framework is novel and practical.
2. Significant Speed-Up: Demonstrates substantial computational efficiency gains over state-of-the-art methods.
