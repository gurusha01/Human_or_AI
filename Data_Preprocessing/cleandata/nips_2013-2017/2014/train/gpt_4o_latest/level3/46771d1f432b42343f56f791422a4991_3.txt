This paper tackles the problem of estimating the mean of a \(d\)-dimensional Gaussian distribution with unit covariance in a distributed setting, focusing on the trade-offs between communication complexity and dimensionality. The authors present several key results: (1) a direct-sum theorem proving that communication complexity scales linearly with dimensionality, implying no gains from jointly processing dimensions; (2) a reduction in communication complexity for sparse means using a thresholding-based protocol; (3) an improved upper bound for communication in the scalar case; and (4) a tighter lower bound for simultaneous protocols. These contributions are significant in advancing our understanding of distributed statistical estimation under communication constraints.
Strengths:
1. Theoretical Rigor: The paper provides a strong theoretical foundation, particularly through the direct-sum theorem, which is a generic tool applicable beyond Gaussian mean estimation. The use of information complexity as a proxy for communication complexity is well-motivated and aligns with prior work in communication complexity.
2. Novel Contributions: The results on sparse mean estimation and the conjectured trade-off between communication cost and squared loss are particularly compelling. The improved bounds for simultaneous protocols and the scalar case also advance the state of the art.
3. Clarity of Results: The results are clearly stated, with theoretical bounds supported by rigorous proofs. The connection between the \(d\)-dimensional and 1-dimensional problems is well-articulated, leveraging existing results effectively.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity Issues: While the paper is generally well-written, some transitions in the theoretical framework are not sufficiently clear. For example, the transition of \(\theta\) from a constant to a random variable in the context of conditional mutual information should be explicitly clarified.
2. Notation and Edge Cases: There are minor issues with notation, such as the subscript of \(Y_i\) in Protocol 2, which could confuse readers. Additionally, the minimax rate in Corollary 3.1 does not account for certain edge cases, which should be addressed for completeness.
3. Practical Implications: The paper focuses heavily on theoretical results but provides limited discussion on the practical implications of the proposed protocols, particularly in real-world distributed systems.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:
Pros:
- The paper addresses a fundamental problem in distributed learning and provides significant theoretical contributions.
- The direct-sum theorem is a versatile tool that could inspire further research in related areas.
- The results on sparse mean estimation open up new avenues for exploiting structure in distributed data.
Cons:
- Minor clarity and notation issues could hinder accessibility for a broader audience.
- The practical relevance of the results is not thoroughly explored, which may limit the paper's impact outside theoretical circles.
Recommendations:
1. Clarify the role of \(\theta\) as a random variable in the context of conditional mutual information.
2. Revise Corollary 3.1 to account for edge cases and ensure the notation is consistent throughout.
3. Include a discussion on the practical implications and potential applications of the proposed protocols.
Conclusion:
This paper makes significant theoretical contributions to the field of distributed statistical estimation, particularly in understanding the interplay between dimensionality and communication complexity. While there are minor issues with clarity and practical relevance, the strengths of the paper outweigh its weaknesses. I recommend acceptance, contingent on addressing the minor suggestions for improvement.
