The paper addresses a significant challenge in object detection: the scarcity of bounding box annotations for large-scale datasets. By proposing the Large Scale Detection through Adaptation (LSDA) algorithm, the authors aim to adapt object classifiers into object detectors, leveraging abundant image-level labels while minimizing reliance on bounding box annotations. This approach is particularly relevant for scaling detection to thousands of categories, where bounding box annotation is impractical.
The proposed LSDA algorithm is straightforward yet effective. It trains on a subset of categories with bounding box annotations and adapts the learned transformations to categories without such annotations. The method achieves a 50% relative improvement in mean average precision (mAP) over a baseline classifier on held-out categories, bridging 35% of the gap between an oracle and the baseline. This demonstrates the potential of LSDA to enable detection for categories with limited annotation resources.
The paper is well-written and clearly organized, providing sufficient technical details for reproducibility. The authors effectively situate their work within the context of prior research, particularly highlighting differences from R-CNN and other domain adaptation methods. However, some aspects could benefit from further clarification. For instance, Figure 3a comparisons should be better explained, and Figure 3b could more prominently highlight key results. Additionally, a dedicated section or table explicitly contrasting LSDA with R-CNN would enhance clarity. Minor issues include inconsistencies in the method's naming ("DNN" vs. "DDA"), a typo on line 431, and the potential removal of Figure 6 to maintain focus on core contributions.
The originality of the work lies in its novel combination of domain adaptation techniques for transforming classifiers into detectors. While not groundbreaking, the approach is innovative and addresses a practical problem. However, the long-term significance of the work is uncertain. The trade-off between reduced performance (due to fewer bounding boxes) and scalability is not objectively evaluated, and future advancements in annotation techniques may diminish the importance of the problem.
Strengths:
- Tackles a practical and relevant problem in object detection.
- Proposes a simple yet effective algorithm with promising results.
- Well-written and adequately references prior work.
Weaknesses:
- Long-term significance is unclear due to potential advancements in annotation methods.
- Trade-offs in performance are not rigorously evaluated.
- Some figures and comparisons require further clarification.
Overall, this paper presents a valuable contribution to the field and is deserving of acceptance. While its long-term impact may be limited, the proposed method offers a practical solution to a pressing challenge in large-scale object detection.
