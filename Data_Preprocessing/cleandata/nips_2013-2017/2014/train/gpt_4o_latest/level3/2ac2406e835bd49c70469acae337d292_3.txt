The paper presents a spectral method for learning a mixture of Hidden Markov Models (MHMMs), addressing the significant challenge of de-permuting the results caused by permutation ambiguities in the estimation process. The authors build upon the Hsu, Kakade, and Zhang algorithm, adapting it to the MHMM setting. While the original algorithm recovers the global transition matrix as an arbitrary permutation of the true one, the authors propose a novel depermutation algorithm that leverages the spectral properties of the global transition matrix to recover the individual HMM parameters. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method on both synthetic and real-world datasets, highlighting its computational advantages over the traditional Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm.
Strengths
1. Technical Contribution: The paper makes a meaningful contribution by extending spectral methods to the MHMM framework, which is a challenging problem due to the inherent permutation ambiguity. The depermutation algorithm is well-motivated and appears to perform reasonably well under noise, as demonstrated in the experiments.
2. Computational Efficiency: The proposed method is computationally efficient, avoiding the iterative nature of EM. This makes it particularly suitable for large datasets, as shown in the experimental results.
3. Experimental Validation: The authors provide a thorough evaluation of their approach, comparing it against EM on synthetic data and applying it to real-world data. The results suggest that the method is competitive in accuracy while being significantly faster.
4. Potential Impact: The work has practical implications for sequence clustering tasks and could inspire further research into spectral methods for other hierarchical latent variable models.
Weaknesses
1. Clarity and Organization: While the paper is technically sound, it suffers from occasional typos and could benefit from more thorough proofreading. Additionally, some sections, particularly the theoretical justifications, are dense and may be challenging for readers unfamiliar with spectral methods.
2. Contextualization: The paper does not adequately situate its contributions within the broader literature. For instance, it would benefit from a more detailed comparison to prior work, such as Chaganty and Liang's spectral methods for mixtures of linear regressions, to better highlight its novelty.
3. Assumptions and Limitations: The paper relies on certain spectral conditions (e.g., eigenvalue separation) for the depermutation algorithm to succeed. While these conditions are discussed, their practical implications and limitations are not fully explored.
4. Real-World Applicability: The real data experiment is somewhat limited in scope, focusing on a single dataset. Additional experiments on diverse datasets would strengthen the paper's claims about the method's generalizability.
Arguments for Acceptance
- The paper addresses a challenging and relevant problem, making a significant technical contribution.
- The proposed method is computationally efficient and has practical utility for large-scale sequence clustering tasks.
- The experimental results are promising and demonstrate the method's potential.
Arguments Against Acceptance
- The paper could be clearer and better organized, with more attention to proofreading and accessibility for a broader audience.
- The contextualization of the work within the existing literature is insufficient, leaving its novelty somewhat underexplored.
- The assumptions underlying the depermutation algorithm's success are not fully analyzed, and the real-world experiments are limited.
Recommendation
Overall, this paper represents a valuable contribution to the field of spectral learning for latent variable models. While there are areas for improvement, particularly in clarity and contextualization, the technical novelty and practical relevance of the work make it a strong candidate for acceptance. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the clarity and contextualization issues.
