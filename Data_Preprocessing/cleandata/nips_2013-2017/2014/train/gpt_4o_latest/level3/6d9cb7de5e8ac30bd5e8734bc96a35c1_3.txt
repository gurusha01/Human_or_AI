The paper presents a novel contribution to multitask learning by proposing the scaled latent trace norm, which addresses the limitations of existing tensor norms in handling heterogeneous task dimensions. The theoretical analysis, including error bounds and a unified comparison of tensor norms, is a significant strength of the paper and provides valuable insights into the behavior of these norms under various conditions. The authors demonstrate that the scaled latent trace norm outperforms the latent and overlapped trace norms in scenarios where tensor dimensions and ranks are heterogeneous, a common situation in real-world multitask learning problems.
The experimental results, conducted on both synthetic and real-world datasets, support the theoretical claims. However, the lack of direct comparisons to simpler matrix-based trace norms and "flat" multitask learning methods raises concerns about the practical necessity of tensor-based approaches. For instance, in the School dataset, the evaluation metrics are inconsistent with prior work, making it challenging to assess the true performance gains. Additionally, while the scaled latent trace norm shows promise, the reviewer questions whether its computational complexity and time cost are justified compared to simpler two-dimensional approaches. The paper would benefit from a more detailed discussion of the algorithm's complexity and runtime.
The novelty of scaling the latent trace norm along each mode is intriguing and aligns with related works such as "Multivariate Regression with Calibration." However, the connection to prior literature could be more explicitly discussed to position the contribution within the broader context of multitask learning research. The reviewer initially misunderstood the "mode" in the experiments but updated their evaluation after clarification from the authors, which highlights the need for clearer explanations in the manuscript.
Minor issues include confusing notation and a typographical error ("Turing" â†’ "Turning"), which should be addressed for improved clarity. Overall, the paper is theoretically robust and introduces an innovative approach to tensor-based multitask learning. However, concerns about its practical impact, efficiency, and broader applicability limit its significance. The paper would be strengthened by additional experiments comparing tensor-based and matrix-based methods, clearer algorithmic details, and consistent evaluation metrics.
Arguments for Acceptance:
1. Theoretical contributions, including error bounds and tensor norm comparisons, are strong and valuable.
2. The scaled latent trace norm addresses a critical gap in handling heterogeneous task dimensions.
3. Experimental results align with theoretical findings.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
1. Lack of comparisons to simpler matrix-based and "flat" multitask learning methods.
2. Insufficient discussion of computational complexity and runtime.
3. Inconsistent evaluation metrics in real-world datasets.
4. Practical impact and broader applicability remain unclear.
Recommendation: Borderline accept, contingent on addressing the practical concerns and providing additional comparisons to simpler methods.
