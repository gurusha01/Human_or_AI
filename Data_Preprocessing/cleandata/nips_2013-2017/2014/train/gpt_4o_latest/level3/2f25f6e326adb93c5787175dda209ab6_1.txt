The paper presents a novel extension to low-rank spectrogram-factorization models, introducing a time-domain generative model that bridges the gap between traditional nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) approaches and raw signal synthesis. By generalizing latent factors over arbitrary, potentially overcomplete, bases, the proposed Low-Rank Time-Frequency Synthesis (LRTFS) model enables multi-resolution representations, which were previously unattainable in the NMF framework. Building on Fevotte et al.'s Gaussian Composite Model (GCM), the authors expand the convolution with Gabor impulse responses to a time-domain expression and propose two expectation-maximization (EM) algorithms for parameter estimation. Applications in music decomposition and speech enhancement demonstrate the model's potential.
Strengths:  
The paper addresses a significant limitation of traditional NMF models by proposing a generative model for raw signals rather than their spectrograms. The ability to accommodate overcomplete and multi-resolution bases is a notable advancement, particularly for audio applications where different signal components (e.g., transients and tonal elements) exhibit varying time-frequency characteristics. The theoretical grounding of the model is solid, and the connection to sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) provides a broader context for the work. The experiments showcase the model's flexibility, particularly in hybrid decomposition and speech enhancement tasks, where it outperforms baseline methods like IS-NMF and OMLSA in terms of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) improvements.
Weaknesses:  
While the theoretical contributions are compelling, the paper suffers from several limitations. The estimation procedure, particularly the EM algorithms, is described in a dense and technical manner, making it difficult to follow for non-experts. The evaluation is relatively superficial, relying on limited examples and lacking a comprehensive comparison with state-of-the-art methods. The presence of artifacts in the denoised signals and the lower perceived quality compared to conventional methods like wavelet shrinkage or Wiener filtering raise concerns about the practical utility of the approach. Additionally, while the authors highlight the potential of multi-resolution modeling, the experimental results do not fully exploit or validate this capability.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:  
- Pro: The paper introduces a novel and theoretically sound extension to NMF, addressing a critical gap in the field. The multi-resolution capability and use of overcomplete bases are promising for advancing audio signal processing.  
- Con: The evaluation is insufficiently rigorous, and the artifacts in the results undermine the practical significance of the contributions. The clarity of the technical approach could be improved to make the work more accessible.
Recommendation:  
While the paper presents an interesting and potentially impactful contribution, its weaknesses in evaluation and clarity limit its immediate applicability. I recommend acceptance with major revisions, focusing on improving the clarity of the estimation procedure, expanding the experimental evaluation, and addressing the observed artifacts.
