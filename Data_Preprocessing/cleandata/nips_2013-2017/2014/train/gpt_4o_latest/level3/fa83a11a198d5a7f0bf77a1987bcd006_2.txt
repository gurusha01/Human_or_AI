The authors address an important problem in covariance matrix estimation for autocorrelated data, proposing a novel bias-corrected estimator that improves upon the Sancetta estimator. This work is motivated by the limitations of standard shrinkage methods, which assume i.i.d. data, and the high bias of the Sancetta estimator in finite samples. The authors demonstrate the theoretical soundness of their estimator and its superior performance in simulations and EEG-based brain-computer interface (BCI) experiments. While the contribution is significant, the paper suffers from several issues that hinder its clarity and impact.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Significance: The proposed bias-corrected estimator is a meaningful advancement in covariance estimation for autocorrelated data, addressing a critical gap in the literature. The authors demonstrate its robustness to hyperparameter choices and its unbiased nature (apart from truncation bias).
2. Theoretical Rigor: The theoretical analysis is strong, with clear assumptions and proofs supporting the claims of consistency and reduced bias.
3. Empirical Validation: The authors validate their estimator through simulations and real-world BCI data, showing improvements over standard shrinkage, Sancetta's method, and cross-validation in certain settings.
4. Practical Implications: The work has potential applications in fields like EEG analysis, where autocorrelation is common, and computational efficiency is critical.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity and Organization: The manuscript is difficult to follow due to unclear notation and insufficient explanations. For example, the heuristic fix to the Sancetta estimator in Section 2 is poorly explained, and the bias-corrected estimator in Equation (6) requires more detailed exposition. Expanding Section 2 while condensing the discussion could improve readability.
2. Incomplete Methodological Details: Section 4 lacks critical details about the decoding procedure, such as the number of CSP filters, frequency bands, and cross-validation setup. This omission makes it hard to assess the reproducibility of the results.
3. Unconventional Experimental Design: The use of only two trials and two CSP filters in Figures 6 and 7 is unconventional and likely exaggerates differences between estimators. A more standard approach (e.g., using six CSP filters) would provide a fairer comparison.
4. Overemphasis on Performance: The real-data results appear overly tuned to highlight the estimator's advantages, raising concerns about generalizability. Differences in performance seem to stem more from CSP component ranking than improved spatial filter estimation.
5. Minor Errors: Typos and errors, such as the missing normalization term in Equation (3) and the typo in "rate of p" (should be "rate of n"), detract from the paper's polish.
Recommendation:
While the paper makes a valuable contribution, its weaknesses, particularly in clarity and experimental design, limit its impact. I recommend a major revision to address the following:
- Improve the clarity of notation and explanations, especially in Sections 2 and 4.
- Provide complete details of the decoding procedure and use a more conventional experimental setup.
- Address the overemphasis on performance and validate the estimator using CSP filters targeting the same brain regions.
- Correct typos and minor errors.
Pro Acceptance Arguments:
- Addresses a significant problem in covariance estimation for autocorrelated data.
- Proposes a theoretically sound and practically useful estimator.
- Demonstrates improvements in simulations and real-world applications.
Con Acceptance Arguments:
- Lack of clarity and incomplete methodological details hinder reproducibility.
- Experimental design is unconventional and may exaggerate results.
- Real-data results appear overly tuned, raising concerns about generalizability.
With revisions, this paper could make a strong contribution to the field.
