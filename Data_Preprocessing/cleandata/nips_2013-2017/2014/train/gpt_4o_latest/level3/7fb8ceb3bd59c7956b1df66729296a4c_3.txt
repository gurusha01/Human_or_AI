This paper presents a novel approach to algorithm selection by framing it as a metacognitive process and optimizing the value of computation (VOC) based on expected utility. The authors employ Bayesian feature selection to predict algorithm scores and runtimes, demonstrating that their method outperforms existing decision tree-based and dynamic programming-based approaches for sorting algorithms. Furthermore, the paper bridges cognitive science and artificial intelligence by showing that human sorting behavior aligns more closely with the proposed metacognitive strategy than with prior psychological models.
Strengths:
The paper makes a significant contribution by formalizing algorithm selection as a metareasoning problem, a perspective that is both innovative and impactful. The use of Bayesian feature selection to approximate VOC is technically sound and well-justified, and the experimental results convincingly demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the-art approaches. The behavioral experiments are particularly compelling, as they not only validate the model's predictions but also provide insights into human cognitive strategy selection. This interdisciplinary approach is likely to inspire further research at the intersection of AI and cognitive science.
The manuscript is well-written and organized, with a clear exposition of the theoretical framework, experimental setup, and results. The authors provide thorough evaluations against Guo's decision tree method and Lagoudakis et al.'s recursive method, highlighting the advantages of their approach in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency. The behavioral experiments are thoughtfully designed and provide strong evidence that humans adaptively select strategies in a manner consistent with the proposed model.
Weaknesses:
While the paper is highly commendable, there are areas where additional details would enhance its clarity and impact. Specifically, the Bayesian feature selection process, including the computation of Bayes factors and the use of Savage-Dickey ratios, is not explained in sufficient detail. Expanding on this would make the methodology more accessible to readers unfamiliar with these techniques. Additionally, the paper briefly mentions Lagoudakis et al.'s method and its poor performance but does not provide a detailed analysis or discussion of why this method underperforms relative to the proposed approach. Addressing this would strengthen the comparative evaluation.
A minor issue is a typographical error in the phrase "to an descending list," which should be corrected for clarity.
Pro and Con Arguments:
Pro:  
- The paper addresses a fundamental problem in AI and cognitive science with a novel and well-executed approach.  
- The results are robust, demonstrating clear improvements over existing methods.  
- The interdisciplinary perspective is unique and opens new avenues for research.  
Con:  
- Insufficient detail on Bayesian feature selection and related computations.  
- Limited discussion of why competing methods perform poorly.  
Recommendation:
Overall, this is an excellent paper that makes a substantial contribution to both AI and cognitive science. With minor revisions to address the noted weaknesses, it has the potential to be a standout work in the field. I strongly recommend acceptance.
