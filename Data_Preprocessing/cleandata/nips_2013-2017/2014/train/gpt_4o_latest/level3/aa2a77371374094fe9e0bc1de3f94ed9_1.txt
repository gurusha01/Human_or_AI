This paper presents a unified low-rank tensor learning framework for spatio-temporal data analysis, focusing on cokriging and forecasting tasks. By leveraging tensor representations to model spatial, temporal, and variable dependencies, the authors address the limitations of existing methods, such as strong parametric assumptions and high computational costs. The proposed framework incorporates global and local consistency principles, enforced via low-rank constraints and Laplacian regularization, respectively. A novel greedy algorithm, enhanced with an optional orthogonal projection step, is introduced to efficiently solve the resulting optimization problem. Theoretical convergence guarantees are provided, and the method is validated on synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating superior performance in both accuracy and scalability compared to state-of-the-art approaches.
Strengths:
1. Technical Soundness: The paper is technically robust, with well-supported claims through theoretical analysis and empirical results. The convergence guarantee for the greedy algorithm adds credibility to the proposed method.
2. Clarity: The paper is clearly written and well-organized, making it accessible to readers familiar with tensor learning and spatio-temporal analysis. The unified framework and its applications to cokriging and forecasting are explained in detail.
3. Originality: The combination of low-rank tensor optimization with a greedy learning algorithm is novel. The ability to handle spatial, temporal, and variable dependencies simultaneously in a scalable manner distinguishes this work from prior approaches.
4. Significance: The results demonstrate clear improvements over existing methods in terms of both accuracy and runtime, particularly on large-scale datasets. The framework's flexibility to incorporate side information (e.g., friendship networks) enhances its applicability across diverse domains.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity of Equations: The equivalence of equations (4), (5), and (6) with earlier formulations in Section 2.3 is not immediately clear. Additional explanations or intermediate steps would help readers follow the derivation.
2. Runtime Comparison: The runtime comparison in Figure 1(c) may not be entirely accurate. The authors should conduct further scalability tests, especially on larger datasets, to strengthen their claims about computational efficiency.
3. RMSE Normalization: While RMSE is used as a performance metric, the paper lacks a detailed discussion on how RMSE normalization impacts results across datasets. Insights into performance differences between datasets would also be valuable.
4. Minor Issues: Grammatical errors on lines 34 and 305 should be corrected for improved readability.
Recommendation:
Accept with Minor Revisions. The paper makes a significant contribution to the field of spatio-temporal data analysis, offering a scalable and accurate solution to a challenging problem. Addressing the noted weaknesses, particularly the clarity of equations and runtime analysis, would further strengthen the paper. The proposed method has the potential to inspire future research and practical applications, making it a valuable addition to the conference.
