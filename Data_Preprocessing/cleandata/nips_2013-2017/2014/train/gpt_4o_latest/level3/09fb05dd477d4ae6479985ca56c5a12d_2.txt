The paper presents a novel framework, Large Scale Detection through Adaptation (LSDA), which addresses the challenge of adapting deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) from image classification to object detection tasks. This is a significant contribution as it seeks to bridge the gap between the abundance of image-level labels and the scarcity of bounding box annotations, a critical bottleneck in scaling object detection to thousands of categories. The proposed method achieves a 50% relative improvement in mean average precision (mAP) over baseline classifiers and secures 4th place in the ImageNet LSVRC-2013 object detection challenge, demonstrating its practical impact.
Strengths:
The paper is well-written, clearly organized, and easy to follow, making it accessible to readers with varying levels of expertise. The CNN structure and adaptation methodology are simple to implement, which enhances the reproducibility and practical utility of the approach. The authors provide a detailed experimental setup and conduct an ablation study to analyze the contributions of different components of their method. Additionally, the release of models and software at lsda.berkeleyvision.org is commendable, as it promotes transparency and encourages further research.
The paper's focus on adapting classifiers into detectors without requiring bounding box annotations for all categories is both novel and impactful. By leveraging domain adaptation techniques and introducing category-invariant and category-specific transformations, the authors address a pressing challenge in object detection. The scalability of the approach, demonstrated through the creation of a 7.6K-category detector, is particularly promising for large-scale applications.
Weaknesses:
Despite its strengths, the paper has several shortcomings. The adaptation method lacks a clear theoretical justification, and the motivations behind certain design choices, such as the offset parameter in the kNN variant, are insufficiently explained. This undermines the interpretability of the approach. Furthermore, the superiority of the kNN variant is not convincingly established due to inadequate reasoning and analysis.
The evaluation methodology raises concerns about fairness. The use of the validation set instead of the test set for comparisons with other methods introduces potential bias, making it difficult to draw definitive conclusions about the method's relative performance. Additionally, the reported performance gains on the small validation set are not statistically significant, which limits the reliability of the results.
Recommendation:
While the paper demonstrates promise and introduces a novel approach to a challenging problem, it requires further refinement in its theoretical explanations and evaluation methodology. The authors should provide clearer justifications for their design choices and ensure fair comparisons with existing methods. Addressing these issues would strengthen the paper's contribution to the field. 
Arguments for acceptance: Novel and scalable approach, strong experimental results, well-written and reproducible methodology.  
Arguments against acceptance: Insufficient theoretical justification, unfair evaluation, and lack of statistically significant performance gains.  
Overall, the paper is a valuable contribution but requires improvements to meet the standards of rigorous scientific evaluation.
