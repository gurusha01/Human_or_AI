This paper addresses the critical problem of covariance matrix estimation in the presence of autocorrelated data, proposing a novel bias-corrected (BC) shrinkage estimator. The authors build on the work of Sancetta, whose estimator extended shrinkage methods to non-i.i.d. data but suffers from high bias and sensitivity to hyperparameter choices in finite sample settings. The proposed BC estimator is designed to address these limitations, offering unbiased variance estimates (apart from truncation bias) and robustness to the choice of the truncation parameter \( b \). The paper demonstrates the superiority of the BC estimator through theoretical analysis, simulations, and a real-world application in EEG-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI).
Strengths:
1. Significance and Novelty: The paper tackles an important problem in covariance estimation for autocorrelated data, which is relevant across domains such as finance, biomedical engineering, and signal processing. The proposed estimator is a significant improvement over existing methods, including Sancetta's approach, and has the potential to become a new standard.
2. Theoretical Rigor: The authors provide a thorough theoretical analysis of the bias and variance properties of the BC estimator, clearly contrasting it with the Sancetta estimator. The consistency of the BC estimator under finite sample settings is well-supported.
3. Empirical Validation: Simulations and real-world experiments convincingly demonstrate the BC estimator's robustness and superior performance. The analysis of EEG data highlights its practical utility, particularly in time-critical applications like BCI.
4. Clarity of Contributions: The paper clearly identifies the limitations of existing methods and positions the BC estimator as a robust alternative, with detailed comparisons to standard shrinkage and Sancetta's method.
Weaknesses:
1. Truncation Parameter \( b \): The paper lacks clear guidance on how to choose the truncation parameter \( b \) in practice. While the BC estimator is robust to suboptimal choices of \( b \), practitioners would benefit from concrete recommendations or heuristics for selecting \( b \).
2. Accuracy vs. Cross-Validation (CV): While the BC estimator is computationally faster than CV, the manuscript does not adequately evaluate its accuracy relative to CV. A direct comparison of classification performance in the BCI experiment would strengthen the argument for adoption.
3. Clarity and Presentation: Equation 5 requires a more formal clarification of the assumptions on \( b \) and the truncation kernel. Additionally, the simulation settings and abbreviations (e.g., "cmp.") need clearer explanations. Visualizations such as heatmaps of the biases as functions of \( b \), \( n \), \( s \), and covariances would enhance interpretability.
Minor Issues:
- Clarify "complementary analysis" as "complementary theoretical analysis."
- Fix the missing space on line 206.
- Add a supplementary figure to justify footnote 4.
- Specify the value of \( R \) used in simulations for averaging.
- Justify the desirability of estimating a covariance matrix from an AR process earlier in the manuscript.
Recommendation:
This paper makes a strong contribution to the field of covariance matrix estimation for autocorrelated data. While the lack of clarity on the selection of \( b \) and limited comparisons to CV are notable weaknesses, the theoretical and empirical results are compelling. Addressing these concerns in a revision would significantly enhance the paper's impact. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions.
