The paper addresses the critical problem of recovering distributions and causal queries from datasets corrupted by missing data, introducing a novel identification formula. It extends the foundational work of Mohan et al. (2013) by considering a broader class of missingness processes, including cases where missingness mechanisms interact. The authors make significant contributions by showing that causal queries, such as \( P(y|do(x)) \), can be recoverable even when the observational joint distribution is not, thus advancing the theoretical understanding of recoverability in the presence of missing data. The application of these results to attrition problems further demonstrates their practical relevance.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Originality: The paper builds on prior work by Mohan et al. and extends it to more general settings, addressing gaps in the literature. The introduction of graphical conditions for recoverability and the ability to handle interacting missingness mechanisms are notable contributions.
2. Theoretical Rigor: The results are well-supported by formal proofs, and the paper provides sufficient conditions for recoverability, as well as non-recoverability criteria, which are new and valuable additions to the field.
3. Practical Relevance: The application to attrition problems, a common issue in longitudinal studies, highlights the utility of the proposed methods.
4. Clarity in Examples: The examples provided, such as the recovery of \( P(y|do(z)) \) when \( Y \) and \( R_y \) are inseparable, effectively illustrate the theoretical results.
Weaknesses:
1. Assumptions on Censoring: The results rely on knowledge of the censoring process, which may not always be available in typical machine learning applications. This limits the practical applicability of the methods in real-world scenarios.
2. Full Population Assumption: The assumption that the full population is known excludes important problems like estimating population sizes, which could have broadened the scope of the work.
3. Terminological Inconsistencies: The term "mgraph" is used inconsistently across figures, and the restriction on mgraphs disallowing \( R \) variables as parents of \( V \) or \( U \) needs clearer justification.
4. Undefined Terms: Key terms such as "neighbor" are not defined, which could confuse readers unfamiliar with the context.
5. Clarity Issues: Some statements, such as those on maximum likelihood under the MAR assumption, are too vague and require elaboration. Additionally, typos and ambiguous notations detract from the paper's readability.
6. Relation to Prior Work: The alignment of the recoverability definition with Garcia et al.'s work is unclear, and the related work section could better contextualize the contributions relative to existing literature.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper makes a significant theoretical contribution by extending recoverability conditions to more complex missingness processes.
- The results are novel, well-supported, and have practical implications for handling missing data in causal inference.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The reliance on strong assumptions, such as knowledge of the censoring process and the full population, limits the practical applicability.
- Issues with clarity, terminology, and alignment with prior work reduce the accessibility and impact of the paper.
Recommendation:
The paper is a valuable contribution to the field of causal inference and missing data, addressing a challenging and important problem. However, the authors should address the clarity issues, provide better justification for assumptions, and resolve terminological inconsistencies. Pending these revisions, the paper is suitable for acceptance.
