The paper introduces a novel Bayesian Quadrature (BQ) method, termed WSABI, that incorporates a square-root transformation and active learning to address the inefficiencies of traditional Monte Carlo (MC) methods in numerical integration. The authors propose two likelihood approximation schemes—linearization (WSABI-L) and moment matching (WSABI-M)—to handle the non-negativity constraint of likelihoods. Additionally, a simple active sampling strategy is employed to improve computational efficiency. The paper demonstrates the method's faster convergence compared to standard MC techniques on synthetic and real-world problems, including regression and classification tasks.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Originality: The use of a square-root transformation to enforce non-negativity in BQ is a novel contribution. This approach is computationally efficient and avoids the more error-prone log-transform used in prior work. The combination of this transformation with active learning represents a meaningful advancement in BQ methodology.
2. Clarity and Accessibility: The paper is well-written and provides a clear explanation of the proposed method, making it accessible even to non-experts in Bayesian Quadrature. The detailed mathematical exposition and illustrative figures enhance understanding.
3. Practical Contributions: The proposed WSABI framework addresses a critical limitation of BQ—its computational cost—making it more viable for real-world applications. The active sampling strategy is particularly compelling for balancing exploration and exploitation in likelihood evaluation.
4. Empirical Results: The experiments demonstrate the method's faster convergence (in wall-clock time) compared to MC techniques, particularly in low-dimensional settings. The inclusion of both synthetic and real-world datasets adds credibility to the results.
Weaknesses:
1. Experimental Validation: The experimental section lacks comparisons with other state-of-the-art BQ methods, such as those using log-transforms or advanced sampling strategies. This omission makes it difficult to assess the superiority of WSABI beyond MC baselines.
2. Scalability: While WSABI performs well in low-dimensional problems, its performance in higher-dimensional settings appears less robust, particularly for WSABI-M. This limitation should be discussed in greater depth, along with potential remedies.
3. Missing Metrics: The paper does not report the number of samples required by WSABI to match the accuracy of MCMC methods (e.g., Bayesian Monte Carlo or Sequential Monte Carlo). This information would provide a more direct comparison of sample efficiency.
4. Limited Exploration of Active Sampling: The active sampling strategy, while effective, is relatively simple. A more detailed analysis of its trade-offs and potential alternatives would strengthen the contribution.
Recommendation:
Overall, this is a solid paper that introduces a novel and computationally efficient approach to Bayesian Quadrature. However, the lack of comparisons with other BQ methods and limited exploration of scalability and active sampling strategies leave room for improvement. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions, contingent on the authors addressing the experimental gaps and providing additional comparisons with other BQ techniques.
