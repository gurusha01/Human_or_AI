The authors present a novel approach to preprocessing calcium imaging signals by learning a convolution filter, which improves the accuracy of inverse covariance estimation for inferring neural network connectivity. This method achieves performance comparable to the winning algorithm of a recent Kaggle Connectomics competition while significantly reducing computational costs. Unlike the competition's brute-force grid search, the proposed supervised optimization approach is more efficient and generalizable, aligning well with the interests of the NIPS community.
Strengths:
1. Technical Soundness and Efficiency: The proposed method is technically robust, leveraging a supervised optimization algorithm to learn signal processing parameters. It achieves competitive AUC scores (above 0.9) within two hours of training on a CPU, compared to the 10-hour prediction time of the winning Kaggle solution. This efficiency is a significant contribution to the field.
2. Relevance and Originality: The work addresses a critical challenge in calcium imaging data preprocessing—noise and low resolution—by introducing a convolution filter that outperforms traditional thresholding methods. The approach is novel in its ability to jointly learn the convolution kernel and inverse covariance regularization parameter, offering a fresh perspective on signal preprocessing.
3. Practical Impact: The method's generalizability to networks of varying sizes and its potential application to other point processes (e.g., social network contagion) enhance its significance. The reduced computational overhead makes it accessible to a broader range of researchers.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity of Visualization: The relationship between the fluorescence signal (f), neuron firing estimate (n), and processed signal (y) in Figure 1c is a key result but is not clearly visualized. Improved clarity here would enhance the reader's understanding of the model's impact.
2. Typographical Error: A minor typo on page 6 ("fluoresce" should be corrected to "fluorescence").
3. Limited Discussion on Non-Gaussian Data: While the authors acknowledge the non-Gaussian nature of neural firing data, a deeper exploration of how this affects model performance and potential remedies would strengthen the paper.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper provides a significant advancement in preprocessing calcium imaging data, a challenging and impactful problem in neuroscience.
- The proposed method is computationally efficient and generalizable, making it a valuable contribution to the NIPS community.
- The work is well-grounded in theory and demonstrates strong empirical results.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The visualization of key results is unclear, which may hinder comprehension for readers unfamiliar with the domain.
- The discussion of the method's limitations, particularly regarding non-Gaussian data, could be more thorough.
Recommendation:
I recommend acceptance of this paper, contingent on the authors addressing the visualization issue in Figure 1c and correcting the typographical error. The paper's contributions to efficient and robust preprocessing of calcium imaging signals are both timely and significant, making it a strong candidate for inclusion in the conference.
