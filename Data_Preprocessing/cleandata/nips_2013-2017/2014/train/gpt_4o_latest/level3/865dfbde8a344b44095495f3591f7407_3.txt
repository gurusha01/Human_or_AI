The paper introduces a novel approach for applying Stochastic Variational Inference (SVI) to Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), addressing the challenges posed by dependencies in time-series data. Unlike prior work that assumes independence or exchangeability in data, this work adapts SVI to sequential models by leveraging the memory decay property of Markov chains. The authors propose an innovative buffering mechanism to mitigate edge effects at subchain boundaries, ensuring that local variational distributions approximate the full-data posterior. The method is validated on synthetic datasets and a large-scale genomics application, demonstrating its computational efficiency and scalability.
Strengths:
1. Originality and Innovation: The paper addresses a significant gap in the literature by extending SVI to time-dependent models, which is a challenging and underexplored area. The buffering mechanism to handle edge effects is particularly creative and well-motivated.
2. Technical Soundness: The authors provide theoretical guarantees for convergence to a local mode, which adds rigor to their methodology. The adaptive buffering approach is grounded in the memory decay property of Markov chains, a well-established concept in time-series analysis.
3. Practical Significance: The application to a massive genomics dataset (250 million observations) highlights the scalability and real-world relevance of the proposed method. The results are competitive with existing methods, such as DBN-EM, while being significantly more efficient.
4. Empirical Validation: The experiments on synthetic datasets are thoughtfully designed to illustrate trade-offs between subchain length and minibatch size. The inclusion of the GrowBuf routine demonstrates robustness to suboptimal hyperparameter choices.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity: While the paper is technically sound, certain sections, particularly the derivation of the ELBO for subchains and the buffering mechanism, are dense and could benefit from additional explanation or visual aids. This could make the paper more accessible to a broader audience.
2. Incomplete Experimental Details: Key experimental details are missing, such as the runtime comparison for the human chromatin segmentation experiment and hyperparameter settings for synthetic experiments. Table 1 lacks crucial metrics like predictive log-likelihood and ||A - A₀||_F, which would provide a more comprehensive evaluation.
3. Minor Errors: There are minor issues, such as the missing φ parameter in Equation (1) and an incorrect reference to "Table 4" instead of "Table 1" in Line 355. These errors, while not critical, detract from the overall polish of the paper.
Recommendation:
The paper makes a strong contribution to the field by extending SVI to HMMs and addressing the challenges of dependency-breaking in time-series data. The proposed method is both theoretically grounded and practically impactful, with promising results on large-scale real-world data. However, the paper would benefit from improved clarity, more detailed experimental reporting, and correction of minor errors. 
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper addresses a challenging and important problem with a novel and well-validated solution.
- Theoretical guarantees and empirical results demonstrate the robustness and scalability of the method.
- The work has significant potential for impact in both academia and industry, particularly in fields dealing with large-scale time-series data.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The clarity of some sections could be improved, potentially limiting accessibility to non-expert readers.
- Missing experimental details and minor errors reduce the overall completeness and polish of the paper.
Overall, I recommend acceptance, contingent on addressing the clarity issues and providing additional experimental details.
