Paper proposes to use neural networks (generic function approximators)
to learn mapping coming from UCT. UCT is a Monte Carlo method, which
considers multiple trajectories of game. Monte Carrlo methods are
expensive due to consideration of exponential number of trajectories.
Neural networks trained on such mapping allow to retrive results
within orders of magnitude faster time.
Paper is difficult to understand due to many abbreviations. However,
overall concept is quite simple. It seems that this technique could be
used to speed up any Monte Carlo players, but paper describes only
results for UCT. It would be nice, if you would show for other Monte
Carlo methods that this approach works.
Please add some mathematical equations to make paper more clear.
BTW: Would it be possible to train a single model to play all the
games ? Would it help across games ? Results are compelling, however presentation can be improved. Authorsshould include a some mathematical formulas, and fix figures (e.g.figure number 4 is quite to read, and understand).
