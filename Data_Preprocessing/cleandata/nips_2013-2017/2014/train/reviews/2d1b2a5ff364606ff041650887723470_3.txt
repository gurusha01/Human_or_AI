The paper proposes additive factorial HMM (AFHMM) with signal aggregate constraints (SAC) to deal with blind source separation problem. Authors propose convex quadratic problem for relaxed AFHMM with SAC. The technique shows promising results on both synthetic and real world data.
Pros:
- Paper is well written and has good mathematical foundation.
- Problem motivation is good
- Evaluation results indicate good boost in performance metrics, NDE and SAE
Areas of improvement:
- Results are shown as an improvement over AFHMM without SAC and AFAMAP. Both these use less data than SACAFHMM which seems unfair comparison. Are there any other approaches that could use SAC but are not as efficient in computation?
- Results in Figure 1 are not clear. It seems like for distance more than 10^4 AFAMAP beats SACAFHMM. Does this indicate that bad constraints can result in much poorer performance? Discussion seem to indicate that results are always better which seems misleading.
- I was expecting to see more complex constraints incorporated in the algorithm. For e.g. Person cannot use the heater and cooler at the same time. What about having no more than 3 out of 10 bulbs in the house active at the same time. Things like grinders having time constraints of less than 10 mins. To summarize, there could various kinds of constraints that could be specified. Is it possible to extend the algorithm to other kinds of constraints as well? Paper is well written and provides good motivation into the problem. Future work involves extending the model further to other kinds of constraints.
