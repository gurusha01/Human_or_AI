Authors present a unified low rank tensor learning framework for two main tasks in multivariate spatio-temporal analysis: cokriging and forecasting. Authors present an efficient greedy algorithm that can be used for both tasks.
Positives:
* Paper is well written and has good mathematical foundation of the approach taken to solve the tasks.
* Positive results are shown on both synthetic and real-world data when compared to other algorithms in the literature.
Areas of improvement:
* It is unclear how different tuning parameters are chosen for different algorithms when applied to different data. 
* It is unclear if this approach will work if the data had more than 3 dimensions.
* Multiple fold cross validation results are shown in Table 1, 2 without any confidence intervals.
* Can the forecasting approach be taken one step further to classify anomalies in climate data such as hurricance, drought, etc?
* Table 2 shows Tucker beats Ortho alg on USHCN data. Why? Are the results significant? Add discussion on what this means.
Few typos:
- Pg. 1 Oftentimes --> Often times
- Pg. 1, 7 five folds cross validation --> five-fold cross validation Paper has good mathematical foundation for learning low rank tensors from spatio-temporal data. I would have loved to see discussion on why cokriging and forecasting are important especially for the datasets tested in the paper.
