The authors propose an expectation loss svm (e-svm) that can handle continuous attributes of positive instances in a learning problem and apply the model to learn visual segmentation classifiers under weak supervision. The methodology is validated for both semantic segmentation and object detection with promising results. The paper addresses an important problem of visual learning under weak supervision, the presentation is clear and well-motivated and the experiments are interesting and well executed. Although the technical content is an extension of the standard multiple instance learning framework (by replacing a binary with a soft weighting of positives), it applies in both the observed and the latent setting, and represents a valid contribution for NIPS. An expectation loss svm method that can handle continuous attributes of positive instances in a learning problem and apply it to learn visual segmentation classifiers under weak supervision. Good motivation, clear presentation, relevant results for semantic segmentation and object detection.
