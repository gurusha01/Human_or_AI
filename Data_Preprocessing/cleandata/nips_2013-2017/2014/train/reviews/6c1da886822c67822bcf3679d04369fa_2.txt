This paper addresses the high sparsity problem of user-item ratings in recommendation systems, when applying matrix factorization technique. Some users own a large number of ratings (called public users in the paper), whereas many users have very few ratings (called private users). A main reason for the latter case is that such private users intend to protect their privacy.
First, The authors provided theoretical guarantees of reasonably good performance of recommendation systems, when only a small set of public users are available. Then, they defined mechanisms for private protection for both discrete and continuous rating values to exploit private users in order to improve the models initially built on public users' ratings. The mechanisms add private users by maintaining the second order statistics of the user ratings.
Finally, they tested the proposed private preserving mechanisms on the MovieLens 10M data set. The experimental results confirmed the promised guarantees and showed improvements by exploring private users.
This paper is clearly written. The novelty of the paper lies in the theoretical proof of the performance guarantee and the definition of the private protection mechanisms. Experiments are somewhat limited A paper with novel ideas, supported by proofs and experimental results
