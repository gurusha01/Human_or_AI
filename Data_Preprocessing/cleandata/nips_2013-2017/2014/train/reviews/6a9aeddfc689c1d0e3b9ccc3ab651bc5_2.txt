- Summary:
	This paper presents a speed-up proposal for least squares linear regression. Compared to existing approaches the current proposal claims robustness to outliers or corruptions in the measured predictors.
	- Quality:
	The paper seems technically sound to me. The claims are well supported from a theoretical perspective. From an experimental perspective I was a bit disappointed. The initial motivation of the authors was estimation on large scale settings. Although in terms of artificial data sets the authors have used reasonably large data (n=100,000; p=500), regards the single real world domain it can hardly be considered a large data set by today standards (n=13,000; p=170). Moreover, as mentioned before, there was a single real world data set. This is a bit limiting in terms of experimental results, particularly given the initial motivation immediately outlined in the first sentence of the abstract. Still, the work is very complete from a theoretical perspective, particularly when we take into account the supplemental material that was provided. 
 
	- Clarity:
	I think the paper reads very well. The algorithms and methodological approach are clear and I think it should be easy to reproduce the results of the authors. Still, a bit more details on the Airline delay dataset would be preferable (still an URL is given...). I also do not understand the label on the X-axis of figure 2 (n_{subs})... what is the meaning of this label? On page 5, near Eq. 7, there seems to be some sort of typo (... $4 and $4 ...)
 
	- Originality:
	The proposal seems novel to me. Still, the proposal is a combination of previous works ([8] and [14] as the authors refer on section 5) and thus with limited novelty. Nevertheless, the authors are clear about this and identify relevant and related works.
 
	- Significance:
	The results reported in the paper are immediately limited by the fact that they are constrained to a specific type of regression method. Moreover, given the limitations on the experimental evaluation mentioned above, I'm afraid it is also not easy to completely assert the impact of these proposals in terms of experimental results. This means that although I think this is an advance on the state of the art of least squares linear regression, the exact impact of this advance is not correctly evaluated by the authors in my opinion, which limits the significance of the paper that was already potentially small by being constrained to a specific regression algorithm.
  This paper presents a very localized contribution that seems theoretically sound but whose impact is limited both because of its focus on a single technique and by a limited experimental evaluation
