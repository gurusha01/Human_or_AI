The authors proposed a data dependent kernel called Fredholm kernels. The novelty of the kernel is to use unlabeled dataset in natural way. Authors showed that several theoretical property of the kernel and experimentally verified that the kernel compares favorably with existing state-of-the-art method. 
The paper is well written and organized. 
Detailed comments: 
1. Is there any systematic approach to select kernel width for freadholm kernel? For example, under some assumption, can you select a kernel width by cross validation?
2. It would be nice to add some toy experiments to show the case the proposed method might not work. I just want to know in which setting the proposed method is most effective.
 The paper is interesting and is very clearly written. I vote for an acceptance.
