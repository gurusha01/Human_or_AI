While the regular NMF framework considers a generative model of the TF analysis coefficients of a signal, the proposed framework considers a generative model of the time-domain signal itself by describing a generative model of TF synthesis coefficients. This allows us to open doors to multi-resolution representations, that were not possible in the traditional NMF setting.
This is an interesting paper. In particular, I personally like the idea of the multi-resolution extension a lot.
While the authors present some results on multi-resolution signal decompositions, I am also curious to know the performance of the proposed method in the single-resolution case, compared with IS-NMF. Does it give similar W and H? Is the present algorithm as fast and stable as the multiplicative update algorithm for IS-NMF?
