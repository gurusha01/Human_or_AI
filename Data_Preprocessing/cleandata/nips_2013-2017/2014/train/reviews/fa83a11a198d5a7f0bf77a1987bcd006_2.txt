The authors propose a novel bias-corrected estimator of covariance matrices for autocorrelated data. They provide simulated data as well as a real-world data set on brain-computer interfacing to demonstrate the superior performance of their estimator in comparison to a standard-, a shrinkage-, and the Sancetta estimator.
I believe the authors address a very interesting problem and make an important contribution. At the same time, I find the manuscript rather hard to read and the experimental result on real data not particularly convincing:
* The authors do not really introduce their notation. While most notation is obvious from its context, this makes the manuscript harder to read than it would need to be.
* I did not quite understand the heuristic fix of the Sancetta estimator in Section 2.
* Along the same lines, I would be interested in a more detailed explanation of the bias-corrected estimator in (6). As the discussion section is primarily a summary of what the authors have done, it might be shortened to have more space in Section 2?
* I am missing some of the details of the decoding procedure in Section 4. In particular, how many CSP filters were used for decoding? Which frequency band did the authors use? How did they perform cross-validation?
* The following is the primary concern I have with this manuscript: It appears to me that the authors use only two trials to estimate the CSP filters and only pick the two most discriminative CSP filters for the plots in Figures 6 and 7. This is not what one would typically do in this setting. I suspect that this choice has been motivated by highlighting the differences between the different estimators. Furthermore, it appears to me from Figure 7 that the differences in performance between the various estimators are not a result of a better estimation of the spatial filters, but rather due to a different ranking of the CSP components. One would typically not use the best two but the best six CSP filters. From my experience, it is quite likely that this set of CSP filters would include filters for left- and right sensorimotor cortex for all estimators. If so, the differences in decoding performances between the estimators are likely to be negligible. In order to be convinced that the bias-corrected estimator outperforms any other estimator, I would like to see decoding differences on CSP filters that at least focus on the same brain regions.
Typos and minor comments:
* I believe the normalization term is missing in (3)?
* Section 2: "rate of p" should be "rate of n"?
* The first sentence of the second paragraph in Section 5 is very hard to parse. Very interesting theoretical work. The experimental results on real data, however, have been tuned to look more impressive than they would be in a realistic setting.
