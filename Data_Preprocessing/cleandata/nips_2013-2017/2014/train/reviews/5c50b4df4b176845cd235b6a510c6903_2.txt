The paper casts the problem of designing voting rules (choosing an order over a set of alternatives) for multiple agents as decisions that minimize the expected loss w.r.t the posterior distribution over parameters i.e. Bayesian risk.
To the best of my assessment, the results are technical correct, novel and interesting.
My only comment or concern, is that the paper presents normative properties and asymptotic results (as number of voters grow large) of the Bayesian estimators. The NIPS audience tends more interested in learning dynamics. Given that I perceive the results to be of high-quality, I don't know if NIPS is the best match for this paper.
