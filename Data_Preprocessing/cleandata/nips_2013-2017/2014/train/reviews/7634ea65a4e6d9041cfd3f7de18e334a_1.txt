The paper presents a simple novel model for structured sparsity in spike-and-slab models and an expectation propagation algorithm for Bayesian inference. It is written clearly and accompanied by interesting examples and comparisons with other approaches.  Although there are some previous works in this area, this particular approach is simple and novel.
