This work presents a method for modeling object categories, supercategories, and attributes in a shared space. This is made possible by an appropriately labeled dataset: Animal with Attributes. The main motivation is that the category-supercategory and category-attribute relationships provide generative regularization for the category-only discriminative learning. 
[strength] The work is well motivated in the introduction and related work. I recommend some mention of recent deep methods in the "sparse coding" subsection.
[suggestion] Figure 1 could more efficiently use available space by type-setting text to the right of the figure.
[strength] The approach is clearly laid out component by component, with clear mathematical notation, appropriate level of detail, and a sufficient explanation of the numerical implementation.
[strength] Evaluation considers a fair set of baselines, and uses two different underlying features to demonstrate that the method is not overfit to a particular feature space. It is unfrotunate that only the AWA dataset is considered, but perhaps there are no other possibilities for this involved task.
[weakness] Little discussion of the computational concerns of this method. The optimization looks tricky, and I would appreciate knowing details of the training and test runtimes. The proposed unified semantic embedding model is well motivated, clearly and sequentially formulated, and properly evaluated -- demonstrating superiority -- on one super-labeled dataset. The paper would further benefit through discussing computational concerns.
