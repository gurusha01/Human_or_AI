The paper considers multi-agent systems where a voting rule is used to aggregate decisions of individual agents to solve a problem. One can consider the agents as sampling from a noisy distribution centered around the true ranking of the alternatives at each state. They show that if the agents are copies of each other, in the sense that the agents produce samples (preferences for alternatives) from the same distribution then it is likely that system votes for a sub-optimal alternative. On the other hand, if we have many agents that have sufficient diversity then the system is likely to vote for the optimal alternatives in almost every state. The paper then concludes with an experimental study of agents playing Go games. 
The paper is clear and well written, however, it was not clear to the reviewer what the new contributions are over existing results which qualitatively resemble this paper's results (such as Marcolino's work that they refer to). It seems that the main difference in the setting is that agents can give a preference ordering for alternatives at each stage rather than vote for a single alternative. 
Minor: In the experimental section of the paper diverse agents are generated by varying parameters in an existing Go playing agent. From the perspective of a reader unfamiliar with the details of the system, it is not obvious that such parametrization will indeed result in a diverse set of agents. The paper does discuss this issue in Appendix H and towards the end of section 4, it would be better if this justification (or reference to Appendix H) is added earlier when the agents are introduced. The results of the paper are interesting but a more detailed comparison to related work is needed.[Revised, following author feedback].
