An additive factorial hidden Markov model is developed to model electricity usage. The model incorporates the so-called signal aggegate constraint.
The quality of the paper is good, but it is really hard to read. There are too many acronyms, and some of them are really log (even 11 letters!)  It seems that the Authors are looking for a constraint to be placed on the posterior density and so they place a constraint on a prior density. They should state they have an a priori constraint and hence the posterior is constrained.
