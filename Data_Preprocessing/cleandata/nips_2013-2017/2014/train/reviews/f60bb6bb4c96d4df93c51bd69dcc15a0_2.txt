This paper proposes a new tight continuous relaxation approach to the k-cut problem which avoids the greedy recursive splitting technique required for other approaches.
The generality of the monotonic descent method make it of general interest. 
While the method shows clear promise in terms of finding the k vertices sets, the issue of estimating k itself is not really addressed.
Quality: The conclusions of the paper seemed fair based on the detail written. A conclusions section with caveats and future work would have improved the quality however.
Clarity: The majority was well-written, if a little dense at times. Missing a conclusions/discussion section.
Originality: The idea seemed original but I find it difficult to comment on this due to my lack of expertise in this area.
Significance: Difficult to say.
Small issues:
Move the "Balanced k-Cut" to the second line of the title
"Clustering" on line 17 should not be capitalised.
Line 42: "frequently outperform" rather than "outperform frequently"
Line 57: change "with small amount of label information" to "with a small amount of label information,"
Add letters (a), (b), etc to graphs in Figure 1. An interesting theoretical idea but the paper is lacking in a conclusions section or discussion of caveats. The reframing of the cut problem in terms of the continuous relaxation proposed was of interest as was the monotonic descent method proposed for implementing its solution.
