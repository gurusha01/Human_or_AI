This paper proposes novel necessary and sufficient conditions to guarantee whether a causal query can be inferred from data in the presence of missing observations. It extends previous works that explicitly model the missing data generating mechanism into the causal diagram. The paper is clearly written and while it builds up on previous contributions using this approach, the additional insights provided constitute, in the opinion of this reviewer, a valuable contribution to the state of the art in the analysis of causal mechanisms in the presence of missing data. Focused paper, clearly written.
