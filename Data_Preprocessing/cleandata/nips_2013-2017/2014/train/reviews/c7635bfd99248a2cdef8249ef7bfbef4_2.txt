The manuscript "Speeding-up Graphical Model Optimization via a Coarse-to-fine Cascade of Pruning Classifiers" introduces a framework to improve MRF Optimization through a cascade of classifiers to progressively prune the search space while going from coarse to fine-grained models.
The newly introduced pruning scheme is novel, interesting and seems to provide good solution in practice while being faster than other approaches. There are several parameters pre-set (e.g., C = 10, 5 scales, rho). It is not clear, how robust the method is regarding the value of the parameters, but since they are set the same way for all evaluation data sets, they are probably not too over-trained (although line 294 states that C was set to 10, since it gave good enough accuracy (implying that the value was found looking at the test data)).
The manuscript is clearly written and easily accessible. The speed-up of the new method is considerable which is why it could have a significant impact on the field.
Minor typos:
Line 90: different classifiers per scale are used (not "is used")
Lines 102-103: with a fine-grained pruning of the labels (not "fined-grained")
Line 155: one with too much in the heading
Line 363: all aggressiveness factors except lambda (not "expect lambda")
Line 370: illustrated in column (d,e,f) (not "(d,e,g)")
