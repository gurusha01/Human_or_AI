This paper describes two methods for searching for simpler symbolic expression trees. One of these is based on the use of ngrams computed over sequences of sub-expressions. The other uses a recursive neural network to create continuous space representations of symbolic expression trees. These representations are then used to predict what rule is likely to be used to combine subtrees. The use of ngrams appears from Figure 3 to be better than the RNN on two of the three tasks. 
Comments wrt specific review criteria:
Quality - High.
Clarity - The paper is somewhat hard to follow, especially Section 7.2.
Originality - High.
Significance - Low. It is unlikely that anyone seeking to perform efficient computations would ever do this. The problem seems contrived. This paper describes ways of searching for more computationally efficient symbolic expression trees. The significance of the methods is unclear.
