This paper proposed fully collapsed Gibbs (CG) sampler for the BNBP.
Lemma 1 and the derived sampler are novel and interesting.
However, my concern is the experiments.
Your motivation is to construct the CG sampler for the BNBP because of its simple implementation, fast convergence, good mixing, and state-of-the-art predictive performance.
That is, this work focuses on the sampling algorithm, not statistical modeling.
Therefore, you have to compare other sampling algorithms for the BNBP with the proposed algorithm, not HDP-LDA.
 A fully collapsed Gibbs sampler for the BNBP was provided.The experimental results of other sampling algorithms for the BNBP are needed .
