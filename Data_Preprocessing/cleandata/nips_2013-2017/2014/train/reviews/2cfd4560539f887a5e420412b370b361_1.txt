Paper For paper 1180: Deep Recursive Neural Networks for Compositionality in Language
This paper introduces a new architecture â€” deep recursive neural network (deep RNN) which
 is constructed by stacking multiple recursive layers. The authors evaluate the proposed
 model on the task of fine-grained sentiment classification.
Clarity
- In general, this paper is well written and pleasant to read. 
Quality
- The paper seems technically sound. 
- The major idea is nice, i.e. the deep recursive neural network, which is constructed by stacking multiple layers of individual recursive nets. 
- The authors provided reasonable amounts of experimental results to evaluate various aspects of the method
Originality
- The proposed idea is simple and reasonable 
- It might be better to add more discussions about 
 + why intuitively deeper network is good for the target task? 
 + why choose the selected network architecture ? 
Significance
- The paper has presented interesting idea, clear background description and reasonable experimental supports.
