This paper presents a thoughtful interpretation of time/frequency factorizations. Instead of using existing formulations that are build on the analysis coefficients of STFT transforms, it presents a more flexible framework that can be applied on an arbitrary transform and is directly linked to the time domain signal.
The paper is easy to read for people in this area and of good quality. The originality is above average, although the significance is not fully communicated in the paper. Perhaps the most disappointing part of this paper is in terms of the results and the evaluation. The supplemental material is not particularly convincing and the paper itself doesn't compare this work to the methods it builds on. I don't think that this is a significantly weak point (the theoretical development is itself enough to make this an interesting paper), but I think it would have made the paper a lot better. Good paper, well written, solid theory. I would have liked to see more results and comparisons, but this isn't a fatal flaw in this paper since the theoretical contribution is very interesting.
