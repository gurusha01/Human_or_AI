The paper is aiming to speed up optimization for the of graphical model MAP problem. The authors suggest a coarse to fine approach and clearly motivate their work. The method suggested by the authors combines label pruning for each variable with sequential optimization of the pruned, yet finer problem. 
As far as i can tell, the work is original and correct. One point i think was not clearly pointed out is whether the proposed method can be applied to graph structure with no apparent regularity (in contrast to grid graphs resulting from images).
Another interesting question i am curious about is whether this method could be used inside a learning procedure.
Given my limited knowledge of the related works it is hard for me to asses the significance of this work.  The papers proposes a coarse to fine method to accelerate MAP inference. The method seems interesting and sound,. In addition experimental result are also supportive.
