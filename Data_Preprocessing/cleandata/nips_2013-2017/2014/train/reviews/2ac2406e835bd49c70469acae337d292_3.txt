The authors present spectral method for learning a mixture of HMMs.
The algorithm would be a trivial variant of the standard Hsu, Kakade & Zhang
algorithm, except that the transition matrix recovered is an arbitrary permutation of
the true one, mixing the various components. The authors propose a depermutation algorithm
that seems to work reasonably well.
Occasionally there seem to be a number or little typos. e.g.:
"For each e, identify of eigenvalues that contain all of the energy."
Please proof read more carefully.
The paper could do a better job of putting this work into context, perhaps relating to papers such as:
Chaganty and Liang. Spectral experts for estimating mixtures of linear regressions. In
International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), 2013.
 The authors present spectral method for learning a mixture of HMMs, addressing the key question ofwho to "de-permute" the results.
