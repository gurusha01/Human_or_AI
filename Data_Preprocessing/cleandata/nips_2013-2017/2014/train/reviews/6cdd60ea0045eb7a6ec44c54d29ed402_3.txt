This paper introduce a robust logistic regression under arbitrary outliers. As the title of the paper implies, the method is robust to outliers, and this point is investigated in terms of theory as well as experiments. 
The theoretical result to outliers (theorem 1 and remark 1) is impressive. The estimation algorithm is also nice, which consists of just thresholding and linear programming. However, in practical points of view, the method includes some weakness, which is that the user has to set the number of outliers in advance. This makes the method weaker in practice because it is difficult to know the number in advance. If author(s) discussed ideas to overcome this problem, the paper would be better. In addition, the author(s) should mention how the performance varies if the incorrect number of outliers were set in the method. 
 The paper is well-written, and some theoretical result is impressive. I think that this work has an impact on machine learning community.
