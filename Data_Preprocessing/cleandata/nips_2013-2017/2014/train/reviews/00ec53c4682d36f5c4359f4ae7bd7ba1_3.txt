The paper proposes a few new methods for video classification with deep learning, namely two-stream formulation, and multi-task learning. The methodology, implementations, procedures were described in good detail. The paper is clear, well written, and presents a fair case for the proposed methods by showing good results. 
These methods are novel. Although the paper adds improvements to the framework of [13], the two-stream framework is very interesting, because it shows that the optical flow component adds significant improvements. This is a result many researchers will be interested in. The paper is clearly presented, at the same time it seems to be split across multiple contributions as opposed to having a single theme. Finally, the results offer quite impressive improvements upon [13], and competitive with state-of-the-art. 
Some suggestions to improve the paper: 
1. It seems most of the significance is concentrated on the two-stream and incorporation of optical flow, the abstract and introduction could have a more focused theme. 
2. Missing citations in deep learning:

 The paper seems to offer significant practical contributions, with some interesting ideas that complements the main ideas in deep learning. I would recommend to accept the paper at NIPS 2014, conditional upon that the authors provide the suggested improvements.
