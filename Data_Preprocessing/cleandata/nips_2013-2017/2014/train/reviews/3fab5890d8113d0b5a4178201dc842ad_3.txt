The paper presents the exchangeable partition probability function (EPPF) for the beta negative binomial process (BNBP) and utilizes it to develop a collapsed Gibbs sampler for the BNBP topic model.
This is a well written, reasonably clear, technically sound paper. The primary result of the paper -- a derivation of the BNBP's EPPF for mixed-membership modeling (arrived at via "count-mixture" models) is both interesting in its own right and provides potentially useful tools for deriving EPPFs for related models.
Additional Comments:
While the BNBP topic model is a reasonable illustration of the utility of the developed EPPF and corresponding prediction rule, the improvements over the HDP-LDA are only marginal and the only confident conclusion one can draw is that the BNBP topic model and the HDP-LDA have distinct characteristics. A more interesting experiment would be to contrast the collapsed sampler against the sliced sampler of [10] and the truncated sampler of [8] for inference in the BNBP topic model. The uncollapsed representations have natural advantages when it comes to parallelization and it would be useful to examine mixing tradeoffs wrt to the collapsed sampler developed here.  Overall, this is an interesting paper and passes the publication threshold. I only have a few minor comments on the experimental section ( see above).
