This paper introduces an interesting solution to finding more efficient algebraic identities. It is very interesting to see that distributed, recursive neural representations can successfully classify these identities.
The problem definition seems quite restricted.
This is not well explained:
"weight tensorW3 (of size lxlxl, so that the output is also size l),"
Does this mean you use a neural tensor network instead of a simple linear network?
Bowman showed that the tensor network works a lot better in these than the RNN.
7.2 Efficient Identity Discovery
It is unclear if you're still using the RNN here for classification but you are evaluation different search strategies.
I didn't quite follow how you generate proposals in your search. This could be explained better.
typos:
has contains a single matrix
listed in table Table 1.
vector is the presented to the next operation
The final vector is pass to a softmax classifier
as to how explore space of possible
The scheduler is is fixed
The difficulty of the task by be appreciated by looking
which can easily captured with
Should be RNN, not TNN in figure 3. This paper introduces an interesting solution to finding more efficient algebraic identities. It is very interesting to see that distributed, recursive neural representations can successfully classify these identities.
