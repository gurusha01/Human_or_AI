This paper proposes a new algorithm of signal recovery which combines the advantages of continuous basis pursuit (CBP) and orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP). 
This algorithm chooses basis vectors from left singular vectors from SVD of matrix of dictionaries, in order to better interpolate the data point between the grid. And simulation results show the SVD basis outperforms previous Taylor and Polar basis. Then, motivated by orthogonal matching pursuit, the algorithm greedily recovers the time bins of occurrence of each waveform, and moves to the Fourier domain to more precisely estimate time shifts. 
The paper is clearly written and seems new in this field. And the new algorithm outperforms previous ones. A new algorithm about signal recovery.
