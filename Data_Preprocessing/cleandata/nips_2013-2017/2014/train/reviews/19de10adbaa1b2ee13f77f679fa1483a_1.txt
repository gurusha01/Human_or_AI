A convnet with feedback connections to learn visual attention. The feedback is done by gating activation of some filters. The model is learned with reinforcement learning on top of a convnet. No part is particularly novel but the approach taken is a really good one in my opinion and the right way to go. And as expected they prove it with state of the art results on CIFAR. This is significant in confirming feedback/attention is the right way to go next. Quality and clarity is good. A very good approach to vision with good results: convnets with RL-driven feedback attention. If possible, authors should go deeper on bigger problems like imagenet if they aren't already.
