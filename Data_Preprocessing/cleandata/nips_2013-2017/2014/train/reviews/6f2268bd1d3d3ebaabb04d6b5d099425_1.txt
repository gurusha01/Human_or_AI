The paper looks at the problem of combining clustering and outlier detection. It is very well written and easy to read. The authors reuse an earlier facilities location without outliers formulation by Charikar et' al and their main contribution is the solution to the problem formulation. 
The FLO problem was shown to be intractable by the authors of that paper and no approximation algorithm exists that is both i) scalable and ii) comes with guarantees. The FLO paper has well over 100 citations and a quick scan of them shows this to be case. The Lagrange relaxation the author's propose is straight forward and seems reasonable. The analysis of the LR is interesting, the core result that the LP relaxation of FLO is equivalent to the LR relaxation is non-intuitive. 
The experimental results are a nice addition to the paper in that they show the usefulness of the formulation particularly the speed up over the LP relaxation. However, I found the lack of absolute values in the experimental section raised questions. For example in Figure 3, your results show the speedup over LP relaxation but doesn't show how fast the LR method is in absolute time.
 The authors take an existing formulation (FLO) show how it is useful for outlier detection and clustering simultaneously. Their main contribution is the LR formulation for the existing objective function and the experimental results showing its usefulness.
