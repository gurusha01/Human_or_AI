Summary:
This paper addresses the semi-metric labeling problem, a discrete optimization problem whose objective function separates according to a second-order MRF and whose second-order functions are proportional to a semi-metric. It extends recent work [14,15,20] in which (primal) move making algorithms are developed, for some semi-metrics, which match the best known multiplicative bounds of rounded solutions of the LP relaxation. This paper generalizes those results and defines move making algorithms for several rounding procedures and arbitrary semi-metrics. 
Quality:
- the paper is technically correct
- the references are adequate
- the authors are clear about the problems they solve and the problems that have been solved before
Clarity:
- the paper is well-written, well-structured and easy to read
Originality:
- the Interval Move Algorithm and the Hierarchical Move Algorithm as well as the equality of the multiplicative bounds of these algorithms to that of related rounding procedures are novel.
Significance:
- this work is a significant contribution to our understanding of the connection between (primal) move making algorithms and algorithms that round the solutions of LP relaxations, in the context of the semi-metric labeling problem. A technically correct, well-written and well-structures paper which makes a significant contribution to our understanding of the connection between (primal) move making algorithms and algorithms that round the solutions of LP relaxations, in the context of the semi-metric labeling problem.
