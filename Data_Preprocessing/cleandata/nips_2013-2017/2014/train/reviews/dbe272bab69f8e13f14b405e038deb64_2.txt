Well written and significant paper on inferring synaptic conductance from recorded spike trains, with validation from physiological data.
How is this method extended to infer network connectivity structure, in addition to the synaptic conductances, from spike data on a limited number of neurons in the networks? Please see Abarbanel et al and other recent work for some examples in this direction.
