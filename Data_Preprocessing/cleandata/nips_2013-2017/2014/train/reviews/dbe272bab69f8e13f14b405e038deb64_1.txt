The authors propose a conductance based spiking model (CBSM) that is more biophysically 
realistic than the currently popular generalized linear model (GLM). Furthermore, the authors 
present CBSM as a generalization of the GLM and propose a set of constraints that can reduce it 
to a GLM and a GLM variant that would be as adaptive as the CBSM.
The proposed model is an interesting extension to current spiking models in that it is parametrized
in a more descriptive way of the spiking process without sacrificing much of the mathematical
convenience of the GLM. 
One thing that could raise some concerns stems from the last paragraph of page 6. The behaviour of 
the inhibitory filter described in line 322 is reminiscent of overfitting. The authors deal with that
by adding the regularizing penalty of Eq. 22. However, it seems that they don't use cross-validation 
in the experimental results to show the applicability of their model in a more natural environment.
Some small things that might need correction:
	line 121: fourth subscript should be i?
	line 214: chose our an? Good quality paper in line that is a considerable contribution to the state of the art. I would like to see a few more experiments
