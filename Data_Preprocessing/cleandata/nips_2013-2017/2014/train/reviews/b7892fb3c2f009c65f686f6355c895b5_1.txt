The authors "kernelize" a recent Bayesian SVM by use of Gaussian Processes. For the resulting hierarchical GP model two forms of approximate inference are proposed: An MCMC sampler and an EM algorithm.
A sparse (FITC) approximation is proposed as a further speedup.
Another contribution is a GPLVM model for the Bayesian kernel SVM.
In most places the paper is fairly clear in terms of writing.
Conceptually, most of the proposed extensions to the Bayesian SVM are pretty standard. But together they yield an interesting set of contributions.
Due to the large number of different contributions and extensions, each of these falls a bit short in terms of experiments. Despite assessing prediction quality on a range of data sets, some additional empirical validation beyond bare prediction errors and timing would be nice to assess properties of the model in terms of modeling and inference. The topic and the proposed Bayesian kernel SVM are interesting and fairly relevant. I would have wished for some better intuition and empirical assessment of the properties of the model and differences to related models.
