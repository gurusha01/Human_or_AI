This paper studies a structured spike-and-slab prior where Gaussian process is used to impose spatial contiguity of the sparsity pattern. Previous work in (Cevher et. al., 2008) reported a closely related study by using Ising model to encode the between-element correlation. A major difference between the present paper and (Cevher et. al., 2008) is that the Ising model is replaced by a Gaussian process passed through a Probit link function. The proposed spike-and-slab construction is employed as a prior for the unknown signal in a linear inverse problem, and an EP algorithm is developed to infer the unknown signal under such a prior. Experiments are based on synthetic data.
The Gaussian process based correlation structure constitutes the main novelty of the proposed spike-and-slab prior. However, how this correlation structure compares to the Ising model in (Cevher et. al., 2008) is not discussed, nor are they compared in the experiments. In addition to this obvious issue, a number of other issues are identified, as described below. 
(1) Figure 1(c), how is the correlation between z1 and z2 computed?
(2) The shorthand notation MMV is never defined.
(3) No real data are used in the experiments.
(4) Experiment 2, why not including BG-AMP in the comparison, although (quoted from the paper) ''Note, that the BG-AMP algorithm is expected to perform poorly on this problem due to the violation of the assumption of Aij being gaussian iid."
 This paper presents a correlated spike-and-slab prior with the correlation structure implemented by a Gaussian process. The relations between the proposed prior and the Ising-model based prior in (Cevher et. al., 2008) are not sufficiently discussed, nor are they compared in the experiments. Other issues include the missing comparison to BG-AMP in experiment 2 and that the experiments are based exclusively on synthetic data.
