This paper proposes a new algorithm for the balanced k-cut objective function using continuous relaxation, for both the classical clustering setting with no labeled data, as well as the transductive setting. Thorough experimental results compare the new method against many other variation of spectral clustering, and demonstrate that the new method often outperforms previous ones. Particularly, the new algorithm consistently finds better balanced k-cuts, but also, somewhat surprisingly, it is able to find better partitions based on other related objective functions, even against algorithms that are designed for those functions. 
Minor comments:
- Page 1, at end of the first paragraph of the introduction, switch the order of the words "outperform" and "frequently." 
- Please alphabetize the bibliography. 
 A continuous relaxation of balanced k-cut is presented. Thorough experimental results show notable qualitative improved other previous related techniques.
