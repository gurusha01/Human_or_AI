In this paper, the authors consider bipartite ranking and specifically, they consider optimizing the ranking at the top.
The authors first define a loss function that penalizes positive
example whenever its predicted score is less than that of the negative example with the highest
score. The main technical contribution is to propose a regularized optimization problem with
the above loss and to show that it can be solved efficiently via the dual formulation. The authors
give an optimization algorithm to solve the proposed formulation. They also give a theoretical result
that gives an upper bound on the probability that any positive example is ranked below delta fraction
of negative examples. The main advantage of the proposed formulation is that it brings down the computational
complexity of to rank optimization to linear in the number of examples. 
Finally, the authors give experimental results comparing their approach with several other approaches. The proposed method clearly outperforms most other methods both in terms of speed and accuracy.
Minor comment:
The definitions of loss used in this paper is non-standard. Typically e^{-z} is the exponential
loss and [1-z]_{+}^2 is the truncated exponential loss. However, there is no issue since the 
authors have also flipped the sign of the argument in Eqn (3). For clarity, I think that it is
better to modify this to match standard definitions.
The paper seems quite novel to me and the contributions in this paper seem non trivial. I do not
have any major concerns about this paper.
 The authors propose an elegant approach to reduce the time complexity of bipartite rankingto linear in the number of examples. The experimental results are quite compelling. I strongly recommendaccepting this paper.
