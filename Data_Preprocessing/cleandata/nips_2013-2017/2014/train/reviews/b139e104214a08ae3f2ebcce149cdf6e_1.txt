The paper derives a version of Pinsker's theorem for the normal means model (minimax lower bound), when a quantized version of the data is observed rather than the original data. It also provides a strategy for encoding and decoding (estimating the mean parameters from the quantized data) that achieves the lower bound. 
The paper is written clearly and the result are certainly useful from a practical point of view too. I went over the proofs and they seem correct to me. As the authors acknowledge, the encoding-decoding method is computationally prohibitive. It would be interesting to see if the results of [12] (and a sequence of follow up/related work) could be leveraged in this context to design a computationally efficient schemes. 
Lastly, I am not particularly in favor of the title quantized 'non-parametric estimation'. I feel quantized 'infinite Gaussian sequence model' or 'normal means model' might be more apt for this work. The reason being, there is no rigorous proof of the equivalence (in a LeCam sense, along the lines of Brown and Low, 1996 for the unquantized case) between the quantized normal means model and non-parametric estimation problems in this paper.  The paper derives a version of Pinsker's theorem for the normal means model (minimax lower bound), when a quantized version of the data is observed rather than the original data. The paper is written clearly and provides significant theoretical insights for a practically relevant problem.
