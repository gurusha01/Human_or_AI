This paper propose a new sampling algorithm for the state posterior distribution in a multi-chain model.
The original contribution of the paper relies on the application of slice sampling technique to the context of multi-chain hidden Markov models.
My major concerns are the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item I wonder if the method can be extended to FHMM with more general transition matrix than the one given in eq. (1).
\item The illustrative example presented in Section 2 (see panel a) in Figure 2), shows that a pairwise blocked Gibbs cannot go in one step from the initial state multi-chain configuration to the true one. The authors claim that this is an example where the standard Gibbs chain is trapped by these type of local modes. I disagree with this conclusion. I would conclude instead that the example show that the mixing of a standard Gibbs chain can be slower than the mixing of the proposed Hamming ball sampler.
\item It has been shown that the mixing of the basic FFBS sampler for HMM can be improved by applying permutation sampler (Fr\"uwirth-Schnatter (2001)) or antithetic sampling (Billio et al. (2014)). I wonder if the performance of both the GB and the HB samplers can be further improved by combining them with these sampling strategies. Further simulation results (or at least a discussion) will be appreciated.
\end{enumerate}
Minor remarks:
\begin{enumerate}
\item line 152, provide a formal definition (or reference) for the Hamming distance.
\item line 168, The authors claim that "This Hamming ball, centered at
$X$, is simply the union of all $i$-th location Hamming balls of radius $m$", but then from the decomposition given in equation (6) it looks like it is an intersection. 
\item line 171, is $I(\cdot)$ the indicator (or characteristic) function? I cannot understand why the authors define it as the identity function.
\item Bibliography needs a careful revision. E.g.: line 434, "Markov" instead of "markov"; line 452, "Monte Carlo" instead of "monte carlo"; line 467, "Indian" instead of "indian".
\end{enumerate}
