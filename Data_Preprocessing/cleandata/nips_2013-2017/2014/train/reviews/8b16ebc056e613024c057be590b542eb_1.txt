The authors learn a convolution filter for preprocessing signals from calcium imaging, which led them to be similarly effective at predicting neural connectivity from calcium imaging data as a winning algorithm in a recent competition on this problem. The winning algorithm used a grid search approach to preprocessing, but the approach described here will likely be more robust, and thus is of particular interest to a subset of the NIPS community.
1) Please plot f, n, and y on figure 1c in a more easy-to-visualize manner, as the relation between these is the crucial result supplied by this paper. Currently f and y are plotted but they are difficult to see due to the thick line-width and overlap.

page 6 typo "fluoresce" should be fluorescence This paper presents a useful approach to preprocessing calcium imaging data based on learning a convolution filter, which will likely be of interest to members of the NIPS community that work with such data.
