The author(s) present a method for combining the Bayes/GP and max-margin approaches to learning, initially by extending earlier work of [5]. They develop a detailed model combining Bayesian methods and SVM-related methods in a way that is clear, comprehensive and novel. They obtain algorithms for inference and prediction based on several statistical methods, including an algorithm incorporating a factor model, and give extensive experimental results. 
Quality
-------
This is an excellent paper, presenting a new and apparently powerful collection of algorithms which seamlessly and elegantly integrate several state-of-the-art methods. While attempts to produce Bayesian versions of the SVM have a considerable history --- and I was somewhat surprised that no mention was made of the work of Peter Sollich et al., which I believe was the earliest --- this seems a cleaner and more satisfactory approach than those I have previously seen.
Clarity 
-------
The paper is clear, concise and well-written.
Originality
-----------
The work demonstrates considerable originality.
Significance
------------
 A very good paper indeed.
