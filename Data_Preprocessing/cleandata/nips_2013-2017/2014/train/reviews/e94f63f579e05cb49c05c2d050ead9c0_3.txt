The paper presents a Bayesian quadrature approach that uses square root transform and active learning technique. Two approximation schemes for the likelihood Gaussian process prior are explored -- linearization and moment matching. A simple active sampling method (without integration) is also used to increase speed.
The paper is well written. I am not an expert in BQ, so the paper is more like an educational read to me. The only part concerns me is that experimental section. The author didn't compare the method with other BQ methods. It is hard for me to judge if the method is indeed superior when it is only compared to slow MCMC methods. It would also be ideal for the authors to post the number of point it requires in order to achieve the same accuracy as MCMC methods (BMC and SMC at least).
  A well written paper in BQ, but the experimental section can use some work.
