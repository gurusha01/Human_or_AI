The authors present a novel approach to learning to rank. In contrast to traditional approaches, the idea is to focus on the number of positive instances that are ranked before the first negative one. Following a large-margin approach leads to primal and dual representations. Compared to similar approaches, the complexity is only linear in the number of instances. 
This is a nice paper! Particularly the technical contribution is strong.
Apart from the url data set, the rest of the experiments is pretty small-scale. Adding experiments on larger-scales would certainly strengthen the paper as baseline competitors will at some point drop out. Consider having a figure showing performance vs number of training instances to showcase the benefit of processing more data than the baselines. The same figure for time instead of performance would also be interesting. 
The divide and conquer schema should at least be sketched in the final paper. 
 Strong technical contribution. Good paper.
