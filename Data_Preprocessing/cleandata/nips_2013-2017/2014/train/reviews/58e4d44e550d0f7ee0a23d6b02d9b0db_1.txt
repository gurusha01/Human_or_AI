The paper is well written and it appears like a novel result, perhaps less so to someone who is an expert in streaming algorithms. The theory and Theorem 4 in particular appear to be correct.  Summary:This paper deals with low-rank "k" approximation of a matrix when its rows are presented in a streaming fashion. Recently (SODA 2014), an algorithm was proposed for this task which uses O(dk/epsilon) words of space. It was an open question if that bound is tight. This paper shows a \Omega(dk/epsilon) lower bound which establishes that the bound is optimal and that it needs \Theta(dk/epsilon) words of space.
