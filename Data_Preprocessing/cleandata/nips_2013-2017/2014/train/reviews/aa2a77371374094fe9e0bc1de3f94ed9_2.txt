A multivariate spatio-temporal analysis based on cokriging and forecasting is presented. The analysis is based on the low rank tensor learning framework. An efficient greedy learning algorithm is implemented. Results obtained both from synthetic and real data problems are discussed. I have just a couple of minor comments.1) there is a typo at page 2, between section 2 and subsection 2.1: of patio-temporal2) I would prefer "subject to" in place of "s.t." (formulae 5 and 6)
