The authors consider logistic regression when the data are contaminated with outliers. No assumptions are made on the outliers, they need not even follow any distribution, which can happen for example when a video is corrupted by sensor errors. 
The authors provide an innovative algorithm, RoLR, and provide performance guarantees. The algorithm is simple to describe but uses sophisticated ideas, and the mathematics behind the performance guarantees is impressive. The simulations are promising. 
Specific comments:
L135: Why does $\beta^*$ have unit length?
Line 157: X_i is p-dimensional, so how is the square and the absolute value defined?
The paper is of high quality and clearly written. It is to be seen how the method will perform for real data, but regardless of this the theoretical advance is important. 
 The paper is innovative and the mathematics is of high quality.
