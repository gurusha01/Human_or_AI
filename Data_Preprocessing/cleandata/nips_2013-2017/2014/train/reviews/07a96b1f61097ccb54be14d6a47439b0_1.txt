This paper addresses the problem of robustly estimating the low-dimensional subspace of contaminated observations when the observations are inherently coherent. Performance goes worse with increasing data coherence is a standard theoretical bottleneck of previous RPCA methods. This paper, however, circumvents this problem in a clever manner. Considering that such cluster structure is rather common in realistic data, solving this issue is certainly significantly meaningful. The proposed method is both theoretically sound and well demonstrated to perform well in practice.
I just have a curious comment on the submission:
Can the proposed method also be applied for solving subspace clustering/segmentation problem? Could the authors provide some comments on this point?
 This paper solves an important problem in robust PCA works. The quality of the paper is very good and should be accepted.
