The authors derive a lower-bound on minimax risk for the estimation of normal means under a "communication constraint": a restriction on the number of bits that can be used to represent a given estimate. The authors devise a theoretical (not practically implementable) discretized estimator that achieves this bound, and show performance results in small-scale simulations. 
The paper is quite well written, and the presentation is clear and organized. The results are interesting and, to the best of my knowledge, novel. 
The authors do not propose a practical encoding method that achieves their bound, nor do they evaluate known encoding methods with respect to their bound. Further, the model used to derive the bound could be generalized significantly; the results do not seem to have immediate practical application, which limits its scope somewhat. Nevertheless, the paper is an interesting step toward understanding the tradeoff between statistical power and storage resources. 
 In this interesting, well written paper, the authors derive a lower-bound on minimax risk for the estimation of normal means under a "communication constraint": a restriction on the number of bits that can be used to represent a given estimate. The work is a worthwhile theoretical advance toward understanding the tradeoff between statistical power and storage resources.
