The problem of aligning two manifolds is a well studied one in the literature. This paper proposes a method for aligning two datasets, under the crucial assumption that both data sets lie on a single manifold, given no correspondences. This problem was studied by Wang and Mahadevan (IJCAI 2009), and subsequently by several others. This paper proposes a more sophisticated loss function than previous work, based on minimizing a sum of three terms: a geometry matching term, a feature matching term, and a geometry preserving term. This results in a difficult non-convex optimization problem, but the author(s) propose a sophisticated convex relaxation based on an alternating projection like idea of assuming the projections are known, and solving the resulting quadratic integer programming problem using the Frank-Wolfe algorithm. 
The paper contains a detailed set of experiments comparing the new method to the previous work of Wang and Mahadevan and others, showing significantly improved performance on several synthetic and moderately complex real datasets. The results appear to show a significant improvement over previous work. 
The major limitation of this work, however, is the crucial assumption that the datasets lie on a single underlying manifold. This is unfortunately unlikely to be the case with the majority of real-world data sets, which lie on some complex mixture of manifolds. Techniques for dealing with alignment in this case are beginning to be proposed, but appear to be beyond the scope of this paper. It would be interesting to see if the proposed approach could be extended to this more realistic setting.  Proposes a novel method for aligning two datasets that lie on a single underlying manifold based on no correspondence information, and shows improved performance over previous unsupervised alignment methods. Results show significant improvement, but the assumption of a single underlying manifold remains restrictive.
