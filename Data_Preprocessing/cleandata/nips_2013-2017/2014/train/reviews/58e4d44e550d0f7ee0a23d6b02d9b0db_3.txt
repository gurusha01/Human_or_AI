The concern is to compute a k-rank approximation of a $n\times d$ matrix A when its rows are presented in a streaming fashion, one at a time.
Specifically, the algorithm of Ghashami and Phillips (SODA, 2014) is shown optimal (up to word size) with a space lower bound of $\Omega(dk/e)$.
Theoretical results are presented as a reduction to the well-known Index problem in communication complexity. The exposition that follows is well written and technically sound. Once the problem is formulated in the authors' framework, the mathematical machinery to proof the statements is standard.
My major concern with the paper is the significance of the contributed results, specially when comparing with the already available in the aforementioned SODA paper. In this paper, the O(dk/e) space requirement for the streaming low-rank matrix approximation algorithm of Ghashami and Phillips is shown tight. The paper is well written and seems technically sound.
