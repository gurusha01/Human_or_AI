Summary: This very strong paper proposes a rational model for algorithm selection based on problem features and Bayesian regression. The model is shown to be effective computationally and to better predict human performance than comparable models. 
This paper is the epitome of a strong NIPS paper. The paper is clearly written and addresses an interesting problem. There is both a nice computational result about the algorithm and a cognitive model that is tested with a brief experiment. 
My only substantive concern is that too much is made of the rational component of the approach. A lot of the success (both computationally and as a cognitive model) comes from breaking the problem space into the features rather than the rational inference per se. It would be nice to see this approach pitted against an RL model with function approximation, instead of the simple RL model considered. 
Minor points:
-Fig 1 has tiny fonts.
-line 38: "by specialized algorithms" no a.
-Equations 11-12 were a bit hard to follow and certainly did not seem simple
-One of the strongest parts of the paper is the very serious comparison against other algorithms that was undertaken. That is not sufficient usual and should be commended.
