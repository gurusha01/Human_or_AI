This paper investigates the communication cost of distributed estimation for d-dimensional spherical Gaussian distribution with unknown mean and unitary covariance, where the joint distribution is assumed to be a product distribution of each coordinate. The authors generalize previous works on the one-dimensional case in [4] by proposing upper and lower bounds for d-dimensional data on two communication schemes, interactive and simultaneous communication settings, for achieving minimax squared loss. The results establish the tradeoffs between dimensionality and communication cost for distributed estimation. In addition, improved bounds are derived when the unknown mean is s-sparse.
 
Although the model is somewhat restrictive (for example, the joint distribution is a product distribution of each coordinate and the covariance matrix is known), this paper offers new insights on the communication cost of distributed estimation and protocol design. The results are technically solid and several rule-of-thumb protocols have been proposed with an aim of achieving the communication lower bounds.
A minor concern for this reviewer was the paper's weakness in presentation. First, the introduction is too lengthy and, second, there is no conclusion section. It is suggested that the authors refine the introduction part and provide a conclusion section to summarize the contributions. It was also somewhat irritating that the notations in the main paper and the supplementary file were not consistent, making it difficult to use the supplementary file for clarification of certain points in the paper. For example, Lemmas 1 and 2 in the paper are exactly the same as Lemmas 3 and 4 in the supplementary file. This paper studies bounds on communication cost in distributed estimation and several protocols are proposed to achieve the communication lower bounds. The authors provide solid analysis on the subject and the results are significant.
