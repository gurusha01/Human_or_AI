The authors propose to model the selection of the appropriate algorithm for a task as a metacognitive process by maximizing the value of computation, defined as the amount of expected utility of acting after having carried out a computation that exceeds the expected utility without carrying out the computation. The authors approximate this value by learning to predict the score and the runtime of an algorithm on the basis of features, which are chosen by Bayesian feature selection. Applying this meta-reasoning to the problem of choosing the algorithm for minimizing the duration of sorting lists shows that the proposed computation performs better than two previously proposed methods, one based on decision trees and one based on recursive algorithm selection using dynamic programming. 
Finally, the authors present a set of behavioral experiments in which human subjects had to sort lists according to either cocktail sort or merge sort by following respective instructions. After estimating from behavioral data the time to carry out individual sorting actions according to the two algorithms, the authors applied this model to the case in which subjects chose the algorithm to sort new sequences. The human behavior was better predicted by the metacognitive strategy compared to previous models of how humans choose to sort.
This is one of the best papers of the last three years I have been reviewing for Nips. The only recommendation I would like to give the authors for improving the manuscript is to provide more details for the reader on: 
- feature selection by Bayesian model choice,
- allows us to efficiently compute Bayes factors,
- Lagoudakis et al.'s method,
- an explanation for why Lagoudakis et al.'s method performs so much worse. 
P6:
"to an descending list."
a Great manuscript formalizing how to choose one algorithm for sorting applied to machine sorting and to human performance.
