Overview:
The paper proposes a framework for enforcing structure in Bayesian models via structured prior selection based on the maximum entropy principle. Although the optimal prior may not be tractable, the authors developed an approximation method using submodule optimization. Contructing priors with structured variables is an important topic, so this method should be able to make good impact.
Quality
The paper is technically sound. The authors present some results on both simulated data and functional MRI data to show that the methodology is effective. The strengths and limitations are also discussed. 
Clarity
Overall, this paper is clearly written and well-organized. 
Typeos: Page 4, line 210 and line 211, "Corollary 10" should be "Corollary 6"?
Please make sure the references have the same format.
 
 
Originality
 
It has enough novelty to me if all proofs are correct.
Significance
The paper presents an important topic and suggests an approach that is computationally feasible and understandable. 
 This is a nice work. I recommend acceptance for this paper.
