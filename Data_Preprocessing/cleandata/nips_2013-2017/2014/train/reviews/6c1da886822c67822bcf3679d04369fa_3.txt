This paper proposes an EM-like algorithm for matrix completion applied to recommendation systems; parameter estimation is constrained in order to maintain privacy guarantees. The authors modify the typical matrix completion with trace-norm regularization to only estimate the item features.
Quality:
The paper illustrates a nice use of privacy aware learning for the application of recommendation systems. They show that a small number of public users having a large number of ratings can provide sufficient overlap with private data to enable good accuracy. They use the private data to estimate covariances, while keeping a particular marginal distribution that helps maintain privacy.
Clarity:
The paper is well written. A few things could have been elaboarated:
- It's not quite clear how their method compares to previous methods, e.g. [10], either experimentally or in terms of privacy guarantees.
- It would be nice to show summary statistics/plots of the marginal distributions to help illustrate the affects of their technique.
Significance:
This paper belongs to an important class of algorithms that allow one to choose between privacy and accuracy. If data privacy continues to be in the public spotlight, this paper could be a nice addition to that field.
Originality:
To this reader's knowledge, their approach is novel, borrowing from common techniques in privacy aware learning. The paper illustrates a nice application of privacy aware learning to recommendation systems. Further experiments would strengthen the reader's understanding of how the algorithm performs, whether it meets its privacy goals, and how it compares to previous methods.
