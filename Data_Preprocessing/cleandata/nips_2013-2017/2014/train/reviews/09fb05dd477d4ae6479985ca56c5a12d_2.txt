The authors proposed a framework to adapt deep neural networks trained from image classification tasks to object detection tasks. Evaluation on the ImageNet LSVRC-2013 dataset demonstrates that the proposed method ranks 4th in the objects detection challenge. This paper is clearly presented and generally easy to follow, and the proposed CNN structure is interesting and simple to implement. Over all, the quality of the paper is good. However, there are two concerns that the authors could improve. 
First, as the main contribution of this work, the adaption method proposed in this paper needs better justification. The details of underlying motivations are not presented in a principled fashion. For example in Section 3.2 (Page 5 Line 231), it is not clear why the weights for adapted detection task is a summation of Wj^c and the W{avg}. The physical meaning of this 'offset parameter' is not explained. As a consequence, it is also not clear why the kNN variant is better.
Second, in comparing with other methods, the users used part of the validation set, but not the test set, making the comparison not fair. The authors mentioned in footnote (Line 322) that RCNN has similar performance on val2 set, but due to the small size of this set, the performance gain is not statistically justified.
 The authors proposed a framework to adapt deep neural networks trained from image classification tasks to object detection tasks. The proposed method has comparable performance as the state-of-the-art model, but the comparisons are on different settings, and the proposed adaptation method needs better explanation.
