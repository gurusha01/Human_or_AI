The authors improved a state space method of inferring the synaptic conductance. The method was originally proposed as a GLM based on a linear assumption in ref [8]. The point of improvement in this contribution is to incorporate the nonlinear stimulus-induced changes in synaptic conductance in a dynamical model of neuronal membrane potential. The proposed method offers an interpretation of GLM in terms of conductance-based model, and makes it possible to infer the synaptic conductance and time series of inputs. The proposed method appears solid and I believe this paper deserves publication, provided that they could revise the ms responding the following comment.
Major comment
The temporal profiles of filters used in the simulation have time-scales of 30-50 ms, which appear very long compared to the commonly known timescales of the biological conductance. I would request the authors to argue about the reason of this choice, or they should redo the analysis with the smaller timescales.
Minor typos
p3: "ge(t) Ei" should be "gi(t) Ei"
p7 "this this" Improvement of a state space method of inferring synaptic conductance, offering an interpretation of GLM in terms of conductance-based model. It would make a significant contribution if the problem of timescale is discussed properly.
