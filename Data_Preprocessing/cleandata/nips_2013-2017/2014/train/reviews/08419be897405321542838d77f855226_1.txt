First, apologies for the brevity of this review- I had written a version with more detailed comments and had found a few typos, but can't find it now.
This paper is an application of DNNs to a novel area (finding mathematical identities) and my feeling is that while the ideas are novel, this seems like preliminary work that maybe doesn't quite rise to the level of a NIPS publication. Specifically, your method doesn't seem to show particularly impressive performance in discovering identities, even though you only gave it a very limited set of inputs. The expressions that you were finding identities on were from such a limited set that it would probably have been easier to just work out some mathematical rule to discover them rather than applying DNNs; it seems like using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. Of course you might argue that your approach could be extended to a much more general range of expressions, but it's not clear to me that your existing approach would very easily scale out in that way, or that doing so would even make sense given your so-so initial results.
 I do think this is an interesting paper, but I think it's maybe a little but below the threshold for publication.
