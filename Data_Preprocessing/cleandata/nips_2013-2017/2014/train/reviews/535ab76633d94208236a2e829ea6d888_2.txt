The paper presented an approach to filter-out different adversarial voters in crowd sourcing systems in order to increase the quality of aggregation voting. The paper presents two different algorithm, soft and hard penalty assignment in order to filter out adversarial voters. Theoretical results justifies the proposed algorithms and the experimental results sounds promising.
This is an interesting problem and it would be nice to have more details about the applications of this problem.
 
It would be nice to have a few sentences explaining optimal semi-matching algorithm as it is being used as one of the important components in hard penalty assignment algorithm. 
Why the hard penalty assignment performs consistently better than soft penalty assignment in real data set comparing to synthetic data set? This consistency is not clear for me. 
 The problem is interesting and the paper has been written well. It would be nice to have more discussion about the applications where the problem fits.
