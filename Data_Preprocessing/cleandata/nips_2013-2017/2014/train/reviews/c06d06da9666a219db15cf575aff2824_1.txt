This paper presented a new method for spike-sorting, although the method itself is general and not limited to spike-sorting, and was presented in a generic way.
The authors introduced two new ideas. First is to use SVD to define basis functions and compute precise spike times by interpolation, which is I think a very neat idea. To this end, Taylor or polar interpolators are previously used (Ekanadham et al., 2011), but the authors pointed out that SVD-based method is theoretically optimal in MSE sense.
Second is to employ a greedy algorithm instead of a convex optimization solver. This is similar to OMP, but the authors further proposed an alternative tweak for finding finer spike times by working in the Fourier domain. As a result, computing time is greatly improved (Figure 3c).
I think this is a very nice paper overall.
Minor comments:
- There are several erroneous stentences (e.g., line 51; maybe 195-196; 429).
- What is the unit of noise in Figure 2(g) and (h)? 
- It would be much nicer if more thorough examinations of the proposed model with spike-sorting problems were presented, either with simulated or actua recordingl data.
 This paper presented a new spike-sorting algorithm that improved both performance and computational efficiency.
