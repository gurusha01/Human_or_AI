The paper presents a novel algorithm to solve the balanced k-cut problem. The k-cut criterion is defined by using the Lovasz extension of a set function. A relaxation of balanced k-cut functionals can be formulated using Lovasz extensions of cuts and of normalizing constraints. The appealing feature of this relaxation is the connection between convex Lovasz extensions and submodular set functions. The authors propose an algorithm that minimizes a sum of auxiliary variables that are lower-bounded by ratios. The minimization is further constraint by simplex and unique membership constraints. 
Clarity: The paper is very well written and it appropriately refers to prior art. 
Originality: There exists significant prior art and the novel idea modifies the optimization strategy. I consider the originality and in particular the novelty as limited but its significance due to the success in the experiments might justify publication of this paper at NIPS. 
Significance: Due to the surprisingly clear superiority of the new method, this paper might show high impact in the future despite its high similarity with prior art. 
Minor comments:
Figure 1 has five subfigures but only four are explained in the caption. What is the fifth subfigure about?
 A novel continuous relaxation for balanced k-cuts with a descent algorithm is presented andthe experimental evaluation looks very promising.
