This is an interesting paper. It addresses the problem of when a distribution may be recovered from knowledge of the generating process and the process leading to missing data.
The paper considers a more general class of missingness process than considered in earlier work by Mohan et al.
This leads to a novel identification formula.
In addition the authors consider the identification of causal queries and show that these can be identified even when the (observational) joint distribution is not identified.
The paper is generally well-written, though there are some glitches and areas for improvement I describe below.
MAIN COMMENTS:
(1) The results here require knowledge of the process by which observations are censored. 
Is this knowledge available in typical machine learning applications?
It would be helpful to include more of the detail regarding Figure 1 in the main paper. (This could be done by making the Figure smaller.)
(2) Section 2. It should be mentioned that the missing data processes here always assume that the full population is known:
Even if Vo = emptyset, and Rv =1 for all V in V_m (so no variables are observed for this individual) it is still supposed that we know this individual exists. 
(This excludes missing data problems such as estimating the number of animals in a population.) 
(3) The term mgraph seems to be used ambiguously. In particular, sometimes the graph includes the V* variables (Figure 1)
at other times it does not (Figure 2). If the V* variables are simply being omitted in these graphs then this should be explained.
(4) In this paper mgraphs are not allowed to have R variables as parents of variables in V or U.
Given that the authors describe treat the R variables as real quantities not simply indicators, they should explain why this restriction is justified (or whether it is mainly for convenience).
(5) The term 'neighbor', which appears at the bottom of p.4 is not defined.
(6) p. 8 first paragraph. "rectification" of the observation by Garcia.
recoverability as defined by the authors assumes positivity. Do Garcia et al also assume positivity?
If not, they might require a stronger condition.
(7) p.8 second paragraph. "Maximum Likelihood method is known to yield consistent estimates under MAR assumption".
This is much too vague. Why could maximum likelihood not be applied to any of the missingness processes described here.
MINOR COMMENTS
P.1 line 33. can bias outcomes
p.2 figure 1. Qualifications
p.2 Example 1 on p.3 line 158. P(Y |X,Z,R_y) = P(X,Z)
the RHS here should be P(Y|X,Z).
p.3 line 168. Since Y || R | X,Z
this should be: Y || R_y | X,Z
p.3 line 214. Condition (ii) R^{part} ={R^{(1)},R^{(2)}, \ldots , R^N}
Should be R^{(N)}.
p.3 line 215 R^j respectively
should be R^{(j)}
p.4 Corollary 1. does not contain a partially observed variables
p.6 Footnote 2. Please give a reference for the variable-level definition An interesting paper that builds on earlier work.Not clear how broad the application is, but technically sound.
