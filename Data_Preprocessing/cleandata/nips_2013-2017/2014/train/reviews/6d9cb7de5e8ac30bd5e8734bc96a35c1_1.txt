In this paper, the authors study the problem of learning a tensor for the purpose of linear multi-task learning. The authors propose a new weighted version of a previously proposed tensor norm (called "latent trace norm") and show that the introduced rescaling yields better bounds on the excess risk as well as improved recovery performance on some datasets. The paper is well written and organized, and the proposed rescaling can potentially have a significant impact in practice, although a more extensive experimental evaluation would have been desirable. The technical results seem to be appropriate and correctly proven. Literature coverage seems to be sufficient. It may be worth noticing that all the tensor norms studied in this paper can be also seen as particular cases of a more general class of tensor penalties introduced in the recent paper

 The paper carries out a study of some recently proposed tensor norms, and a new weighted version of one of them, illustrating the advantages of such reweighting both theoretically and empirically. The paper is well-written, organized, and of potential significance.
