This paper combines multiple graph kernels with a diffusion-convolutional neural net. Specifically, they propose weighting the jth hop transition for feature k in the first layer and then outputting an activation for each node, hop, feature and graph. This way, the weights can be learned from the data. The paper is of significant importance, since the problem of learning kernels from graph labels has not been comprehensively addressed in the literature. The paper could be much clearer, since the power spectrum P star and the hop is not well defined. I think that I know what is going on, but the average reader may not. The experiments are very informative and comprehensive.
