This paper proposes an approach to estimate depth from single images. In contrast to end-to-end CNN methods that directly regress the depth, this paper trains a neural network to predict distributional parameters over the zero-th, first and second order derivatives of the depth map. At test, given the estimate of these distributional parameters for all pixels of the image, a globalization step that 'harmonizes' all distributions is proposed. This globalization step aims at estimating the depth map and its corresponding derivatives that maximize the likelihoods of the parameter distributions. The method is evaluated on the NYU v2 depth dataset achieving better results than competing approaches only trained on this dataset, and performing slightly worse that other methods required additional supervision (pretrained VGG network or the outcome of a semantic segmentation). This is a technically sound paper. Using CNNs to regress distributional parameters that are later used to estimate depth is an interesting contribution. While the underlying idea is related to that proposed in [Chakrabarti et. al CVPR 2015], I believe there are sufficient differences between the two works to grant a new publication. My main concern is that looking at Figure 3, the estimated individual coefficients seem to have many low-confidence regions. I presume this is because the network is independently applied to local regions of the image. The final accuracy of the estimated depth map, therefore, heavily relies on the globalization procedure which is applied in a final and independent stage. This strategy seems to be in disadvantage with competing approaches such as that of Eigen and Fergus [ICCV 2015], in which several tasks (depth and normal prediction and semantic labeling) are simultaneously addressed by a single network architecture. In a similar way, I wonder if, for the approach proposed in this paper, the local estimation and global harmonization could also be performed by a single network. I would like the authors to further comment on the errors depicted in Fig. 3 and the particularities of the patterns that are drawn. For instance, I understand that the smooth elliptical shapes are the result of the GMMs, but I do not understand the reason of the vertical high frequency stripes.
