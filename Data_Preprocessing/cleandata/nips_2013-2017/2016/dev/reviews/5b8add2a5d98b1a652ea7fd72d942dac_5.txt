The paper proposes an almost everywhere differentiable generalization of subgradient solution to an over-determined system of quadratic equations with random coefficients that is know to be inconsistent. The cost function was shown to belong to the class of nonconvex and nonsmooth function. The authors established orthogonality in identiying a suitable initialization followed by the update with the generalized gradient iteration. The paper is impressive in the structure, contents and presentation. The algorithm was well justified and the results are good. However, it is recommended that the authors look into the 4n-2 claim for the complex case in page 2. Also, reference [22] included did not have the name(s) of the author(s).
