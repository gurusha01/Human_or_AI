This paper considers long-term trajectory planning using hierarchical policy models, in order to model the macro-micro behavior. The model is instantiated using deep memory network with attention mechanism, through which the macro-planner guides the micro-planner. It is shown that the proposed method generates more realistic player trajectories. In the first paragraph of section 3.1, the notation gt is not defined before its usage here. Moreover, the goal space is not defined in a concrete manner. Is it a finite dimensional space here? What is the dimension? How is it represented in practical problems? It is not clear how equation (3) is derived as both the left-hand side and the right-hand side have P(at | st, h{t-n,t}), which is very strange. How are the weak labels \hat{g}t and \hat{m}t obtained?
