The authors consider valid inference for the effect size in linear regression associated with groups of variables selected after viewing the data. A selective test for the null hypothesis that the projection of the mean onto the linear space spanned by the group variables, has been suggested before, but the existing test is not useful for obtaining a confidence interval. By deriving the exact distribution of this test statistic in the "noncentral" case (i.e., without assuming the null is true), a selective confidence interval is obtained for the size of the projection. Inference is in fact provided for the size of the projection of \mu onto the vector which is the projection of Y onto the linear space (this is indeed a parameter once conditioning on that direction). I found the paper to be an important extension of the previous paper by Loftus and Taylor ('15). The difference between the null distribution of the considered test statistic and the non-null distribution is quite interesting, and the technical problems that arise are substantial. A few comments: 1. Is there anything that can be said about properties of the proposed CI? in the case of inference for the coefficient of a selected variable in Gaussian linear regression (no groups), the conditioning on nuisance statistics is justified by theory for general exponential families (Fithian et al, '15).. 2. I understand that conditionally on dirL(Y), the distribution of the test statistic is governed by < dirL(Y), \mu > rather than < dirL(\mu), \mu >=\| PL \mu \|. The proposed CI is guaranteed to cover \| PL \mu \| w.p. 1-alpha conditionally on dirL(Y) but is usually conservative; but it then follows that also unconditionally on dir_L(Y), the CI should be valid for the parameter of interest. In that case maybe the CI is less conservative? 3. Consider modifying the wording in the following: -line 59: "distribution of subsets 60 of parameters " (please be more precise; this sentence doesn't make sense) -line 132: "Lemma 1 yields a truncated Gaussian distribution"
