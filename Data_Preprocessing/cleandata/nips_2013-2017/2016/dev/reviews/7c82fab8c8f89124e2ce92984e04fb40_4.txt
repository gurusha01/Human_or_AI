This paper studies the (relatively recently introduced) problem of selective inference for linear models with group sparsity. The authors provide new estimators for confidence intervals and testing selected groups. The paper is well-written and seems like an interesting contribution to this area (though I am not familiar with previous work beyond what the authors cite). The theoretical results are non-trivial and the experimental evaluation sounds promising.
