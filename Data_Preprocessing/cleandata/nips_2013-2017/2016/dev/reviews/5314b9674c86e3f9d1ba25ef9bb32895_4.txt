The authors approach the problem of image classification by means of tensor networks and optimization algorithms for these. A minimal theoretical evalution of their method and results on the MNIST dataset are provided. I have a few problems with the paper. I would have liked to see a better embedding of the paper in the literature. For instance, classification is one of the main applications of GLMs (called logistic regression in this case) and tensor methods have been used to optimise mixtures of GLMS [1]. There is not much depth to the paper. The authors propose essentially a new algorihtm without giving the reader strong arguments for getting interested in the algorithm: classification or regression algorithms are typically compared in terms of their expressive power (dense in L2, for instance -- the authors give here an informal argument why their model class should lie dense) and in terms of rates of convergence; for most regression/classification methods minmax optimal rates are known by now and I expect some discussion of the statistical properties of a regressor. One might also motivate the algorithm by beneficial computational runtimes/ complexity compared to other approaches. But this is not done here either. Finally, a strong empirical performance might be used as a motivation and the authors provide some results on the MNIST data set. But the empirical evaluation is in total rather meager (one short section in the middle of p. 6). So the paper leaves one with the feeling of yet another heuristic to some well understood machine learning problem and one wonders why one should bother. Some detailed comments: L19: what do you mean by exponentially large; exponential in what? L95: "The cost function for which we found our best test results .."; what does that mean? The performance is defined in terms of a cost function so what do you mean by your best test results?? Eq 6: how is delta^ellLn defined? == 1 if L_n = ell? L168: What do you mean by "the possible set of functions is quite general, .. " ? L176: a basis is by definition complete. What you mean is an orthonormal system. Literature should be alphabetical.
