The paper proposed methods to construct and summarize confidence sets for the unknown true cluster tree, and introduce a partial ordering on cluster trees which was used to prune some of the statistically insignificant features of the empirical tree. Clarity: - The paper is not well organized. The presentation and discussion of the main contribution (Section 4) is very limited. Also, some of the main text can be put into the supplementary material, Section 3 for example, since it seems to be not quite related to the following construction. - The title seems to be too big for the contents provided. As mentioned in Section 1, statistical inference "allow us to quantify our uncertainty, ..., as well as to rigorously test hypotheses related to the estimated cluster structure". No such hypothesis testing discussion is presented in the paper. - It would be good to provide the labels for the x- and y-axis in Figure 4 and 5 to make them self-contained. - The "feature" used is confusing. There is no clear description on what it refers to. Innovation/Significance: - It would be better to have the result on T(p0) combining the results of Lemma 2 and Theorem 3. - The authors failed to deliver comparisons with the existing large-sample approximate confidence intervals, which is essential. Also, no practical situation is discussed, where these complex confidence intervals can be applied and really shine. - One of the contributions is the convergence rate independent of the dimension, but this has not be validated in the experiment section. I think partial ordering and Lemma 2 are interesting by themselves, but the whole manuscript lacks a coherent presentation and strong validations.
