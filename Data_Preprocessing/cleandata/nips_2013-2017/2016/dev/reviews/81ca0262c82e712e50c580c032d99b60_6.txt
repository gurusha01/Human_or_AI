This paper studies causal subset selection based on directed information. Two tasks are formulated and their sub-modularity properties are explored through a so called sub-modularity index introduced by the authors. This paper investigates the subset selection problem with respect to directed information as the causality measure. The main contribution comes from introducing a sub-modularity index to indicate how close the function is to sub-modular. The index seems to be natural and it is a bit surprising that it is not been studied before. Overall, the methods are novel and interesting. The application of the method, learn the causal structure, is quite interesting.
