This paper proposes a new algorithm called the truncated generalized gradient flow (TGGF) to solve quadratic linear systems. This algorithm starts with an orthogonality-promoting initialization and then then successively updates scaled iterations, which is in contrast with to existing literature where spectral initializations are used. I found the paper in general well-written and the results solid. The main result Theorem 1 assumes noiseless measurements. Can this be generalized to the case of noisy measurements?
