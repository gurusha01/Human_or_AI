The basic idea of the paper is to formulate the two problems, source detection and causal covariate selection, into cardinality constrained directed information (DI) maximization problems. It is then shown that the objective function of source detection which is precisely the DI from selected set to its complement is submodular, although not monotonic. It is also shown that the problem of causal covariates selection which is the DI from selected set to some target process is not submodular, however, the authors define a new notion called "near-submodularity" which holds in this case (at least in some problem instances). A novel quantity, namely submodularity index (SmI), for general set functions is introduced to measure how "submodular" a set function is. for a non-submodular functions SmI is negative. But if SmI is not so small, then the algorithm random-greedy will still perform near-optimally (even for non-monotone functions). As a separate contribution, the authors derive near-optimality bounds of the performance of the random-greedy algorithm based on SmI. Such bounds are then incorporated into analysing the behaviour of random greedy on the two main problems considered in the paper (i.e. source detection and causal covariate selection). In general, computing SmI may be intractable (exponential in size of the ground set). Hence, the authors provide a simple lower bound for SmI for the two problems considered. These theoretical results are then verified by numerical experiments. The paper is clearly written in most parts and I enjoyed reading it. Apart from proposing efficient algorithms for the two problems considered (source detection and causal covariate selection), I believe that a separate contribution of the paper is to show the near-optimality of the random-greedy algorithm in terms of the so-called submodularity index (SmI). As a result, for functions that are "approximately" submodular (i.e. have a small SmI), the greedy algorithm may work well. Computing the value of SmI is exponential in terms of the size of the ground set. I suggest that the authors: (i) provide computable bounds on this index (as done in lemma 2) for other classes of se functions, (ii) provide some more applications where SmI is small. I should also mention that the bound provided in Lemma 2, becomes useless as n growrs as the mutual information terms will most probably grow by n. As a result, I suggest that the authors investigate the performance of random greedy on problems (lets say source detection) with the ground set size |V| being large (100 or so). It would be interesting to see how the proposed methodology compares to other algorithms in this setting. Also, in the experimental results, can the authors explain why they have not made any comparison with the other methods (e.g [21-22])? some minor comments: Line 60: "i" should be "t" or vice versa. Line 101, you never formally define what S^n is. Line 161: perhaps strictly-submodular? Line 280: should be "reduced".
