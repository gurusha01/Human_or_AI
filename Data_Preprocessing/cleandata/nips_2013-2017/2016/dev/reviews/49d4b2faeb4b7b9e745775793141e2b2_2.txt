The authors present a new hierarchical generative model, the MatNet. It combines recent advances in the field by the DRAW-type models, Ladder Networks, residual nets, etc It achieves state-of-the-art results, in terms of NLL, in some datasets (MNIST, Omniglot, CIFAR 10), and exhibits some good qualitative inpainting results on other datasets (CelebA, LSUN). Technical Quality: I thought the experimental section was very clear; a straightforward and reproducable experimental protocol was followed, and there were comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, even with some methods that were very recent (eg. Pixel RNN). I would have liked to see side-to-side comparison with other methods for the qualitative results which I did not see in the supplementary material either. Novelty: The authors used recent successes in the field and pushed forward eg by using a GMM as a prior over z_0 instead of a single Gaussian prior. Clarity: Figure 1 could have been of a much better quality and clearer. Also it was not clear what was different between the supplementary material and the actual paper submission (Except for the additional images section in the supp. material)
