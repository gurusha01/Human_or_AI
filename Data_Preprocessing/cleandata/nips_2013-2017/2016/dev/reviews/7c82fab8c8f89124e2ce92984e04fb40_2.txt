The authors propose a framework for evaluating the significance and the associated confidence interval for a selected group of variables in the context of group-sparse regression. I found this paper quite difficult to read. I'm afraid this as well as the high density of the paper has impaired my understanding of the contribution. In particular, I am not very clear on the incremental contribution over Loftus and Taylor, 2015. As far as I understand, the goal of the paper is to provide a way to test, either iteratively or as a whole, the relevance of groups of variables selected by group-sparse linear algorithms. The authors mainly focus on three such algorithms. While I can clearly see the advantages of being able to compute these significance results, I am afraid that I can't provide a relevant review for this paper and for this I apologize, hoping that my fellow reviewers will feel more confident. Let me still try to focus on the applications. In the California data set example and table 1, I don't understand how the 3-variable groups are constructed. I was actually hoping to see actual groups of variables but I understand that the 3-variable groups are constructed by "expanding" one variable into 3? Why not let the algorithms actually choose groups of variables? I'm assuming this might be for comparison purposes but it also makes the results somewhat unclear. In general, I would have liked to see a more algorithmic version of the procedure somewhere in the paper. From what I see here, I am really not sure how this method is/could be implemented.
