This paper presents a novel method for selective inference in the setting of group sparsity that includes the construction of confidence intervals and p-values for testing selected groups of variables. The originality lies in the development of the projection of the data onto a given space and inference procedures for a broad class of group-sparse selection methods including the group lasso, iterative hard thresholding, and forward stepwise regression. The proposed method is practically useful and can be accepted to the conference.
