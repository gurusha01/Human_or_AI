This is a clearly written paper which presents and evaluates (through simulation) practical algorithms for decision threshold optimization. Major comments: - I think this paper makes a valuable contribution to the theoretical literature on DDMs. It seems that this paper is written primarily for a neuroscience/psychology audience; these have been the main consumers of these algorithms. However, I was disappointed to see almost no application to neuroscience or psychology. For example, are these algorithms cognitively or biologically plausible? Is there empirical evidence to support any of these algorithms? What kinds of experiments could be done to test these hypotheses? - It would be really useful to see learning curves for the two methods as a function of computation time rather than trials. This would help determine the optimal choice of algorithm for a particular computational budget. - It's never explained why Bayesian optimization has a larger variance. - Simen, Holmes & Cohen (2006) describe a neural network that optimizes decision thresholds. They claim that it is neurally plausible. Frank (2006) also presents a biologically plausible mechanism for threshold adjustment (though not in the DDM formalism). Both of these models are put forth as theories of how the brain actually does threshold optimization, so they are important to discuss (and compare against with respect to empirical data) if we are to take seriously the new model as a psychological/neural theory. I have read the other reviews as well as the author feedback, and I have decided to keep my current scores. Minor comments: - p. 3: W0 and W1 appear to be error costs, but this isn't stated explicitly. - p. 3: "sum collected" -> "sum of collected" - Footnote 1: W0/W1 are referred to as thresholds, but I think theta0/theta1 are meant here. - p. 4: "dependance" -> "dependence"
