The paper talks about the problem of finding the optimal time to make an action in the problem of decision making under uncertainty. This is the same as finding the proper threshold in the drift-diffusion model commonly used for two-alternative forced choice tasks. The paper proposes two methods, i.e. REINFORCE and Bayesian optimization to learn this threshold. The paper brings up an important problem and it is presented well. However, as authors mentioned, no biologically plausible implementation is suggested in the paper. Also to my understanding, the current models only handle the Bayes risk. There is also a biological cost for observing and accumulating evidence (see Drugowitsch et al 2012, J neuro). How is it possible to add this cost of observing to the methods for learning the threshold?
