This paper presents a deep learning approach to learn correspondences between pairs of images. They use a FCN with a novel correspondence contrastive loss and active hard-negative mining. They demonstrate the performance of this approach on a number of public datasets. A well written description of the methods with convincing results. More details about the "semantic " aspect of this approach would be helpful.
