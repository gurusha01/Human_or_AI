This paper extends CNNs to handle general graph-structured data by introducing a diffusion-convolution operation, extensive experiments are conducted on various node and graph classification tasks, and better performance results are achieved over probabilistic relational models and kernel methods. lines 109 - 110 "training is ceased if the validation error of a given epoch is greater than the average of the last few epochs." Do you try other criteria, such as if the validation error of a given epoch is greater than the last epoch, cut learning rate in half? line 98 "graph" showed twice.
