This paper proposed a new algorithm on partial monitoring games. Instead of using the UCB techniques in the previous CPM models, this paper use another classic technique "forcing with certainty equivalence". Their algorithm, PEGE, is based on a simpler oracle. This algorithm can also combine with gap estimation to achieve the same regret bound with previous result. The author also shows that this algorithm could be applied to online ranking. This paper is 1. Some part of the paper is not clear. For example, abstract is too long and contains too many descriptions of the previous paper. 2. Since application(online ranking) is included, real world experiment result should be provided. Actually as sqrt(log T) is often much smaller than T^(2/3), the increase seems to be subtle. Maybe more justification should be added in this part?
