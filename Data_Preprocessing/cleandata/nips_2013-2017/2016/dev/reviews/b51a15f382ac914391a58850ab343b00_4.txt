The paper first describes the existing model of combinatorial partial monitoring games in which the learner selects actions from an exponentially large set and the adversary samples moves from a bounded, continous space. Two algorithms are proposed to solve this problem taking inspiration from forced exploration techniques commonly used in the bandit literature. The first algorithm, called Phased Exploration with Greedy Exploitation (PEGE), does not require knowledge of the time horizon. The authors give both distribution dependent and independent upper bounds for PEGE. The second algorithm (PEGE2) tries to estimate the gap between the best and second best action to achieve better distribution dependent bound. The authors show that PEGE2 matches the upper bound of GCB, the state-of-the-art algorithm for CPM, removing the dependence on the size of the learner's action space. Finally, they motivate some application of the algorithmic framework to the problem of online ranking with feedback on the top. The paper is very well written an easy to follow. The model of combinatorial partial monitoring games is clearly described. The main technical contributions of the paper are the PEGE and PEGE2 algorithms together with an analysis of their regret upper bounds. The authors consistently compare them to GCB as it is the only existing algorithm solving the exact same problem. The advantages of the proposed algorithms with respect to GCB are well motivated, as well as their drawbacks. However, I was disappointed no experiments was done to show the practical behaviour of PEGE/PEGE2 compared to that of GCB. The advantages of computing a single argmax are well motivated, but an experiment showing the regret behaviour of PEGE/PEGE2 with respect to GCB could have been insightful. At the end of the paper, the authors describe a potential application of their algorithms to a real-world problem, namely, the problem of online ranking with feedback at the top. The description of this application is welcome. The authors clame this limited feedback setting has pertinence in user privacy concern scenarii. This is not very clear to me. AFTER REBUTTAL I have read the rebuttal and kept my scores.
