The paper proposes a novel algorithm for solving random systems of quadratic equations, an important problem in signal processing (which belongs to the class of phase retrieval problems). As in previous proposed algorithms (e.g. the truncated Wirtinger flow algorithm), the algorithm is comprised of two stages: an initialization procedure, followed by iterative refinement of the solution. In contrast to the (truncated) spectral initialization procedures used in previous works, the authors propose a novel orthogonality-promoting initialization procedure, avoiding the known short-coming of spectral methods relying on heavy-tailed distributed quantities. An empirical study clearly shows the advantage of this new initialization procedure over previous ones. Given the initial approximation, the paper then proposes an iterative truncated-generalized-gradient algorithm for minimizing a non-convex and non-smooth amplitude-based cost function (instead of an intensity-based one) to further refine the solution. Assuming Gaussian design, they provide a rigorous analysis of its convergence to the correct solution in exponential rate, given a sufficiently accurate initial approximation. As far as I understand, the proof relies on a novel observation, showing that a smart truncation of generalized gradient components avoids directing the algorithm to spurious direction during the search. Empirical study shows that the proposed algorithm is superior to the state-of-the-art algorithms and significantly reduce the number of equations needed for solving the problem, thus considerably narrowing the gap toward the information theoretic number of equations provably required. The paper is well written and easy to follow. Although I haven't been familiar with the problem before, the background and connection to previous results put me right on track for understanding the motivation behind the proposed algorithm. The analysis and state-of-the-art empirical results are quite convincing and as an outsider to phase retrieval problems (and counting on the authors integrity) I believe that the results given in the paper will play a significant role in future work in the field. Some minor issues: - In line 133, should it be "for sufficiently small step size"? - In line 152, is z missing the subscript t? - In equation 9, can you please define h explicitly, as it is quite confusing.
