The paper proposes an end to end network for correspondence matching. They introduce a modified version of the contrastive loss for their network and implement it in a fully convolutional manner which reduces the number of forward passes needed for training and testing the network. They also implement a hard negative mining algorithm for a faster training of the network. Authors also implement Convolutional Spatial Transformers which are layers that learn to do patch normalization for each activations in the ConvNet independently. The paper has multiple contributions: -uses Fully Convolutional Networks for correspondence matching which reduces the computation complexity -introduces a modified version of contrastive loss for their application -introduces a hard negative mining approach which reduces training time -introduces a convolutional spatial transformer layer instead of patch normalization out of these 4 contribution I really like that they solve the problem using FCNs, rather than other approaches using patches The discussion on related work is fair and results are compared to various popular methods I consider the experiments sufficient for validating that the approach really works
