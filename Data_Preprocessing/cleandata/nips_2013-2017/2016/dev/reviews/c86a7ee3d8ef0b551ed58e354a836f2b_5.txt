This paper proposes SGD/SVRG using the Barzilai-Borwein (BB) method to tune step size automatically. The paper shows the linear convergence not only of SVRG-BB but also of SVRG with option-I whose proof has been missing in the literature. In experiments, SVRG-BB starting from several step sizes achieves competitive performance compared to best tuned SVRG. The paper is well written and I can understand the motivation to use the BB method. The analyses are correct. Although the contribution is rather incremental, the paper is useful to community because it complements the proof of SVRG-I and provides highly practical methods. It would be nice if the author can give the theoretical guarantee to use BB method for vanilla SGD and other stochastic methods.
