The paper presents a method for long-term trajectory planning using macro-goals. The macro-goals affect micro-actions through a novel attention mechanism. The method outperforms non-hierarchical approaches on modeling basketball players' behavior. The main message of the paper, the idea of using macro-goals to affect the choice of micro-actions, is rather attractive. However, I found it difficult to follow the theory behind the proposed method. Here are my notes concerning Section 3 "Long-Term Trajectory Planning". 1. Line 84. Typo: t should be in half-open interval [p,q), because otherwise formulas (1) and (3) don't make sense, since the action at would be included in history h{t-n,t}. 2. Lines [109,113). It is unclear what m is. Is it a function or a random variable? It is used apparently in both senses. If it is a function, then for a constant goal it will return a sequence of constant states and actions. If m is a random variable, its values at different time steps will be uncorrelated. In both cases, the purpose and use of m remains unclear. 3. Formula (3). Typo? Should the first integrand be P(a | g, s, h) and not P(a | s, h)? Compare to Formula (1). 4. Formula (4). As seen from Formula (2), mg is a probability density function. What kind of object is mg(a) then? Since Formula (4) says that it is a Hadamard product of mg with a, and assuming a is a vector, I guess mg is also a vector. Is it a conflict of notation? Some clarification is needed here. I also feel that notation \pi(s | g) is somewhat misleading, because \pi(s) = p(a | s), so s is fixed, just like g. I think \pi(s, g) would be perhaps more suitable. Although the level of technical details was insufficient to fully appreciate the inner workings of the proposed approach, I think the ideas presented in the paper deserve attention and provide a novel view on how to combine macro-goals along with micro-actions using memory networks. One could argue that experiments lack objective measure of performance, relying only on subjective visual impressions of experts, but on the other hand, it is indeed hard to say which basketball trajectories are good and which are bad.
