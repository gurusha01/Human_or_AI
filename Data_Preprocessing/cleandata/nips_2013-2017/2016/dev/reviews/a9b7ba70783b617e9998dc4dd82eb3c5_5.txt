This paper proposed methods to construct and summarize confidence sets for the unknown true cluster tree and illustrate the proposed methods on a variety of synthetic examples and furthermore demonstrate their utility in the analysis of a Graft-versus-Host Disease (GvHD) data set. My only question about this paper is that the author does not provide any compared method which make the experiment parts weaker.
