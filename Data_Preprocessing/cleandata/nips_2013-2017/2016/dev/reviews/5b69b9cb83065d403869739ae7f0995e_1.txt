This paper proposes a method to benefit from monolingual corpora to improve a NMT system. The framework relies on the idea of reinforcement learning to provide feedback to 2 NMT systems (one in each direction for a given language pair). The method is well described and yields impressive gains. The paper is overall well written. While there's nothing really new in terms of machine learning, this work merges different novelties to create an efficient framework that will create new perspectives in NLP. A general remark. Could feedback function also use the language model corresponding to the source sentence. I don't know how to that, but this could acts as an indicator of the sentence difficulty and therefore mitigate the feedback of wired source sentence. Could you also motivate why you discards sentence with at least one unknown word. This could be handled in your framework. Did you try something else ? L254. Avoid the repetition of in table 3. L255.
