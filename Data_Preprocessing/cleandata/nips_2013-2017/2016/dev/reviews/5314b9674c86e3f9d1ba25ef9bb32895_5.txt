This paper investigates tensor networks from quantum physics in order to provide a supervised learning algorithm. A major drawback of this work is that it is not motivated, in the sense of using the tensor networks for the definition of the feature map. It is clear that the use of tensor networks leads to several difficulties in the optimization process. We recommend the authors to study the possible use of the kernel trick, which could alleviate the computational complexity, as it has already been largely investigated in kernel machines, such as support vector machines. Within the proposed classification model as given in Section 3, it is difficult to understand the issue of the label, namely how the label index is arbitrarily placed at some position of the tensor, and how/why it can be moved to another tensor. This could be viewed as affecting the label to a single pixel of the image, and not to the whole image. This is due to the considered model (4)-(5) which seems to be not appropriate for multiclass classification. The authors used the quadratic loss in (6), motivated by having the best test results. They should also state the other used loss functions in the comparaison. It is worth noting that the quadratic loss provide relatively easy computations, as opposed to some other loss functions, due to its derivability. There are many issues regarding the experiments : -Several details are missing, such as the number of data used in the experiments, i.e., N, and the number of classes, i.e., L. -The 28x28 images are subsampled to 14x14, in order to reduce the training time. However, nothing is said about the computational complexity of the algorithm. This is a major issue to be addressed in the paper. -It is not clear how the training and test errors are estimated. -The proposed classification algorithm is not compared to any of the state-of-the-art classification methods. It should be compared in terms of the estimated errors, as well as the computational complexity.
