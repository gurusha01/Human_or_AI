Drift-diffusion model are a well-validated and neuroscience-supported approach for modeling the result of two-alternative forced choice experiments in psychophysics and neuroscience. Decision making under uncertainty is modeled commonly as a process of competitive evidence accumulation (a drift-diffusion process) that reaches a decision when a threshold is hit. WHat is the optimal threshold to set for a given problem? By recasting the problem one of miniminsing the stopping time and decision error the authors obtain an optimal threshold. This is then comptued using two different algorithms that treat the optmisation as a reinforcement learning problem. This is a nice piece of work, but i would like to see it applied to human or animal data (which is available online) and not just synthetic exmaple. How optimal are humans if at all? Can you provide us a sense of this, passing this threshold, would enable me to up-rate this paper's impact.
