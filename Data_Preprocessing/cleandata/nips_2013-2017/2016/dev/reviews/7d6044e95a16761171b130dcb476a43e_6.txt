This paper combines neural networks with graphical models. Variational inference and neural network learning are combined into a single optimization objective. Let me start by acknowledging that I am not an expert on this topic, and I did not understand the details of this work. That being said, I found the contribution to be slightly incremental, or at least vague. I also feel like the carity of the presentation is lacking. The paper assumes that the reader is an expert on variational methods, and lots of arcane terminology is used.
