The authors propose a new convolutional neural network (CNN) based model called the diffusion convolutional network (DCNN) for classifying graph-structured data at the level of nodes, edges, and entire graphs. The fundamental operation in a DCNN is a mapping from nodes and their features to the results of a diffusion process starting at those nodes. Unlike standard CNNs, DCNN parameters are tied according to search depth rather than their position in a grid. The authors establish theoretically that the DCNN activations of two isomorphic input graphs are the same, ie, the DCNN representation is invariant with respect to node index. The authors compare the DCNN model with other models on node and graph classification tasks, and report state of the art performance on the former and comparable performance on the latter. The authors propose a novel model called diffusion convolutional network (DCNN) for classifying graph-structured data at the level of nodes, edges, and entire graphs. The model is impressive in that it achieves state of the art performance on node classification tasks. But it doesn't do as well on graph classification tasks. The authors do not present any results of applying the DCNN model on edge classification tasks. The authors have done a good job explaining their model, but they could have been clearer with the notation and figures 1 (a-c) by using a small graph as a running example.
