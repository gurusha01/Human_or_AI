The paper proposed a new neural network model for classification tasks over generic graphs, as an extension of CNN. The model explicitly takes into account graph diffusion via a multi-hop architecture, and is able to leverage both node attributes and the graph structure during training. Although the model outperforms several simple baselines on average, it seems to suffer from relatively poor scalability. The idea of incorporating graph diffusion into neural networks seem both interesting and novel. The authors also did a good job in motivating the problem. However, overall I feel several aspects of the work could be further improved: Scalability: 1. The authors proposed three separate models for node, graph and edge classification. However, no empirical performance of edge classification was reported. I was wondering if this is due to scalability issues as for edge classification the parameter size can be extremely large even for medium-scale graphs (according to eq (6)). 2. It would be helpful to include the run time of the current experiments. About the experiment settings: 1. Experiment comparisons seem unfair. While DCNN uses both node features and graph structures, at least 4 out of the 5 baselines (l1-logistic, l2-logistic, KED, KLED) are solely relying on graph structures as their input, making it inconclusive whether the performance gain of DCNN is due to a good model design or simply because of the additional side information. To make the comparison more meaningful, at least the performance of the purely structural DCNN (101-104) should be reported. 2. Section 5 mentioned about several recent neural architectures for graph-based learning based similar idea of extending CNN to irregular graph domains. However, none of those models were included as baselines for empirical comparison. Without strong baselines, it is hard to judge whether the proposed DCNN is actually achieving the state-of-the-art performance (or close). Relationship to CNN: Unlike existing works that explicitly generalizes convolution operator over 2d-grid [1,2], it is not clear whether DCNN proposed in this work can be viewed as an extension of CNN(as claimed by the authors), since it is not obvious how DCNN will subsume CNN as a special case.
