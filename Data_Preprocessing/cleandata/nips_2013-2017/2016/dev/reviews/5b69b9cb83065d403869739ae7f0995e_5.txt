This paper proposes a reinforcement learning based method for machine translation by leveraging monolingual data and two-player communication. There are two innovations in the paper, firstly, the proposed model jointly train two dual translation models in one framework. Secondly, the translation models take unpaired data as inputs and learn the translation model through reinforcement. The proposed framework is novel and the idea is explained in details. The paper is well-written and I really enjoy reading the paper. Though, there is a question regarding the algorithm. Can you explain why there are $\frac{1}{K}$ in both line 12 and line 13 in Algorithm 1?
