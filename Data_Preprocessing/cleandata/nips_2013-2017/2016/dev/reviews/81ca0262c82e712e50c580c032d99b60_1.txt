This paper discusses the problem of causal subset selection using directed information. The problem becomes one of maximizing a submodular (or approximately submodular) function of choosing which features to use for prediction. The most interesting aspect is a novel definition of approximate submodularity and the obtained results on approximation that it yields. There are really two issues with this paper. The first one is the discussion on how to use directed information for causality. Unfortunately, the word causality means two different things and these should be separated (and this discussion should be mentioned in this manuscript I think). The first concept of causality is really prediction of a time series using other time series. This prediction respects time and hence people call that causal. Given a bunch of time series we can ask which one can be used to better predict another (in the next time-step) and use this as a measure of causality. Then we can talk about finding the k-best predictors and get into 'causal' feature selection etc, as the paper does. The connection of this Granger-type of causality with directed information is interesting and was recently explored, e.g. in [20] as cited in this paper. This paper builds on this type of causality that perhaps should be called generalized Granger causality, or prediction causality or something like that. The second type of causality (that is in my opinion, and in the opinion of most people working in this area the correct one, as far as I understand) relates to counter-factuals (or the related structural equations). In this world, the key issue is what WOULD happen if I changed X, would Y change? This relates to understanding the functions or mechanisms that generate the data, rather than predicting. It is important to state in this paper that the best time-series prediction tells us nothing about how modifying one time-series will actually change the other. In short, I think this paper has quite interesting results but on prediction of processes and not really about causality. More specifically, the most interesting results are on submodularity and perhaps the authors should modify the manuscript to emphasize on the approximation of near-submodular functions (with Granger causality as an application). For the non-Granger causality literature, the authors should be perhaps mentioning the work by e.g. Pearl, Imbens and Rubin and Richardson. Theorem 2 is interesting and the proof seems correct. Lemma 1 is the key in showing how submodularity is relaxed in this paper (even though its called lemma 2 in the appendix ) and the proof is clear. Theorem 3 and its corollaries are the most interesting results in the paper I think, and they are really about a new relaxation of submodularity that is independent of causality (or any information metrics really) so that should be made clear in the paper. The second issue I'd like to raise is the following: Das and Kempe in [3] define another relaxation of submodularity called the submodularity ratio. It is incorrectly stated in this paper that [3] defined the concept of submodularity ratio for R^2 score only. In fact, the submodularity ratio is actually defined in [3],Def 2.3 for an arbitrary set function and then specialized for the special case of R^2. Furthermore, the performance guarantee that generalizes the 1-1/e result (Theorem 3.2 in [3]) actually holds for any set function with bounded submodularity ratio. This is stated in [3] before theorem 3.2 but admittedly the paper does not emphasize this general result enough in the abstract/intro. Now my main question is if (some of) the obtained results in this paper are also direct corollaries of Theorem 3.2 of [3]: This is because (if I understand correctly) the Submodularity index defined in equation (6) of this paper is the difference of adding elements one at a time vs adding them all at once. The submodularity ratio of [3] on the other hand seems to be exactly the ratio of the same quantities. Submodularity means the difference is greater than zero (lemma 1 of this paper ) which is equivalent to ratio >=1 (as stated in [3]). Submodularty ratio: sum fx(A) / fS ( A) >=1 SMI defined in this paper sum fx(A) - fS ( A) >=0 Also the relaxation of [3] is Submodularity ratio >= constant gamma and in this paper SMI difference negative but close to zero. Since the obtained results seem to be normalizing SMI/ f(S_greedy) it is possible there is a direct mapping from the results of [3] to this paper for general set functions. This is a non-trivial analysis for the authors to perform, so I would simply recommend that the authors discuss a possible connection to the ratio of [3]. The analysis is even more complicated since [3] only yields results for monotone functions while this paper obtains results for both monotone and non-monotone, so it would seem that the authors could be generalizing [3] beyond monotonicity which is very interesting. Minor Comments: [3] the author order should be reversed. Proofs of Proposition 2 and 3 where not clear (or i did not find them). The paper has many typos/ grammatical errors and there are some missing ?? in the Appendix. Examples of typos: Consider two random process X^n (processes) directed information maximization-> maximization problems (page 3) address in details-> in detail. any polynomial algorithm-> polynomial-time algorithm Throughout the paper: 'Monotonic' submodular functions are called Monotone we mainly analysis-> analyze we can justify its submodularity, (confusing sentence, please rephrase) that in literature-> in the literature (page 4) several effort-> efforts Overall I recommend that this paper is accepted after these issues have been addressed since the combinatorial optimization results are quite interesting.
