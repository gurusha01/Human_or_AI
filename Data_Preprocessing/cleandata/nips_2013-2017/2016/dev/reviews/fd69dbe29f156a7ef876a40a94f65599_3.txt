This paper describes a neural model derived from [21] for visual question answering. The main idea is to iteratively update the question representation by selecting relevant image regions. Each input image is encoded by a VGG model and features are extracted from each candidate region (20 candidate regions per image). The image representation is transformed into a latent space shared with the question features. Each word in question sequence is embedded to a word vector with an embedding matrix, and the embedded vector is fed into GRU at each time step. The final hidden state is considered as the representation of the question and is also transformed into the common latent space. The question is updated through each reasoning layer with multilayer perceptron and weighted pooling (attention mechanism is used). The final answer is generated through a softmax layer. Evaluation results on COCO-QA show that their model outperforms other state-of-the-art models. Results on VQA dataset are also comparable with state-of-the-art. The paper is generally clear and well-written. It could be improved by including basic descriptions of the baseline models and other state-of-the-art approaches. The attention mechanism is employed in weight pooling. It may contribute to the performance improvement, which seems reasonable. Comparing different question representation pooling mechanisms in this paper could be a significant contribution since the original paper [21] did not show any results for this part (neither did they indicate what specific mechanism they employed). It would be great to provide explanations on using one single layer in MLP. Also the third example question in Figure 3 could be clarified. It seems the question representation stays the same after updating with one reasoning layer. It would be great if the author could provide thorough analysis to the results. Although the model is derived from [21], it appears to be the first study that modify the model to address the VQA problem. The authors have done a nice job of applying an effective text question answering model to VQA task. This paper, as well as [21] (the paper of the original QA model), seems to be interesting and opens a new area of research for QA/VQA.
