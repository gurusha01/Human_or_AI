This paper proposes an approach to perform group-sparse inferences for the (sparse) feature selection methods using the conditional probability density \|P\mathcal{L}Y\|2, i.e. to provide p-values and confidence intervals for the selected features/coefficients. Three sparse regression methods are then studied and algorithms for performing the inferences on all three methods are given respectively, followed by experiments on simulated and real data. 1. The proposed approach performs inferences with respect to groups of columns of X. Is there any advantage/motivation to perform inferences in groups instead of doing it one by one column? 2. In practice, how do you decide which columns should be grouped together? 3. Are the groups mutually exclusive? 4. Line 61-63: Can you provide details on how to "control for the remaining selected groups"? 5. Line 109-110: What do you mean by saying "condition on the direction dir\mathcal{L}(Y)"? 6. Line 113-114: What do you mean by saying "independence between the length and the direction of P\mathcal{L}Y"? When P_\mathcal{L}\mu\neq0, why do the two become dependent? 7. Line 255: The matrix X is 500 by 500, right? Do the columns in each group share some similar structure? If the entries of X are i.i.d. generated, how do you decide which columns should be grouped together? 8. Line 279-280: For the real data, how do you choose the group and the group size? Why do you expand one column to a group of three instead of combining different columns? This doesn't produce anything new. 9. How do you evaluate the performance? Is there a baseline or some other inference method that you can compare the proposed approach against? Can you compare the proposed approach with the method from reference 6? 10. For the real data, since each group contains only information from one column of the original data, how come that the p-values differ so much using the same method? Take the "Forward stepwise" for example, when group size is 3, the p-value of "Obese" is 0, which is quite different from 0.519 when group size is 1. Which one is more accurate?
