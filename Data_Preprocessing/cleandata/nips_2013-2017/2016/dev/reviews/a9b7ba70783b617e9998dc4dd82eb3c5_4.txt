The paper does the following: 1. investigates a variety of metrics on cluster trees and shows the equivalence of l-infinity and merge distortion norms and show why a modified merge distortion metric won't work with their analysis and they decide to go with the l-infinity norm for their analysis. 2. constructs asymptotic confidence sets for cluster trees using a KDE estimate and bootstrapping. 3. gives a pruning procedure to simplify trees in the confidence set and introduces a partial ordering of the trees. A well-written and insightful paper. The construction of confidence intervals for cluster trees seems important and in the process of doing so the authors appear to have developed a good amount of new theory.
