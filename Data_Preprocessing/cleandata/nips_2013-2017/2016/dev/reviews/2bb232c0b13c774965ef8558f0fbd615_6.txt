This paper proposes a joint segmentation and transcription for handwritten paragraph recognition. The paper builds on past work on using multidimensional LSTM-RNNs for this purpose. Such a model employs the connectionist temporal classification (CTC) to train the network. This paper builds on reference [6] by employing a weighted 'collapsing' step where a weighted sum of the feature vector sequence is formed before the final step. This weighted collapse induces an attentional mechanism into the recognition step and improves the performance. The final step uses a bidirectional LSTM decoder instead of a softmax. In doing so, the decoder outputs entire text lines instead of individual characters. This provides a speed-up of 20X to 30X probably in terms of the number of iterations. The proposed method has improved recognition accuracy than past approaches. The contributions of this paper is in suggesting a weighted collapse layer (provides attentional mechanism) and the use of a BLSTM decoder (to output sentences) for handwriting recognition. These are reasonable next steps that augment earlier work but seem to lack an element of surprise. The improvement in accuracy is made very clear in the results and these are quite good. However, the other claim, which is regarding the speed-up, is not quantified well. A major issue with this manuscript are the large number of typos. Hopefully, the authors can correct these if the manuscript is accepted for publication.
