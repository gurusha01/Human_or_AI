This paper proposes a neural network model for node, edge and graph classification problems that is based on integrating information of the local vicinity of each node in the graph. They obtain good results on node classification but not on graph classification. This paper presents what seems to be a reasonable model for node classification that uses local information to improve performance. However, as someone who is not an expert in this field is was hard for me to assess the quality for several reasons: 1. The authors get good results on node classification but not on graph classification. However, even for the node classification results, it seemed most of the baselines are not exposed to the same information as the method so it is hard to tell whether difference in performance is due to that and not to the model. 2. The authors mention in related work that there are other works on using neural network models for graphs, but they do not compare to those anywhere, why? 3. The authors define models for edge classification but there are no empirical results. why? To conclude, the authors present a reasonable model for using neural networks for graphs, but as someone who is not an expert it was hard to understand the extent of the contribution compared to existing literature.
