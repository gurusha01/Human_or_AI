The authors propose a novel algorithm, called Truncated Generalised Grdient Flow, to solve a system of quadratic equations, which is a NP-hard problem. The authors show how their method outperforms existing ones in terms of quality of the result, reaching an exact solution with high probability even when the ratio between number of equations and number of unknown approaches the minimum theoretical limit (which is not the case of the other existing methods mentioned in the manuscript). Also, the solution proposed here keeps a level of complexity that is linear with the time required to read the data The paper is very well written and structured. The problem is clearly stated and the proposed method represents an improvement above the other ones mentioned in the paper, which is clearly proved by the extensive comparison between the methods carried out throughout the entire paper. You give a good introduction, however I would advise to complete it by briefly mention existing methods performance and that of your technique (also lines 89-93 could be moved in the introduction, as well as lines 106-107). Finally, it would be a good addition to the paper if you could include a real-data example of a typical problem where solving such a system of equations is fundamental. This would clearly create a gap between your method and existing ones.
