This paper presents an approach to learn hierarchical policy models from demonstration, and demonstrates the proposed approach on generating player behavior in basketball. The authors use deep neural networks combined with an attention mechanism for combining across high level objectives/goals and micro-actions. The aim of this work is very interesting. However, in its current form, it is hard to understand and assess the proposed technical contribution, especially for readers such as myself who are familiar/researchers in RL but do not have deep knowledge of deep learning. In particular, I found the main section on the proposed method, section 4, very hard to parse as a non-expert in deep learning. Some parts were not defined (for example, what is L in Equation 5? Loss? How is loss defined here?). The work also didn't seem to be sufficiently situated in the literature, or compared to alternate approaches. For example, both George Konidaris and Sanjoy Krishnan seem to have relevant work on learning skills or macro-actions or policies from demonstration, but these were not compared to nor sited. I highly encourage the authors to revise and submit again. I highly encourage the authors to revise and submit again. Related work of Sanjoy Krishnan or George Konidaris G.D. Konidaris, S.R.
