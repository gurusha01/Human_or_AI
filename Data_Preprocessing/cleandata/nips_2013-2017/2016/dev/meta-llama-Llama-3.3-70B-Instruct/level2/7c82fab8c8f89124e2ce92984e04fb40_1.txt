This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of selective inference in the setting of group sparsity. The authors develop tools for constructing confidence intervals and p-values for testing selected groups of variables in group-sparse linear regression models. The main technical result, the "truncated projection lemma," provides the precise distribution of the magnitude of the projection of the data onto a given subspace, conditioned on a particular selection event. This result enables the development of inference procedures for a broad class of model selection methods, including the group lasso, iterative hard thresholding, and forward stepwise regression.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem of selective inference in group-sparse regression. The technical results are presented in a rigorous and detailed manner, with careful attention to notation and mathematical derivations. The authors also provide numerical results to illustrate the performance of their methods on simulated and real data, demonstrating the practical usefulness of their approach.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The development of a novel and powerful technical result, the truncated projection lemma, which provides a foundation for selective inference in group-sparse regression.
* The application of this result to a range of commonly used group-sparse regression methods, demonstrating the flexibility and versatility of the approach.
* The provision of numerical results to illustrate the performance of the methods, including simulations and an analysis of real data.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes a relatively high level of technical expertise in statistical theory and methodology, which may limit its accessibility to some readers.
* Some of the notation and mathematical derivations may be challenging to follow, even for readers with a strong background in statistics.
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the limitations and potential extensions of the approach, including potential applications to other areas of statistics and machine learning.
Overall, this paper presents a significant contribution to the field of selective inference in group-sparse regression, and is likely to be of interest to researchers and practitioners working in this area. The technical results are rigorous and well-presented, and the numerical illustrations demonstrate the practical usefulness of the approach.
