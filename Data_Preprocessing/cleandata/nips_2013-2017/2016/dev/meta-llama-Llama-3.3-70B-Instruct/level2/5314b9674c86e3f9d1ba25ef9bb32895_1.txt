This paper proposes a novel approach to supervised learning using tensor networks, specifically matrix product states (MPS), to parameterize non-linear kernel learning models. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on the MNIST handwritten digit dataset, achieving a test error rate of less than 1%. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the tensor network framework and its application to machine learning.
The main claim of the paper is that tensor networks can be used to efficiently optimize the weight vector in a supervised learning model, and that this approach can lead to state-of-the-art performance on certain tasks. The authors support this claim with experimental results on the MNIST dataset, which demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach.
The paper is practically useful, as it provides a new tool for machine learning practitioners to tackle high-dimensional datasets. The use of tensor networks can provide a more efficient and scalable approach to learning than traditional methods, especially when dealing with large datasets.
The paper reflects common knowledge in the field, and the authors demonstrate a good understanding of the relevant literature. The use of tensor networks is well-motivated, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the benefits and limitations of their approach.
The novelty of the paper lies in the application of tensor networks to supervised learning tasks. While tensor networks have been used in other areas of machine learning, such as feature learning and neural network compression, their use in supervised learning is a new and interesting direction.
The paper is complete, and the authors provide sufficient details for reproducibility. The experimental results are well-presented, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the hyperparameters and optimization algorithms used.
One limitation of the paper is that the authors do not provide a thorough comparison with other state-of-the-art methods on the MNIST dataset. While the authors achieve a test error rate of less than 1%, it is not clear how this compares to other methods, such as convolutional neural networks or support vector machines.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and compelling argument for the use of tensor networks in supervised learning. The experimental results are promising, and the paper provides a new and interesting direction for future research.
