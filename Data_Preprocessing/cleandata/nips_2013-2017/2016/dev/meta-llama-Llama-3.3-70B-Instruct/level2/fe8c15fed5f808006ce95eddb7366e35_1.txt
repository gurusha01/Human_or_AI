This paper proposes a novel hierarchical policy network (HPN) for modeling spatiotemporal trajectories over long time horizons using expert demonstrations. The HPN simultaneously models macro-goals and micro-actions and integrates them using a novel attention mechanism. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach in a case study on modeling basketball player behavior, showing significant improvement over non-hierarchical baselines.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise overview of their approach. The use of a hierarchical policy network to model both long-term and short-term goals is a key contribution of the paper. The attention mechanism used to integrate the macro- and micro-policies is also a notable innovation.
The experimental results are impressive, with the HPN outperforming non-hierarchical baselines in a human preference study. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the macro- and micro-policy integration, which helps to understand how the HPN works.
However, there are some limitations to the paper. The authors only consider a limited aspect of basketball gameplay, and the model is not able to capture the full complexity of the game. Additionally, the use of weak labels to initialize the macro-policy training may not be feasible in all scenarios.
The paper is well-organized, and the authors provide a clear and concise overview of their approach. The writing is clear, and the figures and tables are well-labeled and easy to understand.
In terms of novelty, the paper presents a significant improvement over existing approaches to modeling spatiotemporal trajectories. The use of a hierarchical policy network and attention mechanism is a new and innovative approach that has the potential to be applied to a wide range of problems.
The significance of the paper is also high, as it has the potential to impact a wide range of fields, including robotics, computer vision, and sports analytics. The ability to model complex behaviors over long time horizons has many potential applications, and the authors' approach is a significant step forward in this area.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication. The authors have made a significant contribution to the field, and the paper is well-written and easy to understand. The experimental results are impressive, and the analysis of the macro- and micro-policy integration is helpful in understanding how the HPN works.
