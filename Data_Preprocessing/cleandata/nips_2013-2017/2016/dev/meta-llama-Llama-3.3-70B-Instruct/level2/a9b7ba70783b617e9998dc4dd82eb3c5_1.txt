This paper addresses the problem of statistical inference for cluster trees, which are used to represent the hierarchy of high-density clusters in a density function. The authors propose methods to construct and summarize confidence sets for the unknown true cluster tree, and introduce a partial ordering on cluster trees to prune statistically insignificant features. The paper makes several contributions, including the study of various metrics on trees, the construction of confidence sets, and the application of these methods to synthetic and real datasets.
The paper is well-written and clearly organized, with a good balance between theoretical and practical contributions. The authors provide a thorough review of related work and clearly explain the motivations and significance of their research. The technical sections are well-structured and easy to follow, with clear definitions and notation.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The introduction of a partial ordering on cluster trees, which allows for the pruning of statistically insignificant features and the construction of simpler trees that are consistent with the data.
* The construction of confidence sets for the unknown true cluster tree, which provides a way to quantify uncertainty and make inferences about the cluster structure.
* The application of these methods to synthetic and real datasets, which demonstrates the practical usefulness of the proposed approach.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The limitation to a specific type of metric (d∞) for constructing confidence sets, which may not be suitable for all types of data or applications.
* The lack of a clear algorithm for finding all trees in the confidence set that are minimal with respect to the partial order, which is an important open question.
* The use of the Silverman reference rule for choosing the bandwidth, which may not be optimal for tree inference.
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of cluster analysis and statistical inference, and provides a useful framework for constructing and interpreting cluster trees. The authors demonstrate the practical usefulness of their approach through a range of examples, and provide a clear and well-organized presentation of their results.
