This paper proposes a novel approach to offline handwriting recognition by modifying the popular Multi-Dimensional Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks (MDLSTM-RNNs) to enable end-to-end processing of handwritten paragraphs. The main claim of the paper is that the proposed model can transcribe complete paragraphs without explicit line segmentation, achieving competitive results with state-of-the-art systems that use ground-truth line segmentation.
The paper is well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results on two public databases, Rimes and IAM. The proposed model uses an attention mechanism to iteratively focus on single text lines, allowing for implicit line segmentation. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the baseline system by a large margin and yields better performance than methods based on explicit and automatic line segmentation.
The paper is well-written, and the ideas are clearly presented. The authors provide a thorough review of related work and demonstrate a good understanding of the field. The proposed model is novel and significant, as it presents a new approach to handwriting recognition that can handle paragraphs without explicit line segmentation.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposed model is novel and significant, presenting a new approach to handwriting recognition.
* The experimental results are thorough and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.
* The paper is well-written, and the ideas are clearly presented.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The model is limited to paragraphs and may not be easily extendable to full documents.
* The attention mechanism may not be able to handle arbitrary reading orders.
* The model requires a document layout analysis to detect paragraphs before applying the model.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the proposed model is novel and significant. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model, and the paper provides a thorough review of related work. I would recommend accepting this paper, as it presents a new approach to handwriting recognition that can handle paragraphs without explicit line segmentation.
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The proposed model is novel and significant, presenting a new approach to handwriting recognition.
* The experimental results are thorough and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.
* The paper is well-written, and the ideas are clearly presented.
Arguments con acceptance:
* The model is limited to paragraphs and may not be easily extendable to full documents.
* The attention mechanism may not be able to handle arbitrary reading orders.
* The model requires a document layout analysis to detect paragraphs before applying the model.
However, the strengths of the paper outweigh the weaknesses, and I believe that the paper should be accepted. The authors have demonstrated a good understanding of the field and have proposed a novel and significant model that can handle paragraphs without explicit line segmentation. With some revisions to address the limitations of the model, this paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of handwriting recognition.
