This paper proposes Multimodal Residual Networks (MRN) for visual question-answering tasks, extending the idea of deep residual learning to multimodal inputs. The main claim of the paper is that MRN effectively learns joint representations from vision and language information using element-wise multiplication for joint residual mappings. The authors also introduce a novel method to visualize the attention effect of joint representations using back-propagation.
The paper is well-written and clearly organized, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments. The related work section provides a good overview of the existing literature on deep residual learning and attentional models. The proposed MRN model is thoroughly evaluated on the Visual QA dataset, achieving state-of-the-art results on both Open-Ended and Multiple-Choice tasks.
The strengths of the paper include its novelty, clarity, and thorough evaluation. The authors provide a detailed analysis of the results, including a qualitative analysis of the attention effects. The paper also explores various alternative models and hyperparameters, demonstrating the robustness of the proposed approach.
However, there are some limitations to the paper. The authors could have provided more insights into the interpretability of the element-wise multiplication as an information masking mechanism. Additionally, the paper could have benefited from a more detailed comparison with other state-of-the-art methods, including a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of each approach.
Overall, I would argue in favor of accepting this paper. The paper presents a significant improvement over existing approaches, and the proposed MRN model has the potential to advance the state of the art in visual question-answering tasks. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a thorough evaluation of their approach.
