This paper presents a novel approach to learning decision thresholds in the drift-diffusion model of perceptual decision making. The authors propose two distinct methods to optimize the decision thresholds: a REINFORCE method derived from Williams' REINFORCE algorithm for training neural networks, and a Bayesian optimization method that fits a Gaussian process to the reward function. Both methods are shown to converge to near-optimal decision thresholds, as validated against an exhaustive optimization of the reward function.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the background and motivation of the research. The methods section is detailed and easy to follow, and the results are presented in a clear and organized manner. The discussion section provides a good summary of the main findings and implications of the research.
The strengths of the paper include the novelty of the approach, the thoroughness of the methodology, and the clarity of the presentation. The authors also provide a good discussion of the limitations of the research and potential avenues for future work.
One potential weakness of the paper is that the Bayesian optimization method is shown to be more variable in the threshold estimates and slower in computation time compared to the REINFORCE method. However, the authors acknowledge this limitation and suggest potential improvements to the Bayesian optimization method.
The paper is relevant to the field of neural information processing systems, and the research has potential implications for our understanding of decision making and learning in the brain. The authors provide a good review of the relevant literature and demonstrate a clear understanding of the field.
