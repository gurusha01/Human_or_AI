This paper presents a novel algorithmic framework, Phased Exploration with Greedy Exploitation (PEGE), for combinatorial partial monitoring (CPM) games. The authors adopt the CPM model proposed in [1] and develop two algorithms, PEGE and PEGE2, which achieve improved regret bounds compared to the existing Global Confidence Bound (GCB) algorithm.
The main claims of the paper are: (1) PEGE achieves O(T 2/3 âˆš log T ) distribution-independent and O(log2 T ) distribution-dependent regret bounds, (2) PEGE2 combines gap estimation with PEGE to achieve an O(log T ) regret bound, matching the GCB guarantee, and (3) the regret bounds of PEGE and PEGE2 do not depend on the size of the learner's action space, making them suitable for countably infinite or continuous action spaces.
The paper provides a clear and detailed explanation of the algorithms, assumptions, and theoretical analysis. The authors also provide a comparison with the GCB algorithm, highlighting the advantages of their approach. The application of the algorithms to online ranking with feedback at the top is also well-explained and demonstrates the practical relevance of the work.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The development of a novel algorithmic framework that improves upon existing results
* The provision of detailed theoretical analysis and regret bounds
* The comparison with existing work and highlighting of advantages
* The application of the algorithms to a practical problem
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The assumption of a unique optimal action, which may not always hold in practice
* The requirement of knowledge of the time horizon T for PEGE2, which may not be available in all scenarios
* The potential for high computational complexity due to the need for offline oracles
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of online learning and partial monitoring games. The algorithms and analysis provided are sound, and the application to online ranking demonstrates the practical relevance of the work. However, the assumptions and limitations of the approach should be carefully considered in future work.
