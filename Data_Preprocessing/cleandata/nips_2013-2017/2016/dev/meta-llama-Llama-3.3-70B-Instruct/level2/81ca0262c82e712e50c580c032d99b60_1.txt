This paper presents a novel approach to causal subset selection using Directed Information as a measure of prediction causality. The authors formulate two typical tasks, causal sensor placement and covariate selection, into cardinality constrained directed information maximizations. They show that the first problem is submodular while not necessarily monotonic, and the second one is "nearly" submodular. To address the issue of approximate submodularity, they introduce a novel quantity, namely submodularity index (SmI), for general set functions.
The paper's main contributions are: (1) formulating causal subset selection objectives with directed information and conducting submodularity analysis, and (2) introducing SmI and providing theoretical results on performance guarantees of greedy algorithms for possibly non-monotonic and non-submodular functions. The authors evaluate their theoretical results with several case studies and illustrate the application of subset selection to causal structure learning.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem and their approach. The technical sections are thorough and well-organized, with clear explanations of the key concepts and results. The experimental results are convincing and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
The strengths of the paper include:
* A clear and well-motivated problem formulation
* A novel and interesting approach to addressing the problem
* Thorough and well-organized technical sections
* Convincing experimental results
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes a significant amount of background knowledge in information theory and submodularity, which may make it difficult for non-experts to follow
* Some of the technical sections are quite dense and may require multiple readings to fully understand
* The paper could benefit from more discussion of the implications of the results and the potential applications of the proposed approach
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication. The paper presents a novel and interesting approach to causal subset selection, and the authors provide a thorough and well-organized presentation of their results. While there are some weaknesses to the paper, they do not outweigh the strengths, and the paper makes a significant contribution to the field.
