This paper proposes a novel algorithm, Truncated Generalized Gradient Flow (TGGF), to solve systems of quadratic equations. The main claim of the paper is that TGGF can recover the solution exactly with high probability and linear complexity when the number of equations is on the order of the number of unknowns. The paper also claims that TGGF outperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms, such as Wirtinger Flow (WF) and Truncated Wirtinger Flow (TWF), in terms of sample complexity and computational efficiency.
The support for these claims comes from a combination of theoretical analysis and numerical experiments. The paper provides a detailed theoretical analysis of the TGGF algorithm, including a proof of its convergence and a bound on its sample complexity. The numerical experiments demonstrate the superior performance of TGGF over WF and TWF on a range of synthetic and real-world problems.
The paper is well-written and clearly organized, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments and understand the technical details of the algorithm. The use of mathematical notation and terminology is standard and consistent throughout the paper.
In terms of usefulness, the TGGF algorithm has the potential to be widely applicable in a range of fields, including signal processing, machine learning, and optimization. The algorithm's ability to solve systems of quadratic equations efficiently and accurately makes it a valuable tool for many applications.
The paper demonstrates a good understanding of the relevant literature and field knowledge, citing key papers and results in the area of phase retrieval and nonconvex optimization. The authors also provide a clear and concise overview of the background and motivation for the problem, making it easy for readers to understand the context and significance of the work.
The novelty of the paper lies in the development of the TGGF algorithm, which combines a novel orthogonality-promoting initialization with a simple yet effective truncation rule and scalable gradient-like iterations. The paper also provides a detailed analysis of the algorithm's convergence and sample complexity, which is a significant contribution to the field.
The completeness of the paper is good, with all necessary details and proofs provided in the main text or supplementary materials. The authors also provide a clear and concise summary of the main results and contributions of the paper.
The limitations of the paper are acknowledged by the authors, who note that the algorithm's performance may degrade in the presence of noise or other forms of corruption. However, the authors also provide some preliminary results on the robustness of the algorithm to noise, which suggests that it may be possible to extend the algorithm to handle more general cases.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication. The paper makes a significant contribution to the field of nonconvex optimization and phase retrieval, and the results are well-supported by theoretical analysis and numerical experiments. The paper is well-written and clearly organized, making it easy to follow and understand.
