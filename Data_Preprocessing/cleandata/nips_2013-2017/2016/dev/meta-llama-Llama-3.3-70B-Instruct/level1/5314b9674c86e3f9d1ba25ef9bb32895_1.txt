This paper proposes a novel approach to supervised learning using tensor networks, specifically matrix product states (MPS), to parameterize non-linear kernel learning models. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on the MNIST handwritten digit dataset, achieving a test error rate of less than 1%. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the tensor network framework and its application to supervised learning.
The paper builds upon previous work in tensor methods for machine learning, including tensor decompositions and tensor networks. The authors provide a thorough review of the relevant literature and clearly explain how their approach differs from previous contributions. The use of tensor networks to regularize and optimize the weight tensor is a key innovation of the paper, and the authors provide a detailed explanation of the sweeping optimization algorithm used to train the model.
The paper has several strengths, including:
* The authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the tensor network framework and its application to supervised learning.
* The paper includes a thorough review of the relevant literature and clearly explains how the approach differs from previous contributions.
* The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on a real-world dataset, achieving state-of-the-art results.
* The paper provides a detailed explanation of the sweeping optimization algorithm used to train the model.
However, the paper also has some weaknesses, including:
* The paper assumes a significant amount of background knowledge in tensor methods and machine learning, which may make it difficult for non-experts to follow.
* The authors do not provide a clear comparison to other state-of-the-art methods for supervised learning, which makes it difficult to evaluate the relative performance of their approach.
* The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the sweeping optimization algorithm, which may be important for large-scale applications.
Overall, the paper is well-written and provides a clear explanation of the tensor network framework and its application to supervised learning. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on a real-world dataset, and the paper provides a detailed explanation of the sweeping optimization algorithm used to train the model. However, the paper could benefit from a clearer comparison to other state-of-the-art methods and a more detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the algorithm.
