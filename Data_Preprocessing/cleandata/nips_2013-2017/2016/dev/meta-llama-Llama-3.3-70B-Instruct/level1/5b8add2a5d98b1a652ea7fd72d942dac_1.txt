This paper proposes a novel algorithm, termed Truncated Generalized Gradient Flow (TGGF), to solve systems of quadratic equations. The problem is known to be NP-hard in general, but the authors prove that TGGF can recover the solution exactly with high probability when the number of equations is on the order of the number of unknowns. The algorithm consists of two stages: an orthogonality-promoting initialization and a refinement of the initial estimate by successive updates of truncated generalized gradient iterations.
The paper relates to previous work on phase retrieval, nonconvex optimization, and quadratic programming. The authors cite relevant papers, including [1-7], and discuss the limitations of existing approaches, such as the alternating projection method, trust-region methods, and convex relaxation techniques. The paper also compares TGGF with state-of-the-art algorithms, including Wirtinger Flow (WF) and Truncated Wirtinger Flow (TWF).
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposed algorithm, TGGF, has a linear-time complexity, making it efficient for large-scale problems.
* The orthogonality-promoting initialization is a novel approach that outperforms spectral initialization methods.
* The truncation rule used in TGGF is simple and effective, allowing the algorithm to avoid spurious stationary points.
* The paper provides a thorough analysis of the algorithm's performance, including theoretical guarantees and numerical simulations.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes that the system of quadratic equations has a unique solution, which may not always be the case in practice.
* The algorithm's performance may degrade when the number of equations is not sufficient, or when the system is noisy.
* The paper could benefit from more detailed comparisons with other state-of-the-art algorithms, including those that use different optimization techniques or regularization methods.
