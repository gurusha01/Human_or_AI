This paper proposes a novel neural network-based reasoning model for visual question answering (VQA) tasks. The model iteratively updates the question representation by selecting image regions relevant to the query and learns to give the correct answer. The authors claim that their model achieves state-of-the-art performance on two challenging VQA datasets, COCO-QA and VQA.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear overview of the VQA task, related work, and their proposed model. The model architecture is well-explained, and the use of attention mechanisms and multilayer perceptrons is justified. The experimental results are impressive, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of their model's performance on different question types.
The strengths of this paper include:
* The proposed model is novel and well-motivated, addressing the limitations of existing VQA models.
* The use of attention mechanisms and multilayer perceptrons allows the model to focus on relevant image regions and update the question representation effectively.
* The experimental results are strong, and the authors provide a detailed analysis of their model's performance.
The weaknesses of this paper include:
* The model's performance on counting tasks is weaker than other models, which is a limitation that the authors acknowledge.
* The use of object proposals may not always be effective, and the model may struggle with questions that require a more nuanced understanding of the image content.
* The authors could provide more insight into the interpretability of their model's attention mechanisms and how they relate to human visual attention.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel and well-motivated model that addresses the limitations of existing VQA models.
* The experimental results are strong, and the authors provide a detailed analysis of their model's performance.
* The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear overview of the VQA task, related work, and their proposed model.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The model's performance on counting tasks is weaker than other models, which may be a significant limitation.
* The use of object proposals may not always be effective, and the model may struggle with questions that require a more nuanced understanding of the image content.
* The authors could provide more insight into the interpretability of their model's attention mechanisms and how they relate to human visual attention.
Overall, I believe that this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of VQA and deserves to be accepted. The proposed model is novel and well-motivated, and the experimental results are strong. While there are some limitations to the model, the authors acknowledge these and provide a clear direction for future work.
