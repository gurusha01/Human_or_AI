This paper proposes a hierarchical policy class for modeling spatiotemporal trajectories over long time horizons using expert demonstrations. The approach combines a macro-policy and a micro-policy through an attention mechanism, allowing the model to reason about both long-term and short-term goals. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach in a case study on learning to imitate demonstrated basketball trajectories, showing that it generates significantly more realistic trajectories compared to non-hierarchical baselines.
The paper relates to previous work on reinforcement learning, hierarchical models, and attention mechanisms. The authors provide a clear overview of the related work and position their approach within the existing literature. The technical contributions of the paper are well-explained, and the experimental evaluation is thorough and well-designed.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel hierarchical policy class that can capture long-term dependencies in spatiotemporal trajectories
* The use of an attention mechanism to integrate the macro-policy and micro-policy, allowing for flexible and dynamic planning
* The demonstration of the approach in a realistic case study on basketball trajectory modeling, with impressive results in terms of trajectory realism and quality
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The reliance on weak labels for the macro-policy training, which may not always be available or accurate
* The limitation of the approach to a single-level hierarchy, which may not be sufficient for more complex planning tasks
* The lack of exploration of the approach in more general planning settings, such as those requiring online learning or adversarial reinforcement learning
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel and well-motivated approach to modeling spatiotemporal trajectories
* The experimental evaluation is thorough and demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach in a realistic case study
* The paper provides a clear and well-written overview of the related work and technical contributions
Arguments con acceptance:
* The approach relies on weak labels for the macro-policy training, which may limit its applicability in certain settings
* The paper does not explore the approach in more general planning settings, which may limit its impact and relevance to the broader research community
* The technical contributions of the paper, while significant, may not be entirely novel or surprising to experts in the field.
Overall, I believe that the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of reinforcement learning and spatiotemporal modeling, and I recommend acceptance. However, I also suggest that the authors consider addressing the limitations and weaknesses of the approach in future work, such as exploring more general planning settings and developing methods for online learning or adversarial reinforcement learning.
