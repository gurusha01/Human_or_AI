This paper proposes a novel approach to monocular depth estimation by training a neural network to predict probability distributions over local coefficients of the scene depth map in an overcomplete representation. The network outputs distributions for various spatial derivatives at each location, allowing it to express confidence and ambiguity about different aspects of the scene geometry. A globalization procedure is then used to combine these local predictions and produce a consistent depth map.
The paper relates to previous work on monocular depth estimation, which has largely focused on direct regression to depth values or predicting surface normals. In contrast, this approach predicts a more diverse set of structural relationships and uses a distributional output space to characterize ambiguity in the predictions. The authors demonstrate the efficacy of their approach on the NYU v2 depth dataset, achieving state-of-the-art performance.
The strengths of this paper include its novel approach to monocular depth estimation, its ability to characterize ambiguity in the predictions, and its state-of-the-art performance on a benchmark dataset. The use of an overcomplete representation and a globalization procedure allows the network to effectively summarize the depth cues present in a single image.
However, there are some weaknesses to the paper. The network architecture is complex and has a high-dimensional output space, which may make it difficult to train and optimize. The globalization procedure is also iterative and may require careful tuning of hyperparameters. Additionally, the paper could benefit from more analysis of the network's predictions and the globalization procedure, such as visualizations of the predicted distributions and the intermediate results of the globalization procedure.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel and interesting approach to monocular depth estimation
