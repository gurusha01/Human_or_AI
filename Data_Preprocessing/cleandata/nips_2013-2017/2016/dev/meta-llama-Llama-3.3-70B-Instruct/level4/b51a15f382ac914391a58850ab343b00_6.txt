This paper introduces a novel algorithm for partial monitoring games, deviating from the traditional UCB approach employed in preceding CPM models. Instead, it leverages the "forcing with certainty equivalence" technique, yielding the PEGE algorithm, which relies on a simpler oracle. Notably, PEGE can be integrated with gap estimation to replicate the regret bound achieved in previous studies. Furthermore, the authors demonstrate the algorithm's applicability to online ranking. However, several aspects of the paper require clarification. Firstly, the abstract is overly lengthy and contains excessive references to prior work, obscuring the core contributions. Secondly, given the inclusion of an application to online ranking, the omission of real-world experimental results is noticeable. Additionally, the improvement, quantified as the difference between sqrt(log T) and T^(2/3), may seem marginal, suggesting that further justification is necessary to contextualize the significance of this advancement.
