This paper explores the stochastic combinatorial setting with a linear feedback mechanism, building upon the original problem introduced by Lin et al. in [1] and improving upon some of the existing results. Specifically, it proposes two algorithms, PEGE and PEGE2, designed for globally observable problems, which address certain limitations of the GCB algorithm from [1]. These limitations include the requirement for uniqueness of the optimum, access to oracles for solving potentially complex optimization tasks, and sample complexity dependent on the size of the action space. 
The PEGE algorithms offer several advantages over GCB, including not requiring an oracle to return the second-best solution to an optimization problem, not necessitating the uniqueness of the optimal solution, and having regret that does not depend on the size of the action set. However, they also have disadvantages, such as the need to set a parameter h to satisfy distribution-dependent conditions, which is not straightforward without knowledge of the problem parameters. Additionally, the distribution-dependent bound has a worse dependence on the time horizon T and an exponential dependence on h. Furthermore, guaranteeing the distribution-dependent bounds requires a different parameter setting than for the distribution-independent bounds.
To address the issue with parameter h, the paper introduces another algorithm, PEGE2. Although PEGE2 does not depend on the size of the action set for its regret, it does not provide a satisfactory solution to the parameter issue and has other shortcomings. For instance, the distribution-dependent bound is not guaranteed in all cases, as seen in Equation (7), leaving uncertainty about what kind of distribution-dependent bound can be generally guaranteed.
A significant drawback of the proposed algorithms is that none can avoid solving linear optimization problems at every step. In light of this, the contributions of the paper should be viewed as interesting additions to the understanding of the combinatorial partial monitoring problem, but it is unclear whether they bring us closer to an effective solution. The distribution-dependent bounds obtained seem particularly weak, although the fact that the regret bounds no longer depend on the size of the action set is a strong point. Highlighting the main idea behind this achievement in the main part of the paper would be beneficial.
Additional suggestions for improvement include providing a formal, algorithm-like presentation of the protocol, clarifying that sigma in line 4 of Algorithm 1 refers to the globally observable set, and addressing the confusing remark in lines 176-180, including correcting the typo in line 177. Furthermore, the introduction of delta, which is always set to 1/T, could be explained, and the comparison of the obtained results to existing methods when adapting combinatorial partial monitoring games to online ranking should be discussed. Finally, minor errors such as the typo in line 304 and the incomplete citation in line 317 should be corrected.
