The hierarchical structure of a probability density function's high-density regions is effectively captured by its cluster tree. This paper explores statistical inference for the cluster tree associated with an unknown density $p0$, given an iid sample. A bootstrap-based approach is proposed to construct a confidence set for the cluster tree of a related density, with the set's shape determined by a suitable metric. Although the confidence set is defined implicitly, the authors suggest methods to extract informative representatives that preserve statistically significant features of the cluster tree. The paper's originality and interest are notable. However, it raises questions about its connection to nonparametric inference for density functions. The task of constructing a confidence set for the cluster tree of $p0$ appears distinct from building a confidence set for $p0$ itself, justifying a direct approach. For instance, focusing on $ph$ instead of $p0$ is justified when comparing $T{ph}$ to $T{p0}$, but not necessarily when comparing $ph$ to $p_0$. Several points are worth noting: 
1. The implicit nature of the confidence set means that the primary tangible contribution of this work lies in its method for pruning the tree while maintaining statistical guarantees, which could be emphasized further. 
2. When testing the hypothesis $H0: T{ph} = T0$, it is theoretically possible to use any statistic, including $d{\infty}$, to form a confidence set by inverting tests. The choice of $d{\infty}$ seems somewhat arbitrary, and while discussions of its optimality may be beyond the paper's scope, additional justifications for its use would be beneficial.
