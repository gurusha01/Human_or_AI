The authors tackle the image classification problem using tensor networks and optimization algorithms, providing a brief theoretical evaluation and results on the MNIST dataset. However, I have several concerns with the paper. A more comprehensive literature review would be beneficial, as classification is a primary application of Generalized Linear Models (GLMs), and tensor methods have been employed to optimize mixtures of GLMs, as seen in [1]. The paper lacks depth, as it proposes a new algorithm without convincing arguments for its significance. Typically, classification and regression algorithms are compared in terms of expressive power and convergence rates, with many methods having established minmax optimal rates. I expect a discussion on the statistical properties of the regressor, such as its computational runtime or complexity compared to other approaches. Alternatively, strong empirical performance could motivate the algorithm, but the provided results on the MNIST dataset are limited to a short section. This leaves the impression that the paper presents yet another heuristic for a well-understood machine learning problem, raising questions about its relevance. Some specific comments include: 
- L19: The term "exponentially large" is unclear, as it is unspecified what the exponential growth is relative to.
- L95: The phrase "The cost function for which we found our best test results" is confusing, as performance is defined by the cost function, making it unclear what "best test results" refers to.
- Eq 6: The definition of $\delta^{\ell}{Ln}$ is not provided; is it equal to 1 if $L_n = \ell$?
- L168: The statement "the possible set of functions is quite general" is vague; what specific aspects of the function set are being referred to?
- L176: The term "basis" implies completeness, so it seems that "orthonormal system" is the intended meaning.
- The literature references should be alphabetized.
