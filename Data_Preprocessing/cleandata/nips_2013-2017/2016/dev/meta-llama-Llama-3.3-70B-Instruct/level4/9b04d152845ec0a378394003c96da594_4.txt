This manuscript presents a method utilizing element-wise multiplication for joint residual mapping in the context of Visual Question Answering (VQA). However, the overall quality of the submission falls short of the standards required for publication due to several key concerns: the reported performance does not achieve state-of-the-art results, and the core concept lacks novelty. Similar architectural frameworks have been previously investigated, notably in the work by Fukui et al. (2016), which explored Multimodal Compact Bilinear Pooling for applications in VQA and visual grounding, as detailed in their publication available at http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01847.
