This work presents a novel deep architecture, referred to as MatNets, designed for generative image modeling. The model's performance is evaluated in comparison to existing state-of-the-art approaches, with a focus on likelihood metrics. By integrating concepts from various successful generative image models, the proposed architecture results in a complex framework. While the achieved performance is commendable, it offers only a marginal improvement over the current state-of-the-art methodologies.
