This manuscript tackles the challenge of paragraph-level handwriting recognition using an end-to-end approach. Traditional methods involve a two-stage process comprising line segmentation and subsequent line recognition. In contrast, this work integrates these two stages into a single attention-based model. The experimental findings demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses conventional two-step approaches, even when the latter utilize ground-truth line segmentation information. Furthermore, the results indicate that the proposed approach achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art line-level methods on the Rimes and IAM datasets, without relying on sophisticated pre-processing techniques employed in previous studies. For decades, handwriting recognition has relied on the two-step paradigm, with research focusing on enhancing individual components. The development of end-to-end systems that eliminate the need for line segmentation has been a long-standing goal, but a challenging one. Recent advancements in deep learning have paved the way for the creation of such systems, and this work contributes to this context by proposing a unified approach using an attention-based model. The attention mechanism enables implicit line segmentation within the model, and the formulation is both natural and intuitive. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of this approach. Given current trends in related fields, the application of attention-based models to end-to-end paragraph-level handwriting recognition is a logical and anticipated development. To the best of my knowledge, this study is the first to successfully implement this approach. The paper is well-structured and clear. However, it would benefit from additional explanation regarding the superiority of the attention-based model over the line-based model with ground-truth line segmentation. Additionally, reporting computational time would provide valuable insights.
