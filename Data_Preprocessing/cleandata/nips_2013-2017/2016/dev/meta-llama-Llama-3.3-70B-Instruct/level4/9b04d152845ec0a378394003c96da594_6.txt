This manuscript presents a novel approach, Multimodal Residual Networks (MRN), designed for multimodal residual learning in the context of visual question-answering. The proposed framework leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for visual feature extraction and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for processing language information, ultimately enabling the MRN model to learn a joint representation that combines visual and linguistic cues effectively. The authors report state-of-the-art performance on the Visual QA dataset for both open-ended and multiple-choice tasks, and introduce an innovative method for visualizing the attention effects of these joint representations. The MRN demonstrates efficacy in tackling visual question-answering tasks, particularly on the Visual QA dataset. However, the contributions, while noteworthy, are somewhat straightforward. Given the prevalence of deep neural networks (DNNs) in learning joint representations, a more nuanced analysis of the framework's components and their respective contributions would significantly enhance the paper's impact. Specifically, an investigation into whether the CNN, RNN, or MRN component is most instrumental in the model's success, supported by empirical evidence or detailed discussion, would elevate this work to a more impressive level.
