This paper introduces a novel approach to long-term trajectory planning by incorporating macro-goals, which influence micro-actions through an innovative attention mechanism. The proposed method demonstrates superior performance compared to non-hierarchical approaches in modeling the behavior of basketball players. The central idea of utilizing macro-goals to inform the selection of micro-actions is compelling. However, the theoretical underpinnings of the method are somewhat obscure, making it challenging to follow. 
Regarding Section 3, "Long-Term Trajectory Planning," several clarifications are necessary:
1. On Line 84, a typo is present, as "t" should be defined within the half-open interval [p, q) to maintain the logical consistency of formulas (1) and (3), given that action "at" would otherwise be included in the history "h{t-n, t}".
2. The lines between 109 and 113 lack clarity concerning the definition of "m." It is ambiguous whether "m" represents a function or a random variable, as it appears to be used in both contexts. If "m" is a function, it would yield a sequence of constant states and actions for a constant goal. Conversely, if "m" is a random variable, its values at different time steps would be uncorrelated. In either case, the purpose and application of "m" remain unclear.
3. Formula (3) may contain a typo, as the first integrand should be "P(a | g, s, h)" rather than "P(a | s, h)," consistent with Formula (1).
4. Formula (4) implies that "mg" is a probability density function. However, the nature of "mg(a)" is uncertain, given that it is described as the Hadamard product of "m_g" and "a," with "a" assumed to be a vector. This raises concerns about potential notation conflicts, necessitating further clarification. Additionally, the notation "\pi(s | g)" may be misleading, as "\pi(s) = p(a | s)," suggesting that "s" is fixed, similar to "g." The notation "\pi(s, g)" might be more appropriate.
Although the technical details provided are insufficient to fully comprehend the inner workings of the proposed approach, the ideas presented in the paper warrant attention and offer a novel perspective on combining macro-goals with micro-actions using memory networks. While one could argue that the experiments lack an objective measure of performance, relying solely on subjective visual impressions of experts, it is indeed challenging to define which basketball trajectories are optimal and which are suboptimal.
