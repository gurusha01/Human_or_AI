This manuscript proposes a deep learning-based method for establishing correspondences between image pairs, leveraging a fully convolutional network (FCN) in conjunction with a newly introduced correspondence contrastive loss function and an active hard-negative mining strategy. The authors validate the efficacy of their approach through experiments conducted on multiple publicly available datasets, presenting a clear and well-structured explanation of their methodology accompanied by compelling results. However, further elaboration on the semantic implications and aspects of this methodology would provide additional insight and enhance the overall understanding of the approach.
