This manuscript presents a novel framework that integrates a deep convolutional neural network with a gated recurrent unit to tackle visual question answering tasks. The proposed architecture iteratively refines question representations to generate accurate responses. Notably, the authors employ object proposal techniques to focus on specific image regions that are highly relevant to the questions, rather than analyzing the entire image. The paper is well-structured and clear in its exposition. The incorporation of region proposal, inspired by object detection methods, appears to be a sensible approach to enhancing visual question answering performance. However, several questions arise: 1. Although the paper asserts that the proposed model iteratively updates question representations, the updates seem to occur only once, as evident from Figures 1 and 3. Is the number of iterations equivalent to the number of reasoning layers? Would implementing a recurrent network in the reasoning layer to recursively update question representations lead to improved accuracy? 2. As shown in Table 3, the proposed method outperforms several existing approaches but falls slightly short of FDA [11] and DMN+ [30]. Can the authors provide insight into this outcome on the VQA dataset, offering explanations for the relative performance of their method compared to these state-of-the-art approaches?
