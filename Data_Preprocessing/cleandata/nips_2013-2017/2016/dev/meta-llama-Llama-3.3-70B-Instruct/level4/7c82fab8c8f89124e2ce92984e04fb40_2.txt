The authors present a framework for assessing the significance and corresponding confidence interval of a chosen set of variables within the context of group-sparse regression. Unfortunately, I encountered significant difficulties in comprehending the paper due to its complexity and dense presentation, which hindered my ability to fully grasp the contribution. Specifically, the incremental value over the work of Loftus and Taylor (2015) remains unclear to me. As I understand it, the paper aims to provide a method for testing the relevance of variable groups selected by group-sparse linear algorithms, either iteratively or collectively, with a focus on three such algorithms. While the benefits of calculating these significance results are apparent, I regret that I am unable to provide a thorough review of this paper and apologize for any inconvenience, hoping that my fellow reviewers will have a more confident assessment. Nonetheless, I will attempt to focus on the applications. Regarding the California dataset example and Table 1, the construction of 3-variable groups is unclear to me. It appears that a single variable is expanded into three, rather than using actual groups of variables. I assume this approach may be intended for comparative purposes, but it also renders the results somewhat ambiguous. Ideally, I would have preferred to see a more algorithmic description of the procedure within the paper. As it stands, the implementation details of this method remain uncertain to me.
