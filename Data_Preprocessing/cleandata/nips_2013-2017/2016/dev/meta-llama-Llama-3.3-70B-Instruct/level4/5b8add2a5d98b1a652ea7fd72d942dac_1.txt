This paper presents a groundbreaking algorithm for tackling random systems of quadratic equations, a crucial challenge in signal processing that falls under the category of phase retrieval problems. Similar to previously proposed algorithms, such as the truncated Wirtinger flow algorithm, the approach outlined in this paper consists of two primary stages: an initialization procedure, followed by an iterative refinement of the solution. Notably, the authors introduce a novel orthogonality-promoting initialization procedure, which circumvents the well-known limitation of spectral methods that rely on heavy-tailed distributed quantities. Empirical studies unequivocally demonstrate the superiority of this new initialization procedure over its predecessors. 
Given an initial approximation, the paper proposes an iterative truncated-generalized-gradient algorithm aimed at minimizing a non-convex and non-smooth amplitude-based cost function, as opposed to an intensity-based one, to further refine the solution. Under the assumption of Gaussian design, the authors provide a rigorous analysis of the algorithm's convergence to the correct solution at an exponential rate, contingent upon a sufficiently accurate initial approximation. As I comprehend it, the proof hinges on a novel insight, which reveals that a judicious truncation of generalized gradient components prevents the algorithm from being directed towards spurious directions during the search process. 
Empirical studies illustrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms and substantially reduces the number of equations required to solve the problem, thereby significantly narrowing the gap towards the information-theoretic number of equations provably required. The paper is well-structured and easy to comprehend. Despite my initial unfamiliarity with the problem, the background information and connections to previous results provided in the paper facilitated my understanding of the motivation behind the proposed algorithm. The analysis and empirical results are convincing, and as an outsider to phase retrieval problems, I believe that the results presented in the paper will have a profound impact on future research in the field, assuming the integrity of the authors.
Some minor issues were noted: 
- In line 133, it seems that the phrase "for sufficiently small step size" might be more appropriate.
- In line 152, the variable z appears to be missing a subscript t.
- Equation 9 could be clarified by providing an explicit definition of h, as its current representation is somewhat confusing.
