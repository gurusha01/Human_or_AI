The authors propose an algorithm for solving random systems of quadratic equations using a truncated gradient update approach, which minimizes the least squares criterion based on the amplitude-based empirical loss. Notably, the truncation method differs from that of Chen and Candes (2015) in that it does not discard large-sized gradients. The authors provide a theoretical analysis of the noiseless case, supported by simulations. However, the definition of the generalized gradient (Definition 1) is not referenced in the main text, raising questions about its purpose and relevance. 
In the text, there are several areas that require clarification. For instance, in line 145, the use of "necessary" instead of "sufficient" may be a point of contention. Furthermore, Equation 9 could be presented in a clearer manner to facilitate easier understanding of the definition of \(h\), which is introduced without explicit definition prior to its appearance. The invocation of the strong law of large numbers in line 154 is also problematic due to the dependence among summands, given that both fixed points \(x\) and \(z^*\) are data-dependent. Additionally, the rationale behind \(h\) being a good direction warrants further explanation.
The theoretical framework relies on certain assumptions, such as the Gaussian data assumption, the impact of which on the statement in line 164 should be elucidated. Moreover, the authors' decision to focus exclusively on the noiseless case in Section 3, without addressing the noisy case, prompts questions about potential technical challenges and the algorithm's generalizability. A discussion on whether the main theorem can be extended to the noisy case would be beneficial for guiding future research endeavors.
It is also crucial to assess the algorithm's performance on datasets with non-Gaussian distributions, as its efficacy in such scenarios is not immediately clear. To comprehensively validate the algorithm's performance, testing on real datasets, such as those used in image recovery examples (e.g., the TWF paper), is recommended. This would provide practical insights into the algorithm's applicability and effectiveness in real-world scenarios.
