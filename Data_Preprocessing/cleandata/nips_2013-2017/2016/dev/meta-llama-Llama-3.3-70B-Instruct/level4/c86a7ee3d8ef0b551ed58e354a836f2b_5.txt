This manuscript presents an approach utilizing the Barzilai-Borwein (BB) method for automatic step size adjustment in SGD and SVRG algorithms. Notably, it demonstrates linear convergence for both SVRG-BB and SVRG with option-I, thereby addressing a previously unproven aspect in the literature. Experimental results indicate that SVRG-BB, initiated with various step sizes, exhibits performance comparable to optimally tuned SVRG. The paper's clarity and motivation for employing the BB method are commendable, with accurate analyses. Although the contribution is somewhat incremental, its value to the community lies in complementing the proof for SVRG-I and offering practical methodologies. A potential future direction could involve providing theoretical guarantees for the application of the BB method to vanilla SGD and other stochastic optimization techniques.
