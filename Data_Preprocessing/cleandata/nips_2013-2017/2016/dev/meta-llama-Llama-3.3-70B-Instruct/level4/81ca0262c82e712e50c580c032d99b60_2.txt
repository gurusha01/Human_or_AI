The authors investigate two interconnected problems, referred to as source detection (OPT1) and causal covariate selection (OPT2), which have been explored in prior research, albeit with different approaches. OPT1 is related to sensor selection, where previous studies typically employed mutual information, whereas this work utilizes directed information. Similarly, problems akin to OPT2 have been studied for decades, often with strong modeling assumptions, and the authors propose using directed information as a non-parametric method. 
The authors demonstrate that OPT1 is submodular but not monotone, which allows for performance guarantees using greedy search. In contrast, OPT2 is monotone but generally not submodular. To address this, the authors introduce a novel measure, the submodularity index (SmI), which quantifies how "submodular" a function is. They obtain performance bounds for maximization in OPT1 and OPT2 with cardinality constraints, where the bounds are a function of SmI. The authors also analyze both simulated and real-world data, showcasing the performance of the algorithm and computing empirical SmI values.
Overall, the work is promising and contains several results that will appeal to the NIPS community. However, significant revisions are needed for OPT2 to be suitable for presentation at NIPS. Notably, the authors are missing citations for work closely related to their research on OPT2. Several minor issues also require attention, which are detailed below.
The problems addressed are interesting and relevant to NIPS, particularly OPT2, which has been a concern in various domains for decades. The non-parametric approach using directed information is appealing, as it reduces the need for strong modeling assumptions. The introduction of SmI as a measure of submodularity is intriguing and context-dependent, making sense in the context of the authors' later work and data analysis. The performance bounds obtained are good, and the application to both simulated and real-world data provides credence to the use of greedy methods, especially when exact computation is prohibitively expensive.
However, the usefulness of the bounds for OPT2 is unknown, as they are only applicable when OPT2 exhibits "quasi-submodularity." The authors fail to provide a precise definition of "quasi-submodularity" or justify when it occurs. Statements throughout the paper suggest that OPT2 is "nearly" submodular in particular cases, but these claims are not substantiated. The definition of "quasi-submodularity" is provided as a function having a negative but close to zero SmI, but the authors never specify what constitutes "close." The paper lacks examples of when OPT2 is quasi-submodular, except in the extreme case of Proposition 2, where independence is conditioned on Y_t.
The authors are also missing a reference to a closely related work, "Bounded Degree Approximations of Stochastic Networks" by Quinn et al., which appears to be relevant to OPT2. This work proposes an approximate submodularity measure and obtains bounds on the deterministic greedy search, but it does not theoretically justify when the approximate submodularity is useful.
Minor comments include the need for examples when Proposition 2 holds, particularly if the authors cannot identify when OPT2 is quasi-submodular. The authors should clarify how they modified the CTW algorithm to handle directed information for sets, as the available code and original paper are for pairs of processes. Guidance on selecting k is also necessary, given the computation tradeoffs and the sensitivity of the approximation coefficient to k. Additionally, the authors should provide a sentence or two explaining how the random greedy algorithm relates to the deterministic one and clarify the notation in Lemma 2.
The reference section requires attention, with several formatting issues, such as missing capitalization and inconsistent use of acronyms. The notation in Lemma 2 should be clarified, and the grammar in line 205 should be corrected. The formula below line 201 should be explained, and the behavior of the formula for Î³ could be illustrated with a table or graph. The data used in Section 5 is old, and if it has appeared in another paper, the source should be cited. The authors should describe how they discretized the data, particularly since it was discretized to binary values. Finally, the statement in line 257 should be revised, as convergence is not sufficient to claim that the results are accurate, and the equation reference in line 261 should be included to provide clarity.
