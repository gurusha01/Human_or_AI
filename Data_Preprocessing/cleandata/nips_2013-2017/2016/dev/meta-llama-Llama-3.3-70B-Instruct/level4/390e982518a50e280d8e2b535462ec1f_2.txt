This manuscript presents a neural network-based approach for classifying nodes, edges, and graphs by aggregating local neighborhood information. While it achieves promising results in node classification, its performance on graph classification is less impressive. The proposed model appears to be a viable solution for node classification, leveraging local information to enhance accuracy. However, as a non-expert reviewer, I encountered difficulties in evaluating the manuscript's quality due to several concerns: 
1. The authors report favorable outcomes for node classification, but the comparison with baselines is compromised, as the latter do not have access to the same information, making it challenging to discern whether the performance difference is attributed to the model or the information disparity. 
2. The related work section acknowledges existing research on neural network models for graphs, yet fails to provide a comparison with these studies, raising questions about the motivation behind this omission. 
3. The manuscript defines a model for edge classification but omits empirical results, leaving the reader wondering about the rationale behind this exclusion. 
In conclusion, the authors propose a reasonable neural network model for graph classification, but its contribution relative to the existing literature is unclear to a non-expert reviewer. Additionally, a minor suggestion is to increase the size of Figure 1 for better readability.
