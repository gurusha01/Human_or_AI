This paper presents a novel, almost everywhere differentiable generalization of the subgradient solution for an over-determined system of quadratic equations with random coefficients, which is known for being inconsistent. The cost function is characterized as belonging to the class of nonconvex and nonsmooth functions. The authors successfully establish orthogonality by identifying a suitable initialization, followed by an update using the generalized gradient iteration. The paper's structure, content, and presentation are commendable. The algorithm is well-justified, and the results are satisfactory. However, the authors should verify the 4n-2 claim for the complex case, as mentioned on page 2. Additionally, reference [22] is incomplete, as it lacks the author(s)' name(s), which should be included for completeness.
