The authors' work focuses on two submodular optimization problems, primarily motivated by the concept of directed information maximization, which is often used as a measure of causality. Although directed information is not universally accepted as a correct measure of causality, especially in scenarios involving more than two variables, it remains a relevant and widely used concept in certain contexts. The authors proceed to explore a generic non-monotone submodular function and introduce a "submodularity index" (SmI), defined as a measure of the collective diminishing value of the derivative of the function. This index enables the derivation of potentially tighter bounds on the optimum value of submodular maximization problems. However, the relationship between these bounds and the outcomes of the randomized greedy algorithm is complex, and the benefits are not immediately apparent.
The problem statements presented are not well-justified, despite being theoretically intriguing. The sections on submodularity are interesting in their own right, independent of any causal interpretation. A significant concern is the authors' careless use of the notion of "causality." Directed information does not constitute a generally accepted notion of causality and is insufficient for predicting the effects of interventions on a system. It is suggested that the paper be repositioned as a submodular optimization paper with applications in directed information maximization, as the primary technical contribution lies in submodular optimization rather than causality literature. This repositioning would also help avoid debates about the validity of directed information as a metric for causality.
The introduction overlooks a substantial portion of the causality literature, including conditional independence-based, score-based learning methods, and approaches based on assumptions about structural equations. References to Pearl's or Glymour's books would be pertinent, and the authors should justify why directed information serves as an alternative in dynamic systems. The problem formulation is not well-justified, and some claims are incorrect. For instance, the statement regarding the optimal locations being obtainable by maximizing causality from a selected location set to its complement is misleading. The term "causality" should be replaced with "directed information," and the objective should be rephrased. The approach based on directed information would yield incorrect results if the goal is to identify the source nodes of a causal graph, particularly in scenarios involving colliders.
The second problem, maximizing directed information from one set of nodes to another, termed "causal covariate selection," suffers from similar issues. These problems are not merely the result of using a different notion of causality but are inherent to the approach. The example of advertisers choosing opinion leaders to maximize ad influence involves intervention, and using directed information does not guarantee the identification of causal sources. Therefore, claims about the outcomes of possible interventions using directed information as a metric should be made with caution.
Given the problem's motivation, where the set S contains variables that influence or summarize other variables, the underlying causal graph likely includes subgraphs that violate the conditions in Proposition 2. Hence, it is unlikely that variables in S will be independent given another variable Y. The definition of the submodularity index (SmI) in equation (7) is a novel metric for measuring the submodularness of a set function. However, the minimization problem to find SmI involves searching through two disjoint subsets, which complicates its computation. Proposition 3 claims that the minimized term is a supermodular function, but this claim lacks proof. The authors should explain why Algorithm 1 runs in time O(nk), noting that calculating Mi does not require a search due to the objective being a modular function of elements of Mi.
In the simulations, the "1/e reference bound" and "Upper bound by SI" should be clearly defined. The causal structure learning application lacks a definition of the causal graph in the main paper, which is crucial given the absence of a universally accepted notion of a causal graph. The framework is limited to learning directed information graphs, which, from a Pearlian perspective, is expected to be insufficient for learning causal graphs. The labeling of theorems and lemmas in the paper and the supplementary material does not match, which should be corrected for easier cross-referencing. Notation inconsistencies and confusion, such as the use of \bar{A \cup {y}}_t, should be addressed for clarity. Proofs, such as those for Theorem 2 and Propositions 1, 2, and 3, should be carefully reviewed and completed, with clear distinctions between equalities and definitions. Typos and missing references in the supplementary material should also be corrected.
