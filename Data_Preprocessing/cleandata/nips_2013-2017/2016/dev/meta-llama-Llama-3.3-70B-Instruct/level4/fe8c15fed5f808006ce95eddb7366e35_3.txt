This manuscript explores long-term trajectory planning through the utilization of hierarchical policy models, aiming to capture both macro and micro behavioral aspects. The proposed framework is implemented using a deep memory network equipped with an attention mechanism, facilitating the guidance of the micro-planner by the macro-planner. The results indicate that this approach yields more realistic trajectories for players. However, several clarifications are needed: in section 3.1, the notation gt is introduced without prior definition, and the goal space lacks a concrete definition, including its dimensionality and representation in practical scenarios. Furthermore, the derivation of equation (3) is unclear due to the identical conditional probabilities on both sides, P(at | st, h{t-n,t}). Additionally, the methodology for obtaining the weak labels \hat{g}t and \hat{m}t is not provided, requiring further explanation for completeness.
