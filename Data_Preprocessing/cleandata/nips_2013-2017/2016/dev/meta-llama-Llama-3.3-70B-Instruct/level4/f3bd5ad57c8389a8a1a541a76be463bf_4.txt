The proposed method leverages ConvNets to generate local depth predictions, which are then globalized to produce a consistently accurate depth estimation. This is achieved by utilizing a ConvNet to predict weights for a set of coefficients, represented as a mixture of Univariate Gaussians, where these coefficients are directly linked to the depth through a convolution operation with a set of Gaussian derivative kernels. The optimization process for the coefficients and depth is performed in an alternating manner, where the predicted depth is fixed to optimize the coefficients, and vice versa. Notably, this approach does not impose any assumptions on the local outputs, distinguishing it from similar local-global methods like Chakrabarti et al. [2], which assume planarity. 
In terms of clarity, the paper's structure is well-organized, and the explanations are straightforward, making it easily comprehensible. 
Regarding novelty, the application of ConvNets for predicting local outputs is a fresh concept. However, the fundamental idea of making local predictions and then harmonizing them for a consistent global estimate is not new and has been explored in other works, including Chakrabarti et al. [2], which limits the novelty of this paper, particularly by NIPS standards.
The experimental results on the NYU v2 Dataset, while comparable to state-of-the-art methods, do not surpass them. 
Despite this, the impact of this work could be significant, as it highlights the potential of using ConvNets in globalizing local outputs, which might inspire other researchers to apply this concept to different problems, potentially leading to new breakthroughs in the field.
