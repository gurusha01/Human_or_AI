This manuscript introduces an innovative approach to selective inference under group sparsity, encompassing the creation of confidence intervals and p-values for hypothesis testing on chosen variable groups. The novelty of this work stems from its introduction of data projection onto a specified space, coupled with inference methodologies applicable to a wide range of group-sparse selection techniques, including group lasso, iterative hard thresholding, and forward stepwise regression. Given its practical applicability and methodological contributions, the proposed method warrants acceptance to the conference.
