This manuscript proposes an extension of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to accommodate general graph-structured data through the introduction of a diffusion-convolution operation. Comprehensive experiments are performed on a range of node and graph classification tasks, yielding superior performance compared to probabilistic relational models and kernel methods. 
Notably, the training process is halted when the validation error for a specific epoch exceeds the average validation error of the preceding few epochs, as stated in lines 109-110. It would be beneficial to explore alternative stopping criteria, such as reducing the learning rate by half when the validation error of a given epoch surpasses that of the immediately preceding epoch. 
Additionally, there is a minor error in line 98, where the term "graph" is repeated unnecessarily.
