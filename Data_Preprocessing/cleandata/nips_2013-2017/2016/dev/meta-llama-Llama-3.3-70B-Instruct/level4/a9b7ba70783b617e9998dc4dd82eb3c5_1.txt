The authors propose an estimation of the cluster tree associated with the unknown density of a given sample, utilizing the cluster tree of a kernel density estimator. The estimation accuracy is evaluated using the sup-norm of the underlying density, which is equivalent to a natural metric on the class of clustering trees. A bootstrap procedure is employed to construct confidence sets, and a method is introduced to identify a tree within these sets that exhibits a simpler structure than the cluster tree of the kernel density estimator while preserving key topological features. The authors provide experimental results on both simulated and real data. 
1. While the paper is engaging and informative, the primary result is somewhat disappointing. Although the introduction suggests that estimating the cluster tree rather than the density itself circumvents the curse of dimensionality, the authors lack guarantees for the estimator's accuracy. In reality, they estimate $T{ph}$ for an arbitrarily small bandwidth $h$, rather than $T{p0}$. To accurately estimate $T{p0}$, the bandwidth $h$ must be smaller than a certain threshold $h_0$, whose value is unknown, as noted on line 192. Consequently, the curse of dimensionality remains unresolved.
2. Theorem 3, which is stated without proof, surprisingly lacks dependence on $B$, a fact that raises concerns.
3. In my opinion, all references to $d_{MM}$ should be removed, as they do not contribute to the paper's core arguments.
