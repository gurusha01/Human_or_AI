The authors explore valid inference for the effect size in linear regression related to groups of variables chosen after data examination. Although a selective test for the null hypothesis concerning the projection of the mean onto the linear space spanned by the group variables has been previously proposed, the existing test is inadequate for constructing a confidence interval. By determining the exact distribution of this test statistic in the noncentral case, where the null hypothesis is not assumed to be true, the authors derive a selective confidence interval for the size of the projection. Specifically, inference is provided for the magnitude of the projection of μ onto the vector that represents the projection of Y onto the linear space, which is a well-defined parameter once the direction is conditioned upon. This paper significantly extends the work of Loftus and Taylor ('15). The distinction between the null and non-null distributions of the test statistic is noteworthy, and the resulting technical challenges are substantial. Several points warrant discussion: 
1. Can any properties of the proposed confidence interval (CI) be established, particularly in the context of inference for the coefficient of a selected variable in Gaussian linear regression without groups? Theoretical justification for conditioning on nuisance statistics in general exponential families, as demonstrated by Fithian et al. ('15), may offer insights.
2. Conditionally on dirL(Y), the distribution of the test statistic is indeed influenced by < dirL(Y), μ > rather than < dirL(μ), μ > = || PL μ ||. While the proposed CI is guaranteed to cover || PL μ || with probability 1-alpha conditionally on dirL(Y) and may be conservative, it should also be valid unconditionally on dir_L(Y) for the parameter of interest. This unconditional validity might imply that the CI is less conservative than initially thought.
3. To enhance clarity, consider revising the following sentences: 
- Line 59: The phrase "distribution of subsets of parameters" could be rephrased for precision, as the current wording is unclear.
- Line 132: Instead of stating "Lemma 1 yields a truncated Gaussian distribution," a more detailed explanation or rewording might be necessary to accurately convey the intended meaning.
