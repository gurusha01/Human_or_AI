The authors introduce a novel algorithm, termed Truncated Generalised Gradient Flow, designed to solve systems of quadratic equations, a problem classified as NP-hard. Their methodology demonstrates superior performance compared to existing approaches, achieving exact solutions with high probability even as the equation-to-unknown ratio approaches the theoretical minimum limit, a feat not accomplished by other mentioned methods. Furthermore, the proposed solution maintains a complexity level that scales linearly with the time required for data reading. The manuscript is well-organized and clearly written, with a succinct problem statement and a methodology that offers a discernible improvement over other discussed methods, as substantiated by an extensive comparative analysis throughout the paper. The introduction is effective but could be enhanced by a brief overview of the performance of existing methods and the authors' technique, potentially incorporating sections currently found in lines 89-93 and 106-107. To further differentiate their method from existing ones, the inclusion of a real-data example illustrating a typical problem where solving such systems of equations is crucial would be a valuable addition, highlighting the practical implications and superiority of the proposed algorithm.
