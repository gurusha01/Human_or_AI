The paper proposes a hierarchical trajectory planning model, which is applied to predict basketball player trajectories. At its core, the model consists of two policy networks: a "micro-planner" that generates a distribution of actions, denoted as a{micro} ~ \pi(s; \theta{micro}), and a "macro-planner" that produces a distribution of "goals", represented as \pi(s; \theta_{macro}). A "goal" is defined as a sub-region of the court, coarser than the current state, that the player intends to move towards. The model also incorporates a "transfer function" that maps each goal to an attention mask, which is then element-wise multiplied with the action distribution. Both micro- and macro-planners are trained using cross-entropy loss, with the other components frozen, based on ground truth micro-action labels. The experiments involve a human visual analysis of the generated trajectories and a benchmarking of the model's prediction accuracy under various ablations. Overall, this is a well-structured paper with an intriguing idea of utilizing an attention mechanism for sub-goal specification, although it has several technical limitations that hinder its inclusion in NIPS in its current form. 
Limitations of the paper include:
- The title is misleading, as it references "memory" without employing memory networks; instead, the model's memory is derived from GRUs, suggesting a more accurate title such as "(Recurrent and) Hierarchical Trajectory Planning Using ConvNets".
- The multi-stage training approach, where each component is trained individually while freezing others, should be compared to end-to-end training with back-propagation through all components to assess its effectiveness.
- The choice of a discrete 17x17 action space over a continuous 2D space or polar coordinates is not justified and may unnecessarily complicate training; using a mean square error in a continuous space could yield more informative training samples.
- The experimental setup, where all other players are stationary, may introduce biases and undermine the validity of the conclusions drawn from the results.
- Table 2 lacks crucial baselines, such as "random" and "maintain current direction", and suggests that training the attention mechanism may not always be beneficial.
Unclear aspects of the paper include:
- The inconsistency between subsampling every 4 frames and subsampling at 4Hz, which should be clarified for precision.
- The need to specify that "frames" in section 5 refer to frames after subsampling to avoid confusion.
- The phrase "95% statistically significant" should be rephrased for clarity and accuracy.
