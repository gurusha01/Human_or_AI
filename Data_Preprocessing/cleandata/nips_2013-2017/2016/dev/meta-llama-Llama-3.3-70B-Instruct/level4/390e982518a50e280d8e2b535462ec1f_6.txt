The authors introduce a novel neural network architecture designed for graph prediction problems, framing it as a convolutional generalization beyond traditional grid structures. This approach is demonstrated to surpass several kernel methods, exhibiting superior performance in vertex classification but not in graph classification. Although the experimental results appear promising, several concerns arise regarding the presentation and experimental design. 
In terms of presentation, a critical concept such as diffusion lacks a formal definition or a reference to prior work, making it difficult to understand without additional research. It is assumed that a standard method for featurizing a node's neighbors is utilized, but clarification is necessary. Furthermore, the emphasis on generalizing convolutions seems misplaced, as this generalization appears to be specific to the graph setting and not applicable to edge or vertex prediction scenarios, where spatial invariance is not a factor. Given that the primary contribution is improved performance in vertex classification, overemphasizing this aspect may be misleading.
Regarding the experiments, the architecture's ability to handle vertex, edge, and graph prediction in a unified manner is claimed, yet edge experiments are notably absent. A comment on this omission and the potential for structure learning would be beneficial. In vertex prediction experiments, comparisons are made against baselines including kernel methods, logistic regression, and a Conditional Random Field (CRF). However, logistic regression is only provided with features derived from the vertex itself, not its neighbors, which may explain its poor performance. It is essential to conduct experiments where a shallow model is trained on comparable signals, such as diffusion-based features, to demonstrate the neural network's superiority in terms of accuracy or speed. Similarly, the CRF's features should be specified and compared against an equivalent featurization to ensure a fair comparison. The use of up to 5 hops of diffusion implies consideration of neighbors at a distance, which should also be applied to the CRF and logistic regression for a comprehensive evaluation.
Surprisingly, other neural network-based models, such as those presented in https://cs.stanford.edu/people/jure/pubs/node2vec-kdd16.pdf, are not compared against. Including such comparisons would strengthen the paper by providing a more comprehensive assessment of the proposed architecture's performance.
In conclusion, while the architecture is elegant and the paper well-written, the experimental results are not entirely convincing, which is a critical factor in evaluating an applied paper. Initially, the paper seemed borderline, but after further review and consideration of related literature, it becomes clear that the experiments are less extensive and the comparisons less thorough than those in similar works, such as node2vec. The claim that other techniques were developed in parallel and lacked open-source implementations is disputed, given the availability of implementations for methods like LINE and DeepWalk. The quality of this paper is deemed lower than that of comparable works, leading to a strong argument for rejection.
