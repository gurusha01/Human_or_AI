This manuscript describes a neural network-based system for estimating depth from monocular images, utilizing a two-stage cascaded approach. Initially, the system generates distributions of depth derivatives at various scales and orientations, which are then integrated within a globalization framework. While the paper is well-presented and yields strong results overall, it lacks sufficient innovative concepts. Unfortunately, the submission falls short of the standards expected of a NIPS paper. 
Several concerns arise: 
1. The proposed system bears a strong resemblance to existing works by Eigen et al. and Liu et al., making it unclear whether the observed improvements stem from the novel neural network architecture or the proposed algorithm itself. A more direct comparison between the proposed algorithm and Eigen et al.'s work, using the same neural network settings, would be beneficial to assess the true impact of the proposed methodology.
2. The experimental setup raises concerns regarding fairness. Given that Liu et al.'s approach is based on super-pixels, whereas this work employs a sliding window method, it would be informative to include an additional baseline that applies CRF on top of the proposed local neural networks. The authors should either provide a justification for not using this baseline or conduct new experiments to address this concern in their rebuttal.
3. The motivation behind the two-stage cascaded architecture is not well-explained, particularly in regards to how it resolves ambiguities in predictions, as mentioned in line 42. Further clarification on this aspect would strengthen the manuscript.
4. The submission lacks references to relevant works in semantic segmentation, which, although not directly focused on depth estimation, have employed similar architectures. The authors are encouraged to update their manuscript with these pertinent references to situate their work within the broader context of related research.
