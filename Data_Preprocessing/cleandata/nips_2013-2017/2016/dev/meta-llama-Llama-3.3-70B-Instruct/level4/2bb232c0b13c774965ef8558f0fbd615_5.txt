The authors propose an innovative approach to offline handwriting recognition by integrating an attention mechanism into a system designed to process unsegmented paragraphs of handwritten text. The methodology employs MD-LSTMs for feature extraction, attention computation, and decoding in certain configurations. Notably, the learned attention mechanism surpasses ground truth segmentation in the authors' system, yielding impressive character error rates on standard datasets. Although the word error rates do not surpass the state of the art, they remain competitive, particularly considering the system's disregard for ground truth segmentation and its reliance on a relatively simple language model.
The strengths of this work include:
- The concept of extending single-line handwriting recognition to multi-line text is both elegant and a logical next step, demonstrating a natural progression in the field.
- The fact that such a system is functional and performs well is a testament to the authors' efforts, given the complexity of the task.
- The technical explanation provided is clear and easy to follow, with the inclusion of a colorized attention figure being particularly effective in illustrating the concept.
However, there are areas that require improvement:
- The comparison with established benchmarks is somewhat misleading, as it involves disparate elements such as the use of more complex language models and ground truth segmentation in reference models. This disparity, acknowledged by the authors, raises more questions than it answers and feels underdeveloped.
- The significance of the learned attention mechanism outperforming ground truth segmentation is not adequately discussed. Factors such as annotation noise or the leveraging of information from neighboring lines could be crucial and warrant further exploration, especially given that compared models utilize ground truth.
- Lastly, while the paper's organization is commendable, the writing quality could be improved. The presence of numerous typos, grammatical errors, and inconsistencies in tense detracts from the overall professionalism. Moreover, the occasional competitive tone when discussing other works undermines the authors' credibility, as their results are robust enough to stand on their own merit without such comparisons.
