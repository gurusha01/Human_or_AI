This manuscript proposes a novel approach to estimating depth from a single image using monocular vision. The method involves convolving the image with a set of derivative filters to generate an overcomplete representation of features, from which statistical properties are extracted to construct a probabilistic model. A neural network is then employed to predict this model at each location in the image, allowing for an explicit representation of uncertainty in the output. The estimated values are subsequently combined using Half Quadratic Optimization to produce a coherent depth map. The results presented on the NYU2 dataset are favorable, demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach. This paper has several strengths, including its probabilistic formulation, which enables the consideration of uncertainty, and the consensus step, which provides an elegant means of resolving ambiguities. Although the work is not revolutionary, it has considerable merit. However, several questions and concerns arise: 
1. The use of a predefined set of derivative features is an interesting choice, but it would be beneficial to explore the possibility of learning these features within the framework, potentially using an iterative algorithm.
2. In Section 3.1, the choice to learn parameters using K-means is questionable; would not Expectation-Maximization (EM) be a more appropriate and effective method?
3. The computational efficiency of the method is a concern, as the processing time at test time appears to be significant; could the authors provide typical running times?
4. An examination of Table 2 suggests that the order filters are the most critical features, with negligible differences in performance between these filters and the full model; could the authors offer insights into this observation?
