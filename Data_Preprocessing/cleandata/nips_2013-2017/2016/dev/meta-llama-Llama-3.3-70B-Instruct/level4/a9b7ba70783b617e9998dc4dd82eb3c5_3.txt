The article presents an inference problem for cluster trees derived from density estimation and introduces a bootstrap-based method for constructing confidence sets, supplemented by an additional pruning technique for visualization purposes. The authors' approach involves a topological comparison of trees, utilizing an $\ell_\infty$ metric-based pruning method. The primary contribution of the work lies in the development of a theoretical framework, accompanied by numerical examples. The problem addressed is both interesting and significant, and the meticulous consideration of theoretical aspects is commendable. The proposed solution appears reasonable and practical.
1. While acknowledging the importance of theoretical development, the numerical examples provided do not effectively demonstrate the potential of the proposed method. Specifically, since the primary objective is the construction of confidence sets, it would be beneficial to showcase the richness of these sets to enhance the visualization facilitated by pruning, allowing readers to better appreciate the method's capabilities.
2. Related to the first point, the initial understanding was that partial ordering would be used for comparing different trees. However, the definition of partial ordering seems to necessitate that the main split occurs at exactly the same location (as illustrated in Fig.2), which is unlikely to happen for two distinct estimates, despite minor variations in branching points. This suggests that while partial ordering is well-defined for pruning a given estimate, it may not be directly applicable for comparing various trees within the confidence sets. Clarification on this aspect would be helpful to ensure understanding.
3. The metrics defined in Section 3 do not inherently assume that $p$ and $q$ represent density functions of the same underlying population (such as KDE estimates from different realizations of the population). Instead, they can be any functions defined on the same domain, without the requirement of being close to each other. Confirmation of this interpretation would be beneficial.
4. Similarly, for $p{inf}$ and the definition of $a$, considering density functions without compact support would result in $p{inf}$ and $a$ being zero. The phrase "more generally" in Lemma 1 seems to imply consideration of both cases (with and without compact support). Elucidation on this point would help in fully comprehending the lemma's applicability.
5. Intuitively, when considering the distance with respect to the truth, KDE's bias being proportional to the second derivatives suggests that the primary error would occur at peaks and valleys, directly linked to the merging height. This intuition supports the expected equivalence of $d\infty$ and $dM$. However, when comparing two different functions, the relative difference between these functions does not necessarily amplify at these landmarks, leading to a seeming discrepancy. Insights into the source of this confusion and further explanation would be valuable.
6. In Figure 4, the second example (Mickey Mouse data), it would be expected that the heights would differ between the main part and the two small clusters due to differing probabilities. The absence of this expected difference warrants explanation, as it seems counterintuitive given the context of the analysis.
