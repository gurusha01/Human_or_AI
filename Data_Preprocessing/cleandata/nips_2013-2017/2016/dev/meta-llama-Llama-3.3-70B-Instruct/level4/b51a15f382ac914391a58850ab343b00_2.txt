The paper examines the combinatorial aspect of partial monitoring games within stochastic environments, presenting two algorithms that rely on forced exploration rather than confidence bounds. The first algorithm achieves a state-of-the-art distribution-free regret bound with a simpler oracle, while the second algorithm matches the state-of-the-art distribution-dependent regret bound. Notably, both regret bounds are dependent on the size of a specific covering of the action set, rather than its cardinality. 
After considering the rebuttal addendum, particularly the discussion around lines 249-253, it becomes apparent that the algorithm for "online ranking with top-1 feedback" was initially developed for adversarial settings. The authors demonstrate that this problem can be addressed within their general CPM setting, thus allowing the solution of the specific "online ranking" problem even in stochastic settings through their algorithm. However, this response raises confusion, especially regarding the comparative power of stochastic versus oblivious adversaries. The stochastic adversary is less powerful, and while the authors' approach can solve the stochastic instance of the ranking problem, it does not match the capability of dealing with oblivious adversaries as the existing algorithm does. This limitation underscores the need to clarify the benefits of assuming a stochastic iid setting, potentially through a comparison of bounds in terms of problem parameters.
Originally, this paper tackles a significant problem at the forefront of online learning theory, enhancing the dependence on key parameters such as oracle requirements and action set dependence. It provides a detailed discussion of related work and its relation to existing approaches, making it a desirable inclusion for NIPS. However, the manuscript would benefit from proofreading to address English grammatical and style issues, including the correct use of articles, plurals, and comma placement. Minor remarks include corrections at lines 117, 118, and 121, and suggestions for additional commentary at lines 241 and 249-253 regarding the potential for combining algorithm benefits and the advantages of the stochastic method over non-stochastic algorithms. Lastly, line 305 requires the addition of \mathbb for expectation.
