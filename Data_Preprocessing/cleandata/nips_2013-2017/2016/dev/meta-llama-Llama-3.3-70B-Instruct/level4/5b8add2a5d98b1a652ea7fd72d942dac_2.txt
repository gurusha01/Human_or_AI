This manuscript introduces the truncated generalized gradient flow (TGGF) algorithm as a novel approach to solving quadratic linear systems, distinguished by its utilization of an orthogonality-promoting initialization, followed by iterative updates that are scaled. Notably, this methodology diverges from conventional practices that typically employ spectral initializations. Overall, the paper is well-structured and the findings are robust. A key contribution, Theorem 1, is derived under the assumption of noise-free measurements. A potential avenue for future exploration could involve extending this result to accommodate noisy measurements, thereby enhancing the algorithm's applicability to real-world scenarios.
