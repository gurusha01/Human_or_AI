The authors propose that the effectiveness of DRAW-like models stems from their incremental data generation approach and the deterministic relationships between latent variables and observations. By applying these principles to hierarchical latent variable models, they introduce Matryoshka Networks (MatNets), which comprise a bottom-up network, a top-down network, and merge modules that regulate information flow. This architecture bears resemblance to Probabilistic Ladder Networks (PLNs), with a deterministic pathway from observations to latent layers in the inference model and a top-down factorization of the variational posterior, but differs in its deterministic connections between latents and observations. MatNets demonstrate competitive or state-of-the-art performance in density modeling tasks on MNIST, Omniglot, and CIFAR. This paper presents an interesting and well-executed concept, with its primary contribution being a hierarchical VAE architecture that incorporates deterministic connections for incremental observation generation. While similar approaches have been explored in DRAW and PLNs, the introduction of deterministic connections in a generative hierarchical model is a novel aspect. However, the experimental section lacks direct evidence for the importance of these deterministic connections, instead focusing on the architecture's performance on various datasets. The paper's clarity is hindered by the presentation of the proposed architecture, which would benefit from a high-level probabilistic description preceding the specification of exact computations. Additionally, the lack of citations in certain areas, such as the use of convolutional GRUs, may give the impression of novelty where it does not exist. The related work section's omission of DRAW and PLNs is notable, and the authors should address this. Furthermore, it is unclear whether the inference regularization technique from Section 2.3 was utilized in the experiments. Finally, there are typos in Equations 11 and 12, which should include a log term for p(x|z).
