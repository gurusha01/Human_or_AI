The authors introduce a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, termed the diffusion convolutional network (DCNN), designed for classification tasks involving graph-structured data at multiple levels, including nodes, edges, and graphs as a whole. The core functionality of the DCNN involves mapping nodes and their associated features to the outcomes of a diffusion process initiated from these nodes. A key distinction from traditional CNNs lies in the parameter tying mechanism, which is based on search depth rather than positional information within a grid. Theoretically, the authors demonstrate that the activations produced by the DCNN for isomorphic input graphs are identical, indicating that the DCNN's representation is invariant to node indexing. Through comparative analyses with existing models on node and graph classification tasks, the DCNN is shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance on node classification and comparable results on graph classification. However, the model's potential on edge classification tasks remains unexplored, as no relevant results are presented. While the authors provide a comprehensive explanation of their model, further clarification and illustrative examples, such as utilizing a simple graph to elucidate the concepts and notation, particularly in figures 1(a-c), would enhance the readability and understanding of the proposed DCNN model. Overall, the DCNN demonstrates impressive capabilities, especially in node classification, though its performance on graph classification is less standout, highlighting areas for future improvement and exploration.
