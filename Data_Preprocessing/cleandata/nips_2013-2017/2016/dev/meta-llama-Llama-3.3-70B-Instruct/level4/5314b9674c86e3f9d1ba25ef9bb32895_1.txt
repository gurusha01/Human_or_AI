The paper presents a novel application of matrix product states decomposition (MPS) of tensor networks to multiclass supervised classification problems. Although the paper is well-written, it presupposes a certain level of familiarity with MPS and tensor networks, concepts predominantly found in quantum physics. The proposed methodology expands upon existing research (citations [3] and [4]), with the paper's contribution being incremental and somewhat similar in nature to the aforementioned studies. The primary contributions can be distilled into two key aspects: a) the introduction of a tensor-inspired encoding (kernel) applicable to classification problems with fixed-length vector data, and b) the optimization of the MPS representation for classification tasks using gradient descent, differing from [4] where the MPS representation is first chosen unsupervised and then applied separately for classification. 
Several suggestions are proposed to enhance the paper: 
1) Given the assumed background in tensor networks and MPS may not be common among the NIPS community, a more comprehensive introduction to these concepts would significantly improve the paper's readability, despite the challenges posed by space constraints in a NIPS paper.
2) Adding dimensions to vectors and matrices would also enhance readability.
3) There appears to be a discrepancy between the mentioned zig-zag ordering in line 153 and the illustration in Figure 8, which does not seem to depict a zig-zag pattern, suggesting a potential typo or incorrect figure reference that requires clarification.
4) Early in the paper, it would be beneficial to elaborate on the differences between the current work and [3] and [4] to facilitate understanding for readers unfamiliar with tensor networks.
5) The connection to neural networks, although informative, is briefly mentioned towards the end of the paper and warrants further elaboration for a clearer understanding of its relevance.
6) Details on the initialization process, the sensitivity of the problem to local minima, and the strategies employed to address this issue would provide valuable insights into the methodology's robustness.
7) Lastly, specifying the tools used for calculating SVD would be a helpful addition for reproducibility and clarity.
