This manuscript presents approaches for constructing and summarizing confidence sets for the underlying true cluster tree, which are then applied to various synthetic examples and a real-world Graft-versus-Host Disease (GvHD) dataset to demonstrate their effectiveness. However, a notable limitation of this work is the absence of comparative methods in the experimental section, which somewhat diminishes the strength of the empirical evaluations.
