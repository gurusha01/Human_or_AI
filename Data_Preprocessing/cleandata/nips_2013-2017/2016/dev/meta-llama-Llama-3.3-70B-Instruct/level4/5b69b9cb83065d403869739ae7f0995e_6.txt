This paper presents a compelling concept, framing machine translation as a communicative exchange between two parties with limited language knowledge. Several key aspects warrant further consideration: 
1. The theoretical underpinnings of the method appear incomplete, suggesting a need for more in-depth analysis or theoretical discussion to fully flesh out the approach.
2. Crucial details are omitted, such as the specifics of the one-way translation model employed, including its architectural design and parameter selection, as well as the model used for assessing pseudo-translation quality. These specifics are vital for a comprehensive understanding.
3. Algorithm 1 features an alternating scheduling mechanism between languages A and B on a sentence-by-sentence basis. The efficacy of this scheduling strategy could be explored further, potentially improved by incorporating sentences from B that exhibit overlap with the pseudo-translations of sentences from A in previous rounds.
4. The experimental results are somewhat underwhelming, given the potential for application to larger datasets in monolingual translation scenarios. A more extensive evaluation, such as training on the entirety of English and French Wikipedia, could provide more insightful outcomes.
5. An additional intriguing inquiry revolves around comparing the proposed method's performance to training conducted on parallel data, particularly in terms of reducing the requisite amount of parallel data to achieve performance parity with fully parallel data training methods.
