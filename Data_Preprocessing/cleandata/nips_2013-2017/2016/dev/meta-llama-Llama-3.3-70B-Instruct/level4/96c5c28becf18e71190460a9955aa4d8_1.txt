This study leverages the drift-diffusion model, a widely accepted and neuroscientifically grounded framework, to simulate the outcomes of two-alternative forced choice experiments in psychophysics and neuroscience. The decision-making process under uncertainty is typically characterized as a competitive accumulation of evidence, modeled as a drift-diffusion process that culminates in a decision upon reaching a threshold. A key question arises: what is the optimal threshold for a given problem? By reframing this problem as one of minimizing stopping time and decision error, the authors derive an optimal threshold, which is subsequently computed using two distinct algorithms that approach the optimization as a reinforcement learning problem. This work is commendable, but its impact would be significantly enhanced by applying it to empirical data from human or animal studies, readily available online, rather than solely relying on synthetic examples. An exploration of how closely human behavior aligns with optimality would provide valuable insights. Specifically, assessing whether humans achieve optimal performance and to what extent would greatly strengthen the paper's conclusions. Demonstrating the practical implications of surpassing this threshold would substantially increase the paper's impact, potentially leading to a higher rating.
