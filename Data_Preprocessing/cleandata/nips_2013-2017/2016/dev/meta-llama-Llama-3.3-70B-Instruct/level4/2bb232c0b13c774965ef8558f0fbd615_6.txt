This manuscript presents a novel approach to handwritten paragraph recognition by integrating segmentation and transcription, building upon existing research that utilizes multidimensional LSTM-RNNs. The proposed model leverages the connectionist temporal classification (CTC) for network training, extending the work in reference [6] by incorporating a weighted 'collapsing' step. This step involves computing a weighted sum of the feature vector sequence prior to the final processing stage, effectively introducing an attention mechanism that enhances recognition performance. The final stage employs a bidirectional LSTM decoder, replacing the traditional softmax approach, to output entire text lines instead of individual characters, resulting in a significant speed-up of 20-30 times in terms of iteration count. The proposed methodology demonstrates improved recognition accuracy compared to previous approaches. The key contributions of this paper lie in the introduction of a weighted collapse layer, which enables attentional mechanisms, and the utilization of a BLSTM decoder for sentence-level output in handwriting recognition. While these advancements represent logical extensions of prior work, they lack a significant element of novelty. The results clearly demonstrate improved accuracy, which is a notable achievement. However, the claimed speed-up benefit is not thoroughly quantified. A notable drawback of the manuscript is the presence of numerous typos, which the authors should address if the manuscript is accepted for publication.
