This paper presents a novel end-to-end network architecture for correspondence matching, leveraging a modified contrastive loss function implemented in a fully convolutional framework. This approach reduces the required number of forward passes during both training and testing phases. Additionally, the authors incorporate a hard negative mining strategy to accelerate network training. The implementation of Convolutional Spatial Transformers enables patch normalization for each activation in the ConvNet independently. The key contributions of this work include the utilization of Fully Convolutional Networks for correspondence matching, which decreases computational complexity, the introduction of a tailored contrastive loss, the implementation of a hard negative mining technique to reduce training time, and the integration of a convolutional spatial transformer layer as an alternative to traditional patch normalization. Among these contributions, the application of FCNs to solve the problem is particularly noteworthy, as it diverges from conventional patch-based methods. The related work discussion is comprehensive, and the results are benchmarked against several prominent methods. The experimental validation is deemed sufficient to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.
