This manuscript presents a novel approach to machine translation, utilizing reinforcement learning and leveraging monolingual data through a two-player communication paradigm. The paper introduces two key innovations: firstly, a unified framework is proposed for jointly training two dual translation models, and secondly, the translation models are designed to accept unpaired data as inputs and learn through reinforcement. The proposed framework is innovative, and its concept is thoroughly elaborated upon. The paper is well-structured and engaging to read. However, a clarification is needed regarding the algorithmic details. Specifically, it would be beneficial to explain the rationale behind the presence of $\frac{1}{K}$ in both lines 12 and 13 of Algorithm 1.
