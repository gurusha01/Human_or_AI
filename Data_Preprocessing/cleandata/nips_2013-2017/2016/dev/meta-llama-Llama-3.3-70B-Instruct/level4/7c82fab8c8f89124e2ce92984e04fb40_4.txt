This manuscript investigates the relatively newly emerged problem of selective inference for linear models characterized by group sparsity, presenting novel estimators designed for constructing confidence intervals and testing hypotheses on selected groups. The paper is clearly articulated and appears to offer a compelling addition to the field, although my familiarity with prior research is limited to the references provided by the authors. The theoretical findings are substantial and the empirical assessment yields encouraging results.
