This manuscript presents a novel approach to leveraging monolingual corpora for enhancing a Neural Machine Translation (NMT) system. The proposed framework utilizes reinforcement learning to provide feedback to two NMT systems, one for each direction of a given language pair, resulting in notable improvements. The method is clearly outlined, and the paper is well-structured and concise. Although the individual machine learning components may not be groundbreaking, the work innovatively combines various novel elements to create an effective framework that is likely to open up new avenues in Natural Language Processing (NLP). One potential consideration is whether the feedback function could also incorporate the language model associated with the source sentence, potentially serving as an indicator of sentence complexity and thereby mitigating the impact of unusual source sentences. Additionally, it would be beneficial to justify the decision to discard sentences containing at least one unknown word, as this could be addressed within the framework - were alternative approaches explored? Minor suggestions include avoiding repetition in Table 3 (L254), ensuring "for" is in lowercase (L255), and on Page 9, highlighting the option to cite published versions of arXiv papers.
