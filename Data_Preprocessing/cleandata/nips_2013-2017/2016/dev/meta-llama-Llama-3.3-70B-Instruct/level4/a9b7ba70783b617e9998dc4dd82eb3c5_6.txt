The paper presents a methodology for constructing and summarizing confidence sets for the true cluster tree, introducing a partial ordering to prune statistically insignificant features from the empirical tree. 
Clarity: 
- The manuscript's organization is subpar, with the main contribution in Section 4 being underdiscussed and potentially benefiting from relocation of certain sections, such as Section 3, to supplementary materials to enhance relevance and flow.
- The title appears overly broad for the content provided, particularly given the absence of hypothesis testing discussions alluded to in Section 1, which promised statistical inference for quantifying uncertainty and testing hypotheses related to the estimated cluster structure.
- Figures 4 and 5 would benefit from labeled x- and y-axes to ensure they are self-explanatory.
- The term "feature" is ambiguous and lacks a clear definition, necessitating clarification.
Innovation/Significance: 
- Combining the results of Lemma 2 and Theorem 3 to derive a result on T(p0) would strengthen the paper.
- A comparison with existing large-sample approximate confidence intervals is crucial yet missing, as is a discussion on practical scenarios where the proposed complex confidence intervals offer significant advantages.
- Although the dimension-independent convergence rate is a notable contribution, it remains unvalidated in the experimental section. While the partial ordering and Lemma 2 are intriguing, the manuscript suffers from a lack of cohesive presentation and robust validation, undermining its overall impact.
