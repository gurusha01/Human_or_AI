The paper's core concept involves formulating source detection and causal covariate selection as cardinality-constrained directed information (DI) maximization problems. It demonstrates that the source detection objective function, specifically the DI from the selected set to its complement, exhibits submodularity, albeit not monotonicity. In contrast, the causal covariate selection problem, which involves DI from the selected set to a target process, does not display submodularity, prompting the authors to introduce the notion of "near-submodularity" applicable to certain problem instances. A novel metric, the submodularity index (SmI), is proposed to quantify the degree of submodularity in general set functions, with negative values indicating non-submodular functions. However, even for non-submodular functions with a relatively high SmI, the random-greedy algorithm can achieve near-optimal performance, including for non-monotone functions. The authors further derive near-optimality bounds for the random-greedy algorithm's performance based on SmI and apply these bounds to analyze its behavior in source detection and causal covariate selection. Although computing SmI can be intractable due to its exponential complexity relative to the ground set size, the authors provide a simple lower bound for SmI in the context of the two problems. These theoretical findings are validated through numerical experiments. The paper is well-written and engaging, with a significant contribution being the demonstration of the random-greedy algorithm's near-optimality in terms of SmI. This implies that for functions approximating submodularity, the greedy algorithm may perform well. Given the exponential computational cost of SmI with respect to the ground set size, suggestions for future work include providing computable bounds on this index for other classes of set functions and exploring additional applications where SmI is small. It is also noteworthy that the bound in Lemma 2 may become less useful as the size of the problem increases due to the growth of mutual information terms, suggesting an investigation into the performance of the random-greedy algorithm on larger problems, such as source detection with a ground set size of 100 or more, and comparing it with other algorithms. Furthermore, the experimental results could be enhanced by including comparisons with other methods, such as those in references [21-22]. Minor corrections and clarifications are also recommended, including correcting the inconsistency in Line 60, formally defining \(S^n\) in Line 101, considering the term "strictly-submodular" in Line 161, and correcting the terminology in Line 280 to "reduced".
