This manuscript explores the application of tensor networks from quantum physics to develop a supervised learning algorithm. However, a significant limitation of this research is the lack of motivation behind utilizing tensor networks for defining the feature map. It is evident that employing tensor networks introduces several challenges in the optimization process. The authors are advised to investigate the potential application of the kernel trick, which could mitigate computational complexity, as it has been extensively studied in kernel machines, such as support vector machines. The proposed classification model, as outlined in Section 3, raises concerns regarding label assignment, specifically how the label index is arbitrarily positioned within the tensor and how it can be relocated to another tensor. This issue can be perceived as assigning a label to a single pixel rather than the entire image, which may be attributed to the inadequacy of the model, as defined in equations (4) and (5), for multiclass classification. The authors' choice of quadratic loss in equation (6) is motivated by its superior test results, but they should also report on other loss functions used for comparison. Notably, the quadratic loss facilitates relatively straightforward computations due to its derivability, unlike some other loss functions. Several issues are identified in the experimental section: crucial details, such as the number of data points (N) and classes (L) used, are omitted; the subsampling of 28x28 images to 14x14 is done to reduce training time, but the computational complexity of the algorithm is not discussed, which is a significant concern; the methodology for estimating training and test errors is unclear; and the proposed classification algorithm is not benchmarked against state-of-the-art classification methods in terms of estimated errors and computational complexity.
