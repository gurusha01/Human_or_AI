This manuscript presents a methodology for conducting group-sparse inferences in the context of sparse feature selection techniques, utilizing the conditional probability density \|P\mathcal{L}Y\|2 to derive p-values and confidence intervals for the selected features or coefficients. The approach is applied to three distinct sparse regression methods, with algorithms provided for each, and is validated through experiments on both simulated and real-world data. Several questions and concerns arise from the presentation: 
1. What is the rationale behind performing inferences on groups of columns of X rather than individually, and what advantages does this grouping offer? 
2. In practical applications, what criteria are used to determine which columns should be grouped together? 
3. Are the defined groups mutually exclusive, or can columns belong to multiple groups? 
4. The text mentions "controlling for the remaining selected groups" (Lines 61-63); could the authors elaborate on the procedure for achieving this control? 
5. The phrase "condition on the direction dir_\mathcal{L}(Y)" (Lines 109-110) requires clarification; what does conditioning on the direction imply in this context? 
6. The statement regarding "independence between the length and the direction of P\mathcal{L}Y" (Lines 113-114) is puzzling, especially when P\mathcal{L}\mu\neq0, which apparently introduces dependence between these two aspects; could the authors provide a detailed explanation? 
7. In the experiments, the matrix X is described as being 500 by 500 (Line 255); do the columns within each group exhibit similar structural properties? If the entries of X are independently and identically distributed, what methodology is used to decide on the grouping of columns? 
8. For the real data experiments (Lines 279-280), the process of selecting groups and determining group sizes is not clearly explained; why was the decision made to expand one column into a group of three rather than combining different columns, and what novel insights does this approach yield? 
9. The evaluation of the proposed approach's performance lacks a comparative baseline or an alternative inference method; would it be possible to compare the proposed methodology against the method outlined in reference 6 or another established baseline? 
10. Finally, in the real data analysis, where each group is derived from a single column of the original data, the significant discrepancies in p-values obtained using the same method but different group sizes are noteworthy; for instance, the "Forward stepwise" method yields a p-value of 0 for "Obese" when the group size is 3, contrasting sharply with a p-value of 0.519 when the group size is 1. Which of these outcomes is more accurate, and what factors contribute to these discrepancies?
