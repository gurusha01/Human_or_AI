This paper presents a novel approach to image classification by leveraging tensor networks with matrix product states, effectively bridging the gap between distinct fields. The proposed methodology is intriguing and demonstrates significant potential. However, there are several areas where the presentation could be enhanced for clarity. 
In Section 5, the process of approximating the weight tensor as a Matrix Product State (MPS) lacks clear explanation. Specifically, it is unclear how the approximation is achieved or what it entails. Does this involve considering all singular values from equation (11) to represent the tensor being approximated?
The discussion in Section 7 regarding open problems related to regularization could be further elucidated. The equations (11) and (14) seem to implicitly address these concerns, drawing parallels with existing work, such as the paper by Signoretto et al., which applies regularization to tensor model learning through convex optimization and spectral regularization. The truncation of singular values in equation (11) influences the tensor's rank, effectively controlling it without explicitly adding regularization to equation (6).
Furthermore, the method outlined in [15] by Cichocki for solving linear systems using MPS could potentially be applied here, as equations (6) and (7) are linear in the unknown tensor. It would be beneficial to clarify what differentiates the current problem from [15] or what additional complexities prevent the direct application of Cichocki's method.
Additional explanations are needed for how \(\tilde{\Phi}_n\) is derived from the given data. The terminology "leading-order update" in equations (7) and (8) requires further clarification to ensure understanding.
To enhance the paper's readability and applicability, incorporating a step-by-step algorithm that outlines the process from training data to the solution B would be highly beneficial. 
Lastly, the features presented in equation (3) appear to be Fourier features. It's worth noting that random Fourier features are increasingly used in large-scale problems, extending beyond image classification. This could offer an interesting avenue for further exploration or comparison.
