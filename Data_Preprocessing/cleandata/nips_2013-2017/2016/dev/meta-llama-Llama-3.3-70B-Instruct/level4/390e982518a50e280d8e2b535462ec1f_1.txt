This manuscript integrates multiple graph kernels into a diffusion-convolutional neural network architecture. Notably, the authors introduce a weighting mechanism for the jth hop transition of feature k in the initial layer, ultimately yielding an activation output for each node, hop, feature, and graph, thereby enabling the weights to be data-driven. The significance of this work lies in its addressing of the longstanding issue of learning kernels from graph labels, a problem that has not been thoroughly explored in existing literature. However, the clarity of the paper could be improved, particularly with regards to the definition and explanation of the power spectrum P* and the hop, which may pose a challenge for readers unfamiliar with these concepts. Fortunately, the experimental section is both informative and comprehensive, providing valuable insights.
