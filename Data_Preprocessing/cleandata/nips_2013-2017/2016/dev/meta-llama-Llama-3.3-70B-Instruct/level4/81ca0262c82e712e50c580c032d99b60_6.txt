This manuscript examines the problem of causal subset selection using directed information as a measure of causality. The authors formulate two key tasks and analyze their sub-modularity properties by introducing a novel sub-modularity index. The paper's primary contribution lies in the development of this index, which quantifies how closely a function approximates sub-modularity. The introduction of this index is a natural and intuitive approach, making it surprising that it has not been previously explored. The proposed methods are innovative and engaging, with a particularly noteworthy application in learning causal structures, demonstrating the potential of this approach.
