This manuscript addresses the challenge of determining the optimal decision timing in uncertain environments, equivalent to identifying the ideal threshold in the drift-diffusion model for two-alternative forced choice tasks. The authors propose two approaches, namely REINFORCE and Bayesian optimization, to learn this threshold. The paper highlights a significant issue and presents it effectively. Nevertheless, as acknowledged by the authors, the work lacks a biologically plausible implementation. Furthermore, the current framework appears to only account for Bayes risk. Notably, there is an additional biological cost associated with observing and accumulating evidence, as discussed in Drugowitsch et al (2012, Journal of Neuroscience). A crucial question arises: how can this observational cost be incorporated into the threshold learning methods to enhance their applicability?
