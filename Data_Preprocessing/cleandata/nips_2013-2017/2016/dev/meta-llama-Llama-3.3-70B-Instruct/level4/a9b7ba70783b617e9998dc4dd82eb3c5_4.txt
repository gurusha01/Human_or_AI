This paper presents the following key contributions: 1. it examines various metrics on cluster trees, demonstrating the equivalence between l-infinity and merge distortion norms, and explains why a modified merge distortion metric is not suitable for their analysis, ultimately opting for the l-infinity norm. 2. it develops asymptotic confidence sets for cluster trees by utilizing a KDE estimate in conjunction with bootstrapping. 3. it proposes a pruning procedure to simplify trees within the confidence set and establishes a partial ordering of these trees. The paper is well-written and provides valuable insights. Notably, the development of confidence intervals for cluster trees appears to be a significant achievement, and in doing so, the authors have established a substantial amount of novel theoretical groundwork.
