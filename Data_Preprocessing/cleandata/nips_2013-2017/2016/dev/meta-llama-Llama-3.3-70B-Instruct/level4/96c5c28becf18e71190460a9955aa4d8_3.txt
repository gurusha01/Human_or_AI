This paper is well-structured and effectively presents an evaluation of practical algorithms for decision threshold optimization through simulation. Key observations and suggestions include: 
- The paper provides a significant contribution to the theoretical foundation of DDMs, primarily targeting a neuroscience and psychology audience. However, it lacks substantial application to these fields, raising questions about the cognitive or biological plausibility of the algorithms and the availability of empirical evidence to support them. Potential experimental approaches to test these hypotheses would strengthen the paper.
- The inclusion of learning curves as a function of computation time, rather than trials, for the two methods would be beneficial. This would facilitate the determination of the optimal algorithm based on computational resources.
- The paper does not provide an explanation for the higher variance observed in Bayesian optimization.
- Relevant studies, such as those by Simen, Holmes & Cohen (2006) and Frank (2006), which propose neurally and biologically plausible models for decision threshold optimization, should be discussed and compared to the new model, especially in relation to empirical data, to establish its validity as a psychological or neural theory.
After reviewing the other assessments and the author's response, the initial evaluation remains unchanged. 
Additional minor points for consideration include: 
- On page 3, it would be helpful to explicitly state that W0 and W1 represent error costs.
- A minor correction on page 3 from "sum collected" to "sum of collected" is suggested.
- In Footnote 1, there seems to be a confusion between W0/W1 and theta0/theta1, which should be clarified.
- A typo on page 4, "dependance" should be corrected to "dependence".
