This paper proposes a novel reinforcement learning-based method for machine translation using monolingual data and two-player communication. The model jointly trains two dual translation models in one framework, taking unpaired data as inputs and learning through reinforcement. The proposed framework is well-explained, and the paper is well-written and enjoyable to read.
The paper's main idea is to leverage the duality of machine translation tasks, where any task has a dual task, e.g., English-to-French translation (primal) versus French-to-English translation (dual). The primal and dual tasks can form a closed loop, generating informative feedback signals to train the translation models, even without human labeling. The authors propose a dual-learning mechanism, where two agents represent the models for the primal and dual tasks, teaching each other through a reinforcement learning process.
The paper's strengths include its novelty, clarity, and significance. The proposed framework is a significant departure from traditional machine translation approaches, which rely heavily on paired data. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through experiments on English-French translation tasks, showing that their method can achieve comparable accuracy to traditional methods using only monolingual data.
However, there are some weaknesses and questions raised by the paper. One question is regarding the algorithm, specifically the presence of $\frac{1}{K}$ in both line 12 and line 13 of Algorithm 1. It is unclear why this term is necessary, and further explanation would be helpful.
In terms of the qualitative evaluation criteria, the paper scores well on quality, clarity, and originality. The paper is technically sound, with well-supported claims and a clear explanation of the proposed framework. The writing is clear and well-organized, making it easy to follow. The paper's originality is also high, as it proposes a novel approach to machine translation that leverages monolingual data and reinforcement learning.
However, the paper's significance could be further demonstrated by more extensive experiments and comparisons to other state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, the paper could benefit from more discussion on the potential applications and limitations of the proposed framework.
