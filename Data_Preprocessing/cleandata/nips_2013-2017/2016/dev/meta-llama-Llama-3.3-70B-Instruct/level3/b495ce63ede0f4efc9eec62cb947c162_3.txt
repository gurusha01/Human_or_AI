This paper proposes a novel algorithm, Truncated Generalized Gradient Flow (TGGF), for solving systems of quadratic equations. The algorithm consists of two stages: an orthogonality-promoting initialization and a refinement stage using truncated generalized gradient iterations. The authors claim that TGGF recovers the solution exactly with high probability and complexity growing linearly with the time required to read the data.
The paper is well-written and clearly explains the motivation behind the proposed algorithm. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the algorithm's performance and compare it to existing state-of-the-art methods, such as Wirtinger Flow (WF) and Truncated Wirtinger Flow (TWF). The numerical results demonstrate the superior performance of TGGF over these methods, especially in terms of sample complexity and computational efficiency.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposed algorithm, TGGF, is novel and has a solid theoretical foundation.
* The authors provide a thorough analysis of the algorithm's performance and compare it to existing methods.
* The numerical results are convincing and demonstrate the superiority of TGGF.
However, there are some weaknesses:
* The paper assumes that the system of quadratic equations has a unique solution, which may not always be the case in practice.
* The authors do not provide a detailed analysis of the algorithm's robustness to noise and outliers.
* The computational complexity of the algorithm is not thoroughly analyzed, and it is not clear how the algorithm scales to large problem sizes.
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of quadratic equation solving and has the potential to impact various applications, such as phase retrieval and signal processing. However, further research is needed to address the weaknesses mentioned above and to fully explore the potential of the proposed algorithm.
