This paper proposes a novel approach to learning decision thresholds in the drift-diffusion model of perceptual decision making. The authors introduce a reward function derived from Wald's trial-averaged cost function, which is highly stochastic and challenging to optimize. They address this challenge by proposing two distinct methods to learn the decision thresholds: a REINFORCE method based on Williams' REINFORCE algorithm for training neural networks, and a Bayesian optimization method that samples and builds a probabilistic model of the reward function.
The paper provides a thorough analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of each method. The REINFORCE method converges gradually over 5000 trials, while the Bayesian optimization method converges much faster in 500 trials. However, the Bayesian optimization method is three times more variable in the threshold estimates and 40 times slower in computation time. The authors also compare the two methods with experimental data from animal learning studies, finding that the REINFORCE method is a plausible model of animal learning.
The paper is well-written and clearly organized, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments. The introduction provides a clear background on the drift-diffusion model and the sequential probability ratio test, while the methods section provides a detailed description of the two learning methods. The results section presents a thorough analysis of the performance of each method, including comparisons with experimental data.
One potential weakness of the paper is the lack of discussion on the properties of the proposed confidence interval, such as its validity and conservatism. Additionally, the paper could benefit from more specific comments on the wording, such as revisions to lines 59 and 132. However, overall, the paper is well-written and provides a significant contribution to the field of perceptual decision making.
