This paper proposes a novel approach to monocular depth estimation by training a neural network to predict probability distributions over local coefficients of the scene depth map in an overcomplete representation. The network's output is then used to estimate the scene depth map through an efficient globalization procedure. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on the NYU v2 depth benchmark, achieving state-of-the-art performance.
The paper is well-structured and easy to follow, with a clear introduction to the problem and related work. The proposed approach is well-motivated and thoroughly explained, with a detailed description of the network architecture and training procedure. The experimental results are impressive, with the proposed method outperforming previous state-of-the-art approaches on most metrics.
One of the strengths of the paper is its clarity and organization. The authors provide a clear overview of the proposed approach and its components, making it easy to understand the methodology and its contributions. The paper also provides a thorough analysis of the results, including an ablation study to evaluate the contribution of different components of the overcomplete representation.
However, there are some areas where the paper could be improved. For example, the authors could provide more analysis and comparisons with previous methods, particularly in terms of the network's ability to handle different types of scenes and objects. Additionally, the paper could benefit from more discussion on the limitations and potential applications of the proposed approach.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, with a clear and well-supported methodology. The claims made by the authors are well-supported by experimental results, and the paper provides a thorough evaluation of the proposed approach. The authors are also careful to evaluate both the strengths and weaknesses of their approach, providing a balanced view of its contributions and limitations.
The originality of the paper is high, as it proposes a novel approach to monocular depth estimation that differs from previous methods. The paper also provides a unique combination of techniques, including the use of an overcomplete representation and a globalization procedure to estimate the scene depth map.
The significance of the paper is also high, as it addresses a difficult problem in computer vision and provides a state-of-the-art solution. The proposed approach has the potential to be used in a variety of applications, including robotics, graphics, and vision, and could have a significant impact on the field.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, as it provides a significant contribution to the field of computer vision and monocular depth estimation. The paper is well-written, well-organized, and provides a thorough evaluation of the proposed approach. The results are impressive, and the paper has the potential to have a significant impact on the field.
