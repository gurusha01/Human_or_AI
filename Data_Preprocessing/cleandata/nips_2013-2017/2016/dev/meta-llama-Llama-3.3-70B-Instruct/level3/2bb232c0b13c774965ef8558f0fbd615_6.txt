This paper proposes a novel algorithm, Truncated Generalized Gradient Flow (TGGF), for solving systems of quadratic equations. The approach is based on a two-stage process, consisting of an orthogonality-promoting initialization and a refinement stage using truncated generalized gradient iterations. The authors claim that TGGF achieves exact recovery of the solution from a near-optimal number of noise-free measurements, with a linear computational complexity.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of the proposed algorithm. The use of mathematical notation is consistent, and the references to previous work are adequate. The numerical results presented in the paper demonstrate the effectiveness of TGGF in comparison to existing state-of-the-art solvers, such as Truncated Wirtinger Flow (TWF) and Wirtinger Flow (WF).
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel algorithm that achieves exact recovery of the solution from a near-optimal number of noise-free measurements.
* The use of a simple yet effective truncation rule that improves the performance of the algorithm.
* The provision of numerical results that demonstrate the superiority of TGGF over existing solvers.
However, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement:
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the computational complexity of TGGF, including a comparison with existing solvers.
* The authors could provide more insight into the choice of parameters, such as the step size and truncation threshold, and their effect on the performance of the algorithm.
* The paper could be improved by including more numerical results, such as a comparison of the running times of TGGF and existing solvers.
