This paper presents a novel deep learning framework for obtaining dense correspondences between natural images, which can be applied to both geometric and semantic correspondences. The framework's key contributions include the correspondence contrastive loss, convolutional spatial transformer, and K-nearest neighbor layer for efficient training and correspondence search. 
The paper is well-written, and the results are state-of-the-art on several relevant datasets, making it a strong candidate for an oral presentation at NIPS. However, there are some concerns regarding the computational complexity of the framework, specifically the comparison between O(n) and O(n^2) forward passes. The authors should provide more detailed analysis and discussion on this aspect.
Another concern is the framework's ability to handle occlusions, which is unclear from the paper. The authors should include a discussion on how the existing loss addresses occlusions and provide experimental results to demonstrate the framework's performance in such cases.
The paper could also benefit from referencing relevant work, such as "Learning Dense Correspondence via 3D-guided Cycle Consistency" from CVPR 2016, to provide a more comprehensive overview of the current state of research in this area.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of the work. The paper is clearly written, well-organized, and provides enough information for an expert reader to reproduce the results.
The originality of the paper lies in its novel framework and key contributions, which differentiate it from previous work. The significance of the paper is evident from its state-of-the-art results and potential applications in various fields, such as computer vision and robotics.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper presents a novel and effective framework for obtaining dense correspondences between natural images.
