This paper proposes a novel approach to jointly segment and transcribe handwritten paragraphs using Multi-Dimensional Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks (MDLSTMs) and a Bidirectional-LSTM decoder. The model uses an attention network to effectively segment each line of text and a Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss to minimize errors over the entire paragraph. The approach builds upon previous work by extending beyond models that require line segmentation, making it a useful progression in the field.
The paper is well-written and clearly organized, making it easy to follow the authors' ideas. The introduction provides a thorough background on offline handwriting recognition and the limitations of current models. The related work section is comprehensive, covering various approaches to handwriting recognition, including classical text line segmentation algorithms and recent attention-based models.
The proposed model is technically sound, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the architecture and the training process. The use of an attention mechanism to perform implicit line segmentation is a key contribution of the paper, and the authors demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments on two public databases, Rimes and IAM.
The results show that the proposed model outperforms the baseline model and is competitive with state-of-the-art systems on the Rimes database. However, the performance on the IAM database is not as strong, and the authors acknowledge that the language model plays a significant role in this dataset.
One of the strengths of the paper is its clarity and organization. The authors provide a clear overview of the proposed model and its components, making it easy to understand the contributions of the paper. The experiments are well-designed, and the results are thoroughly analyzed.
However, there are some weaknesses to the paper. The authors could have included a baseline comparison with simpler models, such as Convolutional or Affine layers, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. Additionally, the complexity of the model may increase with additional levels of MDLSTMs and CTCs, which could make it more challenging to train and evaluate.
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of handwriting recognition, and the proposed model has real-world applicability. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of the model through experiments on public databases, and the paper is well-written and easy to follow.
