This paper proposes a novel framework for depth estimation, which is a cascaded two-stage system that generates and combines local distributions. However, upon closer examination, it becomes apparent that the proposed system lacks sufficient novel ideas and bears a strong resemblance to existing works by Eigen et al and Liu et al. The paper's contribution to the field of depth estimation is therefore limited.
Furthermore, the experimental evaluation of the proposed algorithm is flawed due to inconsistent comparison methods with existing works and the absence of crucial baselines, such as applying CRF on top of local neural networks. This lack of fairness in experiments makes it challenging to accurately assess the performance of the proposed algorithm.
The motivation behind the proposed two-stage cascaded architecture is also unclear, and the reasoning behind its ability to clear ambiguity in predictions is not well-explained. Additionally, the paper is missing relevant references from semantic segmentation works that have similar architectures, which would provide a more comprehensive overview of related research.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, but the claims are not well-supported by theoretical analysis or experimental results. The paper is also not a complete piece of work, as it lacks a thorough evaluation of the proposed algorithm and its comparison to existing methods.
The clarity of the paper is good, and it is well-organized, but it could be improved with more detailed explanations of the proposed architecture and its components. The paper adequately informs the reader about the proposed framework, but it could benefit from more visual aids and examples to illustrate the concepts.
The originality of the paper is limited, as it builds upon existing works without introducing significant novel ideas. The paper does not provide a unique combination of familiar techniques, and it does not clearly differ from previous contributions. The related work section is also incomplete, as it lacks references to relevant papers in the field of semantic segmentation.
The significance of the paper is also limited, as it does not address a difficult problem in a better way than previous research. The paper does not advance the state of the art in a demonstrable way, and it does not provide unique data, conclusions, or a unique theoretical or pragmatic approach.
Overall, the paper has some strengths, such as its clear writing and organization, but it is outweighed by its weaknesses, including the lack of novel ideas, flawed experimental evaluation, and limited originality and significance.
