This paper proposes a novel approach to machine translation using bidirectional reinforcement learning with RNN translation models and unaligned corpora. The authors introduce a dual-learning mechanism that enables an NMT system to learn from unlabeled data through a dual-learning game, where two agents teach each other through a reinforcement learning process. The approach allows for translation without aligned parallel corpora, which is a significant advancement in the field.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the dual-learning mechanism and its application to neural machine translation. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, outperforming baseline algorithms in all settings. The use of beam search to generate more meaningful results for gradient computation is a good technique to reduce variance and improve the stability of the training process.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to leverage monolingual data to improve the performance of machine translation systems. The authors demonstrate that their approach can achieve comparable accuracy to NMT trained from full bilingual data, even with only 10% bilingual data. This has significant implications for low-resource languages where parallel data is scarce.
However, I do have some concerns regarding the selection of the weighting factor α, which controls the trade-off between the language model reward and the communication reward. The authors do not provide sufficient justification for the choice of α, and it is unclear how this hyperparameter affects the communication loss. More data and analysis on the impact of α on the performance of the dual-NMT algorithm would be beneficial.
In terms of originality, the paper proposes a new approach to machine translation that combines reinforcement learning and dual-learning mechanisms. While the idea of using reinforcement learning for machine translation is not new, the authors' application of dual-learning to this problem is novel and has potential applications in other fields.
The significance of the paper lies in its ability to advance the state of the art in machine translation, particularly in low-resource languages. The proposed approach has the potential to improve the performance of machine translation systems in a variety of settings, and the authors' experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in achieving this goal.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, as it presents a significant contribution to the field of machine translation. However, I would like to see more analysis on the impact of the weighting factor α on the performance of the dual-NMT algorithm.
