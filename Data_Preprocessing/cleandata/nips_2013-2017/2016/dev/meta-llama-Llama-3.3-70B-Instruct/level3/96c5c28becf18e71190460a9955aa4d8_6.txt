This paper proposes the use of the Barzilai-Borwein (BB) method to automatically compute step sizes for stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variant, stochastic variance reduced gradient (SVRG) method. The resulting algorithms, SGD-BB and SVRG-BB, are shown to have comparable or even better performance than SGD and SVRG with best-tuned step sizes. The paper also provides a linear convergence analysis for SVRG-BB and proves the linear convergence of SVRG with Option I, which was previously missing in the literature.
The strengths of the paper include its technical soundness, novelty, and potential impact on the psychology and cognitive science community. The application of the BB method to estimate the decision threshold in a 2-AFC task is an important problem in decision science, and the paper's approach is interesting and novel. The numerical experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithms, and the comparison with other methods shows their superiority.
However, the paper also has some weaknesses. The algorithms used are not novel and have been used without significant modifications from previous work. The paper lacks clarity and presentation, with missing important information in the method section, vague explanations, and typos that need to be corrected to improve readability and replicability. Additionally, the estimation of a constant decision threshold in an infinite horizon setting may not be directly applicable to most psychology experiments.
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel application of the BB method to estimate the decision threshold in a 2-AFC task.
* The numerical experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithms.
* The paper provides a linear convergence analysis for SVRG-BB and proves the linear convergence of SVRG with Option I.
Arguments con acceptance:
* The algorithms used are not novel and have been used without significant modifications from previous work.
* The paper lacks clarity and presentation, with missing important information and typos.
* The estimation of a constant decision threshold in an infinite horizon setting may not be directly applicable to most psychology experiments.
Overall, the paper has potential, but it needs to be revised to address the weaknesses mentioned above. With improvements in clarity, presentation, and applicability, the paper could make a significant contribution to the field.
