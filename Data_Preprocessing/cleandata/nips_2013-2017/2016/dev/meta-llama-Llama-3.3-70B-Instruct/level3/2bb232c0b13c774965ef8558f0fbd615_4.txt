This paper proposes a modification to the standard MD-LSTM architecture for handwriting recognition, replacing the global average pooling in the collapse layer with a weighted average pooling. The weights are learned using a recurrent attention layer, allowing the model to focus on specific parts of the input image. The model is trained using CTC loss, which enables transcription without requiring character or line-level alignment. The attention mechanism can be interpreted as a "soft" line segmentation, and the authors demonstrate competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods on two public datasets, Rimes and IAM.
The strengths of this paper include its ability to perform end-to-end handwriting recognition without explicit line segmentation, which is a significant step towards full document transcription. The use of a recurrent attention layer to learn weights for the weighted average pooling is also a novel contribution. The authors provide a clear and well-organized presentation of their work, including a detailed description of the model architecture and experimental results.
However, the technical novelty of the work is questionable, as the major change is decoding an entire line at each time step instead of a single character. The authors could further demonstrate the effectiveness of their method by visualizing the attentions when the number of lines in the input image exceeds the number of time steps the algorithm is set to run.
In terms of quality, the paper is well-written and clearly presents the authors' contributions. The claims are well-supported by experimental results, and the authors provide a thorough discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of their approach. The originality of the work is moderate, as the authors build upon existing MD-LSTM architectures and attention mechanisms. The significance of the work is high, as it addresses a difficult problem in handwriting recognition and provides a novel solution.
Arguments for acceptance include:
* The paper presents a novel approach to handwriting recognition that eliminates the need for explicit line segmentation.
* The authors demonstrate competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods on two public datasets.
* The paper is well-written and clearly presents the authors' contributions.
Arguments against acceptance include:
* The technical novelty of the work is questionable, as the major change is decoding an entire line at each time step instead of a single character.
* The authors could further demonstrate the effectiveness of their method by visualizing the attentions when the number of lines in the input image exceeds the number of time steps the algorithm is set to run.
Overall, I recommend accepting this paper, as it presents a novel approach to handwriting recognition and demonstrates competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods. However, the authors should address the concerns regarding technical novelty and provide additional visualizations to further demonstrate the effectiveness of their method.
