This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of cluster tree inference, addressing the crucial question of quantifying uncertainty in the statistical significance of topological features of an empirical cluster tree. The authors investigate various metrics on cluster trees, establishing the equivalence of l-infinity and merge distortion norms, and select the l-infinity norm for analysis. They construct asymptotic confidence sets for cluster trees using a KDE estimate and bootstrapping, a substantial contribution to the field. The introduction of a pruning procedure to simplify trees in the confidence set, along with a partial ordering of the trees, adds to the paper's theoretical contributions.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem of cluster tree inference. The related work section is thorough, and the authors demonstrate a good understanding of the existing literature on the topic. The technical sections are well-organized, and the authors provide a detailed explanation of their methods and results.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The authors provide a rigorous theoretical framework for cluster tree inference, including the construction of confidence sets and the introduction of a partial ordering on trees.
* The paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed methods, including simulations and an application to a real dataset.
* The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their methods in identifying statistically significant features of the cluster tree.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes that the true density is a Morse function, which may not be the case in practice. It would be useful to investigate the robustness of the methods to deviations from this assumption.
* The authors use the Silverman reference rule for choosing the bandwidth, which may not be optimal for tree inference. It would be useful to investigate alternative bandwidth selection methods that are more targeted to tree inference.
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The paper presents a significant contribution to the field of cluster tree inference, addressing a crucial question in the field.
* The authors provide a rigorous theoretical framework for cluster tree inference, including the construction of confidence sets and the introduction of a partial ordering on trees.
* The paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed methods, including simulations and an application to a real dataset.
Arguments con acceptance:
* The paper assumes that the true density is a Morse function, which may not be the case in practice.
* The authors use the Silverman reference rule for choosing the bandwidth, which may not be optimal for tree inference.
Overall, I believe that the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of cluster tree inference and should be accepted. However, the authors should address the weaknesses mentioned above, including investigating the robustness of the methods to deviations from the Morse function assumption and exploring alternative bandwidth selection methods.
