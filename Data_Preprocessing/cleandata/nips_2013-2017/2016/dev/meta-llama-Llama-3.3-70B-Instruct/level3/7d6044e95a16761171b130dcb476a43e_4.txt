This paper proposes a novel framework for combining the strengths of probabilistic graphical models and deep learning methods, called Structured Variational Autoencoders (SVAEs). The authors introduce a method to generalize variational autoencoders (VAEs) to structured graphical models with non-linear observation models by predicting potential functions. The SVAE framework uses graphical models to represent structured probability distributions and enables fast exact inference subroutines, while also using ideas from VAEs for learning nonlinear feature models and bottom-up recognition networks to improve inference.
The paper is well-motivated, and the proposed framework has the potential to be a significant contribution to the field. However, the manuscript is difficult to follow, with key concepts like the main objective L_SVAE not introduced in the main text and important proofs scattered in the supplementary material. The experimental results are limited to toy data and mouse depth data, and the model is only compared to other methods on synthetic spiral data, which is a let-down. Additionally, the paper has some technical errors, such as constant terms left in the posterior in Appendix equation (28) and a notation mistake in Figure 2.
The strengths of the paper include its originality and significance. The proposed SVAE framework is a novel combination of familiar techniques, and it has the potential to advance the state of the art in a demonstrable way. The paper also provides a unique theoretical approach to combining graphical models and deep learning methods.
The weaknesses of the paper include its clarity and quality. The manuscript is difficult to follow, and the technical errors and notation mistakes detract from the overall quality of the paper. Additionally, the experimental results are limited, and the model is not compared to other methods on a more involved and well-known task.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for originality and significance, but falls short on clarity and quality. To improve the paper, the authors should focus on clarifying the manuscript, fixing the technical errors, and providing more comprehensive experimental results.
Arguments pro acceptance:
