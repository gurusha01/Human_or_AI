This paper proposes a novel algorithm, Truncated Generalized Gradient Flow (TGGF), to solve a system of quadratic equations, a NP-hard problem. The authors claim that TGGF can recover the solution exactly with high probability and linear complexity, outperforming existing methods. The paper is well-written and structured, with a clear problem statement and extensive comparison between methods.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposed algorithm, TGGF, has a linear complexity level with the time required to read the data, making it efficient.
* The numerical results demonstrate that TGGF outperforms existing methods, such as Wirtinger Flow (WF) and Truncated Wirtinger Flow (TWF), in terms of result quality, even when the ratio between equations and unknowns approaches the minimum theoretical limit.
* The paper provides a clear and detailed explanation of the algorithm and its components, including the orthogonality-promoting initialization and the truncated generalized gradient iterations.
However, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement:
* The introduction could be improved by mentioning existing methods' performance and the proposed technique's performance, and adding a real-data example to demonstrate its applicability.
* The paper assumes that the system of equations has a unique solution, which may not always be the case in practice.
* The numerical results are mostly based on simulated data, and it would be beneficial to include more real-world examples to demonstrate the algorithm's performance in practical scenarios.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of quadratic equation solving, and the proposed algorithm, TGGF, has the potential to be a valuable tool for solving large-scale systems of quadratic equations.
