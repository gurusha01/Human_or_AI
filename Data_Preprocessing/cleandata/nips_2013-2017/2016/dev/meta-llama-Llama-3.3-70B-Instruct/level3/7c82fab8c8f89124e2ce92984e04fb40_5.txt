This paper presents a novel approach to learning decision thresholds in the drift-diffusion model of perceptual decision making. The authors propose two distinct methods, REINFORCE and Bayesian optimization, to optimize the decision thresholds based on single-trial rewards derived from Wald's trial-averaged cost function. The paper is well-written, and the ideas are clearly presented, making it easy to follow.
The strengths of the paper include its originality, as it addresses a previously unknown problem of how animals learn decision thresholds. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the two learning methods, including their convergence properties, computational costs, and variances. The paper also provides a detailed comparison with experimental data from animal learning studies, which supports the REINFORCE method as a plausible model of animal learning.
The weaknesses of the paper include the high computational cost of the Bayesian optimization method, which may limit its applicability in practice. Additionally, the REINFORCE method, while more computationally efficient, requires a large number of trials to converge, which may not be feasible in all experimental settings.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors are careful in evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of their methods and provide a thorough discussion of the limitations and potential improvements.
The clarity of the paper is excellent, with clear and concise writing, making it easy to understand the main ideas and technical details. The organization of the paper is logical, and the figures and tables are well-designed and informative.
The originality of the paper is high, as it presents a novel approach to learning decision thresholds and provides a detailed analysis of two distinct learning methods. The significance of the paper is also high, as it addresses a fundamental problem in perceptual decision making and provides insights into the mechanisms of animal learning.
In terms of arguments for and against acceptance, the pros include:
* The paper presents a novel and original approach to learning decision thresholds.
* The authors provide a thorough analysis of two distinct learning methods.
* The paper provides a detailed comparison with experimental data from animal learning studies.
* The REINFORCE method is a plausible model of animal learning.
The cons include:
* The high computational cost of the Bayesian optimization method.
* The REINFORCE method requires a large number of trials to converge.
* The paper may benefit from additional experimental validation and comparison with other learning methods.
Overall, I recommend accepting the paper, as it presents a significant contribution to the field of perceptual decision making and provides insights into the mechanisms of animal learning.
