This paper presents a novel approach to machine translation, called dual-learning, which leverages monolingual data to improve translation models. The authors propose a two-agent game, where two translation models are trained to translate sentences from one language to another and back, with the goal of maximizing a reward function that measures the quality of the translations. The approach is based on reinforcement learning and uses policy gradient methods to update the model parameters.
The paper is well-written and clearly explains the proposed approach, including the mathematical formulations and the experimental settings. The authors also provide a thorough review of the related work and discuss the limitations of the current state-of-the-art methods.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel approach to machine translation that leverages monolingual data, which is a significant departure from the traditional supervised learning paradigm.
* The use of reinforcement learning and policy gradient methods to update the model parameters, which is a promising direction for machine translation.
* The thorough experimental evaluation, which includes comparisons with state-of-the-art baselines and an analysis of the results.
However, there are also some weaknesses:
* The paper lacks a sufficient review of previous work in this direction, which makes it difficult to understand the novelty and significance of the proposed approach.
* The experimental evaluation is limited to a single language pair (English-French), which makes it difficult to generalize the results to other languages and domains.
* The authors' conclusion that the model gives new directions for learning translation models from scratch from monolingual data is not fully supported by the experimental results, as the model still requires a warm-start with a pre-trained model.
* The extension to multiple languages in a translation chain is not straightforward, as the authors acknowledge, and requires further research.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria of quality, clarity, and originality. The paper is well-written, and the proposed approach is novel and significant. However, the paper could benefit from a more thorough review of previous work and a more extensive experimental evaluation.

Arguments con acceptance:
