This paper proposes a novel approach to offline handwriting recognition by modifying the popular MDLSTM-RNN architecture to enable end-to-end processing of handwritten paragraphs. The authors replace the traditional collapse layer with a recurrent attention mechanism, allowing the network to iteratively focus on individual text lines within the paragraph. This approach eliminates the need for explicit line segmentation, a crucial step in traditional handwriting recognition systems.
The paper is well-structured and clearly written, providing a thorough introduction to the background and related work in handwriting recognition. The authors motivate the advantages of their approach, including the ability to handle paragraphs without explicit segmentation and the potential for improved performance by capturing linguistic dependencies across text lines.
The technical contributions of the paper are significant, and the authors provide a detailed description of the proposed architecture and its components. The experimental results on two public databases (IAM and Rimes) demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, with error rates comparable to the state of the art.
The strengths of the paper include:
* A clear and well-motivated introduction to the problem and the proposed approach
* A thorough description of the technical contributions and the architecture of the proposed system
* Experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach on two public databases
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The lack of experimental results demonstrating the practical behavior of the proposed algorithms compared to existing systems
* The limited discussion of potential applications and the challenges of generalizing the approach to full documents
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of handwriting recognition, and the proposed approach has the potential to improve the performance and efficiency of handwriting recognition systems. However, further work is needed to demonstrate the practical effectiveness of the approach and to address the challenges of generalizing it to more complex documents.
