This paper proposes a novel algorithm, termed Truncated Generalized Gradient Flow (TGGF), for solving systems of quadratic equations, which is an important problem in signal processing. The algorithm proceeds in two stages: an orthogonality-promoting initialization and a refinement of the initial estimate by successive updates of truncated generalized gradient iterations. The authors introduce a new initialization procedure that avoids the shortcomings of previous spectral methods and shows advantages over previous ones in empirical studies. The paper also proposes an iterative truncated-generalized-gradient algorithm to refine the solution by minimizing a non-convex and non-smooth amplitude-based cost function, with a rigorous analysis of its convergence to the correct solution.
The algorithm is shown to be superior to state-of-the-art algorithms, reducing the number of equations needed to solve the problem and narrowing the gap towards the information-theoretic number of equations required. The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with convincing analysis and empirical results that are likely to play a significant role in future work in the field of phase retrieval problems.
The strengths of the paper include the novelty of the algorithm, the rigorous analysis of its convergence, and the impressive empirical results. The authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of the algorithm and its components, making it easy to understand and implement. The paper also provides a thorough comparison with state-of-the-art algorithms, demonstrating the superiority of TGGF.
The weaknesses of the paper are minor and include the lack of a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the algorithm and the potential limitations of the algorithm in certain scenarios. However, these weaknesses do not detract from the overall quality of the paper.
