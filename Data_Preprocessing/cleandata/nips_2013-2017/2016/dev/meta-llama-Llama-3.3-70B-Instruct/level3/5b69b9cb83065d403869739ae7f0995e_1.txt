This paper proposes a novel approach to improve Neural Machine Translation (NMT) systems using monolingual corpora and reinforcement learning. The authors introduce a dual-learning mechanism that enables an NMT system to automatically learn from unlabeled data through a dual-learning game. The game involves two agents, each representing a translation model, that teach each other through a reinforcement learning process. The feedback signals generated during this process are used to update the translation models, allowing them to improve over time.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the dual-learning mechanism and its application to NMT. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, showing significant improvements in translation accuracy compared to baseline models. The use of monolingual corpora to improve NMT systems is a promising direction, and this paper makes a valuable contribution to this area.
One potential weakness of the paper is that it does not introduce new machine learning concepts, but rather combines existing techniques in a novel way. However, the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through extensive experiments, which mitigates this concern.
The paper could be improved by addressing a few minor issues. For example, the authors discard sentences with unknown words, which could potentially be handled within the framework. Additionally, the formatting and citation style could be improved, with some repetition in tables and a lack of citation for published versions of arXiv papers.
Overall, the paper is well-structured, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their approach. The experimental results are impressive, and the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of NMT. The strengths of the paper include its novelty, clarity, and significance, while the weaknesses are minor and do not detract from the overall quality of the paper.
