This paper proposes a novel approach to visual question answering (VQA) by iteratively updating the question representation through interactions with image regions. The authors introduce a neural network-based reasoning model that utilizes object proposals to focus on relevant image regions and employs an attention mechanism to determine the relevance between the question and each image region.
The paper is well-structured and clearly written, making it easy to follow the authors' ideas. The introduction provides a good overview of the VQA problem and the challenges associated with it. The related work section is comprehensive, covering various approaches to VQA, including image captioning and question answering.
The authors' contributions are significant, as they propose a new approach to VQA that updates the question representation iteratively. The use of object proposals and attention mechanisms allows the model to focus on relevant image regions, which is essential for answering questions accurately. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance on two challenging VQA datasets, COCO-QA and VQA.
One of the strengths of the paper is its clarity and readability. The authors provide a detailed description of their model, including the architecture and the training process. The experimental results are well-presented, with tables and figures that help to illustrate the performance of the proposed approach.
However, there are some areas that require improvement. The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the results, including a discussion of the limitations of the proposed approach. Additionally, the authors could provide more insights into the attention mechanisms and how they contribute to the model's performance.
In terms of originality, the paper proposes a novel approach to VQA, which is a significant contribution to the field. The use of object proposals and attention mechanisms is not new, but the way they are combined in this paper is innovative. The paper also provides a comprehensive review of related work, which helps to situate the proposed approach within the broader context of VQA research.
The significance of the paper lies in its potential to improve the state-of-the-art in VQA. The proposed approach has the potential to be applied to other computer vision tasks, such as image captioning and visual grounding. The paper's results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, which could lead to further research in this area.
Overall, this paper is a significant contribution to the field of VQA, proposing a novel approach that achieves state-of-the-art performance on two challenging datasets. While there are areas for improvement, the paper is well-written, clear, and provides a comprehensive review of related work. The proposed approach has the potential to be applied to other computer vision tasks, making it a valuable contribution to the field.
