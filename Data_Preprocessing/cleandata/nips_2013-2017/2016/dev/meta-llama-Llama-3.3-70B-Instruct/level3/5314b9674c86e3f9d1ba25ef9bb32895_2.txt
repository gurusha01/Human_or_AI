This paper proposes Multimodal Residual Networks (MRN) for visual question-answering tasks, extending the idea of deep residual learning to multimodal inputs. The authors explore various alternative models and achieve state-of-the-art results on the Visual QA dataset for both Open-Ended and Multiple-Choice tasks. They also introduce a novel method to visualize the attention effect of joint residual mappings using back-propagation.
The idea of using tensor networks for machine learning is interesting, but the paper has several issues that prevent it from being published in its current form. The readability of the paper is hindered by a lack of explanation of tensor networks and MPS decomposition algorithms, which are unfamiliar to a machine learning audience. The notation used in the paper is heavy and difficult to follow, with unclear relationships between variables and undefined terms.
The experiments presented in the paper are weak, relying on a single dataset and lacking important details about the experimental setting. The choice of local feature map is crucial, but the paper does not provide clear guidance on how to select this map or the associated parameters. The uniqueness of the MPS decomposition and its impact on the learning process are unclear, and the paper does not adequately distinguish itself from existing work in the field.
The paper's quality is compromised by the lack of clarity and the weakness of the experiments. While the idea of using tensor networks for machine learning is novel, the paper does not provide sufficient evidence to support its claims. The paper's significance is also limited by the lack of comparison to other state-of-the-art methods and the limited scope of the experiments.
To improve the paper, the authors should provide a clear explanation of tensor networks and MPS decomposition algorithms, simplify the notation, and provide more details about the experimental setting. They should also conduct more extensive experiments, including comparisons to other state-of-the-art methods, and provide a more thorough analysis of the results. Additionally, the authors should explore the connection between ANOVA kernels and tensor network representations, which could provide an interesting area of study.
