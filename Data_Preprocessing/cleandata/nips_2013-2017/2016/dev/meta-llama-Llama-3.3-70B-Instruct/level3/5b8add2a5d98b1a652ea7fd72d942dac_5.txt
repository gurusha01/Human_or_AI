This paper proposes a novel approach to visual question-answering tasks by extending the concept of deep residual learning to multimodal inputs. The authors introduce Multimodal Residual Networks (MRN), which effectively learn joint representations from vision and language information. The key idea is to use element-wise multiplication for joint residual mappings, exploiting the residual learning of attentional models. The paper presents a well-structured and well-written contribution to the field, with impressive results on the Visual QA dataset for both Open-Ended and Multiple-Choice tasks.
The strengths of the paper include its ability to generalize deep residual learning to multimodal inputs, its novel approach to visualizing attention effects using back-propagation, and its state-of-the-art results on the Visual QA dataset. The authors provide a thorough analysis of their approach, including a comparison with alternative models and an exploration of the effects of various hyperparameters.
However, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement. The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the limitations of the approach and potential avenues for future work. Additionally, the authors should review the 4n-2 claim for the complex case on page 2 for potential improvements or corrections. Furthermore, the reference [22] is incomplete and should be updated to include the name(s) of the author(s) for proper citation.
