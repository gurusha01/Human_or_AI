This paper proposes a novel algorithm, termed Truncated Generalized Gradient Flow (TGGF), to solve systems of quadratic equations. The approach utilizes a two-stage process, consisting of an orthogonality-promoting initialization and a refinement of the initial estimate by successive updates of truncated generalized gradient iterations. The paper provides a well-written description of the methods and demonstrates good performance on public datasets.
The strengths of the paper include its ability to recover the solution exactly with high probability and complexity growing linearly with the time required to read the data. The numerical results demonstrate that TGGF outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms, such as Wirtinger Flow (WF) and Truncated Wirtinger Flow (TWF), in terms of accuracy and robustness. The paper also provides a detailed analysis of the algorithm's performance and convergence.
However, there are some weaknesses to the paper. The approach relies on a novel orthogonality-promoting initialization, which may not be intuitive to some readers. Additionally, the paper could benefit from more discussion on the semantic aspect of the approach and how it relates to previous work in the field. The paper also assumes that the system of equations has a unique solution, which may not always be the case in practice.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The paper is clearly written, and the organization is logical and easy to follow. The originality of the paper lies in its novel approach to solving systems of quadratic equations, which combines an orthogonality-promoting initialization with a truncated generalized gradient flow.
The significance of the paper is that it provides a new and efficient algorithm for solving systems of quadratic equations, which has many applications in various fields, such as phase retrieval and array imaging. The paper demonstrates that TGGF can achieve exact recovery with a near-optimal number of noise-free measurements and features a near-perfect statistical performance in the noisy setup.
