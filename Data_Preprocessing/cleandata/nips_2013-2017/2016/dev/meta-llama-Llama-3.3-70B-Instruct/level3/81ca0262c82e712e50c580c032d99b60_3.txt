This paper presents a novel approach to visual question answering (VQA) by iteratively updating the question representation through interactions with image regions. The proposed model, called QRU, consists of multiple reasoning layers that exploit complex visual relations in the VQA task. The authors evaluate their model on two challenging datasets, COCO-QA and VQA, and achieve state-of-the-art performance.
The strengths of this paper include its ability to focus on image regions relevant to the question, its use of object proposals to obtain candidate image regions, and its end-to-end trainability through back-propagation. The authors also provide a thorough analysis of their model's performance, including ablation studies and comparisons with other state-of-the-art models.
One of the weaknesses of this paper is that it does not provide a clear explanation of how the model's parameters are initialized and tuned. Additionally, the authors could have explored more applications of their model, such as using it for other computer vision tasks or evaluating its performance on larger datasets.
In terms of quality, the paper is well-written and easy to follow, with clear explanations of the model's architecture and experimental results. The authors also provide sufficient details about their implementation, including the use of pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and gated recurrent units (GRUs).
The originality of this paper lies in its novel approach to VQA, which combines the strengths of both computer vision and natural language processing. The authors' use of object proposals and attention mechanisms to focus on relevant image regions is also a significant contribution to the field.
The significance of this paper is evident in its potential to improve the performance of VQA systems, which have numerous applications in areas such as human-computer interaction, blind person assistance, and image retrieval. The authors' results demonstrate the effectiveness of their model in answering a wide range of questions, from simple object recognition to more complex queries that require common sense reasoning.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication, as it presents a significant contribution to the field of VQA and has the potential to inspire further research in this area. However, I would suggest that the authors provide more details about their model's initialization and tuning, as well as explore more applications of their model in future work.
