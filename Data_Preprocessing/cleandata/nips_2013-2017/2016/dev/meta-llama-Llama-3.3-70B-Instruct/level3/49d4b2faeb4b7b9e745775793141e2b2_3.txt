This paper proposes a novel approach to monocular depth estimation by training a neural network to predict probability distributions over local coefficients of the scene depth map in an overcomplete representation. The network's output is then used to estimate the scene depth map through an efficient globalization procedure. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on the NYU v2 depth benchmark, achieving state-of-the-art performance.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of their methodology. The use of an overcomplete representation and probabilistic predictions allows the network to effectively capture the ambiguity and uncertainty present in the depth cues. The globalization procedure is also efficient and effective in reconciling the local predictions to form a coherent estimate of the scene depth map.
The experimental results are impressive, with the proposed method outperforming other state-of-the-art approaches on most metrics. The ablation study provides valuable insights into the contribution of different components of the overcomplete representation, and the results suggest that the proposed method is robust and effective.
The paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of their work. The paper is also well-organized, and the writing is clear and concise.
In terms of originality, the paper proposes a novel approach to monocular depth estimation, and the use of an overcomplete representation and probabilistic predictions is a significant departure from previous work. The paper also provides a thorough review of related work, and the authors clearly demonstrate how their approach differs from and improves upon previous contributions.
The significance of the paper lies in its potential to advance the state of the art in monocular depth estimation, with applications in computer vision, robotics, and graphics. The proposed method is also likely to be useful in other settings, such as stereo reconstruction and motion estimation.
