This paper proposes a novel neural network-based reasoning model for visual question answering (VQA) tasks. The model iteratively updates the question representation by inferring image information through multiple reasoning layers, allowing it to focus on relevant image regions. The authors evaluate their model on two challenging VQA datasets, COCO-QA and VQA, and achieve state-of-the-art performance.
The strengths of this paper include its ability to update question representation and infer image regions relevant to the question, which is a key challenge in VQA tasks. The use of object proposals and attention mechanisms allows the model to focus on important regions of the image, leading to improved performance. The authors also provide a thorough analysis of their model's performance, including ablation studies and comparisons with state-of-the-art models.
However, there are some weaknesses in the paper. The authors do not provide a clear justification for the use of multiple reasoning layers, and the model's performance may be sensitive to the number of layers used. Additionally, the model's ability to count objects is weakened due to the use of object proposals, which may contain multiple objects. The authors also do not provide a detailed analysis of the model's performance on different question types, which would be useful for understanding its strengths and weaknesses.
In terms of quality, the paper is well-written and easy to follow, with clear explanations of the model and its components. The authors provide a thorough analysis of their model's performance, including experimental results and visualizations of attention masks. However, the paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the model's limitations and potential areas for improvement.
The originality of the paper lies in its use of multiple reasoning layers and attention mechanisms to update question representation and infer image regions. While the idea of using neural networks for VQA tasks is not new, the authors' approach is novel and achieves state-of-the-art performance.
The significance of the paper lies in its ability to improve performance on VQA tasks, which has many potential applications in areas such as image retrieval, human-computer interaction, and blind person assistance. The authors' model has the potential to be used in a variety of real-world applications, and its performance could be further improved with additional research and development.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication, as it presents a novel and effective approach to VQA tasks and achieves state-of-the-art performance. However, the authors could benefit from addressing some of the weaknesses mentioned above, such as providing a clearer justification for the use of multiple reasoning layers and analyzing the model's performance on different question types.
