This paper proposes a novel approach to monocular depth estimation by training a neural network to predict distributional parameters over the derivatives of the depth map. The method uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to regress distributional parameters, which is an interesting contribution. The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the NYU v2 depth dataset, outperforming competing methods.
The strengths of the paper include its ability to effectively characterize local geometric structure in images, and its efficient globalization procedure for estimating the depth map. The use of a neural network to predict distributional parameters is also a significant contribution, as it allows the model to express confidence and ambiguity in its predictions.
However, there are some limitations to the approach. The method relies heavily on the globalization procedure, which may be a disadvantage compared to competing approaches that simultaneously address multiple tasks with a single network architecture. Additionally, the paper notes that the network has low-confidence regions in estimated individual coefficients, which may affect the accuracy of the final depth map.
The paper is well-written and clearly organized, making it easy to follow and understand. The authors provide a thorough review of related work and clearly explain their approach and its contributions. The experimental results are also well-presented, with a detailed analysis of the method's performance on the NYU v2 depth dataset.
One concern is the errors depicted in Figure 3, which show vertical high-frequency stripes in the estimated depth map. The authors should provide further comment on the particularities of these patterns and how they affect the overall performance of the method.
