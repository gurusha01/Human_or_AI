This paper proposes two methods, REINFORCE and Bayesian optimization, to learn the optimal threshold in decision-making tasks under uncertainty, which is equivalent to determining the proper threshold in the drift-diffusion model. The authors highlight an important problem and present their ideas clearly. However, the current models only handle the Bayes risk and do not account for the biological cost of observing and accumulating evidence.
The paper lacks a biologically plausible implementation of the proposed methods. The reviewer questions how to incorporate the cost of observing into the methods for learning the threshold, referencing relevant research by Drugowitsch et al (2012). This is a significant limitation of the paper, as it does not provide a complete solution to the problem.
Despite this limitation, the paper has some strengths. The authors propose a novel approach to learning the optimal threshold, and their methods show promise in simulations. The paper is well-organized and easy to follow, making it a pleasure to read.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets some of the criteria. The paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of their work. However, the paper could be improved in terms of clarity, as some of the notation and terminology may be unfamiliar to non-experts.
The paper also meets some of the criteria for originality. The problems and approaches are new, and the paper provides a novel combination of familiar techniques. However, the paper could be improved in terms of significance, as the results may not be important or relevant to a wide range of researchers or practitioners.
Overall, the paper has some strengths and weaknesses. While it proposes a novel approach to learning the optimal threshold, it lacks a biologically plausible implementation and does not account for the biological cost of observing and accumulating evidence. With some revisions to address these limitations, the paper could be a strong contribution to the field.
