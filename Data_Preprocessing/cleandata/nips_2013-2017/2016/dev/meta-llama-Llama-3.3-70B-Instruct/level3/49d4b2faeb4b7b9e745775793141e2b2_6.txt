This paper proposes a novel approach to monocular depth estimation by training a neural network to predict distributions over coefficients of a scene depth map in an overcomplete representation. The network outputs a set of distributions for each coefficient, allowing it to express confidence and ambiguity about its predictions. The authors then employ a globalization procedure to combine these local distributions and estimate the scene depth map.
The paper is well-written, with clear and easy-to-follow claims, explanations, and derivations. The authors provide a thorough review of related work and demonstrate the efficacy of their approach through evaluation on the NYU v2 depth dataset. The results show that their method achieves state-of-the-art performance on most metrics, and the authors provide a detailed analysis of the contributions of different components of their overcomplete representation.
The strengths of this paper include its novel approach to monocular depth estimation, its thorough evaluation, and its well-organized and clear writing style. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the results and discuss the potential applications of their approach in other settings.
One potential weakness of the paper is that it may be challenging to reproduce the results, as the authors use a complex neural network architecture and a large dataset. However, the authors provide the source code and a pre-trained network model, which should facilitate reproduction.
In terms of the conference guidelines, this paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, originality, and significance. The paper is technically sound, with well-supported claims and a thorough evaluation. The writing is clear and well-organized, making it easy to follow and understand.
