This paper proposes a novel approach to monocular depth estimation by predicting filter-bank response coefficients of the depth map instead of directly fitting the depth map. The method is technically sound and novel, but I have concerns about its significance and why it was chosen over other methods. 
The paper presents a general modeling and inference framework that combines the strengths of probabilistic graphical models and deep learning methods. The proposed Structured Variational Autoencoder (SVAE) model class is a broad family of models that can be used for various tasks, including image and video modeling. The SVAE algorithm is a generalization of both the natural gradient SVI algorithm for conditionally conjugate models and the AEVB algorithm for variational autoencoders.
The experiments demonstrate the ability of the SVAE to learn feature representations and latent structure on both synthetic and real data. The results show that the SVAE can accurately represent images and make long-term predictions with uncertainty. The use of natural gradient updates provides optimization advantages, allowing the model to learn faster and be less dependent on parameterization details.
However, I question the importance of fitting the coefficient of filter-bank responses and whether it brings any visual or geometric benefits over directly fitting the depth map. I am also unsure about the choice of handcrafted Gaussian filters and why they are used instead of learning them in an end-to-end manner. Furthermore, I doubt that the indirect regression approach may hurt the performance in terms of RMSE since the model is not optimized to minimize such a loss.
To prove the effectiveness of the proposed method, I suggest a baseline comparison with a method that fits the depth using a loss function based on coefficient similarity between filter responses. This would help to evaluate the significance of the proposed approach and its advantages over other methods.
Overall, the paper is well-written and presents a novel approach to monocular depth estimation. However, I have some concerns about the significance and effectiveness of the proposed method, and I expect the author's rebuttal to address these concerns.
