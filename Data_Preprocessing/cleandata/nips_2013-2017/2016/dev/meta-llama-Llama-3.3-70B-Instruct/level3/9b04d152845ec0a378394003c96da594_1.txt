This paper proposes a novel approach to visual question-answering tasks by introducing Multimodal Residual Networks (MRN), which combines the strengths of deep residual learning and multimodal fusion of language and visual features. The authors' use of multiplicative interactions to combine visual features with word embeddings is a key novelty, contributing to state-of-the-art results on the Visual QA dataset for both Open-Ended and Multiple-Choice tasks.
The paper is well-structured, and the authors provide a clear explanation of their methodology, including the architecture of MRN and the visualization technique used to illustrate the attention effects of the joint residual mappings. The experimental results are thorough, with a comprehensive comparison to other state-of-the-art methods.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to achieve impressive results on standard benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the alternative models explored, which helps to justify the design choices made in the final model.
However, one limitation of the paper is its reliance on many pre-trained models and embeddings, which may limit the generality of the approach. A more in-depth analysis of the effects of these pre-trained models on the overall performance of MRN would strengthen the paper.
Additionally, the paper could benefit from reproducing equations from other papers, rather than referencing them, to enhance clarity and readability. This would allow readers to more easily follow the mathematical derivations and understand the underlying concepts.
I also have a question regarding the potential impact of using sigmoid(W_q*q) as the attentional mask for visualization in section 5.2. The authors assume that this term can be seen as a masking vector to select a part of visual information, but it is not clear how this assumption affects the overall performance of the model. Further exploration of this approach would be beneficial to fully understand its implications.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of visual question-answering, and the results are impressive. With some minor revisions to address the limitations mentioned above, the paper has the potential to be a strong contender for acceptance.
