This paper proposes a novel approach to training machine translation systems using monolingual data, framed as a communication game similar to autoencoders. The authors introduce a dual-learning mechanism, where two agents represent the models for the primal and dual tasks, and teach each other through a reinforcement learning process. The approach is simple and easy to understand, and the experimental results show promise, especially in reducing the requirement for parallel bilingual data.
The paper is well-organized, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the dual-learning mechanism and its application to neural machine translation. The use of reinforcement learning to improve the translation models is a key contribution of the paper. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, with significant improvements in translation accuracy, especially when using only 10% of the bilingual data for warm-starting the training process.
However, there are some areas that require improvement. The paper's explanation is sometimes repetitive, and more thorough empirical analysis is needed to fully understand the benefits and limitations of the approach. The experiments leave many questions unanswered, such as the specific aspects of system performance that are improved through this training method, including vocabulary, word choice, or word order.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of the work. The paper is clearly written, and the organization is logical and easy to follow. The authors provide enough information for the expert reader to reproduce the results.
The originality of the paper is high, as it proposes a novel approach to training machine translation systems using monolingual data. The paper builds on previous work in machine translation and reinforcement learning, but the combination of these techniques is new and innovative. The significance of the paper is also high, as it addresses a difficult problem in machine translation and provides a promising solution.
