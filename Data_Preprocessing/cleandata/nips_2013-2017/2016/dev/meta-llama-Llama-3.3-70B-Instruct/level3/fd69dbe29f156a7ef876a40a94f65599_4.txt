This paper proposes a method for visual question answering (VQA) using neural reasoners and object detection as facts to answer questions. The approach shows some promise, but its performance does not match the current state-of-the-art. The method is derived from a neural reasoning system previously developed for text-based QA, with minor novelty as it only uses objects in the image as facts instead of textual facts.
The use of object detection boxes alone may not provide enough facts to answer questions, particularly for counting questions or those seeking information near objects. Furthermore, the paper lacks ablation studies to prove the effectiveness of including facts in the reasoning system. The attention map is produced on top-ranked image regions without knowledge of the question, which may not be optimal.
The updated question representation may not necessarily ask about the same entity as the original question, and the method used to assess its efficacy is dubious. While the paper is well-written, the general applicability of the work in its current form is low due to limited innovation and inadequate image-based fact generation.
The visual facts need to be question-specific and more detailed to offer a better basis for reasoning. Ablation studies are necessary to demonstrate the explicit efficacy of the proposed work. The paper's strengths include its ability to focus on image regions relevant to the question and its end-to-end trainable architecture. However, its weaknesses, such as limited innovation and inadequate fact generation, outweigh its strengths.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel approach to VQA using neural reasoners and object detection.
* The method shows some promise in its ability to focus on image regions relevant to the question.
* The paper is well-written and easy to follow.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The paper's performance does not match the current state-of-the-art.
* The method lacks novelty, as it is derived from a previously developed neural reasoning system.
* The paper lacks ablation studies to prove the effectiveness of including facts in the reasoning system.
* The visual facts are not question-specific and may not provide enough information to answer questions.
Overall, while the paper shows some promise, its limitations and lack of innovation make it a borderline acceptance. With additional ablation studies and improvements to the fact generation process, the paper could be more competitive.
