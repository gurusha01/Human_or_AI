This paper proposes a novel approach to monocular depth estimation by training a neural network to predict distributions over coefficients of the depth map in an overcomplete representation. The network outputs a set of distributions for each coefficient, allowing it to express confidence and ambiguity about its predictions. The authors then employ a globalization procedure to combine these local distributions and estimate the scene depth map.
The paper is well-written and clearly explains the proposed approach, including the architecture of the neural network and the globalization method. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the NYU v2 depth benchmark. The authors also provide a thorough analysis of the contributions of different components of their overcomplete representation and the accuracy of their method.
The strengths of the paper include its novelty, clarity, and significance. The proposed approach is a significant departure from previous methods, which typically regress directly to depth values or use conditional random fields to smooth neural estimates. The use of an overcomplete representation and distributional outputs allows the network to effectively capture the ambiguity and uncertainty in the depth cues present in a single image.
However, there are some weaknesses to the paper. The experimental section could be improved with more side-by-side comparisons for qualitative results, and the distinction between the supplementary material and the actual paper submission is unclear. Additionally, the quality of Figure 1 is poor, which may make it difficult for readers to understand the architecture of the neural network.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, originality, and significance. The paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The writing is clear, and the organization is logical and easy to follow. The approach is novel and significant, and the results are important and likely to be used by other researchers or practitioners.
