This paper proposes a novel approach to offline handwriting recognition by modifying the popular Multi-Dimensional Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks (MDLSTM-RNNs) to enable end-to-end processing of handwritten paragraphs. The authors replace the traditional collapse layer with a recurrent attention mechanism, allowing the network to iteratively focus on individual text lines within a paragraph. This approach eliminates the need for explicit line segmentation, which is a crucial step in traditional handwriting recognition systems.
The paper is well-structured and clearly written, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments and understand the proposed methodology. The authors provide a thorough review of related work, highlighting the limitations of existing approaches and motivating the need for a new approach. The experimental results are impressive, with the proposed model achieving competitive performance with state-of-the-art systems on two public databases, IAM and Rimes.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to handle variable-length paragraphs and implicit line segmentation, which is a significant improvement over traditional methods. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the results, discussing the impact of the attention mechanism and the decoder on the performance of the model.
However, there are some areas that require further improvement. The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with existing methods, particularly in terms of computational efficiency and scalability. Additionally, the authors could provide more insights into the interpretability of the attention mechanism and its potential applications in other domains.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of the work. The paper is also well-organized, and the writing is clear and concise.
The originality of the paper lies in its novel approach to offline handwriting recognition, which combines the strengths of MDLSTM-RNNs with the flexibility of attention mechanisms. The paper provides a significant contribution to the field, demonstrating the potential of end-to-end handwriting recognition systems.
The significance of the paper is evident in its ability to advance the state of the art in handwriting recognition. The proposed model has the potential to be applied in various real-world scenarios, such as document analysis and recognition, and could have a significant impact on the development of more efficient and accurate handwriting recognition systems.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, as it provides a significant contribution to the field of handwriting recognition and demonstrates the potential of end-to-end systems. However, I would suggest that the authors address the minor remarks and typos mentioned in the review and provide more insights into the interpretability and scalability of the proposed model.
