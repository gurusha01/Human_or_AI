This paper presents a novel framework for combining probabilistic graphical models and deep learning methods, referred to as the Structured Variational Autoencoder (SVAE). The SVAE model uses graphical models to represent structured probability distributions and variational autoencoder ideas to learn nonlinear data manifolds, allowing for tractable graphical model inference algorithms. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of the SVAE model on both synthetic and real datasets, including a latent linear dynamical system (LDS) SVAE to predict trajectory and a latent switching linear dynamical system (SLDS) SVAE to learn discrete states corresponding to natural behavioral units.
The paper's main contribution is its ability to account for discrete latent variables, making it a promising area of research with potential applications in behavior representation modeling. The organization of the paper is excellent, but the technical part is dense, and some symbols in Algorithm 1 are not clearly defined, making it hard to follow. Additionally, the paper lacks comparison to existing baselines, except for a "toy" example, making it difficult to evaluate the model's performance and advantages of "structured" representations.
The explanation of Section 6.3 and Figure 6 is insufficient, particularly regarding the identification of discrete latent behavioral states and their semantic meaning. However, the paper provides a good foundation for future research in this area, and the authors have made their code available, which is a significant contribution to the community.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of the work. The paper is clearly written, well-organized, and provides enough information for the expert reader to reproduce the results.
The originality of the paper is high, as it combines familiar techniques in a novel way. The related work section is thorough, and the authors have adequately referenced previous contributions. The significance of the paper is also high, as it addresses a difficult problem in a better way than previous research and advances the state of the art in a demonstrable way.
