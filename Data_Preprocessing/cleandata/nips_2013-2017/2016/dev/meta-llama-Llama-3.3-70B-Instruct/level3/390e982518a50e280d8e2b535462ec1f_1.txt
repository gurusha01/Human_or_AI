This paper proposes a novel approach to learning from graph-structured data by introducing diffusion-convolutional neural networks (DCNNs). The method combines multiple graph kernels with a diffusion-convolutional neural net to learn weights from data, addressing a significant problem of learning kernels from graph labels that has not been comprehensively addressed in the literature.
The paper is well-organized and clearly written, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments. The introduction provides a clear motivation for the work, and the related work section provides a thorough overview of existing approaches to graph-based neural networks, probabilistic relational models, and kernel methods.
The technical contributions of the paper are significant, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the DCNN model, including the diffusion-convolution operation and the learning procedure. The experiments presented in the paper are informative and comprehensive, providing valuable insights into the performance of DCNNs on node and graph classification tasks.
However, there are some areas where the paper could be improved. The authors could provide more clarity in defining certain terms, such as the power spectrum P star and the hop, which may confuse the average reader. Additionally, the paper could benefit from more detailed analysis of the results, particularly in the graph classification experiments, where the performance of DCNNs is not as strong as in the node classification experiments.
Overall, the strengths of the paper include:
* A novel and well-motivated approach to learning from graph-structured data
* A clear and concise explanation of the technical contributions
* Informative and comprehensive experiments
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* Lack of clarity in defining certain terms
* Limited analysis of the results, particularly in the graph classification experiments
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel and well-motivated approach to learning from graph-structured data
* The technical contributions are significant and well-explained
* The experiments are informative and comprehensive
Arguments against acceptance:
* The paper could benefit from more clarity in defining certain terms
* The analysis of the results could be more detailed, particularly in the graph classification experiments
