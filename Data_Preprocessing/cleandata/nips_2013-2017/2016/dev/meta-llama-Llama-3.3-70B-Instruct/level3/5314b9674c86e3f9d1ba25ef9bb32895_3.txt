This paper proposes a novel approach to visual question-answering tasks by introducing Multimodal Residual Networks (MRN), which extends the idea of deep residual learning to multimodal inputs. The authors effectively learn joint representations from vision and language information using element-wise multiplication, addressing the bottleneck issue of attention networks. The paper presents a clear and well-organized structure, with a thorough introduction to the background and related work.
The strengths of the paper include its ability to achieve state-of-the-art results on the Visual QA dataset for both Open-Ended and Multiple-Choice tasks. The authors also introduce a novel method to visualize the attention effect of joint residual mappings, which provides a higher resolution than other works. The use of element-wise multiplication as an implicit attention mechanism is an interesting and innovative approach.
However, there are some areas that require improvement. The presentation in sections 5 and 7 could be clarified, particularly with regards to tensor approximation and open problems related to regularization. The authors' approach to controlling the rank of the tensor through SVD truncation operations is noted, but further explanation is needed on how this implicitly addresses regularization. Additionally, the reviewer questions why the method proposed in [15] cannot be directly applied to solve the linear system, and seeks clarification on what differentiates this paper's problem.
The paper could also benefit from more detail on how \tilde{\Phi}_n is obtained from the given data, and an explanation of the "leading-order update" in equations 7-8. An algorithm should be added to the paper to clearly outline the step-by-step process for obtaining the solution B from the training data. Furthermore, the features in equation 3 resemble Fourier features, which are also used in large-scale problems beyond images, and the authors could explore this connection further.
Overall, the paper presents a strong and interesting approach to visual question-answering tasks, but requires some improvements in presentation and clarification of certain concepts. The pros of accepting this paper include its novelty, state-of-the-art results, and potential impact on the field. The cons include the need for clarification and improvement in certain areas, but these can be addressed through revisions.
