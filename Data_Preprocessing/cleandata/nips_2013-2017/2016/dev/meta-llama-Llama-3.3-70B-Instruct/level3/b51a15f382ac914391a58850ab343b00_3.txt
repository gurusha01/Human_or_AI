This paper proposes a novel approach to offline handwriting recognition by modifying the popular MDLSTM-RNN architecture to enable end-to-end processing of handwritten paragraphs. The authors replace the traditional collapse layer with a recurrent attention mechanism, allowing the network to iteratively focus on individual text lines within the paragraph. This approach eliminates the need for explicit line segmentation, which is a crucial step in traditional handwriting recognition systems.
The proposed model, termed PEGE, has several advantages over previous methods. It does not require an oracle for the second-best solution, nor does it require uniqueness of the optimal solution. Additionally, the regret of PEGE does not depend on the size of the action set. However, PEGE also has some limitations, including the need for distribution-dependent conditions for parameter setting and a worse dependence on time horizon and parameter h.
To address the issue with parameter h, the authors propose another algorithm, PEGE2. While PEGE2 improves upon PEGE in some aspects, it has its own shortcomings, including not guaranteeing distribution-dependent bounds in every case. The results presented in the paper are interesting additions to the knowledge of combinatorial partial monitoring problems, but may not lead to an effective solution due to weak distribution-dependent bounds.
The paper could benefit from a formal presentation of the protocol, explicit notation, and clarification of certain remarks and citations. Furthermore, the comparison of the obtained results to existing methods in online ranking is unclear and requires further explanation. Overall, the paper presents a novel approach to offline handwriting recognition, but its limitations and potential improvements need to be carefully considered.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors are careful in evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of their work. The paper is clearly written, well-organized, and provides enough information for the expert reader to reproduce the results. The originality of the paper lies in its novel approach to offline handwriting recognition, and the significance of the results is evident in the potential applications of the proposed model. However, the paper could benefit from more detailed comparisons to existing methods and a more thorough discussion of the limitations and potential improvements of the proposed approach.
