This paper proposes a novel approach to monocular depth estimation by training a neural network to predict distributions over coefficients of a scene depth map in an overcomplete representation. The network outputs a set of distributions for each coefficient, allowing it to express confidence and ambiguity about its predictions. The authors then employ a globalization procedure to combine these local distributions and estimate the scene depth map.
The paper is well-written and clearly explains the proposed approach, including the neural network architecture and the globalization procedure. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the method's performance on the NYU v2 depth dataset, including an ablation study to evaluate the contribution of different components of the overcomplete representation.
The strengths of the paper include its originality and the quality of the results. The proposed approach is a significant departure from previous methods, which typically regress directly to depth values or use conditional random fields to smooth neural estimates. The authors demonstrate that their method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the NYU v2 dataset, outperforming other recent approaches.
However, there are some weaknesses to the paper. One limitation is that the authors do not provide a detailed analysis of the failure cases, such as the example in column 6 of Figure 4, where the method mis-estimates the depth of a texture-less planar region. Additionally, the authors could provide more insight into the convergence of the globalization procedure and the choice of hyperparameters, such as the learning rate schedule and the number of iterations.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, and originality. The authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the proposed approach, and the results are well-supported by experimental evaluations. The paper is also well-organized and easy to follow, making it accessible to a broad audience.
