This paper proposes a novel model, diffusion-convolutional neural networks (DCNNs), for learning representations of graph-structured data. The model is designed to capture local behavior in graphs by learning a representation that encapsulates the results of graph diffusion. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of DCNNs on node classification tasks, outperforming probabilistic relational models and kernel methods. However, the results on graph classification tasks are less impressive, and the authors acknowledge the need for future work to improve performance on these tasks.
The paper is well-organized, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the model and its components. The experiments are thorough, and the results are well-presented. However, there are some areas where the paper could be improved. The related work section is under-developed, with too few links to previous work in hierarchical reinforcement learning, goal recognition, and trajectory planning. Additionally, the paper lacks clarity in some areas, with unclear notations, confusing terminology, and unclear explanations of certain equations and concepts.
The methodology used in the paper is sound, but there are some concerns. The assumption of relatively static macro-goals may not always hold, and the prediction of attention masks may not be accurate in all cases. Furthermore, the potential for unrealistic situations during extrapolation is a concern. To address these concerns, the authors could provide more detailed explanations of their methodology and consider additional experiments to validate their results.
Overall, this paper presents a novel and interesting approach to learning representations of graph-structured data. While there are some areas for improvement, the paper demonstrates the potential of DCNNs for node classification tasks and provides a foundation for future work on graph classification tasks. To improve the paper, the authors should address the clarity issues, provide clearer motivations and evaluations, and consider making the data public with clear quantitative benchmarks.
