This paper proposes a novel approach to learning decision thresholds in the drift-diffusion model of perceptual decision making. The authors introduce two distinct methods, REINFORCE and Bayesian optimization, to optimize the decision thresholds based on single-trial rewards derived from Wald's trial-averaged cost function. The paper provides a thorough analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of each method, including their convergence rates, variability, and computational costs.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the background and methods. The results are presented in a logical and easy-to-follow manner, and the discussion provides a thoughtful analysis of the implications of the findings. The paper also includes a detailed comparison with experimental data from animal learning studies, which adds to the paper's significance and relevance.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to bridge the gap between theoretical models of decision making and empirical data from animal learning studies. The authors demonstrate that the REINFORCE method, in particular, provides a plausible model of animal learning, and the results are consistent with experimental data from rodent and bat studies.
However, there are some limitations to the paper. The authors acknowledge that the Bayesian optimization method is computationally expensive and may not be suitable for large-scale applications. Additionally, the paper focuses primarily on the drift-diffusion model, and it is unclear how the results would generalize to other models of decision making.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, and originality. The paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The writing is clear and concise, and the paper is well-organized and easy to follow. The paper also presents a novel combination of familiar techniques, and the results are significant and relevant to the field.
