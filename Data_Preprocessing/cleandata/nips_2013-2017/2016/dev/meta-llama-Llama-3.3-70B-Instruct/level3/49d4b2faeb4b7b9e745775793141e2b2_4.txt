This paper proposes a novel approach to monocular depth estimation, which involves training a neural network to predict probability distributions over local coefficients of the scene depth map in an overcomplete representation. The network's output is then used to estimate the scene depth map through an efficient globalization procedure. The approach is evaluated on the NYU v2 depth benchmark, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of their approach. The use of an overcomplete representation and probabilistic predictions is a key innovation, allowing the network to effectively capture the ambiguity and uncertainty in the depth cues present in a single image. The globalization procedure is also efficient and effective, allowing the network's local predictions to be reconciled into a coherent estimate of the scene depth map.
The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, with the proposed method outperforming other state-of-the-art approaches on most metrics. The ablation study provides additional insight into the contribution of different components of the overcomplete representation, and the results suggest that the approach is robust and flexible.
The paper also provides a good review of related work, highlighting the key differences and similarities between the proposed approach and other methods. The authors demonstrate a clear understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of their approach, and provide a thoughtful discussion of the potential applications and limitations of their work.
