This paper proposes Multimodal Residual Networks (MRN) for visual question-answering tasks, extending the idea of deep residual learning to multimodal inputs. The authors explore various alternative models and propose a three-block layered MRN, which achieves state-of-the-art results on the Visual QA dataset for both Open-Ended and Multiple-Choice tasks. The paper also introduces a novel method to visualize the spatial attention effect from the collapsed visual features using back-propagation.
The strengths of this paper include its ability to effectively learn joint representations from vision and language information, and its achievement of state-of-the-art results on a challenging dataset. The proposed visualization method is also a significant contribution, as it provides a novel way to interpret the attention effect in multimodal models.
However, there are some weaknesses in the paper. The methodology assumes familiarity with deep residual learning and attentional models, which may not be common in the NIPS community. The paper could benefit from a better introduction to these concepts and more detailed explanations of the differences between the proposed work and prior work. Additionally, the paper lacks dimensions for vectors and matrices, which would improve readability. There is also a potential typo or incorrect figure reference in the description of the zig-zag ordering used in the paper.
The paper's quality is good, with well-supported claims and a complete piece of work. The clarity is fair, with some parts of the paper being well-organized and easy to follow, while others require more effort to understand. The originality of the paper is high, with a novel combination of familiar techniques and a significant contribution to the field. The significance of the paper is also high, with important results and a potential impact on the field of multimodal learning.
Arguments pro acceptance:
