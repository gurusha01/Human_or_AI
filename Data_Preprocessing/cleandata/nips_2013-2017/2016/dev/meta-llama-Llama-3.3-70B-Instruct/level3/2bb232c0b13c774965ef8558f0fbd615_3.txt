This paper proposes a novel approach to offline handwriting recognition, introducing an attention-based model that enables end-to-end processing of handwritten paragraphs without the need for explicit line segmentation. The authors modify the popular MDLSTM-RNN architecture by replacing the collapse layer with a recurrent attention network, allowing the model to iteratively focus on individual text lines. The experimental results on the Rimes and IAM datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms conventional two-step methods, even when using ground-truth line segmentation, and achieves competitive results with state-of-the-art line-level methods.
The paper is well-written and easy to understand, providing a clear explanation of the proposed model and its components. The authors also provide a thorough discussion of related work, highlighting the limitations of existing approaches and the advantages of their proposed method. The experimental evaluation is comprehensive, including comparisons with baseline models and state-of-the-art systems, as well as an analysis of the impact of different components, such as the decoder and line segmentation.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel attention-based model for end-to-end handwriting recognition, which has the potential to improve the accuracy and efficiency of handwriting recognition systems.
* The thorough experimental evaluation, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach and provides insights into its strengths and weaknesses.
* The clear and well-organized presentation, which makes the paper easy to follow and understand.
However, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement:
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the computational time and resources required by the proposed model, as well as a comparison with other state-of-the-art systems in terms of efficiency.
* The authors could provide more insights into the interpretability of the attention mechanism and the implicit line segmentation, which could help to better understand the strengths and limitations of the proposed approach.
* The paper could be improved by including more discussions on the potential applications and limitations of the proposed approach, as well as potential future directions for research and development.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of handwriting recognition, and the proposed attention-based model has the potential to improve the accuracy and efficiency of handwriting recognition systems. With some minor improvements and additional analysis, the paper could be even stronger and more impactful.
