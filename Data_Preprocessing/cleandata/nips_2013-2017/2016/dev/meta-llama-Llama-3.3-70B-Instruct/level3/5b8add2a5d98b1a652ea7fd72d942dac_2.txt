This paper proposes a novel algorithm, termed truncated generalized gradient flow (TGGF), to solve systems of quadratic equations. The algorithm consists of two stages: an orthogonality-promoting initialization and a refinement of the initial estimate by successive updates of truncated generalized gradient iterations. The paper provides a thorough analysis of the algorithm's performance, including its ability to recover the solution exactly with high probability and its computational complexity.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the algorithm and its underlying principles. The numerical results demonstrate the superior performance of TGGF over state-of-the-art algorithms, including Wirtinger flow (WF) and truncated Wirtinger flow (TWF). The paper also provides a detailed analysis of the algorithm's convergence and computational complexity.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to provide a near-optimal solution with a small number of measurements. The authors demonstrate that TGGF can achieve a success rate of over 50% when the number of measurements is as small as twice the number of unknowns, which is a significant improvement over existing algorithms.
However, one potential weakness of the paper is that the main result, Theorem 1, assumes noiseless measurements. It is unclear whether the algorithm can be generalized to accommodate noisy measurements, which is a common scenario in many applications. The authors provide some numerical results for noisy measurements, but a more thorough analysis of the algorithm's performance in this setting would be beneficial.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the algorithm and its analysis. The paper is well-organized, and the authors provide a detailed description of the numerical experiments and their results.
In terms of clarity, the paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the algorithm and its underlying principles. The paper includes a number of figures and tables that help to illustrate the results and make the paper more readable.
In terms of originality, the paper proposes a novel algorithm that builds on existing work in the field. The authors provide a clear explanation of how their algorithm differs from existing algorithms and demonstrate its superior performance through numerical experiments.
In terms of significance, the paper addresses an important problem in the field of signal processing and optimization. The algorithm has the potential to be applied to a wide range of applications, including phase retrieval and quadratic programming.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication. The paper provides a significant contribution to the field, and the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their algorithm through numerical experiments. However, I would suggest that the authors provide a more thorough analysis of the algorithm's performance in the presence of noisy measurements.
