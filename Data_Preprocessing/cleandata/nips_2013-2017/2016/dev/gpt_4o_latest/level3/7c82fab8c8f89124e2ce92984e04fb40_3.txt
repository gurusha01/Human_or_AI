This paper presents a significant extension of the selective inference framework to the group-sparse regression setting, building on the work of Loftus and Taylor (2015). The authors derive selective confidence intervals for the size of the projection in linear regression after variable selection, addressing a critical gap in the literature. Their key technical contribution lies in characterizing the exact distribution of the test statistic in the noncentral case, enabling inference on the magnitude of projections beyond null hypotheses. This work is particularly notable for its theoretical rigor and practical applicability to a broad class of group-sparse selection methods, including the group lasso, iterative hard thresholding (IHT), and forward stepwise regression.
The paper's strengths include its clear articulation of the challenges in selective inference for group-sparse settings and its innovative solution via the "truncated projection lemma." The authors' ability to derive the conditional distribution of the test statistic under noncentrality is a major technical achievement, and their demonstration of its application to real-world data (e.g., California health data) underscores the practical significance of their work. Furthermore, the numerical experiments convincingly illustrate the utility of the proposed methods, showing well-calibrated p-values and confidence intervals.
However, there are areas where the paper could be improved. First, while the conditional validity of the proposed confidence intervals is established, the reviewer raises concerns about their potential conservativeness. It would be valuable to explore whether these intervals are less conservative when considered unconditionally, as this could enhance their practical utility. Second, the clarity of the exposition could be improved in certain sections. For example, lines 59 and 132 would benefit from more precise wording to ensure accessibility to a broader audience. Additionally, while the authors provide a numerical approximation for the group lasso case, a deeper discussion of the computational trade-offs and potential limitations of this approach would strengthen the paper.
In terms of originality, the paper makes a substantial contribution by extending selective inference to group-sparse settings and addressing the noncentral case, which has not been previously explored in this depth. The work is well-situated within the existing literature, with appropriate references to foundational and related works.
Overall, this paper is a high-quality scientific contribution that advances the state of the art in selective inference for group-sparse regression. Its theoretical insights and practical tools are likely to be of significant interest to both researchers and practitioners. While some refinements could enhance clarity and address concerns about conservativeness, the paper's strengths far outweigh its weaknesses. I recommend acceptance, with minor revisions to address the points raised above.
