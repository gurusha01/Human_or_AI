This paper presents a novel approach to monocular depth estimation by combining convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) for local depth prediction with a globalization step for globally consistent depth estimation. The methodology involves using ConvNets to predict weights for coefficients represented as a mixture of univariate Gaussians, which are linked to depth via convolution with Gaussian derivative kernels. The optimization alternates between refining coefficients and depth iteratively, without imposing the planarity assumption often seen in similar methods. The authors demonstrate their approach on the NYU v2 dataset, achieving performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods.
Strengths
The paper is technically sound and well-structured, with clear explanations that make the methodology accessible to readers. The use of ConvNets to predict local outputs in the form of probabilistic distributions is a novel contribution, as is the avoidance of restrictive planarity assumptions in the globalization step. The iterative refinement process is well-motivated and efficiently implemented using Fourier-domain computations. The experimental results, while not surpassing state-of-the-art methods, are competitive and validate the proposed approach. The visualization of confidence maps and ablation studies provide valuable insights into the contributions of different components of the model. Furthermore, the authors highlight the potential for broader applications of their framework, such as stereo reconstruction and intrinsic image decomposition, which could inspire future research.
Weaknesses
While the use of ConvNets for local predictions is novel, the overall idea of combining local and global harmonization is not new and draws heavily from prior work (e.g., Chakrabarti et al., 2015). The performance on the NYU v2 dataset, while competitive, does not demonstrate a clear advantage over existing methods, limiting the immediate impact of the work. Additionally, the computational cost of the approach (24 seconds per image) is relatively high, which may hinder its applicability in real-time or resource-constrained scenarios. The paper could also benefit from a more detailed discussion of failure cases and limitations, as well as comparisons to methods that explicitly model planarity.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance
Pro:
- Novel use of ConvNets to predict probabilistic local outputs.
- Avoidance of planarity assumptions in the globalization step.
- Well-structured paper with clear explanations and thorough experiments.
- Potential for broader applications beyond monocular depth estimation.
Con:
- Limited novelty in the overall local-global harmonization framework.
- Performance is comparable but not superior to state-of-the-art methods.
- High computational cost limits practical applicability.
- Lack of detailed discussion on failure cases and limitations.
Recommendation
While the paper does not significantly advance the state of the art in terms of performance, its novel methodological contributions and potential for broader applications make it a valuable addition to the field. I recommend acceptance, with the suggestion that the authors address the computational cost and provide a more detailed discussion of limitations in the final version.
