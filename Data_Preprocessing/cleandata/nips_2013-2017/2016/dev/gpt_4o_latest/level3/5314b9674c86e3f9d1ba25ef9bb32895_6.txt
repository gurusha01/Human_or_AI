The paper presents an innovative approach to image classification by leveraging tensor networks, specifically matrix product states (MPS), to parameterize non-linear kernel learning models. The authors propose a novel method to approximate the weight vector \( W \) using tensor networks, bypassing the traditional kernel trick. This is achieved through a "sweeping" optimization algorithm inspired by the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm in physics, which minimizes a quadratic cost function. The proposed method is validated on the MNIST dataset, achieving a test error of less than 1% for a bond dimension of 120. The paper also provides an insightful discussion on the representational power and implicit feature selection enabled by the tensor network structure.
Strengths:  
The paper is technically sound and introduces a novel connection between tensor networks and machine learning, particularly for feature selection and classification tasks. The sweeping optimization algorithm is well-motivated and efficiently scales linearly with the training set size, addressing a key limitation of traditional kernel methods. The authors provide a clear and thorough explanation of the methodology, supported by tensor diagrams that enhance clarity. The experimental results on MNIST demonstrate the potential of the approach, achieving competitive accuracy with relatively small MPS bond dimensions. Additionally, the paper highlights the interpretability of the learned model, which is a valuable contribution to the field.
Weaknesses:  
The primary limitation of the paper lies in its experimental evaluation. The authors only test their approach on the MNIST dataset, which, while widely used, is not sufficient to demonstrate the generalizability of the method. Testing on more diverse datasets, such as CIFAR-10 or ImageNet, would provide stronger evidence of the method's robustness. Furthermore, the paper lacks a direct comparison with state-of-the-art algorithms, such as deep neural networks or other feature selection methods, which weakens the evaluation of its relative performance. While the sweeping algorithm is novel, the absence of standard optimization techniques like mini-batches or adaptive learning rates in the experiments may limit its practical applicability.
Recommendation:  
I recommend a weak accept for this paper. The proposed method is original and technically rigorous, with significant potential to inspire future research at the intersection of tensor networks and machine learning. However, the authors should expand their experimental evaluation to include additional datasets and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods. Incorporating these improvements would strengthen the paper's contribution and impact.
