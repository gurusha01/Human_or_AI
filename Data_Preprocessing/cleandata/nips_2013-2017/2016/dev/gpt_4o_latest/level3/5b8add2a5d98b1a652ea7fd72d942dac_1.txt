The paper presents a novel algorithm, Truncated Generalized Gradient Flow (TGGF), for solving random systems of quadratic equations, a problem of significant importance in signal processing and related fields. The authors propose a two-stage approach: an orthogonality-promoting initialization and iterative refinement using a truncated generalized gradient algorithm. This work addresses key challenges in non-convex optimization, particularly the shortcomings of spectral initialization methods and the complexity of minimizing non-smooth, amplitude-based cost functions.
The orthogonality-promoting initialization is a standout contribution, as it avoids the heavy-tailed distributions that degrade the performance of spectral methods. By leveraging the near-orthogonality of high-dimensional random vectors, the proposed initialization method provides more accurate and robust estimates, particularly when the number of measurements is small. Empirical results convincingly demonstrate its superiority over spectral and truncated spectral initialization methods. The iterative refinement stage employs a novel truncation rule that avoids spurious directions during optimization, ensuring convergence to the true solution. Rigorous theoretical analysis establishes exponential convergence under Gaussian design, provided the initialization is accurate, and the algorithm achieves near-optimal sample complexity.
The paper is technically sound, with claims supported by both theoretical proofs and extensive empirical validation. The authors demonstrate that TGGF outperforms state-of-the-art methods, such as Wirtinger Flow (WF) and Truncated Wirtinger Flow (TWF), in terms of sample complexity, accuracy, and computational efficiency. Notably, TGGF achieves exact recovery with as few as 3n measurements for real-valued problems, significantly reducing the sample complexity compared to WF and TWF.
Strengths of the paper include its clear motivation, rigorous analysis, and thorough empirical evaluation. The algorithm's scalability and reduced sample complexity make it a significant contribution to the field. The paper is well-written and effectively situates its contributions within the context of prior work.
However, there are minor issues that should be addressed. Potential corrections are needed in lines 133 and 152, and Equation 9 requires further clarification. Additionally, while the theoretical guarantees are strong, the paper could benefit from a discussion on potential limitations, such as the algorithm's performance under non-Gaussian designs or in the presence of significant noise.
Arguments for Acceptance:
1. The paper addresses a challenging and important problem in signal processing.
2. It introduces a novel and theoretically grounded algorithm with significant empirical improvements over state-of-the-art methods.
3. The orthogonality-promoting initialization and smart truncation rule are innovative and impactful contributions.
4. The paper is well-organized, clearly written, and provides sufficient detail for reproducibility.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
1. Minor corrections and clarifications are needed in specific parts of the manuscript.
2. The algorithm's applicability to non-Gaussian or highly noisy scenarios is not discussed.
In conclusion, this paper makes a substantial contribution to the field and is recommended for acceptance, provided the minor issues are addressed.
