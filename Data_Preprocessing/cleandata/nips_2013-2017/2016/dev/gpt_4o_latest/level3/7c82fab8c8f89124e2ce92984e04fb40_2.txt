The paper presents a framework for selective inference in group-sparse regression, focusing on constructing confidence intervals and p-values for groups of variables selected by algorithms like group lasso, iterative hard thresholding (IHT), and forward stepwise regression. The authors' main contribution lies in extending the selective inference framework to the group-sparse setting, introducing a "truncated projection lemma" that generalizes prior work by Loftus and Taylor (2015). This lemma enables inference on the magnitude of projections onto subspaces, allowing for hypothesis testing and confidence interval construction in a post-selection context. The paper also provides numerical experiments on simulated and real-world datasets to illustrate the utility of the proposed methods.
Strengths:
1. Significance: The paper addresses an important problem in group-sparse regression by providing tools for post-selection inference, which are crucial for understanding the uncertainty associated with selected groups of variables. The ability to compute confidence intervals in addition to p-values is a notable advancement over prior work.
2. Theoretical Contribution: The truncated projection lemma is a key technical result that extends the selective inference framework to the group-sparse setting. This is a meaningful contribution to the field.
3. Applicability: The framework is demonstrated on three widely used group-sparse algorithms, making it broadly applicable to practitioners.
4. Numerical Results: The experiments on simulated data and the California health dataset provide evidence of the method's practical utility and highlight differences in p-values across algorithms.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity: The paper is highly dense and difficult to read, which hinders understanding of the contributions. Key ideas, such as the construction of confidence intervals and the practical implications of the truncated projection lemma, are not explained intuitively or clearly.
2. Incremental Contribution: The novelty over Loftus and Taylor (2015) is not well-articulated. While the extension to confidence intervals is mentioned, the practical significance of this addition is not sufficiently emphasized or compared to existing methods.
3. Group Construction: In the California dataset example, the grouping strategy (expanding one variable into three using Legendre polynomials) is unclear and raises questions about its relevance and generalizability.
4. Algorithmic Explanation: The procedural details for implementing the framework are not presented in a clear, algorithmic format, making it challenging to reproduce the results or adapt the method to other settings.
5. Pre-constructed Groups: The pre-construction of groups for comparison purposes may limit the generality of the approach. Allowing algorithms to select groups dynamically could provide a more realistic evaluation.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:
- Pro: The paper provides a theoretically sound framework for selective inference in group-sparse regression, with potential applications in various domains. The truncated projection lemma is a valuable contribution.
- Con: The paper's clarity and accessibility are significant barriers to understanding its contributions. The incremental novelty over prior work and the practical implications of the results are not convincingly demonstrated.
Recommendation: While the paper has potential, its lack of clarity and the unclear incremental contribution over prior work make it difficult to recommend for acceptance in its current form. A major revision focusing on improving readability, clearly articulating the novelty, and addressing the concerns about group construction and algorithmic explanation is necessary.
