The paper presents a novel approach to monocular depth estimation by predicting distributional parameters of depth map derivatives using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The authors propose a two-stage framework: first, the network predicts probabilistic distributions for local depth derivatives, and second, a globalization step harmonizes these predictions to produce a coherent depth map. This method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on the NYU v2 dataset, outperforming competing approaches trained on the same dataset, though it falls slightly short of methods utilizing additional supervision.
Strengths:  
The paper introduces an innovative use of CNNs to regress distributional parameters for depth estimation, which is a technically sound and meaningful contribution. Unlike prior work that directly regresses depth values, the authors adopt an overcomplete representation of depth derivatives, allowing the network to express uncertainty in its predictions. This probabilistic framework is well-motivated and supported by experimental results. The globalization step, which maximizes the likelihood of the depth map under the predicted distributions, is an effective way to reconcile local predictions. The approach is sufficiently distinct from prior work, such as Chakrabarti et al. (CVPR 2015), justifying its publication. The authors also provide a thorough evaluation on the NYU v2 dataset, demonstrating the efficacy of their method. The ablation study further highlights the contribution of each component of their approach.
Weaknesses:  
One concern is the reliance on the globalization step, which is a separate and independent stage from the network. This dependency raises questions about whether the network alone captures sufficient depth information. Additionally, the network's local predictions exhibit low confidence in certain regions, likely due to its independent application to local patches. This limitation could potentially be addressed by integrating local estimation and global harmonization into a single network, as done in competing approaches like Eigen and Fergus (ICCV 2015). Furthermore, the paper lacks clarity in some areas, such as the elliptical shapes from Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) and vertical high-frequency stripes in Figure 3, which require further explanation.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:  
- Pro: The paper introduces a novel and technically sound approach to depth estimation, with significant differences from prior work. The probabilistic framework and globalization step are innovative and effective.  
- Con: The reliance on a separate globalization step and low-confidence regions in local predictions are notable limitations. The clarity of some visualizations and explanations could be improved.
Recommendation:  
Overall, the paper is a strong contribution to the field of monocular depth estimation. While there are areas for improvement, the novelty and technical rigor of the approach outweigh the weaknesses. I recommend acceptance, with minor revisions to address clarity and explore the integration of local and global stages in future work.
