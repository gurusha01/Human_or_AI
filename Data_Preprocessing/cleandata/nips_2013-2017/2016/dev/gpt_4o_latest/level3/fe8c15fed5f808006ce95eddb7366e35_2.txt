The paper presents a hierarchical trajectory planning model (HPN) for long-term spatiotemporal trajectory prediction, applied to basketball gameplay. The model innovatively combines a macro-planner for high-level goals and a micro-planner for fine-grained actions, integrated via an attention mechanism that maps macro-goals to action distributions. The authors argue that this hierarchical approach addresses the limitations of conventional single-scale policy learning methods, particularly in high-dimensional, long-term planning tasks. The model is trained in a multi-stage process, where macro- and micro-planners are trained separately before fine-tuning the entire network. Experimental results demonstrate that HPN generates more realistic trajectories than non-hierarchical baselines, as evaluated through visual analysis, human preference studies, and benchmark experiments.
Strengths
1. Novelty and Technical Contribution: The hierarchical decomposition of macro-goals and micro-actions, combined with an attention mechanism, is a compelling innovation. This approach aligns with prior work on hierarchical policies but extends it by learning from expert demonstrations in a dynamic, non-Markovian environment.
2. Empirical Validation: The paper includes a diverse set of evaluations, such as visual trajectory analysis, human preference studies, and benchmark experiments. The preference study, in particular, adds a qualitative dimension to the evaluation, showing that experts find HPN-generated trajectories realistic.
3. Clarity of Model Design: The hierarchical policy network is well-motivated and clearly described, with detailed explanations of the attention mechanism and multi-stage training process.
4. Potential Impact: The model addresses a challenging problem in trajectory prediction, with potential applications in sports analytics, robotics, and other domains requiring long-term planning.
Weaknesses
1. Title Misleading: The title references a "memory network," but the model does not explicitly incorporate memory mechanisms beyond GRU cells. A more accurate title would focus on the hierarchical and attention-based aspects of the model.
2. Experimental Design Limitations: The assumption that other players remain stationary during rollouts is unrealistic and may bias the results. This limitation weakens the generalizability of the conclusions.
3. Training Methodology: The paper does not compare the proposed multi-stage training approach with end-to-end training, leaving open questions about the relative benefits of the chosen methodology.
4. Action Space Design: The use of a discrete 17x17 action space is not well-justified. Continuous or polar coordinate representations could simplify training and potentially improve performance.
5. Baseline Comparisons: Table 2 lacks key baselines, such as "random" or "keep moving in the same direction," which would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance.
6. Clarity Issues: The sub-sampling frequency and frame references are inconsistent, making it difficult to reproduce the results. Additionally, the term "95% statistically significant" is imprecise and should be rephrased.
Arguments for Acceptance
- The hierarchical model and attention mechanism represent a significant methodological advancement.
- The results demonstrate clear improvements over non-hierarchical baselines in generating realistic trajectories.
- The paper addresses a challenging and impactful problem, with potential for broader applications.
Arguments Against Acceptance
- The experimental design has critical limitations, particularly the stationary player assumption.
- Key comparisons, such as end-to-end training and additional baselines, are missing.
- Certain methodological choices, such as the discrete action space, lack justification.
Recommendation
While the paper has notable strengths in its methodological contributions and empirical results, the experimental limitations and lack of key comparisons prevent a full endorsement. I recommend acceptance conditional on addressing these issues, particularly by revising the title, justifying the action space design, and including additional baselines.
