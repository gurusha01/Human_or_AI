The paper proposes a hierarchical policy network (HPN) that combines a macro-planner and a micro-planner to model long-term spatiotemporal trajectories, demonstrated in the context of basketball player movements. The macro-planner predicts high-level goals (e.g., stationary points on the court), while the micro-planner focuses on short-term actions. The two are integrated via an attention mechanism, enabling the model to balance immediate actions with long-term objectives. The authors evaluate their approach using a dataset of professional basketball games, comparing it against non-hierarchical baselines and demonstrating improved trajectory realism as judged by human experts.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Relevance: The hierarchical decomposition of long-term and short-term goals is a significant contribution, addressing limitations of single-scale models in high-dimensional, non-Markovian environments. The use of attention mechanisms to integrate macro- and micro-policies is innovative and could inspire applications beyond sports analytics.
2. Experimental Validation: The paper provides a thorough evaluation, including qualitative visualizations, human preference studies, and quantitative benchmarks. The results demonstrate that HPN outperforms baselines and approaches human-level trajectory realism.
3. Public Dataset: The authors' willingness to release the dataset enhances the reproducibility and impact of their work, enabling further research in this domain.
4. Potential for Broader Applications: The framework could extend to other domains requiring long-term planning, such as robotics or autonomous driving.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity Issues: The paper suffers from confusing notations, unclear explanations, and misleading terminology (e.g., "micro-planner"), which hinder comprehension. The "Related Work" section inadequately connects the proposed approach to prior research, missing opportunities to contextualize its contributions.
2. Methodological Concerns: The independence of the attention mask predictor from player positions raises questions about its robustness. Additionally, the model exhibits unrealistic behavior in some extrapolated scenarios, suggesting limitations in generalization.
3. Input Data Impact: The influence of input features beyond player trajectories (e.g., teammate or opponent positions) is not sufficiently explored, leaving gaps in understanding the model's dependencies.
4. Minor Issues: Typos, unclear figure captions, and a weak conclusion detract from the overall presentation. The conclusion could be strengthened by merging it with the discussion of limitations and future work.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper addresses a challenging and relevant problem with a novel approach.
- The experimental results are compelling, with significant improvements over baselines.
- The public dataset and detailed evaluation enhance the paper's scientific contribution.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The lack of clarity and methodological transparency may hinder reproducibility.
- Insufficient exploration of input data impact and robustness limits the scope of the findings.
- The "Related Work" section fails to adequately position the paper within the broader research landscape.
Recommendation:
This paper makes a meaningful contribution to hierarchical modeling and long-term trajectory prediction, with strong experimental results and potential for broader impact. However, the clarity and methodological issues need to be addressed. I recommend conditional acceptance, provided the authors improve the presentation, clarify the methodology, and strengthen the discussion of related work and limitations.
