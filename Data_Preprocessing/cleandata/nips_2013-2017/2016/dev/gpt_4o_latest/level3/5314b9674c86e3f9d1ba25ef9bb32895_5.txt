The paper presents an intriguing application of tensor networks, specifically matrix product states (MPS), to supervised learning tasks. By leveraging tensor networks, the authors aim to parameterize non-linear kernel learning models efficiently. The proposed method is tested on the MNIST dataset, achieving a test error rate below 1% with relatively small MPS bond dimensions. The authors also discuss the interpretability of the tensor network structure and its potential for feature selection, positioning their work as a novel contribution to the intersection of quantum-inspired methods and machine learning.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Interdisciplinary Approach: The application of tensor networks, a tool primarily used in quantum physics, to supervised learning is innovative and demonstrates interdisciplinary thinking. The use of MPS to approximate weight tensors is particularly interesting.
2. Efficiency: The authors highlight the linear scaling of their algorithm with respect to the training set size, which is a significant improvement over traditional kernel methods. This could make the approach appealing for large-scale datasets.
3. Interpretability: The paper provides insights into the representational power and implicit feature selection capabilities of tensor networks, which could be valuable for understanding model behavior.
4. Empirical Results: Achieving a test error rate below 1% on MNIST is competitive, especially considering the reduced image resolution (14x14) and the relatively small MPS bond dimensions used.
Weaknesses:
1. Lack of Motivation for Feature Map: The choice of the feature map, inspired by quantum spin systems, is ad hoc and not well-justified. A comparison with alternative feature maps is missing, leaving the reader uncertain about its effectiveness.
2. Optimization Challenges: While the sweeping optimization algorithm is described in detail, the paper does not address potential challenges, such as convergence issues or sensitivity to hyperparameters.
3. Computational Complexity: The subsampling of images from 28x28 to 14x14 is mentioned, but the computational complexity of the approach is not adequately discussed. This omission makes it difficult to assess the scalability of the method.
4. Unclear Label Placement: The placement of the label index in the MPS structure is not well-justified and seems inappropriate for multiclass classification. This could affect the generalizability of the approach to more complex datasets.
5. Limited Comparison: The proposed method is not compared to state-of-the-art classification methods in terms of error rates and computational efficiency. This limits the ability to contextualize the results within the broader machine learning landscape.
6. Missing Experimental Details: Key details, such as the dataset size (N) and the number of classes (L), are absent. Additionally, the process for estimating training and test errors is unclear.
7. Quadratic Loss Function: The use of a quadratic loss function is justified by computational simplicity, but no comparison is made with other loss functions, such as cross-entropy, which is standard for classification tasks.
Recommendation:
While the paper introduces a novel and potentially impactful approach, several critical issues need to be addressed before it can be considered for acceptance. The lack of motivation for the feature map, unclear label placement, and missing comparisons with state-of-the-art methods are significant weaknesses. Additionally, the absence of key experimental details and computational complexity analysis undermines the reproducibility and scalability of the work. If these issues are addressed in a revised submission, the paper could make a valuable contribution to the field.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Novel application of tensor networks to supervised learning.
- Competitive results on MNIST with efficient scaling.
- Potential for interpretability and feature selection.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Insufficient motivation and justification for key design choices.
- Missing comparisons with state-of-the-art methods.
- Lack of clarity in experimental details and computational complexity.
In its current form, I recommend a major revision to address the outlined weaknesses.
