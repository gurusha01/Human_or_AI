The paper addresses two critical problems in causal subset selection: source detection (OPT1) and causal covariate selection (OPT2), using Directed Information (DI) as the measure of causality. Unlike traditional approaches relying on mutual information or parametric methods, the authors leverage DI for its ability to capture non-linear and non-stationary dependencies. They further analyze the submodularity properties of these objectives, showing that OPT1 is submodular but non-monotonic, while OPT2 is monotonic but not submodular. To address the challenges posed by these properties, the authors introduce a novel metric, the Submodularity Index (SmI), to quantify the degree of submodularity and derive performance guarantees for greedy algorithms based on SmI. The paper is supported by both theoretical analysis and empirical validation on synthetic and real-world datasets.
Strengths:
1. Relevance and Novelty: The problems tackled are highly relevant to causal inference and subset selection. The introduction of SmI is a novel contribution that extends the applicability of greedy algorithms to non-monotonic and approximately submodular functions.
2. Theoretical Contributions: The performance bounds derived using SmI are rigorous and provide a broader theoretical foundation for applying greedy heuristics to quasi-submodular functions.
3. Empirical Validation: The experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets (e.g., stock market data) demonstrate the practical utility of the proposed methods. The application to causal structure learning is particularly compelling.
4. Clarity of Results: The empirical results, including the improved performance bounds with SmI, are well-presented and align with the theoretical findings.
Weaknesses:
1. OPT2 Bounds and Quasi-Submodularity: The notion of "quasi-submodularity" is not well-defined or justified. The paper lacks concrete examples or conditions under which this property holds, making the practical utility of the bounds for OPT2 unclear.
2. Missing Citations: The omission of related works, particularly Quinn et al., which propose an approximate submodularity measure, weakens the positioning of the paper within existing literature.
3. Algorithm Description: The adaptation of the CTW algorithm for set functions is inadequately explained, and it is unclear whether the theoretical guarantees extend to this adaptation.
4. Parameter Selection: The paper does not provide guidance on selecting the parameter \( k \), which significantly impacts both computational efficiency and approximation quality.
5. Data Concerns: The stock market data used is outdated, and the discretization process for real-world data is insufficiently described, raising concerns about reproducibility.
6. Clarity and Presentation: The paper suffers from unclear notation, grammatical errors, and formatting issues in the reference section, which detract from its overall readability.
Recommendation:
While the paper makes significant theoretical and practical contributions, the weaknesses, particularly the lack of clarity around quasi-submodularity and missing citations, limit its impact. Addressing these concerns would strengthen the paper considerably. I recommend acceptance with major revisions, contingent on the authors providing a clearer definition and justification for quasi-submodularity, addressing the missing citations, and improving the clarity and presentation of the manuscript.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Novel and impactful contributions (SmI, extended greedy guarantees).
- Strong theoretical foundation and empirical validation.
- Relevance to causal inference and subset selection.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Unclear justification for quasi-submodularity and OPT2 bounds.
- Missing key citations and insufficient explanation of algorithmic adaptations.
- Presentation issues and outdated data.
In summary, the paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field but requires substantial revisions to address the outlined concerns.
