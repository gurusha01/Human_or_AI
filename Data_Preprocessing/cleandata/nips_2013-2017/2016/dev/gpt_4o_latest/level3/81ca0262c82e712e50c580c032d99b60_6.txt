This paper presents a novel study of causal subset selection using Directed Information (DI) as a measure of prediction causality, focusing on two tasks: causal sensor placement and causal covariate selection. The authors explore the submodularity properties of these tasks, introducing a new concept, the Submodularity Index (SmI), to quantify how close a function is to being submodular. This innovative approach extends the applicability of greedy algorithms to a broader class of problems, including non-monotonic and non-submodular functions. The paper also demonstrates the utility of these methods in learning causal structures, supported by theoretical analysis and experimental validation.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Originality: The introduction of the Submodularity Index (SmI) is a significant theoretical contribution. SmI provides a continuous measure of submodularity, moving beyond the binary classification of functions as submodular or not. This is a fresh perspective that could inspire further research in optimization and subset selection.
2. Theoretical Rigor: The paper provides a detailed analysis of the submodularity properties of the two tasks, offering performance guarantees for greedy algorithms based on SmI. The theoretical results are well-supported and extend existing bounds for non-monotonic and quasi-submodular functions.
3. Practical Relevance: The application of the proposed methods to causal structure learning is compelling. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in reconstructing causal graphs, which is a critical task in many domains, including biology, economics, and social sciences.
4. Clarity of Contributions: The paper clearly delineates its contributions, including the formulation of the two tasks, the introduction of SmI, and the extension of greedy algorithm guarantees.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity and Accessibility: While the paper is well-organized, some sections (e.g., the mathematical definitions of SmI and its computation) are dense and may be challenging for readers unfamiliar with submodularity or information theory. Additional intuitive explanations or visual aids could improve accessibility.
2. Experimental Scope: The experiments, while illustrative, are limited in scope. The synthetic datasets are relatively small, and the real-world application focuses on a single domain (stock market data). Broader validation across diverse datasets and domains would strengthen the paper's claims.
3. Computational Complexity: The paper briefly mentions that direct computation of SmI is challenging, but it does not delve into the practical implications of this for large-scale problems. A more detailed discussion of computational trade-offs would be valuable.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:
- Pro: The paper makes a strong theoretical contribution by introducing SmI and extending the applicability of greedy algorithms. Its application to causal structure learning is both novel and impactful.
- Con: The experimental validation could be more comprehensive, and the paper's technical depth may limit its accessibility to a broader audience.
Recommendation: Overall, this paper represents a high-quality scientific contribution with significant theoretical and practical implications. While there are minor weaknesses in clarity and experimental breadth, the novelty and rigor of the work outweigh these concerns. I recommend acceptance, with suggestions to improve accessibility and expand experimental validation in future iterations.
