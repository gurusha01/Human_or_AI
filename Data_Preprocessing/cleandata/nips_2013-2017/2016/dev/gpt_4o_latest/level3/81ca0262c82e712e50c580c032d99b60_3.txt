This paper addresses the challenging problems of source detection and causal covariate selection by formulating them as cardinality-constrained directed information (DI) maximization problems. The authors provide a rigorous submodularity analysis, demonstrating that while the DI objective for source detection is submodular but not monotonic, the DI objective for causal covariate selection is not submodular in general but exhibits "near-submodularity" in specific instances. To quantify this approximate submodularity, the authors introduce the novel concept of the submodularity index (SmI), which measures the degree of submodularity for set functions. Notably, they show that SmI can guide the performance guarantees of the random-greedy algorithm, even for non-monotonic and non-submodular functions, thereby broadening the applicability of greedy heuristics.
The paper is technically sound and provides significant theoretical contributions. The introduction of SmI is particularly innovative, as it transitions submodularity from a binary property to a continuous measure, enabling a nuanced understanding of set functions. The authors derive near-optimality bounds for random-greedy performance based on SmI and apply these bounds to the two main problems, offering a unified framework for analyzing approximately submodular functions. The theoretical results are supported by numerical experiments, which validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods on synthetic and real-world datasets. Additionally, the application to causal structure learning demonstrates the practical utility of the approach.
However, the paper has some limitations. While the theoretical contributions are robust, the experimental section lacks comparisons with alternative algorithms, which would provide a clearer picture of the proposed method's relative performance. Furthermore, the SmI computation is generally intractable, and while the authors propose a lower bound, its utility diminishes as the ground set size increases. Large-scale experiments (e.g., |V| â‰ˆ 100) are recommended to assess scalability. The paper would also benefit from exploring other set function classes and applications with small SmI, as suggested by the authors themselves. Minor issues include typos (e.g., Line 60, Line 161) and missing formal definitions (e.g., Line 101), which should be addressed for clarity.
Strengths:
1. Novel formulation of causal subset selection problems using DI.
2. Introduction of SmI as a continuous measure of submodularity.
3. Theoretical guarantees for random-greedy performance on non-submodular functions.
4. Practical application to causal structure learning.
Weaknesses:
1. Lack of experimental comparisons with other methods.
2. Limited scalability analysis for large ground sets.
3. Incomplete exploration of SmI's applicability to other set function classes.
4. Minor clarity issues due to typos and missing definitions.
Recommendation:
This paper makes a strong theoretical contribution and has practical implications for causal analysis. With additional experimental comparisons and scalability analysis, it could be a highly impactful work. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions.
