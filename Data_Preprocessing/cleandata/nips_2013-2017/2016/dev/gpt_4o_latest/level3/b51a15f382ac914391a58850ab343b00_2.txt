This paper addresses the challenging problem of combinatorial partial monitoring (CPM) games in stochastic settings, proposing two novel algorithms based on the forced exploration framework: PEGE and PEGE2. The authors build on prior work, particularly the GCB algorithm, and make significant contributions by improving regret bounds and simplifying computational requirements. The paper is well-motivated, technically sound, and advances the state of the art in CPM games.
Strengths:
1. State-of-the-Art Regret Bounds: The first algorithm, PEGE, achieves a distribution-independent regret bound of \(O(T^{2/3} \sqrt{\log T})\) and a distribution-dependent regret bound of \(O(\log^2 T)\), improving on prior work by removing the need for a second oracle and relaxing the assumption of a unique optimal action. The second algorithm, PEGE2, achieves \(O(\log T)\) regret, matching the GCB algorithm but with no dependence on the size of the learner's action set.
2. Scalability: The regret bounds depend on the size of the global observable set rather than the cardinality of the action space, making the algorithms applicable to problems with countably infinite or continuous action spaces.
3. Practical Applicability: The paper demonstrates how the proposed algorithms can be applied to online ranking problems with stochastic feedback, a relevant and practical application.
4. Theoretical Contributions: The authors provide rigorous proofs for their regret bounds and introduce a novel gap estimation technique, which is theoretically interesting and practically useful.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity Issues: While the paper is technically sound, it suffers from some clarity issues. The distinction between stochastic and oblivious adversary settings is not always clear, as highlighted in the rebuttal. Additionally, the potential benefits of the stochastic i.i.d. assumption and its impact on problem parameter dependencies could be better articulated.
2. Grammatical Errors: The manuscript contains several grammatical issues, including article usage, plurals, and comma placement, which detract from readability. Proofreading is recommended.
3. Notation and Presentation: Some notational inconsistencies, such as \(S(x)\) instead of \(S(\theta_p^*)\), and the late definition of \(\bar{r}\), should be addressed. The expectation notation could also be improved for clarity.
4. Algorithm Design: While PEGE2 achieves strong theoretical guarantees, it requires knowledge of the time horizon \(T\), unlike GCB, which is an anytime algorithm. Combining the strengths of PEGE2 and GCB into a single anytime algorithm could be a valuable direction for future work.
Pro/Con Arguments for Acceptance:
- Pro: Advances the state of the art in CPM games, simplifies computational requirements, and provides meaningful regret bounds for infinite action spaces.
- Con: Clarity and grammatical issues, as well as the reliance of PEGE2 on a known time horizon, limit its immediate accessibility and practicality.
Conclusion:
This paper makes a significant contribution to the field of CPM games and is a strong candidate for acceptance. However, addressing clarity, grammatical issues, and exploring the possibility of an anytime algorithm would further strengthen the work.
