The paper presents a novel approach for selective inference in the context of group-sparse regression, proposing methods to compute p-values and confidence intervals for selected groups of variables. The authors extend existing work on selective inference for sparse regression to the grouped setting, introducing a "truncated projection lemma" that characterizes the conditional distribution of the magnitude of projections onto subspaces. This technical result is applied to three group-sparse regression methods: group lasso, iterative hard thresholding (IHT), and forward stepwise regression. The paper includes numerical experiments on both simulated and real-world health data to demonstrate the utility of the proposed methods.
Strengths:
1. Technical Contribution: The paper provides a significant theoretical advancement by generalizing selective inference to the group-sparse setting. The "truncated projection lemma" is a valuable addition to the literature, enabling inference beyond the null hypothesis.
2. Breadth of Application: The proposed methods are applicable to multiple group-sparse regression techniques, showcasing their versatility.
3. Numerical Validation: The experiments on simulated and real data effectively illustrate the practical utility of the approach, particularly in highlighting differences in p-values across methods.
4. Clarity in Theoretical Results: The mathematical derivations are rigorous and well-documented, making the theoretical contributions clear to the reader.
Weaknesses:
1. Motivation for Grouping: The rationale for performing inference on groups rather than individual columns is not adequately explained. While the grouped setting is common in some applications, the paper does not justify why grouping is necessary or advantageous in the presented context.
2. Grouping Strategy: Practical guidance on how to form groups is missing. For example, in the real data experiment, the expansion of single predictors into groups of three using Legendre polynomials is not well-justified. It is unclear whether this approach generalizes to other datasets or applications.
3. Ambiguity in Group Definitions: The paper does not clarify whether the groups are mutually exclusive or overlapping, which could affect the interpretation of the results.
4. Unclear Methodological Details: Key terms such as "control for the remaining selected groups" (Lines 61-63) and "condition on the direction dir_\mathcal{L}(Y)" (Lines 109-110) are not sufficiently explained, making it difficult for readers to fully understand the methodology.
5. Baseline Comparisons: The performance evaluation lacks a comparison with other inference methods, such as the one in reference [6]. Without this, it is hard to assess the relative merits of the proposed approach.
6. P-value Variability: The large variation in p-values for the same method with different group sizes (e.g., "Obese" in Forward Stepwise) raises concerns about the robustness and reliability of the approach.
Recommendation:
While the paper makes a strong theoretical contribution and demonstrates practical utility, the lack of clarity in motivation, grouping strategy, and methodological details detracts from its overall impact. Additionally, the absence of baseline comparisons limits the ability to evaluate its significance relative to existing methods. I recommend acceptance conditional on revisions that address the following:
1. Provide a clearer motivation for group-wise inference and practical guidelines for grouping.
2. Clarify whether groups are mutually exclusive or overlapping and explain how this affects the methodology.
3. Expand the discussion of key terms and concepts to improve clarity.
4. Include comparisons with baseline methods to contextualize the performance of the proposed approach.
Pro/Con Summary:

- Significant theoretical contribution.
- Versatile application to multiple regression methods.
- Strong numerical validation.
Cons:
- Insufficient motivation and guidance for grouping.
- Lack of clarity in key methodological details.
