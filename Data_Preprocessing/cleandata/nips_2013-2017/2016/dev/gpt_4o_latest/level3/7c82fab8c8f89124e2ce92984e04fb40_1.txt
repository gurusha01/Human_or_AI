The paper presents a novel approach for selective inference in group-sparse regression, enabling the construction of both confidence intervals and p-values for selected groups of covariates. This method is applicable to widely used algorithms such as forward stepwise regression, iterative hard-thresholding (IHT), and group lasso. The key challenge addressed is the statistical assessment of selected groups when the same data is used for both selection and inference, a problem that has been inadequately addressed in prior work. Notably, the paper extends beyond existing methods, which are limited to p-value computation, by introducing tools for constructing confidence intervals, thus broadening the scope of selective inference.
The theoretical contribution is grounded in a new lemma that characterizes the distribution of truncated projections of Gaussian variables. This result generalizes the "polyhedral lemma" used in sparse regression and provides a foundation for the proposed inference procedures. The authors demonstrate the utility of their approach through two experiments: one on synthetic data and another on real-world health data. However, the second experiment lacks a clear take-home message, which diminishes its impact.
The paper is well-written and clearly structured, effectively introducing the problem and its contributions. The technical soundness of the work is commendable, with Lemma 1 and Theorem 1 representing significant advancements. However, some aspects require clarification, such as the numerical solution of \(\hat{fY}(L\alpha) = \alpha\), the conditioning in Theorem 1, and the computational complexity across different scenarios. Additionally, the assumptions about group partitions (e.g., no overlaps) should be discussed earlier in the paper.
The experimental section is a notable weakness. While the synthetic data experiment provides some validation, the lack of comparisons to alternative methods like bootstrap or data splitting limits the evaluation's comprehensiveness. Furthermore, the second experiment's unclear message and insufficient exploration of extensions beyond quadratic loss or Gaussian models reduce the practical significance of the results.
Strengths:
1. Novel contribution enabling confidence interval construction for group-sparse inference.
2. Solid theoretical foundation with significant technical results.
3. Applicability to multiple group-sparse regression methods.
Weaknesses:
1. Experimental evaluation is limited and lacks comparisons to alternative approaches.
2. Some theoretical aspects and assumptions require further clarification.
3. The second experiment is unclear and lacks actionable insights.
Recommendation: The paper makes a strong theoretical contribution and addresses an important problem in selective inference. However, the experimental evaluation needs significant improvement to demonstrate the practical utility of the proposed method. I recommend acceptance conditional on addressing the experimental and clarity issues.
