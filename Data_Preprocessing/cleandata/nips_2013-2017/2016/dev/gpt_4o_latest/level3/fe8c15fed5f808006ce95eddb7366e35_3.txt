The paper presents a novel hierarchical policy network (HPN) for long-term trajectory planning, focusing on spatiotemporal modeling of expert demonstrations, with a case study on basketball player movements. The authors propose a two-level policy framework—macro and micro—integrated using an attention mechanism, enabling the model to balance long-term goals with short-term actions. This approach addresses the limitations of single-scale policy models, which often fail to capture cohesive long-term behavior in high-dimensional state spaces. The use of weak labels for pretraining and a multi-stage learning process further enhances the model's ability to generate realistic trajectories. Experimental results, including a human preference study, demonstrate that HPN outperforms non-hierarchical baselines and approaches ground truth quality in generating realistic player movements.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Originality: The hierarchical decomposition of macro-goals and micro-actions, combined with an attention mechanism applied to the output space, is a compelling and innovative approach. The paper advances the state of the art in trajectory planning by addressing long-term behavior modeling, a challenging and underexplored problem.
2. Empirical Validation: The authors provide extensive experimental validation, including qualitative visualizations, quantitative benchmarks, and a human preference study involving both experts and non-experts. The results convincingly demonstrate the superiority of HPN over baselines.
3. Technical Contribution: The multi-stage learning approach and the integration of weak labels for pretraining are well-motivated and practical. The use of GRU-based recurrent networks for both macro and micro-policies is appropriate for capturing temporal dynamics.
4. Clarity of Results: The visualizations and preference study results are well-presented and provide clear evidence of the model's effectiveness in generating realistic trajectories.
Weaknesses:
1. Notation and Clarity Issues: The notation \( gt \) is used in Section 3.1 without prior definition, which could confuse readers. Additionally, Equation (3) is unclear, as both sides contain \( P(at | st, h{t-n,t}) \), creating ambiguity.
2. Incomplete Goal Space Definition: The goal space \( G \) is not concretely defined, leaving its dimensionality and practical representation ambiguous. This weakens the theoretical foundation of the macro-policy.
3. Weak Labeling Process: The process for obtaining weak labels \( \hat{g}t \) and \( \hat{m}t \) is not adequately explained, which is a critical component of the proposed method. A more detailed description would enhance reproducibility.
4. Limited Scope: The model is restricted to offensive player movements and does not account for other aspects of basketball gameplay, such as passing, shooting, or defensive strategies. This limits the generalizability of the approach.
5. Inconsistent Macro-Goal Predictions: As noted in the experiments, the HPN occasionally predicts inconsistent macro-goals, suggesting room for improvement in the macro-policy's stability.
Recommendation:
The paper makes a significant contribution to long-term trajectory planning and is well-suited for the conference. However, the authors should address the noted clarity issues, particularly the undefined notation and ambiguous equations. Additionally, a more detailed explanation of the goal space and weak labeling process would strengthen the paper's technical rigor. Despite these weaknesses, the paper's strengths in originality, empirical validation, and practical relevance outweigh its limitations. I recommend acceptance, with minor revisions to improve clarity and completeness. 
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Novel hierarchical policy framework with attention mechanism.
- Strong empirical results, including expert validation.
- Advances the state of the art in long-term trajectory planning.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Ambiguities in notation and equations.
- Incomplete explanation of key components (goal space, weak labels).
- Limited scope of application to basketball gameplay.
Final Recommendation: Accept with Minor Revisions.
