The paper introduces a novel "communication-based machine translation (CMT)" model, which leverages monolingual data and feedback in a dual-learning framework to improve translation quality in both directions. The central idea is to treat translation tasks as a two-player communication game, where two models iteratively improve each other using reinforcement learning. This approach addresses the challenge of limited bilingual data by utilizing monolingual corpora, aiming to reduce dependency on costly parallel datasets. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method on English↔French translation tasks, comparing it to standard neural MT (NMT) systems and pseudo-bilingual data-based systems.
Strengths:
1. Innovative Framework: The dual-learning mechanism is an interesting and creative approach to leveraging monolingual data for machine translation. The use of reinforcement learning to iteratively improve two translation models is novel and has potential applications beyond MT.
2. Empirical Results: The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms baseline NMT and pseudo-NMT systems, particularly in low-resource settings (e.g., using only 10% of bilingual data). The significant improvement in BLEU scores highlights the model's effectiveness.
3. Generality: The authors suggest that the dual-learning framework could be extended to other dual tasks, such as speech recognition vs. text-to-speech or image captioning vs. image generation, which broadens the potential impact of this work.
4. Reinforcement Learning in Real-World Applications: The paper demonstrates the use of deep reinforcement learning for a complex, real-world task, moving beyond its traditional application in games.
Weaknesses:
1. Limited Related Work Discussion: The paper's review of prior work is insufficient, focusing primarily on recent work by Sennrich et al. It overlooks other methods that leverage monolingual data, such as language model rescoring, fusion techniques, and unsupervised noisy-channel models.
2. Empirical Comparisons: The experimental evaluation lacks comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, such as unsupervised MT models or other communication-based learning approaches in reinforcement learning.
3. Two-Player Metaphor Misalignment: The repeated explanation of the two-player communication game metaphor is verbose and does not align well with the algorithm's actual implementation. This space could have been better utilized for a more detailed discussion of related work or experimental details.
4. Generalizability: While the model performs well on English↔French, the extension to multiple languages or translation chains is not straightforward due to potential noise in error detection and updates.
5. Experimental Details: Key experimental details, such as the number of training instances and hyperparameter settings, are missing. Additionally, the claim of learning translation models from scratch is overstated, as the method relies on a warm-start model trained on bilingual data.
Pro and Con Arguments:
Pro:
- The dual-learning mechanism is a novel contribution to MT and reinforcement learning.
- The method demonstrates strong performance in low-resource settings, which is critical for underrepresented languages.
- The framework has potential applications beyond MT, making it broadly significant.
Con:
- The lack of sufficient empirical comparisons with prior work weakens the paper's contributions.
- The metaphor and related work discussion are verbose and incomplete, detracting from clarity.
- The approach's scalability to multilingual or unsupervised scenarios is unclear.
Recommendation:
While the paper presents an interesting and promising idea, the lack of sufficient comparisons with related work and incomplete experimental details limit its impact. I recommend acceptance with major revisions, focusing on expanding the related work section, providing more empirical comparisons, and clarifying the scalability of the approach.
