The paper introduces a novel hierarchical policy network (HPN) for long-term trajectory planning, leveraging macro-goals to guide micro-actions through an innovative attention mechanism. This approach is applied to modeling basketball player trajectories, demonstrating significant improvements over non-hierarchical baselines. The authors argue that conventional single-scale models struggle with cohesive long-term behavior in high-dimensional spaces, and their hierarchical framework addresses this limitation by integrating macro-goals and micro-actions on distinct timescales. The paper also highlights the use of memory networks and attention mechanisms to balance short-term and long-term objectives, a perspective that is both conceptually compelling and technically promising.
Strengths:  
The paper makes a meaningful contribution by addressing a challenging problem in trajectory planning with a novel hierarchical approach. The integration of macro-goals and micro-actions via attention mechanisms is innovative and aligns with prior work in hierarchical planning and attention models, while extending these ideas to new domains. The experimental results, particularly the human preference study, provide strong evidence that the proposed method generates realistic basketball trajectories, outperforming baselines. The visualization of rollouts and macro-goal predictions further supports the model's efficacy. Additionally, the paper situates its contributions well within the existing literature, referencing relevant works in reinforcement learning, hierarchical planning, and attention mechanisms.
Weaknesses:  
Despite its strengths, the paper has several shortcomings. The theoretical explanation of the hierarchical policy framework is difficult to follow, particularly in Section 3. Issues such as typos in interval notation (Line 84), ambiguities in the definition of \(m\) (Lines [109,113)), and inconsistencies in formulas (e.g., Formula (3) vs. Formula (1)) detract from the clarity and rigor of the presentation. Furthermore, notational conflicts in Formula (4) make it challenging to fully grasp the interaction between macro-goals and micro-actions. The lack of objective performance metrics in the experiments is another limitation, as the reliance on subjective expert evaluations introduces potential biases and makes it harder to benchmark against other methods. Finally, while the paper demonstrates the utility of weak labels for pretraining, it does not adequately explore the trade-offs or limitations of this approach.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:  
Pro:  
- Novel and compelling approach to hierarchical trajectory planning.  
- Strong experimental results, including human preference studies.  
- Advances the state of the art in modeling long-term behavior in sports.  
Con:  
- Theoretical explanations are unclear and marred by errors.  
- Experiments lack objective metrics, limiting reproducibility and comparability.  
- Technical details, particularly regarding the attention mechanism, are insufficiently elaborated.  
Recommendation:  
The paper addresses a significant problem with an innovative solution and demonstrates promising results. However, the lack of clarity in theoretical explanations and the absence of objective evaluation metrics are notable weaknesses. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions, emphasizing the need to correct technical errors, clarify theoretical sections, and provide more robust experimental evaluations.
