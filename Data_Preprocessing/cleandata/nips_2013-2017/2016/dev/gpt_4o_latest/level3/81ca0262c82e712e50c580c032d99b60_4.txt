Review of the Paper
Summary
This paper addresses two submodular optimization problems—causal sensor placement and causal covariate selection—using directed information (DI) as a measure of causality. The authors analyze the submodularity of these problems, showing that the first is submodular but not monotonic, while the second is "nearly" submodular. To address the limitations of classical submodular optimization, the authors introduce a novel metric, the Submodularity Index (SmI), which quantifies the "degree of submodularity" and extends the applicability of greedy algorithms to non-monotonic and non-submodular functions. The paper provides theoretical guarantees for the performance of greedy algorithms based on SmI and evaluates these results through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets. Additionally, the authors demonstrate the application of their methods to causal structure learning.
Strengths
1. Novelty: The introduction of the Submodularity Index (SmI) is a significant contribution, as it provides a continuous measure of submodularity and extends the theoretical guarantees of greedy algorithms to a broader class of problems.
2. Theoretical Rigor: The paper provides detailed theoretical analysis, including proofs for submodularity, performance bounds for greedy algorithms, and efficient computation techniques for SmI.
3. Practical Relevance: The application to causal structure learning is compelling, and the experiments demonstrate the utility of the proposed methods in real-world scenarios, such as stock market data analysis.
4. Experimental Validation: The experiments effectively validate the theoretical findings, showing that the greedy algorithm performs near-optimally and that SmI provides tighter performance bounds compared to classical guarantees.
Weaknesses
1. Directed Information as a Causality Measure: The use of DI as a measure of causality is problematic, particularly in multi-variable settings. DI is not universally accepted as a causality metric, and its limitations in causal graph learning are not adequately addressed. The authors should reframe the paper as a study in submodular optimization with applications in DI maximization, rather than emphasizing causality.
2. Literature Gaps: The paper overlooks foundational works in causality, such as those by Pearl and Glymour, and fails to compare DI-based methods with conditional independence-based approaches. This weakens the positioning of the work within the broader causality literature.
3. Incorrect Claims: The claim that DI can identify pollution source nodes in causal graphs is misleading and needs rephrasing. Similarly, the paper's discussion of interventions is flawed, as DI cannot predict intervention effects.
4. Computational Complexity: The computation of SmI involves solving exponentially many supermodular minimization problems, yet the authors claim that Algorithm 1 runs in \(O(nk)\) time without sufficient justification.
5. Clarity Issues: The causal graph is only defined in the appendix, and the main text lacks clarity on the framework's applicability to "directed information graphs." Additionally, the numbering of theorems and lemmas is inconsistent between the main paper and supplementary material, making cross-referencing difficult.
6. Notation and Proof Completeness: The notation in the proofs is inconsistent and confusing, and some proofs (e.g., Proposition 2, Proposition 3) lack clarity and completeness. The supplementary material also contains errors, such as missing references and typos, which require thorough proofreading.
Arguments for Acceptance
- The introduction of SmI is a novel and impactful contribution to submodular optimization, with potential applications beyond the scope of this paper.
- The theoretical analysis is rigorous, and the experimental results convincingly validate the proposed methods.
- The application to causal structure learning is interesting and demonstrates the practical utility of the approach.
Arguments Against Acceptance
- The misuse of the term "causality" and the problematic reliance on DI as a causality measure undermine the paper's claims and positioning.
- The paper fails to engage with foundational causality literature, leaving significant gaps in its theoretical grounding.
- Clarity issues, inconsistent notation, and incomplete proofs detract from the overall quality of the paper.
Recommendation
While the paper makes a strong contribution to submodular optimization through the introduction of SmI, its claims about causality are overstated and problematic. I recommend major revisions to address the misuse of causality terminology, engage with relevant literature, and improve clarity and completeness. If these issues are resolved, the paper could make a valuable contribution to the field.
