The paper presents a neural reasoning-based approach for Visual Question Answering (VQA), where the model iteratively updates question representations by interacting with image regions identified through object detection. The method employs attention mechanisms to focus on relevant image regions and integrates spatial information into object features. While the approach is inspired by neural reasoners previously applied to text-based QA, it adapts the framework to handle visual data. The authors evaluate their model on COCO-QA and VQA datasets, claiming state-of-the-art results in certain categories.
Strengths:
1. Clarity and Writing: The paper is well-written and organized, with clear explanations of the model architecture and experimental setup. The inclusion of qualitative examples, such as attention visualizations, enhances the reader's understanding.
2. Sound Experimental Design: The authors conduct experiments on two established datasets and provide detailed comparisons with state-of-the-art methods. They also analyze the impact of different components, such as spatial coordinates and global image features.
3. Focus on Directed Questions: The iterative question-updating mechanism is an interesting attempt to refine question representations, potentially addressing ambiguities in the original queries.
4. Attention Mechanism: The use of attention to focus on relevant image regions is a strength, as it aligns with recent trends in VQA research.
Weaknesses:
1. Lack of Novelty: The method largely reuses the neural reasoner framework without significant modifications. While adapting it to visual data is non-trivial, the lack of innovation in the core methodology limits its contribution.
2. Limited Generalization: The reliance on object detection proposals, which are not question-specific, restricts the model's ability to handle diverse VQA tasks. This is particularly evident in its poor performance on counting questions and non-object-related queries.
3. Dataset Limitations: The evaluation is heavily reliant on COCO-QA, which has known issues with grammar and phrasing. This raises concerns about the robustness of the results.
4. Ablation Studies: While some ablation results are presented, they do not isolate the effect of using object-based facts versus other forms of image representation. This omission weakens the claims about the model's efficacy.
5. Attention Mechanism Shortcomings: Attention maps are generated without question-specific knowledge, potentially missing critical regions. This limitation is not adequately addressed in the paper.
6. Nearest Neighbor Evaluation: The use of a nearest neighbor approach to evaluate updated question representations is questionable, and failure cases are not sufficiently analyzed.
Recommendation:
The paper introduces an interesting adaptation of neural reasoners to VQA, but its contributions are incremental and lack sufficient novelty. The method struggles with key aspects of VQA, such as counting and non-object-related queries, and its reliance on object detection proposals limits its general applicability. To strengthen the work, the authors should:
- Incorporate more question-specific visual facts.
- Conduct thorough ablation studies to isolate the impact of object-based reasoning.
- Address limitations in the attention mechanism and nearest neighbor evaluation.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper is well-written and provides a clear explanation of the method.
- The iterative question-updating mechanism is an interesting direction for VQA research.
- The attention visualizations and qualitative examples are insightful.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The lack of novelty in adapting neural reasoners to VQA.
- Limited generalization to diverse VQA tasks, particularly counting and non-object-related queries.
- Insufficient ablation studies and reliance on a dataset with known issues.
Overall, while the paper has merits, its incremental contributions and methodological limitations make it better suited for a workshop or a journal with a focus on incremental improvements.
