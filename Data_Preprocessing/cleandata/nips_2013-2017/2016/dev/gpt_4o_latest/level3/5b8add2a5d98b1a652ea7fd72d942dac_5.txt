The paper proposes a novel algorithm, Truncated Generalized Gradient Flow (TGGF), to address the challenging problem of solving over-determined quadratic systems with random coefficients, a task that is NP-hard in general. The authors focus on both real- and complex-valued settings, leveraging a differentiable generalization of subgradient methods to handle the nonconvex and nonsmooth nature of the amplitude-based cost function. The algorithm consists of two stages: an orthogonality-promoting initialization using power iterations and a refinement stage employing truncated generalized gradient updates. The authors demonstrate that TGGF achieves exact recovery with high probability when the number of equations is on the order of the number of unknowns, with linear computational complexity.
Strengths:
1. Technical Contribution: The paper introduces a novel orthogonality-promoting initialization, which outperforms traditional spectral methods, especially in low-sample regimes. This is a significant advancement over existing approaches like Truncated Wirtinger Flow (TWF) and Wirtinger Flow (WF).
2. Theoretical Guarantees: The authors provide rigorous theoretical analysis, proving that TGGF converges exponentially fast and achieves exact recovery under near-optimal sample complexity. The results bridge the gap between theoretical information limits and practical performance.
3. Empirical Validation: Extensive numerical experiments validate the superior performance of TGGF over state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency. The algorithm achieves a success rate of over 50% with a sample complexity ratio of 2 for real-valued problems, a notable improvement over existing methods.
4. Clarity and Structure: The paper is well-organized, with a clear exposition of the problem, methodology, and results. The inclusion of detailed comparisons with TWF and WF strengthens the paper's claims.
Weaknesses:
1. Incomplete Reference: Reference [22] is incomplete, lacking author names. This oversight detracts from the paper's professionalism and should be addressed.
2. Ambiguity in Claims: The "4n-2" claim for the complex case on page 2 requires further clarification and justification. The authors should provide additional theoretical or empirical evidence to support this assertion.
3. Broader Context: While the paper focuses on Gaussian models, it would benefit from a discussion of how TGGF generalizes to other distributions or real-world datasets. This would enhance the paper's significance and applicability.
Pro vs. Con Arguments:
Pro:
- Novel and effective initialization strategy.
- Strong theoretical guarantees and empirical performance.
- Linear computational complexity, making it scalable for large problems.
Con:
- Minor issues with incomplete references and ambiguous claims.
- Limited discussion on generalizability beyond Gaussian models.
Recommendation:
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of nonconvex optimization and phase retrieval. The proposed TGGF algorithm advances the state of the art both theoretically and empirically. Addressing the noted weaknesses, particularly the incomplete reference and the ambiguous claim, would further strengthen the paper. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions.
