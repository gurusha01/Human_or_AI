The paper presents a novel framework for visual question answering (VQA) that integrates a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) with a gated recurrent unit (GRU) and employs object proposals to focus on image regions relevant to the question. This approach addresses the limitations of global image representations by leveraging object proposals to extract localized features, which are then used in iterative reasoning layers to refine the question representation. The proposed method is evaluated on COCO-QA and VQA datasets, achieving competitive performance and demonstrating its ability to focus on relevant image regions through attention mechanisms.
Strengths:
1. Innovative Use of Object Proposals: The use of object proposals to identify candidate regions in the image is a reasonable and effective approach that enhances the model's ability to focus on relevant areas, as evidenced by the qualitative attention visualizations.
2. Iterative Question Updates: The model's iterative reasoning layers provide a mechanism to refine the question representation based on image content, which is a meaningful contribution to the VQA task.
3. Comprehensive Evaluation: The paper provides detailed experimental results on two challenging datasets, including ablation studies and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, which highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed approach.
4. Clarity and Organization: The paper is well-written and clearly organized, making it accessible to readers with a background in VQA and deep learning.
Weaknesses:
1. Unclear Iterative Updates: While the authors claim that the question representation is updated iteratively, the figures and descriptions suggest only a single update. This discrepancy needs clarification, particularly regarding the number of reasoning layers and their impact on performance.
2. Performance Gap: Although the proposed method achieves competitive results, it is slightly outperformed by FDA [11] and DMN+ [30] on the VQA dataset. The authors should provide a more detailed analysis of why their method falls short in certain cases and discuss potential avenues for improvement, such as enhancing object counting capabilities.
3. Limited Novelty in Components: While the combination of CNNs, GRUs, and attention mechanisms is effective, these components are well-established in the field. The novelty primarily lies in their integration, which may limit the broader impact of the work.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper addresses a significant problem in VQA and proposes a reasonable and effective solution.
- The use of object proposals and attention mechanisms demonstrates clear improvements in focusing on relevant image regions.
- The qualitative and quantitative evaluations are thorough and provide valuable insights into the model's performance.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The iterative reasoning process, a key claim of the paper, is not clearly substantiated, which raises concerns about the technical soundness of the approach.
- The method does not consistently outperform state-of-the-art models, and the reasons for this are not adequately explained.
- The contributions, while meaningful, may lack sufficient novelty to warrant acceptance at a top-tier conference like NIPS.
Recommendation:
Overall, the paper makes a solid contribution to the VQA field, particularly in its use of object proposals and attention mechanisms. However, the unclear iterative reasoning process and the performance gap compared to state-of-the-art methods are notable concerns. I recommend acceptance if the authors can clarify the iterative updates and provide a more detailed analysis of their model's limitations. Otherwise, it may be better suited for a more specialized venue.
