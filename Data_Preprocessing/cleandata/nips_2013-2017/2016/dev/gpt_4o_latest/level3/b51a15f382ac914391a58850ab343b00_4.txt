The paper presents a significant contribution to the study of combinatorial partial monitoring (CPM) games, extending the existing literature on partial monitoring and combinatorial bandits. It introduces two novel algorithms, PEGE and PEGE2, which leverage forced exploration techniques to address the challenges posed by large learner action spaces and bounded, continuous adversary action spaces. The authors demonstrate theoretical improvements over the state-of-the-art GCB algorithm, particularly in terms of regret bounds and computational efficiency.
Strengths:
1. Technical Soundness: The paper is technically rigorous, with well-supported theoretical results. PEGE achieves distribution-independent regret bounds of \(O(T^{2/3} \sqrt{\log T})\) and distribution-dependent regret bounds of \(O(\log^2 T)\), while PEGE2 matches the \(O(\log T)\) regret of GCB but removes the dependence on the size of the learner's action space (\(|X|\)). This is a meaningful improvement, especially for problems with infinite or continuous action spaces.
2. Clarity and Organization: The paper is well-written and logically structured. The CPM model, assumptions, and algorithmic contributions are clearly described, making the work accessible to readers familiar with bandit and partial monitoring literature.
3. Novelty: The use of forced exploration techniques in the CPM setting is novel and contrasts with the confidence-bound approach used in GCB. The removal of the dependence on \(|X|\) in regret bounds is a significant advancement, broadening the applicability of the algorithms.
4. Practical Relevance: The application to online ranking with limited feedback is compelling and demonstrates the practical utility of the proposed algorithms. The discussion of how PEGE and PEGE2 handle scenarios with infinite learner action spaces further highlights their versatility.
Weaknesses:
1. Lack of Empirical Validation: The paper does not include experiments to compare the practical performance of PEGE/PEGE2 with GCB. While the theoretical results are strong, empirical evidence would strengthen the paper's impact and demonstrate the real-world utility of the proposed algorithms.
2. Connection to User Privacy: Although the application to online ranking mentions user privacy concerns, this connection is not explored in depth. A more explicit discussion of how the algorithms address or impact privacy would enhance the relevance of the application.
3. Dependence on Time Horizon: PEGE2 requires knowledge of the time horizon \(T\), which limits its practicality in scenarios where \(T\) is unknown. This contrasts with GCB, which is an anytime algorithm.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper advances the state of the art in CPM games by addressing key limitations of GCB, particularly the dependence on \(|X|\).
- The theoretical contributions are robust and well-motivated, with clear implications for both theory and practice.
- The application to online ranking is relevant and demonstrates the potential for broader impact.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The absence of experimental results is a significant drawback, as it leaves the practical performance of the algorithms unverified.
- The reliance on knowledge of \(T\) for PEGE2 may limit its adoption in real-world scenarios.
Conclusion:
Overall, the paper makes a strong theoretical contribution to CPM games and introduces algorithms with meaningful improvements over existing methods. While the lack of experiments and practical limitations of PEGE2 are concerns, the novelty and rigor of the work justify its acceptance. I recommend acceptance, with the suggestion that the authors include experimental results and further explore the privacy implications in future work.
