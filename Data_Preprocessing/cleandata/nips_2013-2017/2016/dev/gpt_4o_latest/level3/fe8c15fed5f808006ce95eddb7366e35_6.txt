This paper proposes a hierarchical policy network (HPN) with attention mechanisms for modeling long-term spatiotemporal trajectories, specifically applied to basketball player behavior prediction. The authors address the challenge of learning hierarchical behavioral policies from expert demonstrations, a problem of significant importance in high-dimensional, long-horizon planning tasks. The proposed model integrates macro-goals and micro-actions using an attention mechanism, enabling it to capture both short-term and long-term behavior. The approach is evaluated through behavioral cloning on a large basketball dataset, and the results are compared against non-hierarchical baselines.
Strengths:
1. Problem Importance: The paper tackles a critical and underexplored problem of learning hierarchical policies for long-term planning, extending beyond standard tasks in reinforcement learning and imitation learning. The basketball benchmark adds novelty and practical relevance to the study.
2. Model Architecture: The hierarchical design with attention mechanisms is well-motivated, drawing inspiration from language modeling and cognitive science frameworks. The authors provide a detailed evaluation of architectural choices, attributing performance gains to specific components like attention and multi-stage learning.
3. Empirical Results: The HPN demonstrates significant improvements over baselines in generating realistic trajectories, as validated by both quantitative metrics and a human preference study. The integration of macro-goals and micro-actions is shown to produce more dynamic and realistic behavior.
4. Novelty: The use of attention mechanisms in the output space to combine hierarchical policies is a novel contribution that could inspire further research in trajectory modeling and beyond.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity and Notation: The paper suffers from inconsistent notation and unclear descriptions of key training details, particularly around the loss function and posterior usage. This lack of clarity may hinder reproducibility.
2. Experimental Details: The evaluation lacks comparisons with standard hierarchical behavior benchmarks, and the posterior sampling process during evaluation is insufficiently explained.
3. Visualization Quality: Figures are of poor quality, with limited baseline visualizations and missing trajectory comparisons to training data. This weakens the interpretability of the results.
4. Macro-Planner Issues: The macro-policy evaluation reveals that the agent rarely visits macro-goals, suggesting poor separation between macro and micro actions due to fine-tuning without macro labels.
5. Statistical Reporting: The absence of test-data splits and statistical significance measures undermines the robustness of the reported results.
6. Human Preference Study: The study design is questionable, as limited animations and the lack of team dynamics may have restricted the reliability of expert evaluations.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper addresses a significant and challenging problem with a novel hierarchical approach.
- The proposed model demonstrates clear improvements over baselines in generating realistic trajectories.
- The use of attention mechanisms in the output space is a novel and potentially impactful contribution.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The paper lacks clarity in key methodological details, which may hinder reproducibility.
- Experimental evaluation is incomplete, with missing comparisons to standard benchmarks and insufficient statistical rigor.
- Issues with macro-policy behavior and visualization quality reduce the interpretability and reliability of the results.
Recommendation:
While the paper presents a novel and promising approach to hierarchical trajectory modeling, the weaknesses in clarity, evaluation, and statistical reporting are significant. I recommend conditional acceptance, provided the authors address the clarity issues, improve the visualizations, and include additional benchmarks and statistical analyses in a revised version.
