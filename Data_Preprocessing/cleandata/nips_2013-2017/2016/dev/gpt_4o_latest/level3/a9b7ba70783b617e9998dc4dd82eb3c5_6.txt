The paper addresses the problem of statistical inference for cluster trees, proposing methods to construct and summarize confidence sets for these trees. It introduces a partial ordering mechanism to prune statistically insignificant features, aiming to simplify and enhance the interpretability of cluster trees. The authors also explore metrics for comparing trees, focusing on the `âˆž metric due to its computational tractability and statistical properties. The proposed methods are applied to synthetic datasets and a Graft-versus-Host Disease (GvHD) dataset, demonstrating their utility in distinguishing significant features from noise.
Strengths:
1. Novelty in Statistical Inference for Cluster Trees: The paper tackles an underexplored area by focusing on statistical inference for cluster trees, which is a significant contribution to the clustering literature.
2. Partial Ordering for Pruning: The introduction of a partial ordering mechanism to prune statistically insignificant features is an interesting and potentially impactful idea.
3. Dimension-Free Convergence Rate: The claim that the proposed methods achieve a convergence rate independent of dimensionality is noteworthy, especially for high-dimensional data.
4. Synthetic and Real-World Applications: The application of the methods to both synthetic datasets and the GvHD dataset demonstrates their practical relevance and potential utility.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity and Organization: The paper is poorly organized, with unrelated sections (e.g., detailed metric definitions) that could be moved to supplementary material. The main contributions are not adequately highlighted, making it difficult for readers to grasp the core ideas.
2. Title Misalignment: The title suggests a focus on hypothesis testing, but the paper does not deliver on this promise, creating a mismatch between expectations and content.
3. Terminology Confusion: The term "feature" is not clearly defined, leading to ambiguity in understanding the pruning process and its implications.
4. Figure Issues: Figures 4 and 5 lack labeled axes, making them unclear and not self-contained, which hinders the reader's ability to interpret the results.
5. Lack of Experimental Validation: The claim of dimension-independent convergence is not experimentally validated, and the results combining Lemma 2 and Theorem 3 are missing.
6. Limited Innovation: The paper does not provide comparisons with existing methods, making it difficult to assess its contributions relative to prior work.
7. Practical Application Gap: The paper does not discuss real-world scenarios where the proposed methods would be particularly useful, limiting its practical impact.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper introduces novel ideas, such as partial ordering for pruning and confidence sets for cluster trees, which could inspire future research.
- The methods are applied to real-world data, showcasing their potential utility.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The lack of clarity, poor organization, and missing experimental validations significantly undermine the paper's quality.
- The title misalignment and limited innovation relative to prior work weaken its contribution to the field.
- Practical applications and comparisons with existing methods are insufficiently addressed.
Recommendation: While the paper has some interesting ideas, the significant clarity, validation, and organization issues make it unsuitable for acceptance in its current form. A major revision is required to address these weaknesses.
