The paper presents a novel method for end-to-end recognition of handwritten paragraphs, leveraging MDLSTM networks augmented with attention mechanisms. This approach eliminates the need for explicit line segmentation, a significant bottleneck in traditional handwriting recognition pipelines. By introducing a weighted collapse layer, the model performs implicit line segmentation, iteratively focusing on single text lines. A Bidirectional-LSTM (BLSTM) decoder is employed to transcribe the encoded sequences, with training optimized using Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss over entire paragraphs. The method is evaluated on the Rimes and IAM datasets, showing competitive results on Rimes while falling slightly short of state-of-the-art performance on IAM.
Strengths
1. Innovation and Originality: The paper extends prior work by integrating line segmentation directly into the transcription model, which is a meaningful step toward fully end-to-end handwriting recognition. This approach aligns with recent trends in machine learning to minimize task-specific preprocessing.
2. Technical Soundness: The proposed model is well-motivated and builds on established techniques like MDLSTMs and attention mechanisms. The experimental setup is robust, with clear comparisons to baselines and prior work.
3. Real-World Applicability: By eliminating the need for line segmentation, the method addresses a practical challenge in handwriting recognition, making it more suitable for real-world applications where line-level annotations are unavailable or prone to errors.
4. Performance on Rimes: The model achieves state-of-the-art character error rates (CER) on the Rimes dataset, demonstrating its potential for certain languages and datasets.
Weaknesses
1. Baseline Comparisons: While the paper introduces a strong model, it lacks a simpler baseline for comparison, such as one using convolutional or affine layers. This would help isolate the contributions of the attention mechanism and MDLSTM layers.
2. Model Complexity: The addition of MDLSTM layers for paragraph boundary detection increases model complexity, which may hinder scalability to larger datasets or full-page recognition tasks.
3. Performance on IAM: The model does not outperform prior results on the IAM dataset, particularly in word error rates (WER). The authors attribute this to challenges with punctuation and small characters, but further analysis or solutions would strengthen the paper.
4. Limited Scope: The method is restricted to paragraph-level recognition, requiring prior document layout analysis to extract paragraphs. Extending the approach to full pages remains an open challenge.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance
Pros:
- Innovative integration of implicit line segmentation into the transcription model.
- Competitive performance on the Rimes dataset, with state-of-the-art CER.
- Addresses a practical challenge in handwriting recognition by removing the dependency on line segmentation.
Cons:
- Limited improvement on the IAM dataset, with notable challenges in handling punctuation and small characters.
- Lack of simpler baselines for a more comprehensive evaluation.
- Increased model complexity and limited scalability to full-page recognition.
Recommendation
The paper makes a meaningful contribution to the field of handwriting recognition by proposing a novel end-to-end approach that eliminates explicit line segmentation. While the results on IAM are not state-of-the-art, the competitive performance on Rimes and the practical implications of the method justify its acceptance. However, the authors should address the lack of simpler baselines and discuss potential solutions for extending the method to full-page recognition in future work.
