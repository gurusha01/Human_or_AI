The paper introduces a novel algorithmic framework, PEGE (Phased Exploration with Greedy Exploitation), for combinatorial partial monitoring (CPM) games, leveraging the "forcing with certainty equivalence" technique instead of the traditional UCB-based methods. The authors demonstrate that PEGE achieves comparable regret bounds to prior work, such as the GCB algorithm, while simplifying the oracle requirements and relaxing certain assumptions. Specifically, PEGE achieves an \(O(T^{2/3} \sqrt{\log T})\) distribution-independent regret and \(O(\log^2 T)\) distribution-dependent regret without requiring a second oracle or the existence of a unique optimal action. The paper also introduces PEGE2, which incorporates gap estimation to match the \(O(\log T)\) regret of GCB while removing dependence on the size of the learner's action space. The authors highlight potential applications in online ranking but do not provide real-world experimental results.
Strengths:
1. Technical Contribution: The paper presents a significant theoretical advancement by simplifying the CPM framework. By eliminating the need for a second oracle and relaxing the unique optimal action assumption, PEGE improves the practicality of CPM algorithms.
2. Regret Bounds: The regret bounds achieved by PEGE and PEGE2 are competitive with GCB, with the added benefit of independence from the size of the learner's action space. This makes the algorithms applicable to problems with infinite or continuous action spaces.
3. Novelty: The use of "forcing with certainty equivalence" in CPM games is novel and demonstrates a creative adaptation of a classic bandit technique.
4. Clarity in Theoretical Analysis: The theoretical guarantees are well-supported with detailed proofs, and the comparison with GCB is thorough.
Weaknesses:
1. Abstract and Presentation: The abstract is overly long and devotes excessive attention to prior work, which detracts from the focus on the authors' contributions. A more concise abstract would improve readability.
2. Experimental Validation: The paper lacks real-world experimental results, particularly for the proposed application of online ranking. This omission limits the practical impact and validation of the theoretical claims.
3. Justification of Regret Improvement: The improvement in regret bounds (\(\sqrt{\log T}\) vs. \(T^{2/3}\)) is subtle, and the paper does not sufficiently justify its significance in practical terms.
4. Dependence on Time Horizon: PEGE2 requires knowledge of the time horizon \(T\), which limits its applicability compared to the anytime nature of GCB.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper makes a meaningful theoretical contribution by simplifying the CPM framework and extending its applicability to infinite action spaces.
- The regret bounds are competitive with state-of-the-art algorithms, and the relaxation of assumptions enhances the practicality of the approach.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The lack of experimental validation weakens the paper's impact and leaves its practical utility untested.
- The subtle improvement in regret bounds is not convincingly justified, and the dependence on \(T\) in PEGE2 is a limitation.
Recommendation: Weak Accept. While the theoretical contributions are strong and novel, the paper would benefit significantly from experimental validation and a more concise presentation. Addressing these issues in a future revision could elevate the paper's impact.
