The paper presents a novel approach to addressing the problem of causal subset selection by introducing the Submodularity Index (SmI), a measure designed to generalize submodular function maximization and extend the applicability of greedy algorithms to non-monotonic and non-submodular functions. The authors focus on two key applications: causal sensor placement and causal covariate selection, leveraging Directed Information (DI) as the measure of causality. While the first problem is shown to be submodular but not monotonic, the second is characterized as "nearly" submodular. Theoretical results are validated through experiments using synthetic datasets generated with Murphy's Bayes Net Toolbox and real-world stock market data.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Theoretical Contributions: The introduction of SmI is a significant theoretical advancement, offering a continuous measure of submodularity and extending the performance guarantees of greedy algorithms to a broader class of functions. This is a meaningful contribution to the field of optimization and causal inference.
2. Practical Applications: The paper addresses two relevant and challenging problems—causal sensor placement and covariate selection—demonstrating the utility of SmI in real-world scenarios such as causal structure learning.
3. Experimental Validation: The authors validate their theoretical findings with experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, showcasing the effectiveness of the proposed methods in practical applications.
4. Performance Guarantees: The paper provides refined performance bounds for greedy algorithms as a function of SmI, which is a valuable addition to the literature on approximate submodularity.
Weaknesses:
1. Scope and Focus: The paper attempts to cover a wide range of topics, from causal subset selection to submodularity theory and causal structure learning. This breadth comes at the expense of depth, making the paper less cohesive and harder to follow for readers unfamiliar with the background.
2. Clarity and Accessibility: Critical proofs are relegated to supplementary material, which undermines the accessibility of the results. Additionally, the paper's organization and technical density make it challenging to understand without significant prior knowledge.
3. Focus Misalignment: While SmI is the central theoretical contribution, the paper devotes substantial attention to causal subset selection applications, which dilutes the emphasis on SmI's broader implications.
4. Minor Issues: The manuscript contains grammatical errors, inconsistent formatting, and missing references, which detract from its professionalism and readability.
Recommendation:
The paper makes a valuable theoretical contribution with SmI and its application to causal subset selection. However, to maximize its impact, the authors should streamline the focus by condensing the causal subset analysis and emphasizing SmI's theoretical contributions. Additionally, critical proofs should be included in the main body to enhance clarity. Addressing minor issues in grammar, formatting, and references is also necessary for improving the manuscript's quality.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The introduction of SmI is a novel and impactful contribution.
- Theoretical results are well-supported by experiments.
- The paper addresses relevant problems in causal inference and optimization.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The paper lacks focus and coherence, covering too many topics superficially.
- Accessibility is compromised by the omission of critical proofs and dense technical exposition.
- Minor issues in writing and formatting reduce the paper's overall quality.
Overall, the paper has strong theoretical contributions but requires significant revisions to improve focus, clarity, and presentation.
