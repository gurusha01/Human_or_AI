This paper proposes a novel monocular depth estimation algorithm that leverages filter-bank response coefficients to predict depth indirectly, followed by a global energy minimization step to reconcile local predictions into a coherent depth map. The approach is technically sound and introduces an interesting alternative to directly regressing depth values by focusing on high-order statistics of depth derivatives. This method has the potential to capture richer geometric cues and uncertainty in predictions, which could be valuable for downstream tasks.
Strengths:  
The paper presents a clear and well-motivated departure from traditional depth estimation techniques. By predicting distributions over filter response coefficients, the method allows for uncertainty modeling and avoids over-committing to a single depth value at each pixel. The use of an overcomplete representation and a globalization procedure to harmonize local predictions is novel and technically rigorous. The authors provide extensive details on the network architecture, training procedure, and optimization framework, making the work reproducible. Additionally, the method achieves competitive performance on the NYU v2 dataset, demonstrating its efficacy.
Weaknesses:  
While the approach is novel, its significance and advantages over simpler methods are not convincingly demonstrated. The paper does not provide a baseline comparison to directly fitting depth maps using coefficient similarity loss, which would help isolate the benefits of the proposed method. Furthermore, the rationale for using handcrafted filters and fitting high-order depth map statistics instead of directly reasoning in 3D geometry space is unclear. The experimental results, while promising, do not highlight the specific advantages of the method, such as improved 3D geometry preservation, visual appeal, or uncertainty modeling. The performance gains appear modest compared to simpler alternatives like pretraining on ImageNet or incorporating semantic labeling losses. Additionally, the indirect regression approach may hurt RMSE performance, as the model is not optimized for this metric.
Pro and Con Arguments:  
- Pro: Novel approach to depth estimation, uncertainty modeling, and overcomplete representation.  
- Pro: Technically sound and well-detailed methodology.  
- Con: Lack of baseline comparisons to simpler methods.  
- Con: Limited experimental evidence to justify the choice of handcrafted filters and high-order statistics.  
- Con: Performance gains are not clearly significant compared to existing methods.
Recommendations:  
The paper is borderline for acceptance. To strengthen its case, the authors should address the following in their rebuttal:  
1. Provide baseline comparisons to directly fitting depth maps with coefficient similarity loss.  
2. Justify the use of handcrafted filters and high-order statistics over direct 3D geometry reasoning.  
3. Highlight specific advantages of the method (e.g., uncertainty modeling, visual quality) through qualitative or quantitative experiments.  
4. Explore end-to-end learning approaches that combine filter optimization and inference.  
In summary, while the paper introduces an interesting and technically sound approach, its contributions and advantages over simpler methods need to be more clearly demonstrated.
