The paper introduces the Truncated Generalized Gradient Flow (TGGF) algorithm for solving quadratic linear systems, a problem that is NP-hard in general. The authors propose a two-stage approach: an orthogonality-promoting initialization and a refinement stage using truncated generalized gradient iterations. This method departs from traditional spectral initialization techniques and instead leverages power iterations to improve robustness and accuracy. The paper demonstrates that TGGF achieves exact recovery of the solution with high probability when the number of equations is proportional to the number of unknowns, and it does so with linear computational complexity. Empirical results show that TGGF outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms, such as Truncated Wirtinger Flow (TWF) and Wirtinger Flow (WF), in terms of accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency.
Strengths  
The paper is well-written, with a clear exposition of the problem, related work, and the proposed algorithm. The orthogonality-promoting initialization is a novel contribution, addressing the limitations of spectral methods, particularly under limited measurements. The theoretical guarantees provided in Theorem 1 are strong, demonstrating exact recovery under near-optimal conditions. The empirical results are comprehensive, including comparisons with TWF and WF under both noiseless and noisy settings. The authors provide detailed analysis and numerical evidence that TGGF achieves lower sample complexity and faster convergence than existing methods. Additionally, the algorithm's linear computational complexity makes it scalable for high-dimensional problems, a significant practical advantage.
Weaknesses  
While the results are solid, Theorem 1 assumes noiseless measurements, which limits its applicability to real-world scenarios where noise is inevitable. Although the authors briefly discuss the algorithm's performance in noisy settings, a formal theoretical analysis of TGGF's robustness to noise would strengthen the paper. Furthermore, the paper focuses primarily on Gaussian sampling models; extending the analysis to other distributions could broaden its applicability. Lastly, while the orthogonality-promoting initialization is innovative, its reliance on power iterations may introduce additional computational overhead compared to simpler spectral methods, particularly for very large datasets.

Conclusion  
Overall, this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of nonconvex optimization and phase retrieval. Despite some limitations, the proposed TGGF algorithm advances the state-of-the-art in solving quadratic linear systems, both theoretically and empirically. I recommend acceptance, with a suggestion to include a formal analysis of noisy scenarios in future work.
