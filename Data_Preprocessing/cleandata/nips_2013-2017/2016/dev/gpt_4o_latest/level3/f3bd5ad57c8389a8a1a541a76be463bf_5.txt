The paper addresses the problem of monocular depth estimation by proposing a cascaded two-stage neural network system. The first stage predicts depth derivative distributions locally, while the second stage integrates these predictions within a globalization framework to produce a coherent depth map. The approach is evaluated on the NYU v2 depth dataset, where it achieves state-of-the-art results. The authors argue that their method provides a richer representation of depth cues compared to prior works, leveraging an overcomplete set of local predictions to handle ambiguities in monocular depth estimation.
Strengths:
The paper is well-written and clearly organized, with a detailed explanation of the proposed method and its components. The use of probabilistic distributions for depth derivatives is an interesting idea, allowing the model to express uncertainty and ambiguity in its predictions. The globalization framework is efficient and effectively harmonizes local predictions into a coherent depth map. The experimental results are strong, demonstrating competitive performance on a standard benchmark. The ablation study provides valuable insights into the contributions of different components of the proposed system.
Weaknesses:
The primary weakness of the paper is its lack of sufficient novelty. The proposed system is conceptually similar to prior works, such as Eigen et al. and Liu et al., which also use neural networks for depth estimation. While the authors claim improvements, the source of these improvements is unclear due to inconsistent baseline comparisons. For instance, the comparison with Liu et al. is unfair, as the methods use different approaches (super-pixels vs. sliding window). Additionally, the motivation for the two-stage cascaded architecture is not well-justified, particularly in terms of how it resolves prediction ambiguities. The paper also misses several relevant references in semantic segmentation and related fields that employ similar architectures, which could have strengthened its contextual positioning.
Pro vs. Con Arguments for Acceptance:
- Pro: Strong experimental results, clear presentation, and an interesting use of probabilistic depth derivatives.
- Con: Limited novelty, unclear source of improvements, and insufficient engagement with related work.
Recommendation:
While the paper demonstrates strong results and is technically sound, its lack of originality and unclear experimental comparisons make it less suitable for a high-impact venue like NIPS. The authors should address the fairness of baseline comparisons, provide a stronger justification for the architectural design, and include missing references to contextualize their contributions better. For these reasons, I recommend rejection but encourage resubmission to a more specialized or less competitive venue after addressing these concerns.
