The paper presents a novel approach to monocular depth estimation by leveraging a neural network to predict distributions for high-order depth derivatives and subsequently harmonizing these predictions through a global optimization procedure. This method is evaluated on the NYU v2 depth dataset, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance. The authors argue that their approach provides a richer representation of local scene geometry compared to direct depth regression methods, and they highlight its potential applicability to other vision tasks.
Strengths:
1. Innovative Representation: The use of overcomplete representations with probabilistic outputs for depth derivatives is a novel contribution. This allows the network to express confidence and ambiguity in its predictions, which is a meaningful step forward in depth estimation.
2. Global Optimization: The globalization procedure effectively reconciles local predictions into a coherent depth map, demonstrating strong performance on the NYU v2 dataset.
3. Comprehensive Evaluation: The paper includes quantitative results, ablation studies, and qualitative visualizations, which collectively provide a thorough evaluation of the proposed method.
4. Potential for Generalization: The authors suggest that their approach could be extended to other tasks, such as motion estimation or intrinsic image decomposition, which broadens the impact of the work.
Weaknesses:
1. Motivation Concerns: The choice of a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for representing distributions and the chaining of multiple steps (local predictions followed by global optimization) lacks sufficient justification. It is unclear why the neural network's capabilities are not fully exploited for end-to-end learning.
2. Intermediate Representation: The necessity of fixed derivative filters and the absence of variance estimates for the final depth map raise questions about the robustness and completeness of the representation.
3. Similarity to Prior Work: The approach bears resemblance to methods like VLAD/FisherVector features and NetVLAD, but the differences are not clearly articulated. This diminishes the perceived originality of the method.
4. Clustering Details: The clustering process for initializing GMM parameters is underexplained. The impact of the number of clusters on the results is not systematically analyzed.
5. Architecture Choice: The specific neural network architecture is not justified, leaving readers uncertain about its suitability for the task.
6. Runtime and Scalability: The inference runtime (24 seconds per image) is relatively high, especially given the patch-based processing in the first stage. This could limit the method's applicability in real-time scenarios.
7. Visual Comparisons: The lack of visual comparisons to other methods makes it difficult to assess the robustness and qualitative advantages of the proposed approach.
8. Failure Cases: The paper does not adequately discuss failure cases or limitations, which would provide a more balanced evaluation.
9. Notation Issue: Referring readers to other papers for notation is inconvenient and detracts from the clarity of the presentation.
Recommendation:
While the paper introduces a novel and promising approach to monocular depth estimation, several aspects require further clarification and justification. The lack of motivation for key design choices, limited discussion of runtime efficiency, and insufficient differentiation from prior work are notable weaknesses. However, the strong quantitative results and potential for generalization make this a valuable contribution to the field. I recommend acceptance, contingent on the authors addressing these concerns in the final version.
