The authors introduce a novel algorithm, termed Truncated Generalized Gradient Flow, to address the challenge of solving a system of quadratic equations, an NP-hard problem. They demonstrate that their approach surpasses existing methods in terms of solution quality, achieving an exact solution with high probability even when the ratio of equations to unknowns approaches the theoretical minimum threshold—a scenario where other methods discussed in the manuscript fall short. Moreover, the proposed solution maintains a computational complexity that scales linearly with the time required to process the input data. The manuscript is well-written and well-structured. The problem is clearly articulated, and the proposed method is shown to provide a significant improvement over existing approaches, as evidenced by the comprehensive comparisons presented throughout the paper. The introduction is strong, but I recommend enhancing it by briefly summarizing the performance of existing methods in comparison to the proposed technique (lines 89–93 and 106–107 could also be relocated to the introduction to strengthen this section). Additionally, including a real-world example of a problem where solving such a system of equations is critical would be a valuable addition. This would further highlight the advantages of the proposed method over existing alternatives.
