The paper introduces a method for long-term trajectory planning that leverages macro-goals to influence micro-actions via a novel attention mechanism. The proposed approach demonstrates superior performance compared to non-hierarchical methods in modeling basketball players' behavior. The central idea of the paper—utilizing macro-goals to guide the selection of micro-actions—is compelling. However, I found the theoretical explanation of the method challenging to follow. Below are my comments regarding Section 3, "Long-Term Trajectory Planning":
1. Line 84: There is a typo. The variable \( t \) should belong to the half-open interval \([p, q)\), as this ensures that formulas (1) and (3) are consistent. Otherwise, the action \( at \) would incorrectly be included in the history \( h{t-n,t} \).
2. Lines [109,113): The definition of \( m \) is unclear. Is \( m \) intended to be a function or a random variable? It appears to be used in both contexts. If \( m \) is a function, then for a constant goal, it would yield a sequence of constant states and actions. Conversely, if \( m \) is a random variable, its values at different time steps would be uncorrelated. In either case, the role and interpretation of \( m \) remain ambiguous.
3. Formula (3): There may be a typo. Should the first integrand be \( P(a \mid g, s, h) \) instead of \( P(a \mid s, h) \)? This would align with Formula (1).
4. Formula (4): Based on Formula (2), \( mg \) is a probability density function. However, the interpretation of \( mg(a) \) is unclear. Formula (4) suggests that \( mg(a) \) is the Hadamard product of \( mg \) and \( a \). Assuming \( a \) is a vector, this implies that \( m_g \) must also be a vector. Does this create a conflict in notation? Further clarification is needed. Additionally, the notation \( \pi(s \mid g) \) might be misleading, as \( \pi(s) = P(a \mid s) \), meaning \( s \) is fixed, similar to \( g \). Perhaps \( \pi(s, g) \) would be a more appropriate notation.
While the technical details provided in the paper were insufficient to fully grasp the inner workings of the proposed method, the ideas presented are innovative and offer a fresh perspective on integrating macro-goals with micro-actions using memory networks. One potential limitation is the lack of an objective performance metric in the experiments, which rely solely on subjective visual assessments by experts. However, given the complexity of evaluating basketball trajectories, it is understandable that determining objective measures of quality is challenging.
