This paper introduces a novel algorithm for partial monitoring games. Departing from the UCB techniques employed in prior CPM models, the authors utilize an alternative classical approach, "forcing with certainty equivalence." Their proposed algorithm, PEGE, is constructed around a more straightforward oracle. Additionally, the algorithm can be integrated with gap estimation to achieve a regret bound comparable to previous results. The authors further demonstrate the applicability of this algorithm to online ranking. 
While the paper is promising, there are some areas for improvement:  
1. Certain sections lack clarity. For instance, the abstract is overly lengthy and includes excessive detail about prior work.  
2. Given the inclusion of an application (online ranking), real-world experimental results should be provided. Furthermore, since âˆš(log T) is often significantly smaller than T^(2/3), the observed improvement appears marginal. Additional justification for this aspect would strengthen the paper.
