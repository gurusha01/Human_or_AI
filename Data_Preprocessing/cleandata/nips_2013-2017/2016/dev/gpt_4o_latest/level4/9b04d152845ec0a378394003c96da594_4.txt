The paper introduces the use of element-wise multiplication for joint residual mapping in VQA. However, the overall quality of the paper is insufficient for publication due to the following reasons: - the performance does not achieve state-of-the-art results. - the idea lacks novelty, as a similar framework has already been explored in [1].
