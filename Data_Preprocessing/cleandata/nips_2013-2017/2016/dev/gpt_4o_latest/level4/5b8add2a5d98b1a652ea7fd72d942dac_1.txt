The paper introduces a novel algorithm for addressing random systems of quadratic equations, a critical problem in signal processing that falls under the category of phase retrieval problems. Similar to previously proposed algorithms (e.g., the truncated Wirtinger flow algorithm), the proposed method consists of two stages: an initialization step followed by iterative refinement of the solution. Unlike the (truncated) spectral initialization methods employed in prior works, the authors present a new orthogonality-promoting initialization approach, which avoids the well-documented limitations of spectral methods that depend on heavy-tailed distributed quantities. The empirical results clearly demonstrate the superiority of this new initialization method compared to earlier approaches. 
Building on the initial approximation, the paper introduces an iterative truncated-generalized-gradient algorithm to minimize a non-convex and non-smooth amplitude-based cost function (as opposed to an intensity-based one), further refining the solution. Under the assumption of Gaussian design, the authors provide a rigorous analysis proving that the algorithm converges to the correct solution at an exponential rate, provided the initial approximation is sufficiently accurate. As I understand it, the proof hinges on a novel insight that shows how a carefully designed truncation of the generalized gradient components prevents the algorithm from being misdirected toward spurious directions during the optimization process. Empirical results indicate that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art methods and significantly reduces the number of equations required to solve the problem, thereby substantially closing the gap toward the information-theoretic lower bound on the number of equations needed.
The paper is well-written and straightforward to follow. Although I was not previously familiar with this specific problem, the background and connections to prior work provided in the paper effectively contextualized the motivation for the proposed algorithm. The theoretical analysis and state-of-the-art empirical results are compelling, and as someone outside the phase retrieval domain (while relying on the authors' integrity), I believe the contributions of this work will have a significant impact on future research in the field.
Some minor issues:
- In line 133, should it read "for sufficiently small step size"?  
- In line 152, is the subscript t missing for z?  
- In equation 9, could you explicitly define h, as its current form is somewhat unclear?
