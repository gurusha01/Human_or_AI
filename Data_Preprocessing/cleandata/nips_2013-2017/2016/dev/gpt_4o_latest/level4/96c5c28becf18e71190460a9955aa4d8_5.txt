The paper addresses the challenge of determining the optimal timing for taking an action in decision-making under uncertainty. This is equivalent to identifying the appropriate threshold in the drift-diffusion model, which is widely used for two-alternative forced choice tasks. The authors propose two approaches—REINFORCE and Bayesian optimization—for learning this threshold. The paper highlights an important problem and is well-presented. However, as noted by the authors, no biologically plausible implementation is provided. Additionally, based on my understanding, the current models focus solely on minimizing Bayes risk. In biological systems, there is also a cost associated with observing and accumulating evidence (see Drugowitsch et al., 2012, J Neuro). How might this cost of observation be incorporated into the proposed methods for learning the threshold?
