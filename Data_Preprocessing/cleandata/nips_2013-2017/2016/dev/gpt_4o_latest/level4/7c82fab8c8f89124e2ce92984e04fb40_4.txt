This paper addresses the (recently proposed) problem of selective inference in linear models with group sparsity. The authors introduce novel estimators for constructing confidence intervals and for testing selected groups. The manuscript is well-written and appears to make a meaningful contribution to this field (although my familiarity with prior work is limited to the references provided by the authors). The theoretical findings are substantial, and the experimental results appear encouraging.
