A novel deep architecture for generative image modeling, referred to as MatNets, is introduced. The model's performance is evaluated against the state of the art using likelihood metrics. It integrates concepts from various successful generative image models, resulting in a fairly complex design. While the achieved performance is strong, it offers only marginal improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods.
