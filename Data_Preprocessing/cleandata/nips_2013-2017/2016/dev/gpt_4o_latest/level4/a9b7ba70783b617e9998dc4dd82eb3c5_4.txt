The paper accomplishes the following: 1. explores various metrics on cluster trees, establishes the equivalence between the l-infinity norm and the merge distortion norm, explains why a modified merge distortion metric is incompatible with their analysis, and ultimately opts for the l-infinity norm in their study. 2. develops asymptotic confidence sets for cluster trees using a KDE estimator combined with bootstrapping. 3. proposes a pruning method to simplify the trees within the confidence set and introduces a partial ordering framework for the trees. This is a well-written and insightful contribution. The construction of confidence intervals for cluster trees appears to be a significant advancement, and in pursuing this, the authors seem to have introduced a substantial amount of novel theoretical work.
