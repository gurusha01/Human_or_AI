This paper presents methods for constructing and summarizing confidence sets for the unknown true cluster tree, showcasing these approaches through various synthetic examples and further demonstrating their applicability in analyzing a Graft-versus-Host Disease (GvHD) dataset. My sole concern with this paper is the lack of comparison with other methods, which somewhat weakens the experimental section.
