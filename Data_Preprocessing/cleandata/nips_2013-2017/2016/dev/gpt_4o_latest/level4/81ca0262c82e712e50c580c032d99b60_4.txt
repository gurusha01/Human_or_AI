The authors address two submodular optimization problems inspired by directed information maximization, where directed information is employed as a measure of causality. While directed information is not widely accepted as a definitive measure of causality, especially in scenarios involving more than two variables (e.g., the example application of learning causal graphs), it remains a relevant and commonly used metric in certain contexts. The authors then generalize their discussion to a non-monotone submodular function and introduce a "submodularity index" (SmI) to quantify the degree of submodularness based on the collective diminishing value of the function's derivative. This metric enables potentially tighter bounds on the optimum value of submodular maximization problems, though the relationship between these bounds and the randomized greedy algorithm's results is complex, and the practical benefit is unclear. While the problem statements are theoretically interesting, they are not well justified. The submodularity sections are compelling in isolation, without invoking a causal interpretation.
The authors are imprecise in their use of the term "causality." Directed information is not a universally accepted causality measure and cannot generally predict the effects of interventions on a system. It is recommended that the authors frame their work as a submodular optimization study with applications in directed information maximization. This approach would emphasize the paper's primary technical contributions in submodular optimization while avoiding contentious discussions about the validity of directed information as a causality metric. Additionally, the authors should address gaps in the causality literature discussed in the introduction, particularly conditional independence-based, score-based methods, and structural equation-based approaches. Citing foundational texts by Pearl or Glymour and justifying the use of directed information as an alternative in dynamic systems would strengthen the paper.
The problem formulation contains inaccuracies and lacks sufficient justification. For example, the claim that "The optimal locations can be obtained by maximizing the causality from selected location set S to its complement \bar{S}" is problematic. First, the term "causality" should be replaced with "directed information" to avoid confusion, as directed information is not universally accepted as a causality measure. Second, the claim that directed information can identify pollution source sites (as suggested in the supplementary material) is incorrect. For instance, in a causal graph with a collider structure (X → Z ← Y), selecting X and Y does not necessarily maximize the directed information to Z, rendering this approach unsuitable for identifying source nodes. The authors should rephrase their objectives accordingly.
The second problem, which involves maximizing directed information from one set of nodes to another (termed "causal covariate selection"), suffers from similar issues. These limitations stem not merely from the authors' choice of causality definition but from fundamental problems with the proposed approach. For example, the motivation involving advertisers selecting opinion leaders to maximize ad influence implies intervention. However, directed information does not account for the causal sources of the network, meaning that intervening on a child node would not affect its parent nodes. The authors should avoid making claims about intervention outcomes based on directed information.
The problem's motivation suggests that the set S contains variables that "influence" or "summarize" others. This implies causal subgraphs of the form s1 → Y ← s2, which violates the condition in Proposition 2. Consequently, it is unlikely that s1 and s2 would be independent given Y under the problem's setup. The definition of the submodularity index (SmI) in equation (7) is novel and measures the "submodularness" of a set function. However, minimizing SmI requires searching over two disjoint subsets, S and A. Proposition 3 (stated without proof) claims that the minimized term is a supermodular function, allowing SmI to be computed using supermodular minimization tools with cardinality constraints. However, since SmI involves a search over both S and A, solving for SmI effectively entails solving exponentially many supermodular minimization problems. The authors should clarify why Algorithm 1 runs in O(nk) time by explicitly stating that calculating Mi does not require a search, as the objective is a modular function of Mi's elements.
In the simulations: For the "Causal Subset Selection Results," it appears that the "1/e reference bound" refers to e × Random Greedy, while the "Upper bound by SI" refers to Random Greedy/(1/e + Δ), where Δ is the additional term in Theorem 3. This should be explicitly stated in the paper. In the causal structure learning application, the authors do not define the causal graph in the main paper (only in the appendix). It is essential to define the causal graph in the main text, as no universally accepted definition exists. From the appendix, it is clear that this framework applies only to "directed information graphs." From a Pearlian perspective, directed information is insufficient for learning causal graphs. The authors should explicitly state that the application is limited to learning directed information graphs.
The numbering of theorems and lemmas in the main paper and supplementary material is inconsistent. For instance, Theorem 1 in the main paper does not align with the numbering in the supplementary file, where all theorems and lemmas are numbered sequentially starting from 1. This inconsistency should be corrected for easier cross-referencing. The notation in the proof of Theorem 2 is inconsistent and potentially confusing. For example, \bar{A \cup {y}}t might be mistaken for yt. Additionally, the authors inconsistently use A^t ∪ {y}^t instead of (A ∪ {y})^t. It is recommended to use extra spacing or alternative notation (e.g., |_t) to improve clarity. Furthermore, I(X,Y|Z) should be written as I(X;Y|Z). The proof of Theorem 2 is correct but would benefit from using \coloneqq (or similar) to distinguish definitions from equalities. The proof of Proposition 1 is also correct but omits some final steps. The proof of Proposition 2 is unclear; the term "causal naive Bayesian" is not defined, and the proof should be completed. Proofs for Proposition 3 should be included in the supplementary material.
Additional issues include inconsistent labeling (e.g., Lemma 1 in the main paper is labeled as Lemma 2 in the supplementary material), undefined terms (e.g., "deviance" in Lemma 2's proof), and missing references (e.g., \ref{.} in "lemma:proba" within Theorem 7's proof). Typos (e.g., "he" instead of "the") and placeholders (e.g., "??") in the supplementary material should also be addressed. A thorough proofreading of the supplementary material is recommended.
