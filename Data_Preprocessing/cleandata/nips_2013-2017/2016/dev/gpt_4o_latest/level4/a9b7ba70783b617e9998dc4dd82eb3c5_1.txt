The authors aim to estimate the cluster tree of an unknown density based on an observed sample. Their proposed estimator corresponds to the cluster tree derived from a kernel density estimator. The accuracy of this estimator is analyzed in terms of the sup-norm of the underlying density, which is demonstrated to align with a natural metric on the space of clustering trees. To quantify uncertainty, the authors propose confidence sets constructed via a bootstrap procedure. Additionally, they define a method to identify a tree within these confidence sets that has a simpler structure than the cluster tree of the kernel density estimator while preserving key topological features. Experimental results are presented using both simulated and real-world datasets.  
1. The manuscript is well-written and engaging, offering valuable insights to the reader. However, the primary result is somewhat disappointing: while the introduction claims that estimating the cluster tree instead of the density itself mitigates the curse of dimensionality, the authors provide no formal guarantees for the accuracy of their estimator. Specifically, they do not estimate \( T{p0} \) directly but rather \( T{ph} \), where \( h \) is a small but arbitrary bandwidth. Accurate estimation of \( T{p0} \) would require \( h \) to be sufficiently small (less than some unknown threshold \( h_0 \), as noted on line 192). Consequently, the curse of dimensionality is not actually circumvented.  
2. In Theorem 3, which lacks a proof, I am surprised by the absence of any dependency on \( B \).  
3. In my opinion, all references to \( d_{MM} \) should be removed.
