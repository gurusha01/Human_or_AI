The cluster tree of a probability density function offers a hierarchical depiction of its high-density regions. This paper addresses statistical inference for the cluster tree corresponding to an unknown density \( p0 \), given an iid sample from it. Specifically, the authors propose a bootstrap-based confidence set for the cluster tree of an object closely related to \( p0 \). The shape of this confidence set is determined by a metric defined on cluster trees, which is well-suited to the problem at hand. Although the confidence set is presented somewhat implicitly, the authors introduce methods to derive "informative" representatives within the set that preserve the "statistically significant" features of the cluster tree. I found the paper to be both original and engaging. However, I am curious about the connections to nonparametric inference for density functions. I assume that constructing a confidence set for the cluster tree of \( p0 \) is fundamentally distinct from constructing a confidence set for \( p0 \) itself, which justifies directly addressing the former problem rather than deriving it indirectly (e.g., by considering \( \{Tp : p \in C\alpha\} \), where \( C\alpha \) is a confidence set for \( p0 \)). For instance, focusing on \( ph \) rather than \( p0 \) seems reasonable insofar as \( T{ph} \) aligns with \( T{p0} \), but not necessarily in terms of how \( ph \) compares to \( p0 \). 
A few comments:  
1. Since the confidence set is implicit, the primary tangible contribution of this work appears to be the method for pruning the tree while preserving statistical guarantees. This aspect might be worth emphasizing further.  
2. If I wanted to test \( H0: T{ph} = T0 \), I could, in principle, use any statistic rather than \( d\infty \), and then invert the tests (as you suggest) to form a confidence set. The choice of \( d\infty \) (or any other metric discussed in the paper) feels somewhat arbitrary. While I understand that exploring notions of "optimality" for these statistics may be beyond the scope of the paper, are there additional justifications for selecting \( d_\infty \)?
