This paper introduces a method for conducting group-sparse inferences in (sparse) feature selection techniques by leveraging the conditional probability density \|P\mathcal{L}Y\|2. Specifically, it aims to provide p-values and confidence intervals for the selected features/coefficients. The authors investigate three sparse regression methods, present algorithms for performing inferences on each, and validate their approach through experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets. 
1. The proposed method focuses on performing inferences for groups of columns in X. What are the advantages or motivations for conducting inferences on groups rather than on individual columns?  
2. In practical applications, how do you determine which columns should be grouped together?  
3. Are the groups of columns mutually exclusive, or can they overlap?  
4. Lines 61-63: Could you elaborate on the process of "controlling for the remaining selected groups"?  
5. Lines 109-110: What is meant by "conditioning on the direction dir_\mathcal{L}(Y)"? Please clarify this concept.  
6. Lines 113-114: What do you mean by "independence between the length and the direction of P\mathcal{L}Y"? When P\mathcal{L}\mu\neq0, why does this independence break down, leading to dependence?  
7. Line 255: The matrix X is 500 by 500, correct? Do the columns within each group exhibit any shared structural properties? If the entries of X are independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.), how do you decide which columns should be grouped together?  
8. Lines 279-280: Regarding the real dataset, how do you determine the groupings and their sizes? Why do you expand a single column into a group of three rather than combining different columns? This approach does not seem to introduce new information.  
9. How is the performance of the proposed method evaluated? Is there a baseline or alternative inference method used for comparison? Could you compare the proposed approach to the method described in reference 6?  
10. For the real dataset, since each group is derived from a single column of the original data, why do the p-values vary so significantly when using the same method? For instance, in the "Forward stepwise" case, when the group size is 3, the p-value for "Obese" is 0, which differs substantially from 0.519 when the group size is 1. Which result is more reliable or accurate?
