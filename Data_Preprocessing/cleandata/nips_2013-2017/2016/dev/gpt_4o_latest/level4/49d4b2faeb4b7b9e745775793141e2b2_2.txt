The authors introduce a novel hierarchical generative model, MatNet, which integrates recent advancements in the field, such as DRAW-type models, Ladder Networks, and residual networks. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of negative log-likelihood (NLL) on several datasets (MNIST, Omniglot, CIFAR-10) and demonstrates impressive qualitative inpainting results on others (CelebA, LSUN). 
Technical Quality: The experimental section is well-executed, with a clear and reproducible protocol. Comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, including some very recent ones (e.g., Pixel RNN), were provided. However, I would have appreciated a side-by-side comparison for the qualitative results, which was not included in the main paper or the supplementary material.
Novelty: The authors build upon recent advances in the field and contribute meaningfully by, for example, employing a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) as a prior over zâ‚€ instead of the conventional single Gaussian prior.
Clarity: The quality and clarity of Figure 1 could be significantly improved. Additionally, it was unclear what distinguished the supplementary material from the main paper, aside from the inclusion of additional images in the supplementary section.
