This paper explores the combinatorial version of partial monitoring games in stochastic environments. It introduces two algorithms that rely on forced exploration instead of confidence bounds. The first algorithm achieves a distribution-free regret bound that matches the state of the art while utilizing a simpler oracle. The second algorithm achieves a distribution-dependent regret bound, also matching the state of the art. Notably, the regret bounds for both algorithms are determined by the size of a specific covering of the action set, rather than its cardinality.
After rebuttal addendum:  
------------------------------------  
Rev_1: Lines 249-253: The authors claim that their algorithm for "online ranking with top-1 feedback," originally developed for the adversarial setting, can be generalized to the combinatorial partial monitoring (CPM) framework and applied to the stochastic setting. They argue that this allows the specific "online ranking" problem to be addressed within the stochastic framework using their general CPM algorithm. However, I find this explanation unclear, particularly the use of the term "even." To clarify: a stochastic adversary is inherently less powerful than an oblivious adversary. While I agree that the stochastic instance of the ranking problem can be addressed using the proposed approach, the existing algorithm already handles oblivious adversaries, which your method does not appear to do. This distinction highlights a limitation of the current approach. That said, I am curious about any potential advantages your stochastic iid assumption might provide. Specifically, it would be useful to compare the regret bounds in terms of their dependence on problem parameters. I view this as a minor point that the authors should be able to address.

This paper tackles a significant and timely problem at the forefront of online learning theory, improving the dependence on key parameters such as oracle requirements and the action set's structure. The discussion of related work is thorough, and the connections to existing approaches are clearly articulated. I would support the inclusion of this paper at NIPS. However, I strongly recommend that the manuscript undergo a thorough proofread to address issues with grammar and style, particularly the use of articles ('the/a'), pluralization, and comma placement. Below are some additional minor comments:  
- Line 117: S(x) should be S(\theta_p^*).  
- Line 118: \bar r is introduced before being defined in Assumption 1 (line 121).  
- Line 241: This would be an excellent point to discuss the feasibility of combining the benefits of the various algorithms. What would be required to achieve an anytime, argmax-oracle algorithm, and what currently prevents this?  
- Lines 249-253: It appears that an algorithm designed for the non-stochastic (oblivious adversary) case is strictly more versatile than a distribution-independent stochastic algorithm. What specific advantages does your stochastic approach offer? Are there improved dependencies on problem parameters?  
- Line 305: The expectation symbol is missing \mathbb.
