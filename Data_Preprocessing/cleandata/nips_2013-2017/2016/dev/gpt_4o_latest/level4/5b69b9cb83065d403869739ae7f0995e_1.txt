This paper introduces a method to leverage monolingual corpora for enhancing a Neural Machine Translation (NMT) system. The proposed framework utilizes reinforcement learning to provide feedback to two NMT systems (one for each direction of a given language pair). The approach is clearly explained and demonstrates significant performance improvements. Overall, the paper is well-written. Although the work does not introduce fundamentally new concepts in machine learning, it effectively combines various innovations to create a robust framework that could open up new avenues in natural language processing. 
A general comment: Could the feedback function also incorporate the language model corresponding to the source sentence? While I am unsure how to implement this, it might serve as an indicator of sentence complexity, potentially helping to adjust feedback for problematic source sentences. Additionally, could you clarify the rationale for discarding sentences containing at least one unknown word? This issue seems manageable within your framework. Did you explore alternative approaches?
Specific comments:
- Line 254: Avoid repeating "in Table 3."
- Line 255: The word "For" should be in lowercase.
