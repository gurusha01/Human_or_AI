This paper introduces the use of the Barzilai-Borwein (BB) method to automatically tune the step size in SGD/SVRG. The authors establish the linear convergence of not only SVRG-BB but also SVRG with option-I, addressing a gap in the literature where the proof for the latter has been absent. Experimental results demonstrate that SVRG-BB, initialized with various step sizes, achieves performance comparable to the best-tuned SVRG. The paper is well-written, and the motivation for employing the BB method is clear. The theoretical analyses are sound. While the contribution is somewhat incremental, the paper is valuable to the community as it supplements the missing proof for SVRG-I and introduces practical methods. It would be beneficial if the authors could provide a theoretical guarantee for applying the BB method to vanilla SGD and other stochastic optimization algorithms.
