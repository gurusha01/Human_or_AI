The authors investigate two interconnected problems, termed source detection (OPT1) and causal covariate selection (OPT2). While OPT1 aligns with prior research on sensor selection, this work distinguishes itself by employing directed information instead of the commonly used mutual information. Similarly, OPT2 relates to decades of research on causal covariate selection, though prior studies often rely on strong modeling assumptions. The authors propose using directed information as a non-parametric alternative for OPT2. They demonstrate that OPT1 is submodular but not monotone, enabling performance guarantees for greedy search, whereas OPT2 is monotone but generally not submodular. A novel metric, the submodularity index (SmI), is introduced to quantify the degree of submodularity, and the authors derive performance bounds for maximizing OPT1 and OPT2 under cardinality constraints, with the bounds depending on SmI. The paper also includes experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets, showcasing the algorithm's performance and empirically observed SmI values.
Overall, the work is promising and contains several contributions that are likely to interest the NIPS community. However, significant revisions are necessary for OPT2 to meet the conference's standards. Additionally, the paper lacks citations to closely related work on OPT2. Several minor issues also need to be addressed, as detailed below.
Major Comments (Strengths):
- Relevance and Novelty: Both problems are highly relevant to the NIPS community. OPT2, in particular, has been a longstanding challenge across various domains. The use of a non-parametric method for OPT2 is appealing, as it avoids reliance on strong modeling assumptions.
- Submodularity Index (SmI): The introduction of SmI as a measure of submodularity is intriguing and contextually appropriate. While SmI is highly dependent on the function and cardinality constraint, this flexibility seems necessary given the theoretical results and empirical analysis.
- Performance Bounds: The derived performance guarantees are valuable and applicable to a broad range of combinatorial optimization problems.
- Empirical Validation: The application of the proposed methods to both simulated and real-world data lends credibility to the approach. The inclusion of empirical SmI values is particularly insightful, as it provides evidence supporting the use of greedy methods when exact solutions are computationally infeasible.
Major Comments (Areas for Improvement):
(A) Quasi-Submodularity and OPT2:
The primary concern lies in the practical utility of the performance bounds for OPT2. While the results for OPT1 are robust due to its submodularity, the bounds for OPT2 hinge on the notion of "quasi-submodularity," which is insufficiently defined and justified. The authors repeatedly claim that OPT2 is "nearly submodular in particular cases" or that the guarantees degrade "slightly" when SmI is close to zero. However, these statements lack rigorous justification or concrete examples. 
- Definition of "Close": The term "close to zero" for SmI is ambiguous. A precise definition is required, potentially relative to the expected value of the objective function (e.g., ensuring the bound in Corollary 1 is nontrivial).
- Examples of Quasi-Submodularity: The paper does not provide non-trivial examples where OPT2 is quasi-submodular. Proposition 2 is an extreme case that assumes conditional independence, which is highly restrictive and unlikely to hold in practical scenarios. For instance, even when causal covariates are marginally independent, conditional independence often fails (e.g., XOR relationships in binary variables). The authors should either identify specific classes of distributions where OPT2 is quasi-submodular or provide empirical evidence across diverse datasets.
- Empirical Evidence: While the experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of randomized greedy methods, this does not imply quasi-submodularity. Additional empirical analysis is needed to establish the prevalence of quasi-submodularity in real-world scenarios. For example, the authors could explore datasets beyond a single stock and examine SmI values across varying cardinalities and problem instances.
If proving quasi-submodularity for OPT2 is infeasible, the authors could instead provide extensive empirical evidence to support their claims. For instance, defining "close" in terms of ensuring nontrivial bounds in Corollary 1 and demonstrating this across multiple datasets would strengthen the paper.
(B) Missing Citations:
The paper omits references to closely related work, particularly for OPT2. Notably:
- The work by Quinn et al., "Bounded Degree Approximations of Stochastic Networks" (arXiv:1506.04767), appears highly relevant. Section 5 of their paper addresses cardinality-constrained causal covariate selection, proposing an approximate submodularity measure and deriving bounds for deterministic greedy search. While their submodularity measure differs from SmI, it may provide insights into OPT2. Additionally, their ISIT 2013 paper contains similar results.
- A recent paper, "Submodular Variational Inference for Network Reconstruction" (arXiv:1603.08616), may also be relevant, though it assumes a diffusion model and is less directly applicable to OPT2.
Incorporating these references and clarifying how the proposed work differs from or builds upon them would enhance the paper's positioning within the literature.
Minor Comments:
- Examples for Proposition 2: Provide concrete examples where Proposition 2 holds, especially if broader quasi-submodularity cannot be established.
- Directed Information for Sets: Clarify how the CTW algorithm was adapted for sets. If modifications were made, discuss their theoretical implications and potential performance trade-offs for finite data.
- Guidance on Cardinality (k): Offer practical guidance for selecting the cardinality constraint \( k \), considering both computational trade-offs and sensitivity of the approximation bounds.
- Algorithm Explanation: Add a brief explanation of randomized greedy in Algorithm 1 to improve clarity (e.g., "At each step, instead of selecting the best element, one of the top \( k \) elements is chosen at random").
- Ambiguity in Line 131: Replace "any" with "every" to avoid confusion.
- References for Section 2: Cite sources for the quantities introduced in Section 2.
- Reference Formatting: Standardize capitalization and formatting in the reference section (e.g., "Gaussian" in line 313, journal names in lines 340 and 346, conference titles in line 358).
- Notation in Lemma 2: Clarify the notation in line 197 (e.g., whether \( y \) represents processes and the relationship between \( Y \) and \( \{y1, \dots, yM\} \)).
- Empirical Observations: Address the discrepancy between the lower bound for SmI in line 201 and the worst-case empirical results for \( k = 2 \).
- Grammar and Clarity: Fix grammatical errors (e.g., line 205: "with each element appears in"), clarify ambiguous terms (e.g., "p1" in the formula below line 201), and improve notation (e.g., replace \( |S^{gk}| = k \) with \( k \) in line 238).
- Data Description: Provide details on data preprocessing, including discretization methods for the stock data.
- Ground Truth Claims: Avoid asserting that the results are "sufficient" for real-world data without ground truth validation.
- Equation References: Include equation references for terms like "the 1/e bound" in line 261.
By addressing these concerns, particularly the issues surrounding quasi-submodularity and missing citations, the paper would be significantly strengthened and better aligned with the standards of the NIPS community.
