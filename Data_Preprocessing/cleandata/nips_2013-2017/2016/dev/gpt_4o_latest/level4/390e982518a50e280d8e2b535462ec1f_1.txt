This paper integrates multiple graph kernels with a diffusion-convolutional neural network. Specifically, the authors propose assigning a weight to the jth hop transition for feature k in the first layer and subsequently generating an activation for each combination of node, hop, feature, and graph. This approach allows the weights to be learned directly from the data. The work is highly significant, as the challenge of learning kernels from graph labels has not been thoroughly explored in the existing literature. However, the paper could benefit from greater clarity, as the definitions of the power spectrum P star and the hop are not sufficiently precise. While I believe I understand the methodology, the average reader might struggle with these ambiguities. On the other hand, the experiments are both comprehensive and highly informative.
