The paper begins by presenting the existing framework of combinatorial partial monitoring games, where the learner chooses actions from an exponentially large set, and the adversary samples moves from a bounded, continuous space. To address this problem, the authors propose two algorithms inspired by forced exploration techniques prevalent in the bandit literature. The first algorithm, termed Phased Exploration with Greedy Exploitation (PEGE), operates without requiring prior knowledge of the time horizon. The authors provide both distribution-dependent and distribution-independent upper bounds for PEGE. The second algorithm, PEGE2, aims to estimate the gap between the best and second-best actions, thereby achieving improved distribution-dependent bounds. The authors demonstrate that PEGE2 attains the same upper bound as GCB, the current state-of-the-art algorithm for combinatorial partial monitoring, while eliminating the dependence on the size of the learner's action space. The paper concludes by discussing potential applications of the proposed algorithms, particularly in the context of online ranking with feedback on the top.
The paper is well-written and easy to comprehend. The combinatorial partial monitoring framework is clearly articulated. The primary technical contributions are the PEGE and PEGE2 algorithms, along with a thorough analysis of their regret upper bounds. The authors consistently benchmark their algorithms against GCB, the only existing algorithm addressing the same problem. The advantages and limitations of the proposed algorithms relative to GCB are well-justified. However, I was disappointed by the absence of experimental results comparing the practical performance of PEGE/PEGE2 to GCB. While the computational benefits of requiring a single argmax are well-explained, empirical evaluations showcasing the regret performance of PEGE/PEGE2 relative to GCB would have been valuable. Toward the end of the paper, the authors outline a potential application of their algorithms to the real-world problem of online ranking with feedback on the top. This application is a welcome addition, but the claim that this limited feedback setting addresses user privacy concerns is not entirely clear to me.
