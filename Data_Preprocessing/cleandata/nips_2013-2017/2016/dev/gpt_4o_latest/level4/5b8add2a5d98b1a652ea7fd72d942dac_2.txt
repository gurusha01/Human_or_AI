This paper introduces a novel algorithm, termed the truncated generalized gradient flow (TGGF), for addressing quadratic linear systems. The proposed method employs an orthogonality-promoting initialization followed by iterative scaled updates, distinguishing it from prior approaches in the literature that typically rely on spectral initializations. Overall, I found the paper to be well-written, with robust and convincing results. However, the primary result, Theorem 1, is derived under the assumption of noiseless measurements. Could the authors explore whether this result can be extended to scenarios involving noisy measurements?
