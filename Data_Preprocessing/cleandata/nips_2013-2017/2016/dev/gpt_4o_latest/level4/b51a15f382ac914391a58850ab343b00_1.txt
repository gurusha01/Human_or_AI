The authors address the stochastic combinatorial partial monitoring (CPM) problem. In this framework, at each round, an unknown vector θ is drawn from a fixed but unknown distribution. The operator selects an arm from a potentially infinite set and receives a reward determined by a known function of the chosen arm and θ. However, instead of observing the reward or the full vector θ, the operator receives a known arm-dependent linear transformation of θ and aims to minimize regret. The authors propose a first algorithm based on the Phased Exploration and Greedy Exploitation (PEGE) strategy. This approach alternates between phases of full exploration and greedy exploitation, with phase lengths predetermined. Additionally, they introduce a variant of this algorithm that incorporates an initial phase to estimate the gap. The authors provide theoretical analysis for both algorithms, deriving problem-dependent and problem-independent regret bounds. These bounds exhibit the same dependence on T as prior work but are independent of the number of arms and, in the case of the problem-independent bound, do not require the assumption of a unique optimal arm. The paper also includes an application example in the context of online ranking. 
The manuscript is well-written and clearly presented. The use of the PEGE framework to eliminate dependence on the number of arms and the allocation of samples for gap estimation to improve the problem-dependent regret bound are noteworthy contributions. I recommend accepting this paper. However, I have a few questions for the authors: 
1. You do not discuss lower bounds for regret. Are there known lower bounds for the stochastic CPM problem, and if so, how do they compare to your results?  
2. You do not provide details about the selection of the global observable set. Is there a principled way to choose the global observable set σ to ensure that β_σ is minimized?  
I have reviewed the authors' rebuttal and maintained my scores.
