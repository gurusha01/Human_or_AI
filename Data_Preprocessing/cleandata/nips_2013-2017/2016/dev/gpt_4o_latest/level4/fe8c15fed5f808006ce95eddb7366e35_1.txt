This paper introduces a method for learning hierarchical policy models from demonstrations and applies the proposed approach to modeling player behavior in basketball. The authors leverage deep neural networks combined with an attention mechanism to integrate high-level objectives/goals with micro-actions. The research objective is compelling. However, in its current form, the technical contribution is difficult to interpret and evaluate, particularly for readers like myself who are familiar with reinforcement learning (RL) but lack extensive expertise in deep learning. Specifically, I found Section 4, which details the proposed method, challenging to follow as a non-expert in deep learning. Certain elements were not clearly defined (e.g., in Equation 5, what does "L" represent? Is it a loss function? If so, how is the loss defined?). Furthermore, the work does not appear to be adequately contextualized within the existing literature or compared against alternative approaches. For instance, prior research by George Konidaris and Sanjoy Krishnan on learning skills, macro-actions, or policies from demonstrations seems relevant but is neither cited nor discussed. I strongly encourage the authors to revise their manuscript and resubmit. Below are some references to related work that should be considered for inclusion and comparison:

Additionally, I would appreciate clarification on practical aspects of the approach, such as the source of weak labels in real-world applications.
