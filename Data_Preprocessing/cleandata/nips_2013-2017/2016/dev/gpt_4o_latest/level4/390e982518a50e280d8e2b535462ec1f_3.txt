This paper generalizes CNNs to process graph-structured data by proposing a diffusion-convolution operation. Comprehensive experiments are performed on multiple node and graph classification tasks, demonstrating superior performance compared to probabilistic relational models and kernel methods. Lines 109â€“110 state, "training is ceased if the validation error of a given epoch is greater than the average of the last few epochs." Have you considered alternative criteria, such as reducing the learning rate by half if the validation error of a given epoch exceeds that of the previous epoch? Additionally, in line 98, the word "graph" appears twice.
