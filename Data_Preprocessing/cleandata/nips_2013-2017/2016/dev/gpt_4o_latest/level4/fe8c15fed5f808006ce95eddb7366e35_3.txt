This paper addresses long-term trajectory planning by employing hierarchical policy models to capture macro-micro behavior dynamics. The proposed framework is implemented using a deep memory network with an attention mechanism, where the macro-planner provides guidance to the micro-planner. The results demonstrate that the method produces more realistic player trajectories. However, in the first paragraph of Section 3.1, the notation \( gt \) is introduced without prior definition. Additionally, the goal space is not concretely specifiedâ€”Is it a finite-dimensional space? If so, what is its dimensionality, and how is it represented in practical scenarios? Furthermore, the derivation of Equation (3) is unclear, as both the left-hand side and the right-hand side include \( P(at \mid st, h{t-n,t}) \), which seems unusual. Lastly, the process for obtaining the weak labels \( \hat{g}t \) and \( \hat{m}t \) is not explained.
