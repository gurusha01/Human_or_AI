This paper introduces a joint segmentation and transcription approach for handwritten paragraph recognition, building upon prior work that leverages multidimensional LSTM-RNNs for this task. The model employs connectionist temporal classification (CTC) to train the network. Extending the work in reference [6], the authors incorporate a weighted 'collapsing' step, where a weighted sum of the feature vector sequence is computed prior to the final step. This weighted collapse introduces an attentional mechanism into the recognition process, enhancing performance. Instead of a softmax, the final step utilizes a bidirectional LSTM (BLSTM) decoder, which outputs entire text lines rather than individual characters. This modification results in a significant speed-up, reportedly 20X to 30X, likely in terms of the number of iterations. The proposed method demonstrates improved recognition accuracy compared to previous approaches. The key contributions of this paper are the introduction of the weighted collapse layer (which incorporates an attentional mechanism) and the use of a BLSTM decoder (to output full sentences) for handwriting recognition. While these contributions represent logical extensions of earlier work, they lack a surprising or groundbreaking element. The improvement in recognition accuracy is clearly demonstrated in the results and is commendable. However, the claim regarding the speed-up is not adequately quantified. Additionally, a significant drawback of the manuscript is the presence of numerous typos, which the authors should address if the paper is accepted for publication.
