The paper presents an end-to-end network for correspondence matching. The authors propose a modified contrastive loss tailored for their network and implement it in a fully convolutional manner, which minimizes the number of forward passes required during both training and testing. Additionally, they incorporate a hard negative mining algorithm to accelerate the training process. The paper also introduces Convolutional Spatial Transformers, which are specialized layers designed to perform patch normalization independently for each activation in the ConvNet. 
The paper makes several contributions:  
- Utilizes Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs) for correspondence matching, significantly reducing computational complexity.  
- Proposes a modified contrastive loss adapted to their specific application.  
- Implements a hard negative mining strategy to expedite training.  
- Replaces traditional patch normalization with a convolutional spatial transformer layer.  
Among these contributions, I particularly appreciate the use of FCNs to address the problem, as it offers a more efficient alternative to patch-based methods. The discussion of related work is thorough, and the results are compared against several well-known methods. I find the experiments adequate to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
