This paper is well-written and presents practical algorithms for decision threshold optimization, which are evaluated through simulation.  
Major comments:  
- The paper provides a meaningful contribution to the theoretical literature on DDMs. However, it appears to be primarily targeted at a neuroscience/psychology audience, as these fields have been the primary users of such algorithms. Despite this, the paper lacks significant application to neuroscience or psychology. For instance, are the proposed algorithms cognitively or biologically plausible? Is there empirical evidence supporting these algorithms? What types of experiments could be designed to test the hypotheses presented?  
- Including learning curves for the two methods as a function of computation time, rather than trials, would be highly beneficial. This addition would clarify the optimal algorithm choice for a given computational budget.  
- The reason for the larger variance observed in Bayesian optimization is not explained and requires clarification.  
- Simen, Holmes & Cohen (2006) describe a neural network model for decision threshold optimization, claiming it to be neurally plausible. Similarly, Frank (2006) proposes a biologically plausible mechanism for threshold adjustment, though not within the DDM framework. Both models are presented as theories of how the brain might perform threshold optimization. These models should be discussed and compared, particularly in relation to empirical data, if the new model is to be considered a serious psychological or neural theory.  
I have reviewed the other comments and the author feedback, and I have decided to maintain my current scores.  
Minor comments:  
- p. 3: W0 and W1 seem to represent error costs, but this is not explicitly stated.  
- p. 3: Replace "sum collected" with "sum of collected."  
- Footnote 1: W0/W1 are referred to as thresholds, but it seems theta0/theta1 are intended here.  
- p. 4: Correct "dependance" to "dependence."
