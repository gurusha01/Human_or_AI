The paper introduces an almost everywhere differentiable generalization of the subgradient method to solve an over-determined system of quadratic equations with random coefficients, which is known to be inconsistent. The cost function is demonstrated to belong to the class of nonconvex and nonsmooth functions. The authors successfully established orthogonality by identifying an appropriate initialization, followed by updates using the generalized gradient iteration. The paper is commendable in terms of its structure, content, and presentation. The algorithm is well-justified, and the results are promising. However, it is suggested that the authors revisit the 4n-2 claim for the complex case mentioned on page 2. Additionally, reference [22] is incomplete, as it does not include the name(s) of the author(s).
