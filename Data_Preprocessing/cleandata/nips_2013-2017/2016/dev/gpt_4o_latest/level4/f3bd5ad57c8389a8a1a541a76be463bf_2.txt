This paper introduces a novel approach for estimating depth from single images. Unlike end-to-end CNN methods that directly regress depth values, the proposed method trains a neural network to predict distributional parameters corresponding to the zero-th, first, and second-order derivatives of the depth map. During inference, the predicted distributional parameters for all image pixels are processed through a globalization step, which 'harmonizes' these distributions. This step aims to estimate the depth map and its derivatives by maximizing the likelihoods of the parameter distributions. The approach is evaluated on the NYU v2 depth dataset, where it outperforms competing methods trained solely on this dataset but slightly underperforms compared to approaches that leverage additional supervision (e.g., pretrained VGG networks or semantic segmentation outputs). 
This is a technically robust paper, and the use of CNNs to predict distributional parameters for subsequent depth estimation represents an interesting and valuable contribution. While the core idea shares similarities with [Chakrabarti et al., CVPR 2015], I believe the differences between the two works are significant enough to justify a new publication. My primary concern arises from Figure 3, where the predicted individual coefficients exhibit numerous low-confidence regions. I suspect this is due to the network being applied independently to local image regions. Consequently, the accuracy of the final depth map heavily depends on the globalization procedure, which is executed as a separate, independent step. This approach appears to be at a disadvantage compared to competing methods, such as Eigen and Fergus [ICCV 2015], where multiple tasks (e.g., depth and normal prediction, semantic labeling) are jointly addressed within a single network architecture. Similarly, I wonder whether the proposed method could integrate local estimation and global harmonization into a unified network. 
I encourage the authors to provide additional commentary on the errors observed in Figure 3 and the specific patterns they exhibit. For example, while I understand that the smooth elliptical shapes are a consequence of the GMMs, the origin of the vertical high-frequency stripes remains unclear.
