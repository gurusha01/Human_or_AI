Drift-diffusion models are a well-established and neuroscience-backed framework for simulating the outcomes of two-alternative forced choice tasks in psychophysics and neuroscience. Decision-making under uncertainty is typically represented as a process of competitive evidence accumulation (a drift-diffusion process) that culminates in a decision when a threshold is reached. What constitutes the optimal threshold for a specific problem? By reframing the question as one of minimizing both stopping time and decision error, the authors derive an optimal threshold. This threshold is subsequently computed using two distinct algorithms that approach the optimization as a reinforcement learning problem. The work is well-executed and commendable; however, I would encourage the authors to apply their method to human or animal data (readily available online) rather than relying solely on synthetic examples. How close to optimal are humans, if at all? Providing insights into this question would significantly enhance the paper's impact and would lead me to consider elevating its rating.
