The paper introduces methods for constructing and summarizing confidence sets for the unknown true cluster tree and defines a partial ordering on cluster trees, which is employed to prune statistically insignificant features of the empirical tree.  
Clarity:  
- The paper lacks proper organization. The discussion and presentation of the main contribution (Section 4) are insufficient. Additionally, some parts of the main text, such as Section 3, could be moved to the supplementary material, as they do not appear closely related to the subsequent construction.  
- The title seems overly ambitious given the content provided. For instance, as stated in Section 1, statistical inference is expected to "quantify our uncertainty, ..., as well as rigorously test hypotheses related to the estimated cluster structure." However, the paper does not include any discussion on hypothesis testing.  
- Figures 4 and 5 would benefit from labeled x- and y-axes to make them self-contained.  
- The term "feature" is ambiguous and lacks a clear definition, leaving its meaning unclear.  
Innovation/Significance:  
- It would improve the paper to combine the results of Lemma 2 and Theorem 3 into a unified result on \( T{p0} \).  
- The authors have not provided comparisons with existing large-sample approximate confidence intervals, which is a critical omission. Furthermore, the paper does not discuss any practical scenarios where these complex confidence intervals could be applied effectively.  
- While one contribution is the convergence rate being independent of the dimension, this claim has not been validated in the experimental section.  
- Although the partial ordering and Lemma 2 are interesting contributions in their own right, the manuscript as a whole suffers from a lack of coherent presentation and robust validation.
