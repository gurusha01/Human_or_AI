The authors present a framework for assessing the significance and corresponding confidence intervals for a selected group of variables within the context of group-sparse regression. I found the paper challenging to follow. Unfortunately, this, combined with the high density of the content, hindered my ability to fully grasp the contributions of the work. Specifically, I am unclear about the incremental advancements over Loftus and Taylor, 2015. Based on my understanding, the paper aims to provide a methodology for testing, either iteratively or collectively, the relevance of groups of variables identified by group-sparse linear algorithms. The authors primarily focus on three such algorithms. While I recognize the potential benefits of being able to compute these significance results, I regret that I am unable to provide a thorough review of this paper. I apologize for this and hope that my fellow reviewers will feel more equipped to evaluate the work. 
That said, I will attempt to address the applications. Regarding the California data set example and Table 1, I am unclear on how the 3-variable groups are constructed. I had expected to see actual groups of variables, but it seems that the 3-variable groups are formed by "expanding" a single variable into three. Why not allow the algorithms to select groups of variables directly? I assume this choice might have been made for comparison purposes, but it also renders the results somewhat ambiguous. Overall, I would have appreciated a more algorithmic presentation of the procedure somewhere in the paper. Based on the current description, I am uncertain about how this method is or could be implemented.
