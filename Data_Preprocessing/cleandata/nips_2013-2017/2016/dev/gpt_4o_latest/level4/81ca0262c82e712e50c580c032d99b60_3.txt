The central idea of this paper is to reformulate the two problems—source detection and causal covariate selection—into cardinality-constrained directed information (DI) maximization problems. The authors demonstrate that the objective function for source detection, which is the DI from the selected set to its complement, is submodular but not monotonic. For the causal covariate selection problem, where the objective is the DI from the selected set to a target process, it is shown that the function is not submodular. However, the authors introduce a novel concept termed "near-submodularity," which holds for this problem in certain instances. Additionally, the paper introduces a new metric called the submodularity index (SmI) to quantify how "submodular" a set function is. For non-submodular functions, SmI is negative, but if its value is not too small, the random-greedy algorithm can still achieve near-optimal performance, even for non-monotone functions. 
As a separate contribution, the authors derive near-optimality bounds for the random-greedy algorithm's performance based on SmI. These bounds are then applied to analyze the algorithm's behavior for the two primary problems addressed in the paper (source detection and causal covariate selection). Since computing SmI is generally intractable (requiring exponential time in the size of the ground set), the authors provide a simple lower bound for SmI specifically for the two problems considered. These theoretical findings are further validated through numerical experiments. 
The paper is well-written for the most part, and I found it enjoyable to read. Beyond proposing efficient algorithms for source detection and causal covariate selection, I believe a key contribution of the paper lies in demonstrating the near-optimality of the random-greedy algorithm in terms of the submodularity index (SmI). This suggests that for functions that are "approximately" submodular (i.e., have a small SmI), the greedy algorithm can perform effectively. However, since computing SmI is exponential in the size of the ground set, I recommend that the authors: (i) derive computable bounds for SmI (similar to Lemma 2) for other classes of set functions, and (ii) explore additional applications where SmI is small. 
I would also like to point out that the bound provided in Lemma 2 becomes impractical as \( n \) grows, since the mutual information terms are likely to scale with \( n \). Therefore, I suggest the authors investigate the performance of the random-greedy algorithm on problems (e.g., source detection) with a larger ground set size (e.g., \( |V| \approx 100 \)). It would be valuable to compare the proposed methodology against other algorithms in this setting. Additionally, in the experimental results, the authors should clarify why comparisons with other methods (e.g., [21-22]) were not included.
