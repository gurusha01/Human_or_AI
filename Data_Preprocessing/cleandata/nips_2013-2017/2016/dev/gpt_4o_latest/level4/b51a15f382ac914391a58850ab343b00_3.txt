The paper addresses the problem of partial monitoring in the stochastic combinatorial setting with a linear feedback mechanism, a variant of the original problem introduced by Lin et al. in [1], and extends some of the results presented in [1]. Specifically, the authors propose two algorithms, PEGE and PEGE2, for globally observable problems. These algorithms overcome certain (but not all) limitations of the GCB algorithm from [1], such as the requirement for a unique optimum, reliance on oracles for solving potentially complex optimization problems, and a sample complexity that scales with the size of the action space. 
The PEGE algorithms offer the following advantages over GCB:
- They do not require an oracle to return the second-best solution of an optimization problem.
- They do not assume the uniqueness of the optimal solution.
- Their regret bounds are independent of the size of the action set.
However, the PEGE algorithms also have notable disadvantages compared to GCB:
- The distribution-dependent regret bound requires parameter \( h \) to satisfy certain distribution-dependent conditions, but it is unclear how to efficiently determine \( h \) without prior knowledge of the problem parameters.
- The distribution-dependent bound exhibits worse dependence on the time horizon \( T \) and suffers from an extremely poor (exponential) dependence on \( h \).
- Achieving the claimed distribution-dependent bounds necessitates a different parameter setting than that required for the distribution-independent bounds.
The issue with parameter \( h \) is significant, prompting the authors to propose PEGE2 as a potential solution. However, PEGE2 does not fully resolve this issue and introduces additional shortcomings, as outlined below.
Advantages of PEGE2 compared to GCB:
- Its regret bounds remain independent of the size of the action set.
Disadvantages of PEGE2 compared to GCB:
- The distribution-dependent regret bound is not guaranteed in all cases (see Equation (7)). It is unclear what kind of distribution-dependent bound can be ensured in general.
Additionally, both PEGE and PEGE2 require solving linear optimization problems at every step, which may pose practical challenges. While the results presented in the paper contribute to our understanding of the combinatorial partial monitoring problem, it remains uncertain whether they bring us closer to a practical and effective solution. In particular, the distribution-dependent bounds appear to be particularly weak. The most notable strength of the paper lies in the fact that the regret bounds no longer depend on the size of the action set. It would be beneficial for the authors to emphasize the key idea behind this result more prominently in the main body of the paper.
Additional Remarks:
- The paper would benefit from including a formal, algorithmic presentation of the protocol.
- Please clarify that \( \sigma \) in line 4 of Algorithm 1 refers to the globally observable set.
- The remark in lines 176â€“180 is unclear. In what sense is the bound in [6] less explicit? Additionally, there should be an "is" between "in" and "not" in line 177.
- Why is \( \delta \) introduced if it is always set to \( 1/T \)?
- When adapting combinatorial partial monitoring games to online ranking, how do the results compare to existing methods?
- The phrase "note -ve sign" in line 304 appears to be a typo.
- Citation 4 in line 317 is incomplete and does not list all the authors' names.
