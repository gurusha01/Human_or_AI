This paper introduces an innovative approach to selective inference within the context of group sparsity, encompassing the formulation of confidence intervals and p-values for testing chosen groups of variables. The novelty stems from the development of data projection onto a specified space, along with inference techniques applicable to a wide range of group-sparse selection methods, such as group lasso, iterative hard thresholding, and forward stepwise regression. The proposed methodology demonstrates practical utility and merits acceptance to the conference.
