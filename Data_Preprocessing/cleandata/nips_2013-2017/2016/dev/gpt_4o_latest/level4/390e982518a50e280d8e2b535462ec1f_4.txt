The authors introduce a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) model, termed the diffusion convolutional network (DCNN), designed for classifying graph-structured data at the levels of nodes, edges, and entire graphs. The core operation of the DCNN involves mapping nodes and their associated features to the outcomes of a diffusion process initiated at those nodes. Unlike traditional CNNs, the parameters in DCNN are tied based on search depth rather than their spatial position in a grid. The authors provide a theoretical guarantee that the DCNN activations for two isomorphic input graphs are identical, demonstrating that the DCNN representation is invariant to node indexing. The model is evaluated against other approaches on node and graph classification tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results on the former and comparable performance on the latter. However, no results are provided for edge classification tasks. While the authors have done a commendable job explaining their model, the clarity of their notation and figures 1 (a-c) could be improved by incorporating a small graph as a running example.
