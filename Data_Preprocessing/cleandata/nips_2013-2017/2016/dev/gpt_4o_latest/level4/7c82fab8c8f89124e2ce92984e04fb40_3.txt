The authors address the challenge of valid inference for the effect size in linear regression when groups of variables are selected after examining the data. A selective test for the null hypothesis, which evaluates whether the projection of the mean onto the linear space spanned by the group variables is zero, has been proposed in prior work. However, the existing test does not facilitate the construction of a confidence interval. By deriving the exact distribution of the test statistic in the "noncentral" case (i.e., without assuming the null hypothesis), the authors propose a selective confidence interval for the size of the projection. The inference specifically pertains to the size of the projection of \(\mu\) onto the vector corresponding to the projection of \(Y\) onto the linear space, which becomes a well-defined parameter once conditioning on that direction is applied. I found this paper to be a significant extension of the earlier work by Loftus and Taylor ('15). The distinction between the null and non-null distributions of the test statistic is intriguing, and the technical challenges addressed are nontrivial. Below are a few comments:
1. Can the authors provide additional insights into the properties of the proposed confidence interval? For instance, in the context of inference for the coefficient of a selected variable in Gaussian linear regression (without grouping), the conditioning on nuisance statistics is theoretically justified for general exponential families (Fithian et al., '15). Could similar theoretical guarantees be explored or discussed here?
2. I understand that, conditionally on \(\text{dir}L(Y)\), the distribution of the test statistic depends on \(\langle \text{dir}L(Y), \mu \rangle\) rather than \(\langle \text{dir}L(\mu), \mu \rangle = \| PL \mu \|\). While the proposed confidence interval is guaranteed to cover \(\| PL \mu \|\) with probability \(1 - \alpha\) conditionally on \(\text{dir}L(Y)\), it is often conservative. However, does it follow that the confidence interval is also valid unconditionally on \(\text{dir}_L(Y)\) for the parameter of interest? If so, could the unconditional confidence interval potentially be less conservative?
3. I suggest revising the wording in the following instances for clarity and precision:
   - Line 59: "distribution of subsets 60 of parameters" (this phrasing is unclear; please reword for better precision).
   - Line 132: "Lemma 1 yields a truncated Gaussian distribution" (consider rephrasing for improved clarity).
