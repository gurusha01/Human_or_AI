The authors explore the integration of an attention mechanism into an offline handwriting recognition system designed to process unsegmented paragraphs of handwritten text. MD-LSTMs are employed for feature extraction, attention computation, and, in certain cases, decoding. Notably, the learned attention mechanism is demonstrated to surpass ground truth segmentation within the proposed system. The character error rates achieved on standard datasets are impressive. Although the system's word error rates do not surpass the state of the art, they remain highly competitive, particularly given the absence of ground truth segmentation and the use of a relatively simple language model.
Strengths:  
- The idea of extending single-line handwriting recognition techniques to multi-line scenarios is both elegant and a logical progression. It is unsurprising that this is one of at least two studies (as noted by the authors) exploring similar approaches. That said, this work appears to be the more mature and developed of the two.  
- It is remarkable—though increasingly common in contemporary research—that such a system functions at all, let alone performs as effectively as it does.  
- The technical presentation is sufficiently detailed and generally easy to follow. The inclusion of the colorized attention visualization is particularly satisfying and illustrative.  
Areas for Improvement:  
- The comparison to established benchmarks raises more questions than it resolves. As the authors acknowledge, this comparison is not entirely fair, as the reference models leverage more sophisticated language models and utilize ground truth segmentation. While the latter is unavoidable given the nature of the problem, the disparity in language model complexity is unnecessary. Moreover, the discussion surrounding this comparison feels underdeveloped and lacks depth. The authors are capable of providing a more insightful analysis here.  
- The significance and underlying reasons for the learned attention outperforming ground truth segmentation are not adequately addressed. Is this due to noise in the annotations? Or perhaps the model is leveraging contextual information from neighboring lines? This point is particularly critical, as the models referenced in Section 5.4 rely on ground truth segmentation.  
- While the paper is well-structured and easy to navigate, the writing quality could be improved. There are numerous typos, grammatical mistakes, and inconsistencies in tense throughout the manuscript. Additionally, the occasionally competitive tone, especially when comparing against other works, detracts from the authors' credibility. The results are strong enough to stand on their own without the need for such a tone.
