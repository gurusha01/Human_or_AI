The authors propose a method for training deep generative models that enhances information flow and facilitates more effective training. They introduce the Matryoshka network, which shares similarities with LapGANs and ResNets and consists of three main components: a top-down network, a bottom-up network, and a set of merge modules. The merge modules compare the states of the top-down and bottom-up networks, selecting a perturbation to minimize reconstruction error. - While the technical details in specific sections are generally well-explained (e.g., effective use of equations to clarify computations), the clarity and flow between sections and subsections could be improved. - Section 2.2 and the conclusion of Section 2.1 need to better connect the sampling/inference/distributions to the network components. For instance, the variable x (introduced in Section 2.2) is only described as a random variable until line 132, where it is vaguely defined as either known or unknown data. How does this variable x integrate with the network? - How are the latent variables z initialized, and what is the impact of this initialization on the model's performance? - Is there a potential typo on line 71? It states that conv(h, w) represents a convolution of the input x with kernel w but does not clarify the role of h. Additionally, x is not explicitly mentioned as an input to the conv function. - The qualitative results are visually impressive. - The quantitative results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms prior methods, although it is significantly more complex. - Before delving into the specifics of the network components, it would be beneficial to provide a concise overview of the inputs and outputs of the network, along with their roles. Furthermore, defining the inputs and outputs of each individual component (top-down, bottom-up, merge modules) before explaining their mechanisms would enhance clarity. - Additional analysis of the qualitative results would be valuable, complementing the explanations of the quantitative findings. - Could the authors include additional metrics beyond NLL, such as reconstruction error, to provide a more comprehensive evaluation? - Finally, qualitative comparisons with previous methods would strengthen the analysis and provide further context for the proposed model's performance.
