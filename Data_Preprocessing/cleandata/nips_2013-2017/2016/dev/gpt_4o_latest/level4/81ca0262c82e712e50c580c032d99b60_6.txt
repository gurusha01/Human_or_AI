This paper examines causal subset selection using directed information as the causality measure. Two tasks are defined, and their sub-modularity properties are analyzed through a sub-modularity index proposed by the authors. The primary focus is on addressing the subset selection problem in the context of directed information. The key contribution lies in the introduction of a sub-modularity index, which quantifies the proximity of a function to being sub-modular. The index appears intuitive, and it is somewhat surprising that it has not been explored previously. Overall, the proposed methods are both innovative and engaging. The application of the approach to learning causal structures is particularly compelling.
