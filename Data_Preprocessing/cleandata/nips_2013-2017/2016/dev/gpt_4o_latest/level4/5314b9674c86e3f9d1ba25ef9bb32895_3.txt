The paper explores the use of matrix product states (MPS), also known as tensor trains in certain research domains, for image classification. A particularly compelling and strong aspect of the work is its ability to effectively bridge multiple fields. However, there are several areas where the presentation could be improved or clarified:
- Section 5, "To approximate the weight tensor as an MPS": The explanation of how a specific tensor is approximated or in what sense this approximation occurs is unclear. For instance, does taking all singular values in equation (11) correspond to the tensor being approximated? Further clarification on this point would be helpful.
- Section 7, Regularization: While the authors mention open problems related to regularization, it seems that the solution may already be implicitly present in equations (11) and (14). Equation (14) appears closely related to the work of Signoretto et al. ("Learning with Tensors: a Framework Based on Convex Optimization and Spectral Regularization," Machine Learning, vol. 94, no. 3, 2014, pp. 303â€“351), which discusses regularization in tensor models through multilinear SVD, nuclear norm regularization, and singular value thresholding. Since equation (11) retains only the largest \( m \) singular values, this effectively influences the tensor's rank. In other words, rather than explicitly adding a regularization term to equation (6), the rank is controlled via the SVD truncation in equation (11). This connection should be made more explicit.
- Relation to [15]: Reference [15] by Cichocki describes solving a linear system using MPS. Given that equations (6) and (7) are linear in the unknown tensor, it is unclear why the method in [15] cannot be directly applied here. The authors should clarify what distinguishes their approach from [15] or what additional complexities arise in this paper's context.
- Details on \(\tilde{\Phi}n\): The process of obtaining \(\tilde{\Phi}n\) from the given data is not sufficiently detailed. A more thorough explanation would improve the clarity of this step.
- Equations (7)-(8): The term "leading-order update" requires further elaboration. What exactly is meant by this, and how does it relate to the method being proposed?
- Algorithm Suggestion: Including a step-by-step algorithm in the paper would significantly enhance its clarity. This would help readers understand the process of obtaining the solution \( B \), starting from the given training data.
- Equation (3): Are these Fourier features? Note that random Fourier features are currently widely used in large-scale problems, including those beyond image classification. If these are indeed Fourier features, the authors should explicitly acknowledge this connection.
In summary, while the paper presents an intriguing and interdisciplinary approach, addressing the above points would strengthen its presentation and provide greater clarity for the reader.
