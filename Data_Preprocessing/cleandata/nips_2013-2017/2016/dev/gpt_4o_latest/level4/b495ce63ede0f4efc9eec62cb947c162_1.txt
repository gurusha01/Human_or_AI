This paper introduces a deep learning method for establishing correspondences between image pairs. The authors employ a fully convolutional network (FCN) combined with a novel correspondence contrastive loss and an active hard-negative mining strategy. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated across several public datasets. The methods are clearly described, and the results are compelling. Providing additional details on the "semantic" component of this approach would enhance the work.
