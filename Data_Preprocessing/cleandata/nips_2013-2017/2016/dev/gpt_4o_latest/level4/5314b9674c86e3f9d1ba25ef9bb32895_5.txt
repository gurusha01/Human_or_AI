This paper explores the application of tensor networks, originating from quantum physics, to develop a supervised learning algorithm. A significant limitation of this work lies in its lack of motivation for employing tensor networks to define the feature map. The use of tensor networks introduces notable challenges in the optimization process. We suggest that the authors investigate the potential application of the kernel trick, which could mitigate computational complexity, as it has been extensively studied in kernel-based methods like support vector machines. 
In the classification model presented in Section 3, the treatment of the label raises concerns. Specifically, it is unclear how the label index is arbitrarily assigned to a particular position within the tensor and how or why it can be transferred to another tensor. This approach could be interpreted as associating the label with a single pixel of the image rather than the entire image. This issue appears to stem from the model described in equations (4)-(5), which seems unsuitable for multiclass classification. Regarding the quadratic loss function used in equation (6), the authors justify its choice based on achieving the best test results. However, they should also disclose other loss functions considered during the comparison. It is worth mentioning that the quadratic loss simplifies computations due to its differentiability, unlike some alternative loss functions.
There are several concerns related to the experimental setup:  
- Key details, such as the number of data points (N) and the number of classes (L) used in the experiments, are missing.  
- The 28x28 images are downsampled to 14x14 to reduce training time, but the paper does not address the computational complexity of the algorithm, which is a critical issue.  
- The methodology for estimating training and test errors is not clearly explained.  
- The proposed classification algorithm is not benchmarked against any state-of-the-art classification methods. A comparison should be provided in terms of both error rates and computational complexity.
