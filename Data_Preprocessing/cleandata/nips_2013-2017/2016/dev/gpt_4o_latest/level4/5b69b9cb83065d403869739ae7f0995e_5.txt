This paper introduces a reinforcement learning-based approach to machine translation by utilizing monolingual data and a two-player communication framework. The paper presents two key innovations: first, the proposed model simultaneously trains two dual translation models within a unified framework. Second, the translation models process unpaired data as input and learn the translation task through reinforcement learning. The framework is original, and the underlying idea is thoroughly explained. The paper is well-written, and I found it enjoyable to read. However, I have a question regarding the algorithm. Could you clarify the presence of $\frac{1}{K}$ in both line 12 and line 13 of Algorithm 1?
