This paper addresses the problem of causal subset selection using Directed Information (DI) as a measure of prediction causality. The authors focus on two key tasks: causal sensor placement and causal covariate selection, formulating them as cardinality-constrained DI maximization problems. They demonstrate that the first problem is submodular (though not monotonic) and the second is "nearly" submodular. To address the challenges posed by non-monotonicity and approximate submodularity, the authors introduce a novel metric, the Submodularity Index (SmI), which quantifies the degree of submodularity for general set functions. They further provide theoretical guarantees for the performance of greedy algorithms under these conditions. The paper is supported by experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, including applications to causal structure learning.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Contribution: The introduction of the Submodularity Index (SmI) is a significant theoretical contribution. It extends the applicability of greedy algorithms to a broader class of problems, including those with non-monotonic or approximately submodular objectives. This is a meaningful advancement over existing work that assumes strict submodularity.
2. Theoretical Rigor: The paper provides detailed theoretical analysis, including performance guarantees for greedy algorithms based on SmI. The proofs and bounds are well-constructed and demonstrate a deep understanding of the problem space.
3. Practical Relevance: The application of the proposed methods to causal structure learning is compelling. The experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets (e.g., stock market data) demonstrate the utility and effectiveness of the approach.
4. Clarity of Results: The experimental results are well-presented, with clear comparisons to optimal solutions and theoretical bounds. The use of SmI to refine performance guarantees is particularly insightful.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity of Presentation: While the theoretical contributions are significant, the paper is dense and could benefit from improved organization and clearer explanations, particularly in the technical sections. For instance, the derivation of SmI and its computational bounds may be challenging for readers unfamiliar with submodularity.
2. Experimental Scope: Although the experiments validate the theoretical findings, they are somewhat limited in scope. The synthetic datasets are relatively small, and the real-world dataset (stock market data) represents a narrow application domain. Additional experiments on larger and more diverse datasets would strengthen the paper.
3. Comparison to Related Work: While the paper references prior work on submodularity and greedy algorithms, it could provide a more detailed comparison to existing methods for causal subset selection. For example, how does the proposed approach compare empirically to other heuristics for non-submodular objectives?
4. Practical Challenges: The computational complexity of estimating DI and SmI, particularly for large-scale problems, is not discussed in detail. This could limit the scalability of the proposed methods.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper introduces a novel and impactful concept (SmI) that broadens the applicability of greedy algorithms.
- The theoretical contributions are rigorous and well-supported by experiments.
- The application to causal structure learning is both relevant and effective.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The paper's clarity and accessibility could be improved, particularly for readers outside the immediate area of expertise.
- The experimental evaluation, while promising, is somewhat narrow in scope and lacks diversity in datasets and application domains.
- Practical challenges, such as scalability and computational cost, are not adequately addressed.
Recommendation:
Overall, this is a strong paper with significant theoretical contributions and practical implications. While there are areas for improvement, particularly in clarity and experimental scope, the novelty and rigor of the work make it a valuable addition to the field. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the clarity and experimental concerns.
