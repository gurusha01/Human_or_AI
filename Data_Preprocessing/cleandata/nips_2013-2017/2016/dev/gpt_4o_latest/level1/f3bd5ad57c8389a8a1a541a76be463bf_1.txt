This paper presents a novel approach to monocular depth estimation by leveraging a neural network to predict local depth derivatives as probability distributions, followed by a globalization procedure to harmonize these predictions into a coherent depth map. Unlike prior methods that directly regress depth values or focus on specific geometric cues, the proposed method predicts a diverse set of derivatives (of varying orders, scales, and orientations) in an overcomplete representation. The network outputs Gaussian mixture distributions for these derivatives, allowing it to express uncertainty and ambiguity in regions where depth cues are less informative. The depth map is then estimated by solving a global optimization problem that aligns these local predictions. The method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on the NYU v2 depth dataset and offers potential for broader applications in other depth-related tasks.
Strengths:
1. Technical Novelty: The use of an overcomplete representation of depth derivatives, combined with distributional outputs, is a significant departure from existing methods. This approach allows the network to capture richer geometric information and express uncertainty, which is particularly valuable in ambiguous regions.
2. Global Optimization: The globalization step effectively harmonizes local predictions into a consistent depth map, leveraging Fourier-domain computations for efficiency. This is a well-thought-out solution to reconcile the overcomplete representation.
3. State-of-the-Art Results: The method achieves superior performance on most metrics compared to existing approaches, as demonstrated on the NYU v2 dataset. The qualitative results also show better preservation of local geometric structures.
4. Broader Applicability: The authors convincingly argue that their approach could be extended to other tasks, such as stereo reconstruction or intrinsic image decomposition, making the contribution potentially impactful beyond monocular depth estimation.
Weaknesses:
1. Computational Cost: The inference time of 24 seconds per image, even with a high-end GPU, may limit the method's applicability in real-time systems or large-scale datasets.
2. Failure Cases: While the method performs well overall, the paper acknowledges occasional mis-estimation of relative object positions and struggles with large, texture-less planar regions. These limitations could be explored further.
3. Ablation Study Scope: Although the ablation study evaluates the contribution of different derivative subsets, it does not explore the impact of varying the number of Gaussian mixture components or alternative parameterizations for the distributions.
4. Clarity of Presentation: While the paper is generally well-written, certain sections, particularly the mathematical formulation of the globalization step, could benefit from additional explanation or visual aids to improve accessibility for non-expert readers.
