This paper introduces the Truncated Generalized Gradient Flow (TGGF) algorithm for solving systems of quadratic equations, a problem that is NP-hard in general. The authors claim that TGGF achieves exact recovery of the solution with high probability when the number of equations is on the order of the number of unknowns. The algorithm operates in two stages: (1) a novel orthogonality-promoting initialization using power iterations, and (2) a refinement stage employing truncated generalized gradient iterations to address the nonconvex and nonsmooth nature of the problem. The paper demonstrates that TGGF outperforms state-of-the-art methods, such as Wirtinger Flow (WF) and Truncated Wirtinger Flow (TWF), in terms of sample complexity, computational efficiency, and empirical success rates.
Strengths:
1. Novelty: The orthogonality-promoting initialization is a significant departure from traditional spectral initialization methods, addressing their limitations in handling heavy-tailed distributions. This is a clear innovation over existing approaches.
2. Theoretical Guarantees: The paper provides rigorous theoretical analysis, proving that TGGF achieves exact recovery with high probability and converges exponentially fast. The results are supported by detailed mathematical derivations.
3. Empirical Validation: Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the superior performance of TGGF compared to WF and TWF. Notably, TGGF achieves exact recovery with fewer measurements (e.g., m/n ≈ 3 for real-valued problems) and exhibits robust performance in noisy settings.
4. Practical Relevance: The algorithm's linear computational complexity (O(mn log(1/ε))) makes it scalable to large problem sizes, which is crucial for real-world applications such as phase retrieval in optics and X-ray crystallography.
Weaknesses:
1. Limited Discussion of Limitations: While the paper acknowledges the challenges of nonconvex optimization, it does not thoroughly discuss the potential limitations of TGGF, such as its sensitivity to initialization parameters or performance under non-Gaussian sampling models.
2. Comparison Scope: The empirical comparisons focus primarily on WF and TWF. Including additional state-of-the-art methods, such as PhaseLift or PhaseCut, would provide a more comprehensive evaluation.
3. Complexity of Presentation: The paper is mathematically dense, which may hinder accessibility for readers unfamiliar with advanced optimization techniques. Simplifying some explanations or providing more intuitive insights could improve clarity.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:
Pros:
- The paper addresses a challenging and practically relevant problem with a novel and well-supported approach.
- Theoretical guarantees and empirical results strongly support the claims of superior performance.
- The algorithm is computationally efficient and scalable, making it suitable for large-scale applications.
Cons:
- The paper could benefit from a broader comparison with alternative methods and a more detailed discussion of its limitations.
- The dense mathematical presentation may limit accessibility to a broader audience.
Recommendation:
I recommend acceptance of this paper, as it makes a significant contribution to the field of nonconvex optimization and phase retrieval. The proposed TGGF algorithm is both theoretically sound and practically impactful, addressing key limitations of existing methods. However, the authors are encouraged to expand the discussion of limitations and include additional comparisons in future revisions.
