The paper presents a novel application of tensor networks, specifically matrix product states (MPS), to supervised learning tasks. The authors propose using MPS to parameterize non-linear kernel learning models, demonstrating their approach on the MNIST dataset with a test error rate of less than 1%. The paper highlights the efficiency and adaptability of tensor networks, including their ability to scale linearly with training set size and adaptively adjust internal dimensions to focus on relevant data correlations. Additionally, the authors discuss the interpretability of the tensor network structure and its potential for feature selection.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Originality: The paper introduces a unique application of tensor networks, a concept rooted in physics, to machine learning. This cross-disciplinary approach is innovative and has the potential to open new avenues for research.
2. Strong Empirical Results: The method achieves competitive performance on the MNIST dataset, with a test error rate of 0.97% for a bond dimension of 120, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
3. Efficiency: The proposed algorithm scales linearly with the training set size, a significant improvement over traditional kernel methods. This makes the approach computationally attractive for large datasets.
4. Interpretability: The authors provide an insightful discussion on the representational power and implicit feature selection capabilities of tensor networks, which could aid in understanding model behavior.
5. Reproducibility: The authors have made their code publicly available, which is commendable and facilitates reproducibility.
Weaknesses:
1. Limited Scope of Experiments: The experimental evaluation is restricted to the MNIST dataset. While the results are promising, additional benchmarks on more complex datasets would strengthen the claims of general applicability.
2. Optimization Challenges: The paper acknowledges that blending stochastic gradient descent with the MPS sweeping algorithm was not successful, leaving room for improvement in the optimization strategy.
3. Regularization and Generalization: While the method generalizes well on MNIST without explicit regularization, the lack of a detailed analysis of the regularization effects of the tensor network structure limits the understanding of its broader applicability.
4. Comparison with Related Work: Although the paper references related work, a more detailed empirical comparison with state-of-the-art methods, including Novikov et al. [26], would provide a clearer picture of the advantages and limitations of the proposed approach.
Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Extend the experimental evaluation to include more diverse datasets, such as CIFAR-10 or ImageNet, to demonstrate the scalability and robustness of the method.
2. Investigate advanced optimization techniques, such as adaptive learning rates or momentum, to improve training efficiency and performance.
3. Provide a more detailed comparison with related tensor-based methods and other kernel learning approaches.
4. Explore the impact of different feature maps and tensor network structures, such as PEPS or MERA, on performance and generalization.
Recommendation:
The paper makes a significant contribution by introducing tensor networks to supervised learning and demonstrating their potential. While there are areas for improvement, the novelty, strong empirical results, and interpretability of the approach make it a valuable addition to the field. I recommend acceptance, provided the authors address the limitations and expand their experimental evaluation in future work.
