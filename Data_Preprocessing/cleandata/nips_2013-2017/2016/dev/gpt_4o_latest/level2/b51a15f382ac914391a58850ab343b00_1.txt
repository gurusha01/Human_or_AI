The paper addresses the problem of combinatorial partial monitoring (CPM) games, extending prior work by proposing novel algorithms that improve upon the state-of-the-art Global Confidence Bound (GCB) algorithm. The authors introduce two key contributions: the Phased Exploration with Greedy Exploitation (PEGE) framework and the PEGE2 algorithm. These methods achieve improved regret bounds while relaxing some of the assumptions and computational requirements of GCB. The paper also demonstrates the practical applicability of the proposed algorithms to online ranking problems with limited feedback.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Innovation: The paper introduces the PEGE framework, which leverages phased exploration and greedy exploitation, a classic but underutilized approach in the CPM setting. This is a significant departure from the confidence-bound-based methods used in GCB.
2. Improved Practicality: The PEGE framework eliminates the need for the computationally expensive "arg-secondmax" oracle required by GCB, making it more practical for real-world applications. Additionally, PEGE achieves regret bounds that are independent of the size of the learner's action space, a critical improvement over GCB.
3. Relaxed Assumptions: PEGE does not require the existence of a unique optimal action for achieving distribution-dependent regret bounds, addressing a limitation of GCB that is often unrealistic in combinatorial settings.
4. Theoretical Rigor: The regret bounds for both PEGE and PEGE2 are well-supported by theoretical analysis, with explicit derivations provided. The authors also compare their results comprehensively with GCB, highlighting the advantages and trade-offs of their approach.
5. Practical Relevance: The application to online ranking with feedback at the top demonstrates the utility of the proposed algorithms in a realistic and important problem domain. The extension to infinite learner action spaces further showcases the versatility of the framework.
Weaknesses:
1. Dependence on Time Horizon: PEGE2 requires knowledge of the total time horizon \( T \), which limits its applicability in scenarios where \( T \) is unknown. This contrasts with GCB, which is an anytime algorithm.
2. Complexity of Gap Estimation: While the gap estimation step in PEGE2 is theoretically sound, it introduces additional complexity and may be computationally expensive in practice, especially for small gap values.
3. Limited Experimental Validation: The paper lacks empirical results to validate the theoretical claims. Simulations or experiments comparing PEGE and PEGE2 to GCB on benchmark CPM problems would strengthen the paper's contributions.
4. Exponential Additive Terms: The regret bound for PEGE in the distribution-dependent case includes an exponentially large additive term if the tuning parameter \( h \) is not set appropriately. This could limit its practical utility in some cases.
Recommendation:
The paper makes a strong theoretical contribution to the field of CPM games, presenting algorithms that are both novel and practically advantageous. However, the lack of empirical validation and the dependence of PEGE2 on the time horizon are notable limitations. I recommend acceptance, provided the authors address the need for experimental results and discuss strategies to mitigate the limitations of their methods. The paper is a valuable addition to the literature and has the potential to inspire further research in CPM games and related areas.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Novel and practically relevant algorithms.
- Improved regret bounds with relaxed assumptions.
- Rigorous theoretical analysis.
Arguments against Acceptance:
- Lack of empirical validation.
- Dependence on \( T \) for PEGE2.
- Potential computational challenges in gap estimation.
