The paper introduces a novel robust optimization formulation that combines policy maximization and transition model minimization into a unified objective. This approach evaluates both the proposed and baseline policies under a shared minimized model, enabling policy improvement even in the face of transition uncertainty. The authors argue that traditional robust optimization methods are overly conservative, as they evaluate policies under extreme optimistic and pessimistic models, potentially rejecting policies that could outperform the baseline. By focusing on minimizing robust regret relative to the baseline policy, the proposed method avoids waiting for the proposed policy to provably outperform the baseline's optimistic performance.
The paper's contributions are significant, particularly in addressing the limitations of standard robust optimization approaches. The reformulation is compelling, as it allows for a more nuanced comparison between policies and enables state-specific improvements. The approximate algorithm proposed by the authors is practical and demonstrates strong empirical performance across multiple domains, including grid problems and energy arbitrage. The experiments convincingly show that the proposed approach outperforms standard robust methods, especially in scenarios with high model uncertainty.
However, there are some weaknesses. First, while the theoretical analysis is thorough, the computational cost of solving the NP-hard formulation is a concern. The authors mitigate this by focusing on approximation algorithms, but a more detailed discussion of scalability in larger, real-world problems would strengthen the paper. Additionally, the assumption of known transition probabilities for baseline-consistent actions in the energy market example is a minor but notable limitation, as it may not generalize to all domains. Finally, while the reviewer finds the reformulation convincing, the broader impact of this work on the robust optimization field is difficult to assess due to a lack of expertise in this specific subfield.
Strengths:
1. Novel formulation that addresses key limitations of traditional robust optimization.
2. Practical approximate algorithm with strong empirical results.
3. Clear motivation and well-structured theoretical analysis.
Weaknesses:
1. Computational cost of the NP-hard formulation is a concern.
2. Assumption of known transition probabilities in some examples may limit generalizability.
3. Broader impact on the robust optimization field is unclear.
Recommendation:
The paper is a strong scientific contribution, addressing a challenging and important problem in sequential decision-making under uncertainty. Despite minor limitations, the novelty and empirical results justify acceptance. Further exploration of scalability and generalizability would enhance the work's impact.
