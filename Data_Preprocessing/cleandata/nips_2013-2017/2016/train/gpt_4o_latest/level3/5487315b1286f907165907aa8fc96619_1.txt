This paper proposes a convex relaxation for bi-level optimization in two-layer conditional models with structured latent representations. The authors address the computational challenges of non-convexity and demanding inference in existing methods by leveraging semi-definite programming (SDP) relaxation and polar operators. The approach is demonstrated on transliteration and image inpainting tasks, showing promising experimental results.
Strengths:  
1. Novelty: The paper introduces a novel convex relaxation framework for bi-level optimization, which is a significant contribution to structured prediction and unsupervised learning. The use of SDP relaxation to tackle intractable optimization problems is innovative and aligns with recent trends in machine learning research.  
2. Applications: The method is applied to transliteration and image inpainting tasks, both of which are relevant and challenging problems. The empirical results suggest that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches like CRF-AE and locally trained models in these domains.  
3. Theoretical Contributions: The characterization of low-rank solutions in the SDP relaxation and the connection to extreme points of the feasible region are technically interesting and provide insights into the convex relaxation.  
4. Scalability: The reliance on polar operators for inference makes the method computationally efficient compared to more demanding normalization-based approaches.  
Weaknesses:  
1. Interpretability: The bi-level objective lacks a natural optimization interpretation, as it is chosen primarily for simplicity. While the authors justify this choice, a deeper discussion of the implications and trade-offs would strengthen the paper.  
2. SDP Relaxation: The paper does not fully characterize the trade-off between convexity and fidelity in the SDP relaxation. This omission leaves open questions about how well the relaxation approximates the original problem.  
3. Experimental Analysis: While the experiments show promise, they lack depth. For example, runtime comparisons, likelihood analysis, and performance against non-structured baselines are missing. These would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the method.  
4. Clarity: The paper contains numerous typos and grammatical errors, which detract from its readability. Additionally, the technical derivations are dense and could benefit from clearer explanations or visual aids.  
5. Assumptions and Approximations: Several assumptions (e.g., PO-tractability) and approximations are made, but their practical implications are not thoroughly discussed. This raises concerns about the generalizability of the method to other structured prediction tasks.  
Arguments for Acceptance:  
- The paper addresses a challenging problem with a novel and theoretically grounded approach.  
- The empirical results demonstrate the potential of the method in real-world tasks.  
- The work advances the state of the art in structured prediction and unsupervised learning.  
Arguments Against Acceptance:  
- The lack of detailed experimental analysis and runtime comparisons limits the practical impact of the results.  
- The clarity and presentation of the paper need significant improvement.  
- The assumptions and approximations require further justification to ensure the robustness of the method.  
Recommendation: Weak Accept. While the paper has notable strengths in terms of novelty and theoretical contributions, the weaknesses in clarity, experimental analysis, and interpretability need to be addressed before it can have a broader impact. The authors should focus on improving the presentation, providing more comprehensive experiments, and discussing the trade-offs and limitations of their approach in greater detail.
