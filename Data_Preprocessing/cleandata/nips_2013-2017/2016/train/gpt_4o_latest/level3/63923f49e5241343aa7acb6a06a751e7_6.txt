This paper addresses an important gap in the literature by extending fast learning rates to unbounded losses with heavy-tailed distributions, a scenario that has received limited attention compared to bounded losses. The authors introduce two novel conditions: the L-integrability of the envelope function and the multi-scale Bernstein's condition, which together enable the derivation of learning rates faster than \( O(n^{-1/2}) \). These rates are shown to approach \( O(n^{-1}) \) under certain conditions, representing a significant theoretical advancement. The paper also verifies these assumptions and demonstrates their applicability to k-means clustering, achieving novel convergence rates for heavy-tailed distributions. This work builds on prior research, such as Lecu√© and Mendelson (2013) for sub-Gaussian losses, while addressing the limitations of earlier approaches that failed to handle polynomially heavy-tailed losses effectively.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Originality: The introduction of the multi-scale Bernstein's condition is a key contribution, offering a more nuanced framework for analyzing unbounded losses by separating microscopic and macroscopic behaviors. This is a significant step forward compared to the standard Bernstein's condition.
2. Theoretical Rigor: The paper provides detailed proofs and builds on well-established mathematical tools, such as concentration inequalities and localization-based techniques, to derive its results. The extension of fast learning rates to k-means clustering under heavy-tailed distributions is particularly compelling.
3. Practical Relevance: The application to k-means clustering demonstrates the practical utility of the theoretical framework, making the results accessible to practitioners working with real-world data that may exhibit heavy-tailed characteristics.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity and Accessibility: While the paper is mathematically rigorous, it is not easily accessible to a general audience. Some variables in the formulas are undefined, and certain parameter choices lack sufficient explanation or justification. For example, the conditions under which specific constants are chosen could be better elaborated.
2. Repetition: The text contains some repetitive explanations, particularly in the discussion of the multi-scale Bernstein's condition and its implications. This could be streamlined to improve readability.
3. Incomplete Definitions: The lack of clear definitions for some variables and assumptions makes it challenging for readers unfamiliar with the topic to fully engage with the work. For instance, terms like "multi-scale Bernstein's powers" could benefit from more explicit clarification.
4. Empirical Validation: While the theoretical contributions are strong, the paper lacks empirical experiments to validate the derived rates in practical settings. This would strengthen the paper's impact and demonstrate its applicability beyond theoretical constructs.
Recommendation:
This paper makes a significant theoretical contribution to the field of machine learning by addressing the challenging problem of fast learning rates for unbounded losses with heavy-tailed distributions. However, its accessibility and clarity could be improved, and the inclusion of empirical results would enhance its practical relevance. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the clarity issues and streamline the presentation. 
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Novel theoretical contributions with clear advancements over prior work.
- Rigorous mathematical analysis and well-structured proofs.
- Practical relevance demonstrated through k-means clustering.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Limited accessibility due to undefined variables and insufficient explanations.
- Lack of empirical validation to support theoretical claims.
Overall, this paper is a valuable addition to the conference and will likely stimulate further research in the area of learning with heavy-tailed losses.
