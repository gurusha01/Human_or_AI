The paper introduces CMICOT, a novel feature selection algorithm designed to address high-order dependencies among features using Conditional Mutual Information (CMI). This work builds on the sequential forward selection (SFS) framework and proposes a max-min optimization problem to identify joint feature interactions. The authors mitigate computational and sample complexity challenges by employing a greedy approximation and binary representatives, making the method scalable and practical. Empirical results demonstrate CMICOT's superiority over state-of-the-art feature selection methods on 10 benchmark datasets, particularly with kNN and AdaBoost classifiers.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Significance: The paper addresses the challenging problem of high-order interaction-aware feature selection, which is underexplored in the literature. CMICOT's ability to detect interactions among up to 10 features is a significant advancement over existing methods, which are typically limited to 2-3 feature interactions.
2. Performance: CMICOT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in classification accuracy for kNN and AdaBoost, as demonstrated on diverse datasets. The results highlight its practical utility and robustness.
3. Efficiency: The use of binary representatives and a two-stage greedy search effectively reduces computational and sample complexity, enabling the algorithm to scale to high-dimensional datasets.
4. Empirical Validation: The extensive evaluation on synthetic and real-world datasets, along with comparisons to a wide range of baselines, strengthens the credibility of the results.
Weaknesses:
1. Binary Representatives Justification: The rationale for using binary representatives is not well-supported theoretically. While the empirical results are promising, a deeper analysis or illustrative examples would strengthen this aspect.
2. Algorithm Clarity: The description of Algorithm 1, particularly the case when \( t = s \), is unclear. A more generic and detailed explanation would improve reproducibility.
3. Proposition 3 Proof: The proof in Appendix A.4 regarding joint entropy calculation lacks clarity and should be revised for correctness and accessibility.
4. Experimental Setup: It is unclear whether the results in Figure 1 are based on training, validation, or test sets. This ambiguity undermines the reliability of the reported performance.
5. NBC Classifier Results: The poor performance of CMICOT with the Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC) is relegated to the appendices without adequate discussion in the main text. This omission weakens the completeness of the experimental analysis.
6. Competitor Analysis: The strong performance of CMIM relative to other interaction-aware methods is not sufficiently explained, raising questions about the comparative advantage of CMICOT.
7. Comparative Analysis: A direct comparison of CMICOT with and without binary representatives in terms of accuracy and computational cost would provide valuable insights into the trade-offs introduced by this technique.
Minor Issues:
- Lines 144-145 contain unclear sentences that need revision.
- Figure 1 lacks axis labels, reducing interpretability.
- Statistical test details in Table 1 are missing and should be included.
Recommendation:
While the paper makes a significant contribution to feature selection by addressing high-order dependencies, several aspects require clarification and improvement. I recommend acceptance with major revisions, contingent on addressing the concerns related to algorithm clarity, experimental setup, and theoretical justification for binary representatives.
