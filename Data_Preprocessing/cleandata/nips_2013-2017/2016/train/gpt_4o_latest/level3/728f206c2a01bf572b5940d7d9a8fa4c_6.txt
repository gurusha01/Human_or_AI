The paper presents a novel approach to training Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) by augmenting the standard Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) objective with a smooth Wasserstein distance. This modification leverages a predefined metric between data points to guide the model in placing probability mass closer to the data distribution, resulting in samples that are more plausible in terms of the chosen metric. The authors demonstrate the utility of this approach through experiments on data completion and denoising tasks, showing that the Wasserstein-trained RBMs (RBM-W) produce cleaner, more prototypical samples compared to standard RBMs. However, this comes at the cost of reduced diversity, as the Wasserstein objective encourages clustering and shrinkage effects in the learned distribution.
Strengths:  
The paper is clearly written and well-organized, making it accessible to both experts and non-experts in the field. The clustering and shrinkage properties observed in the experiments are compelling and suggest practical utility in tasks where sample plausibility is prioritized over coverage. The use of the Wasserstein distance aligns with current trends in generative modeling, particularly in incorporating geometric and metric-based considerations into learning objectives. The experimental results are thorough, with detailed analyses of the bias-variance trade-offs and the impact of hyperparameters. The paper also provides a strong theoretical foundation, deriving gradients for the Wasserstein objective and discussing its relationship to the KL divergence.
Weaknesses:  
One major concern is the scalability of the proposed method. While the authors mention advances in fast approximations of the Wasserstein distance, the computational complexity of solving the dual formulation and the Sinkhorn algorithm for large datasets is not adequately addressed. Providing runtime comparisons or complexity analyses would strengthen the paper. Additionally, the reduction in sample diversity due to the clustering effect may limit the applicability of the method to tasks requiring broad coverage of the data distribution. The experiments, while illustrative, are limited to relatively small datasets, and it remains unclear how the method would perform on larger, more complex datasets. Finally, the paper could benefit from a discussion of potential extensions to other generative models, such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) or Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which could enhance its impact.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:  
- Pro: The method is novel, well-motivated, and contributes to the RBM domain by introducing a metric-aware training objective. The clustering property is a unique and potentially useful feature for certain applications. The paper is clearly written and aligns with current research trends.  
- Con: Scalability remains a concern, and the experiments are limited to small datasets. The reduction in sample diversity may restrict the method's applicability. The lack of runtime analysis and discussion of extensions to other models limits the broader impact of the work.
Recommendation:  
Overall, the paper makes a meaningful contribution to the field of generative modeling, particularly in the context of RBMs. While scalability and diversity issues need further exploration, the proposed method is theoretically sound and practically relevant for specific applications. I recommend acceptance, with the suggestion that the authors address scalability concerns and explore extensions to other generative models in future work.
