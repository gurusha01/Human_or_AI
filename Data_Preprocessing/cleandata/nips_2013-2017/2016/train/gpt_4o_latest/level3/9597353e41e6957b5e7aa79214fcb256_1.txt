The paper introduces the Semi-Supervised Active Clustering (SSAC) framework, which leverages an interactive oracle to answer same-cluster queries, aiming to minimize k-means clustering cost. The authors explore the computational and query complexity of clustering under a γ-margin property, a novel data niceness condition. Their key contributions include a randomized polynomial-time algorithm that efficiently solves k-means clustering with \(O(k^2 \log(k) + k \log(n))\) queries when γ > 1, and a demonstration that k-means clustering remains NP-hard under weaker margin conditions or without queries. The paper also establishes lower bounds on the number of queries required for efficient solvability.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Relevance: The SSAC framework is a fresh perspective on semi-supervised clustering, combining theoretical rigor with practical relevance. The γ-margin property introduces a meaningful way to quantify clusterability, extending prior work on center proximity.
2. Theoretical Contributions: The paper provides strong theoretical results, including a probabilistic polynomial-time algorithm and hardness proofs for k-means clustering under various conditions. The tradeoff between query complexity and computational complexity is particularly insightful.
3. Clarity of Results: The results are well-structured, with clear theorems and proofs. The algorithm is described in detail, and its complexity is rigorously analyzed.
4. Broader Impact: The findings have implications for practical clustering tasks, especially in domains where domain knowledge can be elicited interactively. The framework is user-friendly, as it uses intuitive same-cluster queries.
Weaknesses:
1. Limited Practical Evaluation: While the theoretical contributions are robust, the paper lacks empirical validation. It would be valuable to test the proposed algorithm on real-world datasets to assess its practical utility and robustness.
2. Simplistic Oracle Assumptions: The oracle is assumed to provide perfect answers, which may not hold in real-world scenarios. The paper briefly mentions handling oracle errors but does not explore this in depth.
3. Open Questions: The paper raises intriguing open questions, such as deriving a general threshold for query complexity and handling suboptimal oracles, but does not provide concrete progress on these fronts.
4. Comparative Analysis: While the paper references related work, it does not provide a detailed comparison of its algorithm's performance against existing semi-supervised clustering methods, particularly in terms of query efficiency and computational scalability.
