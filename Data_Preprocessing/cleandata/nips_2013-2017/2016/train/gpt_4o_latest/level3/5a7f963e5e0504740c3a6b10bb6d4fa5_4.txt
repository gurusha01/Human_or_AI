The manuscript presents a significant contribution to the field of probabilistic reasoning by introducing algorithms for arithmetic circuits, specifically focusing on Probabilistic Sentential Decision Diagrams (PSDDs). The work explores the computational properties of PSDDs, demonstrating their ability to support a polytime multiplication operator, which is a notable advancement over other classes of arithmetic circuits. This property makes PSDDs particularly suitable for applications such as probabilistic graphical model compilation. The authors also provide theoretical insights into the intractability of summing-out variables in PSDDs, highlighting both the strengths and limitations of this representation. The proposed compilation algorithm for probabilistic graphical models using PSDD multiplication is a practical and efficient approach, as evidenced by the empirical results.
Strengths:
1. Theoretical Contribution: The paper advances the theoretical understanding of PSDDs, especially in terms of their tractable multiplication operator, which is a key operation for probabilistic reasoning and learning.
2. Practical Relevance: The proposed compilation algorithm is simple yet effective, demonstrating the utility of PSDDs in real-world applications. The empirical results show that PSDDs often outperform other arithmetic circuit representations in terms of size and efficiency.
3. Novelty: The work builds on prior research but introduces a novel approach by leveraging PSDDs' unique properties, distinguishing it from existing methods in the literature.
4. Clarity of Theoretical Results: The proofs and complexity analyses are well-structured and provide a solid foundation for the claims made.
Weaknesses:
1. Lack of Self-Containment: The manuscript assumes significant background knowledge, which may hinder accessibility for readers unfamiliar with PSDDs or related concepts. Key preliminaries and examples are insufficiently explained.
2. Figure Clarity: Figures 1 and 2 are poorly designed, with unexplained numbers and inconsistent examples that make interpretation challenging. Aligning figures with the text and improving graphical representations would enhance clarity.
3. Presentation of Examples: The examples are not well-integrated with the narrative, and unrelated figures are grouped together, which disrupts the flow of the paper.
4. Minor Issues: There are minor typographical and formatting errors, such as "compilating" instead of "compiling," misaligned Figure 4, unclear units in Table 1, and the need to bold winning times in Table 1.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper addresses a critical problem in probabilistic reasoning and provides a novel solution with both theoretical and practical implications.
- The proposed PSDD-based approach is likely to inspire further research and applications in the field.
- The empirical results validate the utility of the proposed methods, demonstrating improvements over existing techniques.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The manuscript's lack of self-containment and unclear figures may limit its accessibility and impact.
- Presentation issues, including poorly explained examples and minor errors, detract from the overall quality of the paper.
Recommendation:
While the paper has notable strengths in terms of originality, theoretical contribution, and practical relevance, the presentation issues and lack of self-containment need to be addressed. I recommend acceptance conditional on a major revision to improve clarity, particularly in the explanation of examples and figures, and to ensure the manuscript is accessible to a broader audience.
