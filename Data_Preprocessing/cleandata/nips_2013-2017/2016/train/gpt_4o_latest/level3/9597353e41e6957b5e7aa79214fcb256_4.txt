The paper addresses the problem of semi-supervised active clustering (SSAC) with margin constraints, leveraging an oracle for cluster membership verification. It introduces a probabilistic polynomial-time algorithm that uses a bounded number of same-cluster queries, providing a novel framework for efficiently solving clustering problems that are otherwise NP-hard. The authors also establish a theoretical lower bound on the number of queries required for computational feasibility and prove that k-means clustering is NP-hard for instances with γ-margin values below approximately 1.84. This work contributes to the understanding of the trade-off between computational complexity and query complexity in clustering tasks.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Significance: The paper introduces a new framework (SSAC) and demonstrates how limited oracle queries can transform an NP-hard clustering problem into a computationally feasible one. This is a significant theoretical contribution, particularly the trade-off between query complexity and computational complexity.
2. Theoretical Rigor: The query lower-bound proof is well-executed and provides a strong foundation for the claims. The hardness results for γ-margin clustering and the probabilistic guarantees of the algorithm are valuable contributions to the field.
3. Practical Implications: The framework has potential real-world applications in domains where domain expertise can be incorporated via queries, such as recommendation systems or customer segmentation.
4. Efficiency: The algorithm achieves a query complexity of \(O(k \log n + k^2 \log k)\) and a runtime of \(O(kn \log n)\), which is efficient for the problem setting.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity and Writing: The manuscript suffers from unclear writing and inconsistent notation, making it difficult to follow at times. Sections such as 4.1 are terse and overly reliant on supplementary material, which hinders readability. Minor grammatical errors and inconsistencies in the algorithm description (pages 4–5) further detract from clarity.
2. Algorithmic Limitations: The binary search step in the algorithm risks false positives/negatives due to a suboptimal cluster center estimator. This limitation is not adequately discussed, and its impact on the algorithm's performance is unclear.
3. Overstated Claims: The assertion of "guaranteed success" is misleading, as the results are probabilistic (Theorem 7). This distinction needs to be clarified.
4. Logical Flow: Lemmas 5 and 6 are misordered, with Lemma 5 relying on a probabilistic result proven in Lemma 6. This disrupts the logical flow and should be corrected.
5. Dependence on Supplementary Material: Key results and proofs, such as the hardness proof in Section 4.1, are relegated to the appendix, making it harder to evaluate the paper's contributions without extensive cross-referencing.
Recommendation:
The paper makes a strong theoretical contribution to semi-supervised clustering and computational complexity. However, the issues with clarity, overstated claims, and insufficient discussion of algorithmic limitations need to be addressed. I recommend acceptance with major revisions, provided the authors:
1. Improve the clarity and organization of the manuscript, particularly in Sections 4.1 and 3.
2. Discuss the limitations of the algorithm (e.g., suboptimal center estimation) in more detail.
3. Correct the logical ordering of lemmas and ensure all claims are appropriately justified.
4. Reduce reliance on supplementary material by integrating key results into the main text.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Novel and significant contributions to clustering theory.
- Rigorous analysis of query complexity and computational hardness.
- Potential for practical applications in semi-supervised learning.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Unclear writing and inconsistent notation.
- Overstated claims and insufficient discussion of limitations.
- Dependence on supplementary material for critical results.
With revisions, this paper could make a valuable addition to the conference proceedings.
