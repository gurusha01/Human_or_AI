This paper addresses the problem of regression and classification in the Limited Attribute Observation (LAO) setting, where a learner can only observe a limited number of attributes per example. The authors derive novel lower bounds on the precision achievable by any algorithm under this constraint for several loss functions, including squared loss, absolute loss, and hinge loss. These results demonstrate fundamental limitations in the LAO setting, such as the impossibility of achieving arbitrarily low error with fewer than two observed attributes for regression. Additionally, the paper complements these theoretical findings with a general-purpose algorithm that achieves precision close to the derived limits.
Strengths
The paper is well-written and organized, with clear motivation and a thorough theoretical analysis. The derivation of lower bounds is rigorous and provides valuable insights into the inherent challenges of learning in the LAO setting. The authors extend prior work by addressing absolute loss and hinge loss, filling important gaps in the literature. The inclusion of a general-purpose algorithm is a practical complement to the theoretical results, offering a constructive approach to achieving limited precision in regression and classification tasks.
Weaknesses
While the theoretical contributions are strong, the lack of experimental validation is a notable limitation. Empirical results demonstrating the practical implications of the derived bounds and the performance of the proposed algorithm would significantly strengthen the paper. Additionally, the proofs, while solid, could benefit from additional high-level explanations in the appendix to improve accessibility for readers less familiar with the technical details. Finally, the paper does not explore whether the results would differ if the attribute vector \(x\) were drawn from \([0, 1]^d\) instead of being binary, which could broaden the applicability of the findings.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Experimental Validation: Include experiments to validate the theoretical bounds and demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm in practical scenarios.
2. Appendix Clarifications: Add intuitive descriptions or diagrams in the appendix to explain the general ideas behind the proofs, making them more accessible to a broader audience.
3. Generalization of Results: Investigate whether the results hold or change when the attribute vector \(x\) is sampled from \([0, 1]^d\) instead of being binary. This would address a potentially important use case in real-world applications.
Arguments for Acceptance
- The paper provides novel and rigorous theoretical contributions to the LAO setting, advancing the state of the art.
- It fills gaps in the literature by addressing absolute and hinge loss functions, which were previously unexplored in this context.
- The proposed algorithm complements the theoretical results, offering practical utility.
Arguments Against Acceptance
- The lack of experimental results limits the paper's ability to demonstrate the practical relevance of its findings.
- The proofs, while correct, could be more accessible with additional high-level explanations.
- The paper does not explore the generalization of its results to non-binary attribute spaces, leaving an important question unanswered.
Recommendation
I recommend acceptance with minor revisions. The theoretical contributions are significant, but the inclusion of experimental validation and additional clarifications would make the paper more impactful and accessible.
