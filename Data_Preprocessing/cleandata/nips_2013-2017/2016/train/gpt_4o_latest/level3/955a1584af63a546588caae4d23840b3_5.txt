The paper investigates the Limited Attribute Observation (LAO) model, where learning algorithms are constrained to observe only a limited number of attributes per example. It establishes the first lower bounds on the precision attainable for regression with absolute and squared loss, as well as classification with hinge loss, under this setting. These results are significant as they provide theoretical limits on the achievable accuracy of learning algorithms in scenarios with restricted data access, such as medical diagnostics where only a subset of tests can be conducted. The authors complement these lower bounds with a general-purpose algorithm that achieves an upper bound on precision, leaving a small gap between the theoretical limits and practical performance.
The paper is technically sound, with well-integrated proofs for its theorems. The authors employ rigorous mathematical analysis to derive lower bounds for regression and classification tasks. For instance, they demonstrate that at least two attributes are necessary to achieve arbitrary precision in regression with squared loss, and they extend this result to absolute loss and hinge loss classification. The proofs are detailed and logically consistent, leveraging subgradient analysis and information-theoretic arguments. The introduction and related work sections adequately situate the research within the broader literature, referencing prior work on regression with missing data and LAO settings.
However, the paper's primary weakness lies in its lack of experimental validation. While the theoretical contributions are robust, the absence of empirical results makes it difficult to assess the practical implications of the proposed bounds and algorithm. For example, it would be valuable to see how the general-purpose algorithm performs on real-world datasets with varying attribute observation limits. Additionally, the exponential gap between the lower and upper bounds for hinge loss classification raises questions about the tightness of the bounds, which could have been explored experimentally.
Strengths:
1. Originality: The paper addresses a novel problem and provides the first lower bounds for regression and classification in the LAO setting.
2. Theoretical Rigor: The proofs are well-constructed and contribute significantly to the understanding of learning under limited attribute observation.
3. Clarity: The paper is well-organized, with clear definitions and logical progression of ideas.
Weaknesses:
1. Lack of Experiments: Theoretical results are not supported by empirical validation, limiting the paper's practical impact.
2. Gap in Bounds: The exponential gap for hinge loss classification is not fully explored, leaving room for further refinement.
Recommendation:
While the paper makes a strong theoretical contribution, the lack of experimental validation is a significant drawback. I recommend acceptance conditional on the authors addressing this limitation in a future revision or supplementing the paper with empirical results. The work is a valuable addition to the field, but its practical relevance needs further substantiation.
