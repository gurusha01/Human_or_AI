The paper investigates the influence of recommender systems (RS) on user ratings and proposes a truncated-SVD algorithm to recover the true rating matrix, unaffected by RS feedback loops. The authors aim to quantify RS influence and recover intrinsic user preferences using a single snapshot of the observed ratings matrix. They validate their algorithm on synthetic and real-world datasets and propose a metric to measure RS influence. While the study addresses an important problem in collaborative filtering, several assumptions and methodological choices limit its real-world applicability.
Strengths:  
The paper tackles a significant challenge in recommender systems by attempting to disentangle RS-induced biases from true user preferences. The use of truncated-SVD for deconvolution is computationally efficient and theoretically grounded. The validation on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrates the feasibility of the approach. The proposed metric for quantifying RS influence provides a novel perspective on evaluating RS effects, and the results, such as distinguishing datasets with and without RS effects, are insightful. Additionally, the authors provide a detailed discussion of their assumptions and limitations, which is commendable.
Weaknesses:  
The paper's primary limitation lies in its assumptions, which are overly simplistic for real-world RS. Assumption 1, which models RS effects using an item-item similarity matrix and iterative updates, does not generalize to more complex algorithms like Bayesian matrix factorization or deep learning-based recommenders. Assumption 2, which models user behavior using a single Bernoulli random variable, fails to capture the diversity of user interactions and preferences. The metric proposed in Eq. (10) to measure RS influence is unnecessarily complex and lacks clear justification, making it less interpretable and potentially less practical than simpler alternatives. Furthermore, the paper does not adequately address how the recovered true ratings could be validated against ground truth in real-world scenarios, where intrinsic preferences are inherently unobservable.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:  
Pro: The paper addresses a critical and underexplored problem in RS research. The truncated-SVD approach is computationally efficient and could inspire further research in deconvolving RS effects. The validation on multiple datasets enhances the credibility of the results.  
Con: The restrictive assumptions significantly limit the applicability of the proposed method to modern RS. The complexity of the influence metric and the lack of justification for its design reduce its practical utility. The paper does not provide sufficient evidence that the recovered true ratings are meaningful in real-world contexts.
Recommendation:  
While the paper offers a novel perspective and a promising algorithmic approach, the restrictive assumptions and methodological limitations undermine its practical impact. I recommend a weak reject, encouraging the authors to refine their assumptions, simplify the influence metric, and explore validation strategies that better align with real-world RS scenarios.
