The paper presents a novel approach to dimensionality reduction for large-scale sparse matrices, addressing both theoretical and practical challenges. The authors propose an algorithm based on coresets, which provides performance guarantees independent of data size and dimensionality. This is a significant contribution, as it resolves a long-standing open problem in the field. The algorithm is efficient, with provable bounds on size and running time, and is demonstrated on a large-scale application: computing Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) for the entire English Wikipedia. This practical demonstration highlights the scalability and utility of the proposed method, which is particularly relevant for modern high-dimensional, sparse datasets.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Theoretical Contribution: The paper introduces a deterministic coreset construction framework that is independent of both the number of rows (n) and columns (d) in the input matrix. This is a significant advancement over existing methods, which often depend on one or both dimensions.
2. Scalability: The algorithm's ability to handle massive datasets, such as the Wikipedia document-term matrix, is a compelling practical achievement. The experimental results demonstrate its efficiency and robustness.
3. Provable Guarantees: The theoretical analysis is rigorous, with clear bounds on error, size, and runtime. This adds credibility to the claims and positions the work as a strong contribution to the field.
4. Open-Source Implementation: The availability of the codebase enhances reproducibility and encourages further exploration and application of the method.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity and Writing Quality: The paper is difficult to follow due to poor organization and language issues. Key concepts, such as the meaning of symbols (e.g., `||` in Equation (2)), are not adequately explained, and Equation (3) is particularly unclear. Significant proofreading is required to improve readability.
2. Discussion of Related Work: While the paper references prior work, it lacks a comprehensive discussion of related algorithms for large-scale data. For example, relevant work on manifold distance [R1] is not cited, and the connections to existing methods are not well-articulated.
3. Typos and Formatting: The manuscript contains numerous typographical errors, and the reference formatting is inconsistent. These issues detract from the overall professionalism of the submission.
4. Experimental Details: While the results are promising, the experimental section could benefit from more detailed comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, particularly in terms of runtime and accuracy trade-offs.
Recommendation:
The paper addresses an important problem with a novel and theoretically sound solution, making it a valuable contribution to the field. However, the clarity of presentation, discussion of related work, and writing quality need substantial improvement. I recommend conditional acceptance, provided the authors address the following:
1. Revise the manuscript for clarity, organization, and language, ensuring all symbols and equations are well-explained.
2. Expand the discussion of related work, particularly citing [R1] and other relevant algorithms.
3. Correct typographical errors and ensure consistent reference formatting.
4. Provide additional experimental comparisons with existing methods.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Significant theoretical and practical contributions.
- Scalability demonstrated on a challenging real-world dataset.
- Open-source implementation promotes reproducibility.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Poor writing quality and lack of clarity.
- Insufficient discussion of related work.
- Formatting and typographical issues.
With the suggested revisions, the paper has the potential to make a strong impact in the field of large-scale dimensionality reduction.
