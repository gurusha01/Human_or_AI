This paper investigates the problem of learning under the Limited Attribute Observation (LAO) model, where the learner can only access a fixed number of features, \(k\), per example. Building on the foundational framework of Ben-David and Dichterman (1998), it establishes novel lower bounds for linear regression and classification tasks under various loss functions. Specifically, the authors prove that for regression with square loss, learning is impossible when \(k=1\), with \(k=2\) being the tight bound for achieving arbitrary precision. For regression with absolute loss and classification with hinge loss, the paper demonstrates that learning is impossible for any fixed \(k < d\), irrespective of the number of samples. These results are complemented by a general-purpose algorithm that achieves an upper bound on precision in the LAO setting.
Strengths:
1. Technical Depth and Rigor: The paper provides strong theoretical contributions by establishing information-theoretic lower bounds for regression and classification tasks. The proofs are mathematically rigorous, with clear distinctions between the challenges posed by different loss functions.
2. Novelty: The results on the impossibility of learning with absolute and hinge losses under fixed \(k\) are new and extend the understanding of the LAO model. The tight bound for square loss (\(k=2\)) fills an important gap in prior work.
3. Framework Extension: By leveraging indistinguishable distributions and subgradient analysis, the paper extends the LAO framework to previously unexplored loss functions, advancing the state of the art.
4. Practical Relevance: The study has implications for real-world problems, such as medical diagnosis, where feature access is inherently limited. The proposed algorithm provides a practical approach for achieving bounded precision in such settings.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity of Presentation: While the technical content is solid, the paper could benefit from improved organization and clearer explanations, particularly in the proofs for absolute and hinge losses, which are intricate and may be challenging for non-expert readers.
2. Experimental Validation: The paper lacks empirical evaluation of the proposed algorithm. While the theoretical results are compelling, experiments demonstrating the algorithm's performance under realistic constraints would strengthen its practical impact.
3. Scope of Loss Functions: The focus on square, absolute, and hinge losses is well-motivated, but the paper does not explore other commonly used loss functions, such as logistic loss, which could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the LAO model.
Recommendation:
I recommend accepting this paper. Its contributions are significant, addressing fundamental questions about the limits of learning with missing attributes. The theoretical insights are robust, and the results are likely to inspire further research in both theory and practice. However, the authors should consider revising the manuscript to improve clarity and, if possible, include experimental results to validate the proposed algorithm.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Strong theoretical contributions with novel lower bounds.
- Advances the understanding of learning under feature constraints.
- Provides a general-purpose algorithm that complements the theoretical results.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Limited clarity in some sections, particularly the proofs.
- Lack of experimental validation.
- Narrow focus on specific loss functions.
In summary, the paper is a solid contribution to the field and aligns well with the conference's focus on advancing the theoretical and practical understanding of machine learning.
