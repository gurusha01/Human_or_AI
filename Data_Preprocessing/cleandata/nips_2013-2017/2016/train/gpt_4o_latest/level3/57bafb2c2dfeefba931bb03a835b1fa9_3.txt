The paper presents a significant extension of stochastic block models (SBMs) to accommodate heterogeneous communities with varying sizes and connectivity, addressing an important gap in the literature. By providing sufficient recovery conditions for convex relaxation and a modified maximum likelihood estimator (MLE), along with general lower bounds, the authors contribute to the theoretical understanding of exact recovery in SBMs. The inclusion of concrete examples in Section 3 effectively illustrates tradeoffs in heterogeneous SBM configurations, such as the recovery of small or weak communities under specific conditions. These examples highlight the practical relevance of the theoretical results and demonstrate the potential of semidefinite programming for community detection in challenging scenarios.
However, the paper has several weaknesses that limit its impact. First, the explanation and intuition behind key conditions in the main theorems, particularly Theorem 1, are insufficient. While the mathematical rigor is evident, the lack of interpretability makes it difficult for readers to grasp the implications of the results. For instance, the sufficient recovery conditions in Theorem 1 are not contextualized in terms of their operational meaning or practical significance. Similarly, the concept of "relative density," a central parameter in the analysis, requires clearer definition and interpretation.
Second, the paper does not address the gap between the upper and lower bounds for MLE performance, leaving the tightness of the results uncertain. This omission is critical, as it prevents a comprehensive understanding of the theoretical guarantees. Additionally, the statistical impact of modifying the MLE algorithm is not compared to the original MLE, which would have provided valuable insights into the tradeoffs involved.
Another major limitation is the absence of numerical experiments. While the theoretical results are compelling, empirical validation is essential to demonstrate their practical applicability. For instance, experiments using convex programming could showcase the power of the proposed methods for small community sizes and validate the theoretical recovery guarantees.
Finally, the paper's clarity could be improved. Certain phrases, such as "sufficient conditions for when the exact recovery is impossible," are misleading and should be revised (e.g., to "necessary conditions for exact recovery"). Additionally, the lower bound in Theorem 4 requires further interpretation and comparison with the sufficient recovery condition in Theorem 3 to provide a cohesive narrative.
Strengths:
- Extends SBM theory to heterogeneous communities with varying sizes and connectivity.
- Develops sufficient recovery conditions for convex relaxation and modified MLE.
- Provides general lower bounds and illustrative examples of tradeoffs in SBM parameters.
- Advances understanding of recovery guarantees for challenging SBM configurations.
Weaknesses:
- Lacks intuition and explanation for key conditions in the main theorems.
- Does not discuss the gap between upper and lower bounds for MLE performance.
- No numerical experiments to validate theoretical results.
- Operational meaning of "relative density" is unclear.
- Statistical impact of modifying MLE is not compared to the original.
- Clarity issues in phrasing and interpretation of results.
Recommendation:
While the paper makes a valuable theoretical contribution, its weaknesses in clarity, interpretability, and empirical validation limit its overall impact. Addressing these issues, particularly through numerical experiments and improved explanations, would significantly strengthen the paper. I recommend acceptance only if the authors can address these concerns in a revision.
