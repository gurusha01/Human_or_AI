The paper introduces a novel framework for Semi-Supervised Active Clustering (SSAC) that leverages same-cluster queries to address the computational challenges of clustering under the k-means setting. The authors present a probabilistic polynomial-time algorithm that efficiently solves clustering problems satisfying the γ-margin property, a condition under which k-means clustering is otherwise NP-hard. By utilizing a small number of same-cluster queries, the proposed algorithm achieves a query complexity close to the theoretical lower bound, making significant strides in reducing the computational burden of clustering tasks.
The strengths of this paper are manifold. First, the work is well-motivated, addressing the dual challenges of computational hardness and under-specification in clustering. The introduction of the γ-margin property and its connection to the phase transition behavior of the k-means objective is particularly insightful. The authors convincingly demonstrate that access to a limited number of same-cluster queries can transform an NP-hard problem into a computationally feasible one, showcasing a novel trade-off between query complexity and computational complexity. The theoretical contributions are robust, with rigorous proofs supporting the claims, and the algorithm's efficiency is well-characterized in terms of both time and query complexity. Furthermore, the paper is clearly written and well-organized, making it accessible to readers familiar with clustering and computational complexity.
However, there are some limitations and areas for improvement. The assumption of a perfect oracle is a significant simplification; real-world oracles are prone to errors or abstentions. Exploring the impact of oracle imperfections on the algorithm's performance would enhance the practical applicability of the framework. Additionally, while the theoretical contributions are strong, empirical comparisons with existing clustering methods, such as k-means++, under similar conditions, are missing and would provide valuable insights into the practical benefits of the proposed approach. Extending the framework to probabilistic clustering models, such as Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), and incorporating probabilistic oracle assignments could further broaden the scope of the work.
In conclusion, this paper makes a significant theoretical contribution to the field of clustering by introducing the SSAC framework and demonstrating its potential to address NP-hard problems efficiently. While the work is primarily theoretical, its implications are promising for practical applications. To strengthen the paper, the authors should address the limitations of the perfect oracle assumption, provide empirical evaluations, and explore extensions to probabilistic clustering models. Minor revisions, such as correcting the typo in Theorem 7 ("clustering instane" to "clustering instance"), should also be made. Overall, the paper is a valuable contribution to the field and merits strong consideration for acceptance.
