The paper presents a significant theoretical advancement in understanding the Burer-Monteiro factorization for the matrix completion problem, proving that the associated non-convex objective function has no spurious local minima. This result ensures that all local minima are global, providing a strong theoretical foundation for the empirical success of non-convex optimization methods, such as gradient descent, in solving matrix completion problems from arbitrary initialization. The authors also extend their results to noisy settings, demonstrating robustness under practical conditions.
The paper builds on prior work in non-convex optimization and matrix completion, such as the well-initialized gradient descent analyses by Sun and Luo (2015) and others, but goes further by removing the need for careful initialization. The authors achieve this by analyzing the geometry of the objective function outside the strongly convex region, leveraging concentration inequalities to establish that spurious stationary points are strict saddle points. This guarantees that optimization algorithms can escape these points and converge globally. The introduction of new techniques to address incoherence issues and the effect of regularization is particularly noteworthy, as it strengthens the theoretical guarantees and broadens the applicability of the results.
Strengths:
1. Technical Rigor: The proofs are solid, with a detailed analysis of the objective function's geometry and the role of the regularizer. The use of concentration inequalities is well-justified and innovative.
2. Clarity: The paper is well-organized, with clear explanations of the problem, related work, and proof strategy. The illustrative examples for the rank-1 case effectively convey the intuition behind the results.
3. Significance: The results have broad implications for both theory and practice, advancing the state of the art in matrix completion and non-convex optimization. The guarantee of global convergence from arbitrary initialization is a major step forward.
4. Originality: The work introduces novel proof techniques and extends the understanding of non-convex optimization in matrix completion, distinguishing it from prior contributions.
Weaknesses:
1. Minor Technical Error: A small issue in inequality (3.9) is noted, though it is deemed fixable. Addressing this in a revised version would strengthen the paper.
2. Generality: While the results are robust to noise, the paper focuses on symmetric positive semidefinite matrices. Extending the analysis to asymmetric cases or alternative loss functions could enhance its impact.
3. Practical Validation: The paper is primarily theoretical, and while the results are compelling, empirical validation on real-world datasets would provide additional support for the claims.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper makes a substantial theoretical contribution by proving global convergence for a widely used non-convex optimization approach.
- It introduces novel techniques that could inspire further research in related areas.
- The results address a fundamental question in matrix completion, bridging the gap between theory and practice.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The scope is somewhat limited to symmetric matrix completion, and extensions to more general settings are not explored.
- The lack of empirical experiments may leave practitioners questioning the practical implications.
Recommendation: Strong accept. The paper is a high-quality contribution to the field, with rigorous theoretical results that advance our understanding of non-convex optimization for matrix completion. Addressing the noted minor issues and extending the scope in future work would further enhance its impact.
