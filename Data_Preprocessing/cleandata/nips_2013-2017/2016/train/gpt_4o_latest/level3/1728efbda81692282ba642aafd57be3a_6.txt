This paper presents a spectral analysis of the Koopman operator in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) and proposes a modal decomposition algorithm for analyzing nonlinear dynamical systems using finite-length data. The authors extend the dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) framework with kernelized techniques, enabling richer approximations of Koopman eigenfunctions. The proposed algorithm is demonstrated on synthetic systems (damped linear 1D dynamics and the Henon map) and applied to real-world locomotion data. The authors also explore applications such as prediction, dynamic pattern recognition, and change-point detection.
Strengths:
1. Theoretical Contribution: The paper provides a rigorous extension of DMD by leveraging RKHS, which allows for a more expressive representation of Koopman eigenfunctions. The theoretical derivations are sound and mathematically well-executed.
2. Educational Value: The paper is clearly written and serves as a valuable resource for readers unfamiliar with the Koopman operator and its connections to machine learning. The inclusion of detailed derivations and algorithmic steps enhances its pedagogical utility.
3. Novelty: While the use of kernel methods in spectral analysis is not entirely new, the combination of Koopman operator theory with kernelized DMD is a meaningful contribution. The work bridges concepts from fluid dynamics and machine learning, potentially opening new avenues for interdisciplinary research.
4. Applications: The paper demonstrates the algorithm's utility in extracting features for nonlinear dynamical systems, with examples of prediction, dynamics recognition, and change-point detection.
Weaknesses:
1. Experimental Scope: The experimental results are primarily limited to synthetic systems and a single real-world dataset (locomotion data). The practical applicability of the method to broader machine learning tasks, such as robotics or control systems, remains unclear.
2. Comparative Analysis: While the results are compared with DMD, PCA, and kernel PCA, the findings are somewhat ambiguous. A more detailed discussion of the advantages and limitations of the proposed method relative to these baselines is needed.
3. Clarity on Feature Space Representation: It is unclear whether the modal decomposition algorithm requires explicit feature space representation, which could pose computational challenges for high-dimensional data.
4. Limited Practical Use Cases: The paper does not convincingly demonstrate the method's utility in real-world machine learning applications. More diverse and impactful use cases would strengthen the significance of the work.
5. Lack of Robustness Analysis: Although the authors propose a robustified variant using POD bases, the robustness of the algorithm under noisy or sparse data conditions is not thoroughly evaluated.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:
- Pro: The paper provides a solid theoretical foundation, is well-written, and offers a novel extension of DMD using kernel methods. It has educational value and demonstrates potential applications.
- Con: The experimental validation is limited, and the practical impact of the method for real-world machine learning tasks is not convincingly demonstrated.
Recommendation: While the paper makes a meaningful theoretical contribution, its practical significance and experimental rigor are limited. I recommend acceptance as a workshop paper or a poster presentation, provided the authors address the concerns regarding clarity, comparative analysis, and practical applications.
