This paper investigates the problem of learning in the Limited Attribute Observation (LAO) model, where only a subset of attributes per sample is visible to the learner. The authors present novel lower bounds for regression with absolute and squared loss, as well as for classification with hinge loss, establishing fundamental limits on the precision achievable in this setting. Additionally, they propose a general algorithm that achieves an upper bound on the error, complementing their theoretical findings.
The paper makes a significant contribution to the field by addressing gaps in prior work. It clarifies why its results do not contradict earlier findings, such as those by Hazan and Koren, and extends the theoretical understanding of the LAO model. The authors provide a thorough review of related work, situating their contributions within the broader context of learning with missing data. The results are presented with mathematical rigor, and the proofs are detailed and well-structured, making the paper a solid scientific contribution.
One of the paper's strengths is its clear articulation of the impossibility results, particularly for regression with absolute loss and classification with hinge loss. These results are significant as they establish fundamental barriers in the LAO setting, which were previously unexplored. The proposed algorithm is another highlight, offering a practical approach to achieving the precision limits identified in the theoretical analysis. The algorithm's performance guarantees, including its O(1/âˆšd) error bound, are compelling and align well with the theoretical lower bounds.
However, the paper has some weaknesses. The explanation of the first lower bound, particularly for general cost functions, could be improved. While the mathematical derivations are precise, the intuitive reasoning behind why learning fails in certain cases is less clear. Providing deeper insights into the mechanisms that lead to these failures would enhance the paper's impact and accessibility. Additionally, the exponential gap between the lower and upper bounds for classification with hinge loss is noted but not fully addressed, leaving room for further exploration.
Arguments for Acceptance:
1. The paper addresses a well-defined and important problem, making a significant theoretical contribution.
2. It provides rigorous proofs and complements them with a practical algorithm.
3. The results are novel and advance the state of the art in the LAO setting.
4. The writing is generally clear, and the related work is well-cited.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
1. The intuitive explanation of the first lower bound is lacking, which may hinder accessibility for a broader audience.
2. The exponential gap in the hinge loss results is left unresolved, which could limit the completeness of the contribution.
Overall, this paper is a strong candidate for acceptance. While there are areas for improvement, its contributions to the theoretical understanding of learning with limited attribute observations are substantial and impactful.
