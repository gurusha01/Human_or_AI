The paper tackles the challenging problem of estimating classifier or regression function risk using only unlabeled data, a task critical for unsupervised learning and domain adaptation. The authors propose a novel framework that leverages conditional independence assumptions across three views of the data to estimate risk. By employing the method of moments, the paper avoids fully specifying the underlying model, enabling risk estimation under weak assumptions. The framework extends to a wide range of loss functions, including log and exponential losses, and structured output settings like conditional random fields (CRFs). The authors also demonstrate how their method can be used for gradient-based unsupervised learning, providing theoretical guarantees and empirical validation.
Strengths
1. Novelty: The paper addresses an unusual and important problem, offering a fresh perspective on unsupervised risk estimation. The use of conditional independence assumptions and the method of moments is innovative and well-motivated.
2. Generality: The framework is applicable to a broad family of loss functions and structured output models, making it versatile.
3. Theoretical Rigor: The authors provide strong theoretical guarantees, including sample complexity bounds and robustness to model mis-specification.
4. Practical Relevance: The method has clear implications for unsupervised learning and domain adaptation, as demonstrated in the experiments.
5. Empirical Validation: The experiments on a modified MNIST dataset effectively illustrate the method's utility for risk estimation and domain adaptation.
Weaknesses
1. Clarity of Contribution: The improvement over Donmez et al. (2010) is not clearly articulated, particularly regarding the conditional independence assumptions. The paper assumes conditional independence of views, which appears stronger than the conditional independence of predictors in prior work.
2. Assumption Justification: The necessity of the three-view conditional independence assumption is not thoroughly justified. While the assumption is central to the method, its practical applicability may be limited in real-world datasets where such independence is rare.
3. HMM Setting: The extension to HMMs is somewhat misleading, as it assumes multiple i.i.d. time series rather than the sequential dependencies typical of HMMs. This could confuse readers familiar with standard HMM use cases.
4. Scope of Experiments: The experiments, while illustrative, are limited to a synthetic dataset derived from MNIST. It would strengthen the paper to evaluate the method on more diverse and realistic datasets.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance
Pros:
- The paper addresses a novel and important problem with significant implications for unsupervised learning and domain adaptation.
- The theoretical contributions are rigorous and well-supported.
- The proposed method is general and versatile, applicable to a wide range of loss functions and structured models.
Cons:
- The improvement over prior work is not clearly articulated, and the assumptions may be overly restrictive.
- The experimental evaluation is limited in scope, raising questions about the method's applicability to real-world datasets.
Recommendation
The paper makes a valuable contribution to the field of unsupervised learning by addressing a challenging problem with a novel approach. However, the lack of clarity regarding its improvement over prior work and the restrictive assumptions limit its impact. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions, focusing on clarifying the contribution over Donmez et al. (2010), justifying the assumptions, and expanding the experimental evaluation to more realistic datasets.
