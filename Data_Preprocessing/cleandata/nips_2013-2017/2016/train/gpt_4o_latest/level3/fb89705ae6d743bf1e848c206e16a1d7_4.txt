This paper presents a novel framework for modeling multivariate data with mixed discrete and continuous margins using vine copulas. The authors propose a method that separates dependency structures from marginal distributions and iteratively combines bivariate copula models to construct a joint model. The framework is validated on simulated data, including biologically realistic neural network simulations, and demonstrates its utility in estimating mutual information between neural activity (spike counts and LFPs) and stimulus conditions. The paper also highlights the scalability of the method for larger datasets, making it relevant for analyzing high-dimensional neural recordings.
Strengths:  
The paper introduces a technically sound and scalable approach to a challenging problem in neuroscience: modeling dependencies between mixed discrete and continuous data. The use of vine copulas is innovative in this context, and the authors provide a thorough theoretical foundation, including efficient algorithms for sampling, likelihood calculation, and inference. The validation on simulated data and biologically realistic neural networks demonstrates the practical applicability of the method. The results, particularly the differences in mutual information estimates across models, underscore the importance of accounting for mixed margins and dependencies. The framework's ability to handle high-dimensional data efficiently is a significant contribution, especially in the context of modern neuroscience datasets.
Weaknesses:  
While the framework is promising, the paper has some limitations. First, the explanation of the tree structure in the vine copula model could be more intuitive, especially for readers unfamiliar with the concept. A visual or step-by-step example might help clarify the construction process. Second, the reliance on pairwise copula constructions raises concerns about neglecting higher-order dependencies, which could be significant in neural data. Although the authors acknowledge this limitation, a more detailed discussion or empirical evaluation of its impact would strengthen the paper. Additionally, the reduction in mutual information observed in the results raises questions about redundancy in coding between spike counts and LFPs, which warrants further exploration. Finally, a comparison with Gaussian copula models is suggested but not fully explored, leaving open questions about the relative performance and trade-offs.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:  
Pro:  
- The paper addresses a significant gap in statistical modeling for neuroscience.  
- The framework is scalable and applicable to real-world high-dimensional datasets.  
- The results demonstrate clear advantages over independent and fully continuous models.  
- The methodology is grounded in well-established statistical principles.  
Con:  
- Higher-order dependencies are not explicitly modeled, which may limit the framework's applicability in some scenarios.  
- The explanation of the vine tree structure could be improved for clarity.  
- The reduction in mutual information and its implications are not fully discussed.  
- A more comprehensive comparison with Gaussian copula models is needed.
Recommendation:  
Overall, this paper represents a valuable contribution to the field of computational neuroscience and statistical modeling. While there are areas for improvement, the strengths of the proposed framework outweigh its limitations. I recommend acceptance, provided the authors address the concerns regarding higher-order dependencies, tree structure explanation, and performance comparisons in a revised version.
