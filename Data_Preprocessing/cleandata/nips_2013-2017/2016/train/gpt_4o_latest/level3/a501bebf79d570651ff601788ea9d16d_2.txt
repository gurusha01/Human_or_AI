This paper addresses a critical challenge in training recurrent neural networks (RNNs): the high memory demands of backpropagation through time (BPTT), especially for long sequences and large models. While existing methods like truncated BPTT and recomputing forward passes attempt to alleviate memory constraints, they often involve suboptimal trade-offs. The authors propose a novel dynamic programming-based approach to optimize the trade-off between memory usage and computational cost during BPTT. Their method strategically determines whether to store or recompute intermediate results, achieving significant memory savings while maintaining computational efficiency.
The proposed approach is rigorously developed, with theoretical bounds provided for sequence length and memory budgets. The authors explore three cost formulations: storing hidden states, internal states, or a combination of both. Experimental results demonstrate that their method achieves up to 95% memory savings with only a 33% increase in computation time, outperforming naive baselines and a previously published divide-and-conquer heuristic. The inclusion of pseudo-code enhances reproducibility, and the paper is well-structured with clear notations and helpful figures.
Strengths:
1. Significance: The paper addresses a pressing problem in RNN training, particularly relevant for memory-limited devices like GPUs. The ability to fit within tight memory budgets without excessive computational overhead is a practical and impactful contribution.
2. Originality: The use of dynamic programming to derive an optimal memory-computation trade-off policy is novel and represents a clear advancement over heuristic methods.
3. Quality: The theoretical analysis is robust, and the experimental results convincingly demonstrate the method's superiority over existing approaches.
4. Clarity: The paper is well-written, with clear explanations, relevant baselines, and illustrative figures. The inclusion of pseudo-code makes the method accessible to practitioners.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity of Results: The deduction of the 33% increase in computation time is not fully explained, leaving room for ambiguity in interpreting the trade-off.
2. Presentation: Some figure captions are unclear, and axis labels and legends are too small, hindering readability.
3. Minor Typos: These detract slightly from the overall polish of the manuscript.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper presents a novel and well-validated solution to a significant problem in RNN training.

- Theoretical and experimental results are strong, and the paper advances the state of the art.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Minor clarity and presentation issues, though they do not detract from the core contributions.
- The explanation of computational trade-offs could be more detailed.
Recommendation:
I recommend acceptance of this paper. Its contributions are significant, original, and well-supported, and it addresses a real-world challenge in a meaningful way. Addressing the minor clarity and presentation issues in a revision would further strengthen the paper.
