This paper investigates the problem of exact recovery in the heterogeneous stochastic block model (SBM) and provides significant theoretical advancements. The authors extend prior work by analyzing the SBM in its full generality, allowing for varying community sizes, connectivity probabilities, and a growing number of communities. They demonstrate that semidefinite programming (SDP) can recover communities smaller than previously believed feasible (e.g., sizes below \( \sqrt{\log n} \)), under certain conditions. This is a notable contribution to the field, as it challenges the long-held assumption that communities below \( \log n \) in size are unrecoverable. The paper also introduces a key parameter, "relative density," which facilitates recovery guarantees for diverse SBM configurations, and provides both upper and lower bounds for exact recoverability.
Strengths:
1. Theoretical Contributions: The results on recovering smaller communities (e.g., \( O(\sqrt{\log n}) \)) via SDP are groundbreaking and extend the boundaries of what is considered computationally feasible. Theorems 1 and 2 provide rigorous guarantees for recovery under specific conditions, while Theorem 3 addresses recovery via a modified maximum likelihood estimator.
2. Clarity and Organization: The paper is well-organized and easy to follow, with a logical progression from problem setup to theoretical results and illustrative examples. Table 1 is particularly helpful in summarizing the theoretical results and their applicable regimes.
3. Examples and Applications: The inclusion of detailed examples (e.g., configurations with small or weak communities) demonstrates the practical implications of the theoretical results. These examples highlight scenarios where existing methods fail but the proposed approach succeeds.
4. Extension to Partial Observations: The authors adapt their results to partially observed graphs, which is a valuable extension for real-world applications where data is often incomplete.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity on Continuous vs. Binary Outputs: While Theorems 1 and 2 ensure that \( \hat{Y} \) and \( Y^ \) coincide under regularity conditions, the handling of continuous \( \hat{Y} \) versus binary \( Y^ \) is not fully clarified. This distinction is critical for practical implementation and should be addressed more explicitly.
2. Unclear Maximization Set in Equation (2.4): The maximization set for the SDP formulation in Equation (2.4) is not clearly specified. This lack of clarity could hinder reproducibility and understanding of the proposed method.
3. Limited Discussion on Phase Transitions: While the paper advances understanding of recoverability, it does not address phase transitions or potential information-computation gaps in heterogeneous SBM, leaving an important open question unexplored.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper provides substantial theoretical advancements in community detection, particularly in recovering small and weak communities.
- It is well-written, with clear explanations and illustrative examples that enhance understanding.
- The results are likely to inspire further research on heterogeneous SBMs and related problems.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The lack of clarity in certain technical aspects (e.g., handling of continuous outputs, specification of the maximization set) could limit the paper's immediate impact.
- The omission of phase transition analysis leaves a key aspect of SBM recovery unexplored.
Recommendation:
Overall, this paper makes a strong contribution to the theoretical understanding of community detection in heterogeneous SBMs. While there are minor issues with clarity and scope, the significance of the results outweighs these concerns. I recommend acceptance, with minor revisions to address the noted weaknesses.
