The paper introduces a method to evaluate MCMC transition operators using the bidirectional Monte Carlo (BDMC) approach, leveraging the gap between upper and lower bounds as a performance metric. This method, termed Bounding Divergences with Reverse Annealing (BREAD), is integrated into two probabilistic programming systems, Stan and WebPPL, and validated on several models and datasets. The authors propose a protocol for assessing posterior inference quality on real-world data by simulating data from fitted hyperparameters and comparing inference behavior across real and simulated datasets. The paper also uses BREAD to explore model representation trade-offs and uncovers a bug in WebPPL, showcasing its utility for debugging.
Strengths:  
The use of BDMC to assess MCMC convergence is simple, impactful, and well-suited for probabilistic programming systems. The integration of BREAD into Stan and WebPPL demonstrates its practical applicability, and the experiments provide valuable insights into model representation trade-offs. The ability to rigorously bound the Jeffreys divergence in expectation is a significant contribution, as it provides a quantitative measure of inference quality. Additionally, the debugging capability of BREAD highlights its potential utility beyond evaluation, making it a versatile tool for probabilistic programming.
Weaknesses:  
The paper's novelty is somewhat limited, as the main insight—interpreting the bound gap as an upper bound on the Jensen-Shannon divergence—is not entirely new. Clarity issues are prevalent, with ambiguous or inconsistent definitions, equations, and notations (e.g., $\vec{v}$, AutoBDMC, and RAIS), which hinder readability. The experiments, while promising, lack a systematic study of the annealing schedule (βt) and its impact on performance. Furthermore, the analysis of how bound gaps vary with step size is insufficient, and parameterization details are not clearly explained. The omission of a key citation to Radford Neal's Tempered Transitions (TT), which shares methodological similarities with BDMC, is a notable gap in the related work section. Minor typos, such as missing parentheses in DKL terms and an incorrect citation for NUTS, detract from the paper's polish.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:  
Pro: The method is promising, impactful, and well-suited for probabilistic programming systems. The integration into Stan and WebPPL demonstrates practical utility, and the debugging capability adds value.  
Con: Clarity and novelty concerns limit the paper's accessibility and contribution. Experimental gaps reduce the robustness of the results, and missing citations weaken the contextualization of the work.
Recommendations for Improvement:  
The paper would benefit from a systematic study of annealing schedules (β_t) and their impact on performance, as well as a more thorough analysis of bound gaps and parameterization. Definitions, equations, and notations should be clarified and made consistent. The authors should address the missing citation to Radford Neal's Tempered Transitions and ensure all references are accurate. Finally, minor typos should be corrected to improve the manuscript's overall quality.
Overall Impression:  
Despite its limitations, the method is promising and potentially impactful. If the authors address the clarity, novelty, and experimental issues, the paper warrants acceptance.
