The paper presents an extension of ODE dynamics for constrained convex optimization by introducing a generalized averaging scheme and proposing an adaptive averaging strategy to improve discretization. The authors leverage a Lyapunov argument to derive sufficient conditions for achieving desired convergence rates and demonstrate the application of their framework to accelerated Mirror Descent (AMD). They also propose an adaptive averaging heuristic, which dynamically adjusts weights to improve the decrease of the Lyapunov function, and provide numerical experiments comparing their method to existing heuristics like adaptive restarting.
Strengths:
1. Theoretical Contribution: The paper provides a unified framework for analyzing generalized averaging in accelerated dynamics, which adds to the understanding of continuous-time optimization methods.
2. Novelty in Adaptive Averaging: The adaptive averaging heuristic is an intuitive idea that aligns well with the goal of improving convergence rates. It preserves the quadratic convergence rate in discrete time and offers a new perspective on adaptive strategies.
3. Connection to Existing Work: The paper builds on prior work on accelerated methods and continuous-time dynamics, such as Nesterov's methods and replicator dynamics, and situates its contributions within this context.
4. Numerical Experiments: The experiments compare adaptive averaging with other heuristics, providing empirical evidence of its potential advantages, particularly in strongly convex settings.
Weaknesses:
1. Originality and Utility: While the adaptive averaging strategy is new, its originality is somewhat limited, as many elements in the paper are direct extensions or minor modifications of prior work. The utility of the generalized averaging scheme remains unclear, as its practical advantages are not convincingly demonstrated.
2. Theoretical Grounding: The adaptive averaging heuristic lacks rigorous theoretical guarantees beyond preserving the convergence rate. Explicit convergence proofs or faster rates for specific cases (e.g., strongly convex functions) are missing, making the method appear heuristic rather than principled.
3. Comparative Analysis: The paper does not include a comprehensive comparison with other averaging schemes, leaving the relative advantage of the proposed method ambiguous.
4. Experimental Limitations: The experiments are limited to toy examples and low-dimensional settings, which fail to convincingly demonstrate the general applicability or superiority of the adaptive averaging strategy. The lack of experiments on real-world problems or higher-dimensional datasets weakens the empirical validation.
5. Clarity and Scope: While the paper is well-organized, some sections (e.g., the derivation of conditions for Lyapunov functions) are dense and may be difficult for non-expert readers to follow. Additionally, the scope of the work feels narrow, focusing primarily on theoretical extensions without broader implications for machine learning.
Recommendation:
While the paper provides some interesting insights into adaptive averaging and accelerated dynamics, its contributions are incremental, and the lack of strong theoretical and empirical support limits its impact. The authors' post-rebuttal promises to include additional experiments, theoretical proofs, and comparisons are encouraging, but the current submission falls short of the standards for significant advancement in the field. I recommend rejection in its current form but encourage resubmission after addressing the outlined concerns.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Novel adaptive averaging heuristic with intuitive appeal.
- Theoretical framework contributes to understanding accelerated dynamics.
- Promising empirical results in specific cases.
Arguments for Rejection:
- Limited originality and practical utility of the proposed extensions.
- Lack of rigorous theoretical guarantees for the adaptive heuristic.
- Insufficient empirical validation and missing comparisons with other methods.
- Incremental contribution with minimal impact on advancing machine learning.
Overall Rating: 5/10 (Borderline reject).
