The paper addresses the problem of online pricing with patient buyers, a novel and challenging setting where buyers can strategically wait for lower prices within a predefined time window. The authors propose an algorithm that achieves a regret bound of \(O(\tau^{1/3} \cdot n^{1/3} \cdot T^{2/3})\), where \(\tau\) is the maximum patience of buyers, \(n\) is the number of price options, and \(T\) is the time horizon. They also establish a matching lower bound of \(\Omega(\tau^{1/3} \cdot T^{2/3})\), demonstrating the tightness of their results. This work builds on prior research in multi-armed bandits (MAB) and posted-price mechanisms but extends these models to account for strategic buyer behavior, filling an important gap in the literature.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Relevance: The paper introduces a new and realistic model of strategic buyers with patience, which is a meaningful extension of existing work in online pricing and regret minimization. The consideration of bounded waiting periods adds practical relevance to the model.
2. Theoretical Contributions: The algorithm achieves a regret bound that is tight up to logarithmic factors, and the lower bound derivation via reduction to MAB with switching costs is a significant theoretical contribution. This demonstrates a deep understanding of the interplay between pricing dynamics and strategic buyer behavior.
3. Algorithm Design: The proposed algorithm is both natural and carefully designed, leveraging epoch-based pricing to limit price fluctuations and accurately estimate sale probabilities. The use of EXP3 within epochs is well-motivated and ensures robust performance.
4. Clarity of Results: The paper clearly articulates the impact of buyer patience on regret, showing that even small patience levels significantly increase the complexity of the problem. The sharp \(\Theta(T^{2/3})\) regret bound is a key insight.
Weaknesses:
1. Gap in Upper and Lower Bounds for \(n\): While the regret bounds are tight in terms of \(\tau\) and \(T\), there is a gap in the dependence on the number of price options \(n\). Achieving matching bounds in \(n\) would strengthen the theoretical contribution.
2. Limited Empirical Validation: The paper is purely theoretical, and while the results are compelling, empirical validation on synthetic or real-world datasets would help demonstrate the practical applicability of the proposed algorithm.
3. Feedback Model Assumptions: The paper assumes a specific feedback model where the seller observes only the revenue at the end of each day. Exploring stronger feedback models, such as observing buyer patience or arrival times, could provide additional insights and potentially improve the regret bounds.
4. Continuous Pricing: The discussion on continuous pricing is limited, and the gap between the \(O(T^{3/4})\) upper bound and the lower bound remains unresolved. Addressing this gap would be an interesting extension.
Recommendation:
I recommend accepting the paper, as it makes a significant theoretical contribution to the field of online pricing and regret minimization. The novelty of the model, the tight regret bounds, and the thoughtful algorithm design make it a valuable addition to the conference. However, the authors are encouraged to address the noted weaknesses, particularly the gap in \(n\)-dependence and the lack of empirical validation, in future work.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Novel and practically relevant problem formulation.
- Strong theoretical contributions with tight regret bounds.
- Well-designed algorithm with clear motivation.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Lack of empirical validation.
- Unresolved gaps in \(n\)-dependence and continuous pricing bounds.
