The paper introduces CMICOT, a novel feature selection algorithm based on a two-stage greedy search and binary representation of features, aimed at identifying high-order feature interactions. The authors position CMICOT as an advancement over existing mutual information (MI)-based sequential forward selection (SFS) methods, which are limited to interactions of up to three features. By framing the problem as a saddle point optimization and addressing computational and sample complexity challenges, CMICOT extends the ability to detect interactions among up to ten features. The algorithm is empirically validated on ten benchmark datasets, demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, particularly with classifiers like kNN and AdaBoost.
Strengths:
1. Originality and Significance: The paper addresses a clear gap in feature selection methods by enabling the detection of higher-order feature interactions, which is a significant advancement over existing SFS-based filters. This is particularly relevant for high-dimensional datasets where feature interactions play a critical role.
2. Technical Soundness: The proposed two-stage greedy search and binary representation techniques are well-motivated and effectively mitigate computational and sample complexity issues. The theoretical justification for the scoring function and its approximation is rigorous.
3. Empirical Validation: The extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets provide strong evidence of CMICOT's effectiveness. The results convincingly demonstrate its superiority over interaction-aware filters like RelaxMRMR and IWFS, as well as other state-of-the-art methods.
4. Reproducibility: The inclusion of a pseudo-code for CMICOT and a GitHub link for implementation enhances the reproducibility of the work.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity Issues: The paper could benefit from improved clarity in certain sections. For example, the explanation of the saddle point optimization problem and its practical implications may be challenging for readers unfamiliar with the topic.
2. Figure Interpretation: The lack of a labeled y-axis in Figure 1 makes it difficult to interpret the results and assess the experiment's effectiveness. This oversight detracts from the otherwise strong empirical presentation.
3. Terminology Ambiguity: The term "SBS-based filters" on line 27 is not adequately explained, leaving the reader uncertain about its meaning and relevance.
4. Classifier Dependence: While CMICOT performs well with kNN and AdaBoost, the results for NBC are less compelling. This limitation could be explored further to understand the algorithm's dependency on specific classifiers.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper makes a significant contribution to feature selection by addressing high-order interactions, a challenging and underexplored area.
- The proposed method is both theoretically sound and practically effective, with strong empirical results to support its claims.
- The work is relevant to the NIPS community, advancing the state of the art in feature selection and machine learning.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Clarity issues and minor presentation flaws, such as the unlabeled axis in Figure 1, reduce the paper's accessibility.
- The lack of explanation for "SBS-based filters" could confuse readers unfamiliar with the term.
Recommendation: Accept with minor revisions. The paper presents a novel and impactful contribution to feature selection, but addressing the clarity and presentation issues would further strengthen its impact.
