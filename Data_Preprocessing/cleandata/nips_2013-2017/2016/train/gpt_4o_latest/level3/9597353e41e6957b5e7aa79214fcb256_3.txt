The paper introduces a novel framework for Semi-Supervised Active Clustering (SSAC), leveraging oracle-based same-cluster queries to address computational challenges in center-based clustering under a newly defined "\(\gamma\)-margin" property. This property introduces a notion of "niceness" in data, which allows efficient clustering for instances that would otherwise be NP-hard to solve. The authors propose an efficient algorithm that uses \(O(k^2 \log(k) + k \log(n))\) queries and runs in \(O(kn \log(n))\) time for \(\gamma > 1\), while also proving that clustering remains NP-hard for \(\gamma \leq \sqrt{3.4}\) without oracle access. The results highlight a significant trade-off between computational complexity and query complexity, offering a fresh perspective on the role of weak supervision in clustering.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Significance: The introduction of the \(\gamma\)-margin property and its implications for clustering complexity is both novel and impactful. The demonstrated trade-off between computational and query complexity is a valuable contribution to the clustering literature.
2. Algorithmic Contribution: The proposed algorithm is efficient and well-suited for \(\gamma\)-margin instances, providing a practical solution to an otherwise intractable problem. The query complexity is reasonable, making the approach applicable to real-world scenarios.
3. Theoretical Insights: The lower bound proof for \(\gamma \leq \sqrt{3.4}\) establishes a clear boundary for the feasibility of clustering without oracle access, adding rigor to the framework.
4. Potential for Future Work: The paper raises interesting questions about extending the framework to other stability assumptions, non-center-based clustering, and handling oracle errors or abstentions, which could inspire further research.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity of Presentation: While the main algorithm and its analysis are clear, the lower bound proof is confusing. The notation is inconsistent, and key parameters are poorly defined, making it difficult to follow the argument. This section requires significant revision to improve readability and correctness.
2. Technical Errors: There are concerns about potential errors in the lower bound construction, particularly in the reduction design and its relationship to the \(\gamma\)-margin property. The authors should clarify these aspects and provide more detailed explanations.
3. Limited Scope of Experiments: Although the theoretical contributions are strong, the paper does not include empirical validation of the proposed algorithm. Adding experiments on synthetic or real-world datasets could strengthen the practical relevance of the work.
4. Presentation Issues: The paper could benefit from clearer assumptions, improved notation, and minor corrections throughout. For instance, the relationship between \(\gamma\)-margin and prior notions like \(\alpha\)-center proximity is relegated to the appendix but deserves more prominence in the main text.
Recommendation:
Despite its weaknesses, the paper makes a significant theoretical contribution to the field of clustering and introduces a framework with substantial potential for future exploration. The results are novel and impactful, even if not technically complex. I recommend acceptance with the expectation that the authors address the clarity and technical issues, particularly in the lower bound proof. This work is likely to stimulate further research and discussion, making it a valuable addition to the conference.
