The paper presents a novel methodology to identify ratings influenced by recommender systems (RS) using a user-deviation model. The authors propose that observed ratings are a combination of true user preferences and RS-induced effects. By leveraging strong assumptions and singular value decomposition (SVD), the authors demonstrate that the true rating matrix can be inferred from the observed ratings, enabling the identification of items likely recommended rather than reflecting intrinsic user preferences. The methodology is validated on synthetic datasets and real-world datasets, with results suggesting its effectiveness in deconvolving RS effects and providing insights into RS influence.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Relevance: The paper addresses an important and underexplored problem in RS researchâ€”quantifying and disentangling feedback loops. This is a significant contribution to understanding the biases introduced by RS, which could have implications for fairness and transparency in recommendation algorithms.
2. Methodological Rigor: The mathematical modeling is well-grounded, with clear assumptions and derivations. The use of SVD and the proposed metric for deconvolving feedback loops are innovative and computationally efficient.
3. Validation: The authors validate their approach on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating its robustness. The anecdotal evidence, such as the absence of RS effects in datasets without RS, strengthens the validity of the method.
4. Insights: The paper provides interesting insights, such as the progression of RS effects in MovieLens datasets and the nuanced analysis of Netflix data, which could inspire further research.
Weaknesses:
1. Practical Implications: While the methodology is theoretically sound, its practical implications remain unclear. The paper does not convincingly address how distinguishing true from recommended ratings could improve RS performance or user experience.
2. Assumptions: The model relies on strong assumptions (e.g., spectral radius constraints, user mean equivalence) that may not hold in real-world scenarios. While the authors acknowledge this, the practical limitations of these assumptions are not thoroughly discussed.
3. Clarity in Section 3.2: The explanation of the algorithm's purpose and the context of the Jester dataset is abrupt and lacks clarity. This section would benefit from additional elaboration and better organization.
4. Technical Question: The relationship between singular values of true and observed ratings is not fully explored. Could the inference occur directly in the singular value space? Addressing this could enhance the theoretical depth of the work.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:
- Pro: The paper tackles a challenging and relevant problem, provides a novel and computationally efficient solution, and validates it on diverse datasets.
- Con: The practical utility of the proposed methodology is not well-articulated, and the strong assumptions may limit its applicability in real-world settings.
Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Elaborate on the practical applications of the proposed method, particularly how it could improve RS design or user satisfaction.
2. Clarify Section 3.2 and provide more context about the Jester dataset's lack of RS.
3. Explore the potential for inference in singular value space and discuss its implications.
4. Discuss the limitations of the assumptions in greater detail and propose ways to relax them in future work.
Overall, the paper is a strong theoretical contribution to RS research, but further work is needed to establish its practical significance.
