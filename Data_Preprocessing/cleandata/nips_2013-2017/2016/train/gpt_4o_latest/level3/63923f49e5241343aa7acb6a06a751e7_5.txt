The paper presents a significant contribution to the study of fast learning rates for unbounded losses under heavy-tailed distributions. It introduces two novel conditions: the multi-scale Bernstein's condition and the integrability of the envelope function, which together enable the derivation of learning rates faster than \(O(n^{-1/2})\). The authors demonstrate that these rates can approach \(O(n^{-1})\) under specific conditions. The results extend prior work on bounded losses and sub-Gaussian settings to the more challenging domain of heavy-tailed losses, filling an important gap in the literature.
Strengths:  
1. Technical Rigor: The paper is technically sound, with well-supported theoretical results. The multi-scale Bernstein's condition is a notable innovation, as it generalizes the standard Bernstein's condition to unbounded losses, allowing for nuanced analysis of microscopic and macroscopic scales.  
2. Novelty: The work is original in its focus on heavy-tailed losses and the introduction of new assumptions. It builds on and extends existing studies, such as those by Lecu√© and Mendelson (2013) and Brownlees et al. (2015), while addressing limitations in prior approaches.  
3. Significance: The results have practical implications, particularly for applications like k-means clustering under heavy-tailed distributions. The derived rates are competitive and improve upon prior work, such as Telgarsky and Dasgupta (2013).  
4. Clarity of Theoretical Framework: The paper provides a clear path for verifying the multi-scale Bernstein's condition, making it accessible for future researchers to apply the framework to other problems.  
Weaknesses:  
1. Clarity and Accessibility: While the theoretical contributions are substantial, the paper is dense and may be challenging for readers unfamiliar with advanced statistical learning theory. Including a concrete example earlier in the paper, such as the k-means clustering application, could improve accessibility.  
2. Practical Examples: The paper would benefit from a more detailed discussion of the practical importance of heavy-tailed losses, along with additional real-world examples to illustrate the relevance of the results.  
3. Typographical Error: There is a typo in Assumption 2.1: "There exist" should be corrected to "There exists."  
Arguments for Acceptance:  
- The paper addresses an important and underexplored problem in machine learning, advancing the theoretical understanding of fast learning rates for unbounded losses.  
- The multi-scale Bernstein's condition is a novel and impactful contribution, with potential applications beyond the scope of this paper.  
- The results are rigorous and extend prior work in meaningful ways, making the paper a valuable addition to the literature.  
Arguments Against Acceptance:  
- The paper's dense presentation may limit its accessibility to a broader audience.  
- The lack of detailed practical examples and discussion of the importance of heavy-tailed losses could reduce its perceived relevance.  
Recommendation: Accept with minor revisions. The paper makes a strong theoretical contribution and is well-suited for the conference, but the authors should address the clarity issues and provide more practical context to enhance its impact.
