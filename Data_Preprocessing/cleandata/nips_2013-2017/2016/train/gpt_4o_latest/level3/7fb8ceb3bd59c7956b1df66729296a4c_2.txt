This paper addresses the problem of matrix completion, a fundamental task in machine learning with applications in collaborative filtering and recommender systems. The authors focus on non-convex optimization methods and provide a significant theoretical contribution by proving that for a regularized version of matrix completion, all local minima are global minima. This result implies that optimization algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) can converge to the global minimum even with random or arbitrary initialization. The paper extends this finding to noisy settings, thereby enhancing the robustness of the results and advancing the theoretical understanding of non-convex optimization in matrix completion.
Strengths
1. Theoretical Contribution: The proof that all local minima are global minima for the regularized matrix completion problem is a major theoretical advance. This result explains why non-convex methods often perform well empirically without requiring careful initialization, addressing a long-standing question in the field.
2. Robustness: The extension of the results to noisy settings demonstrates the practical relevance of the findings, as real-world data often contain noise.
3. Clarity of Proof Strategy: The authors employ a "simple" and generalizable proof strategy that avoids reliance on eigenvector properties, making it adaptable to other statistical problems involving partial or noisy observations.
4. Empirical Relevance: By showing that popular algorithms like SGD can solve matrix completion efficiently, the paper bridges the gap between theoretical guarantees and practical performance.
5. Open Questions: The authors identify important open problems, such as extending the results to asymmetric matrix completion and exploring alternative distance measures, which could inspire future research.
Weaknesses
1. Scope Limitation: The results are restricted to symmetric matrices, leaving the asymmetric case unresolved. While the authors acknowledge this as an open question, it limits the immediate applicability of the findings to broader settings.
2. Regularizer Discussion: The paper lacks a detailed discussion of the properties and practical relevance of the regularizer used in the analysis. This omission could hinder the adoption of the proposed framework in real-world applications.
3. Assumptions: The analysis relies on standard assumptions, such as bounded condition numbers and no dominant rows in the Frobenius norm. While these are common in theoretical studies, their practical validity in diverse datasets is not discussed.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance
Pro:
- The paper makes a significant theoretical contribution by resolving a key question in non-convex optimization for matrix completion.
- The results are robust to noise and have practical implications for widely used algorithms like SGD.
- The proof strategy is innovative and potentially generalizable to other problems.
Con:
- The restriction to symmetric matrices limits the generality of the results.
- The discussion on the regularizer's practical relevance is insufficient.
- The assumptions made in the analysis may not always hold in real-world scenarios.
Recommendation
This paper is a strong candidate for acceptance at NIPS. It provides a novel and impactful theoretical result that advances the understanding of non-convex optimization in matrix completion, a problem of significant importance in machine learning. While the limitations regarding scope and practical relevance should be addressed in future work, the paper is above the bar for acceptance due to its originality, clarity, and potential to inspire further research.
