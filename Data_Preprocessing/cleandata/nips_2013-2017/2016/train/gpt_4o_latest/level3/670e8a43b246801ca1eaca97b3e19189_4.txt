This paper introduces the concept of microclustering, a novel approach to clustering where cluster sizes grow sub-linearly with the size of the dataset. This is particularly relevant for applications like entity resolution, where traditional clustering models such as Dirichlet Process (DP) and Pitman-Yor Process (PYP) assume linear growth in cluster sizes, which is inappropriate. The authors propose a new class of models, termed Kolchin Partition (KP) models, that can exhibit the microclustering property. Two specific models within this class, the Negative Binomial–Negative Binomial (NBNB) and Negative Binomial–Dirichlet (NBD) models, are developed and empirically evaluated. A Gibbs sampling algorithm, including a faster variant called the "chaperones algorithm," is proposed for posterior inference. The models demonstrate superior performance in entity resolution tasks compared to DP and PYP models but perform poorly on noisy datasets with limited features.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Relevance: The paper addresses a significant gap in clustering literature by introducing the microclustering property, which is highly relevant for entity resolution and similar applications.
2. Model Development: The introduction of the KP class and the specific NBNB and NBD models represents a meaningful contribution. The models are empirically shown to satisfy the microclustering property, and their flexibility is demonstrated in various experiments.
3. Empirical Results: The paper provides strong empirical evidence that the proposed models outperform traditional DP and PYP models in realistic entity resolution scenarios, particularly for datasets with larger cluster counts.
4. Algorithmic Contribution: The development of the chaperones algorithm for efficient Gibbs sampling is a practical contribution, addressing computational challenges in large-scale datasets.
Weaknesses:
1. Lack of Theoretical Guarantees: While the authors provide empirical evidence for the microclustering property, the absence of formal proofs is a significant limitation. A theorem specifying the conditions under which the KP models satisfy the microclustering property would strengthen the paper.
2. Model Naming: The term "Flexible Models for Microclustering" (FMMC) is potentially misleading, as not all models in the class are guaranteed to exhibit the microclustering property.
3. Performance on Noisy Data: The models perform poorly on noisy datasets with few features, such as the Syria2000 and SyriaSizes datasets. This raises concerns about their robustness in challenging real-world scenarios.
4. Clarity and Presentation: The paper contains notational errors, unclear explanations of posterior expectations, and missing figure labels, which detract from its readability and reproducibility.
Recommendation:
The paper makes a significant contribution to clustering research by introducing the microclustering property and proposing models tailored for entity resolution. However, the lack of theoretical guarantees and issues with clarity need to be addressed. I recommend conditional acceptance, contingent on the inclusion of a formal proof for the microclustering property (or at least a detailed discussion of sufficient conditions) and improvements in the paper's clarity and presentation.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Novel and impactful concept of microclustering.
- Strong empirical performance in entity resolution tasks.
- Practical contributions, including the chaperones algorithm.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Lack of formal theoretical guarantees for the microclustering property.
- Limited robustness to noisy datasets.
- Presentation issues that hinder clarity and reproducibility.
