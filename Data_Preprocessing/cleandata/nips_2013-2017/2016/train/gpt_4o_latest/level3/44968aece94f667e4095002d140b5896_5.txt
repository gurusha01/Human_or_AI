This paper addresses the challenging online pricing problem with strategic and patient buyers, introducing a novel model where buyers are characterized by a time window during which they may purchase at the lowest available price. The authors propose an EXP3-based learning algorithm that bundles time steps into epochs with fixed prices, updating the algorithm using feedback from entire epochs. They establish an upper bound of \(O(T^{2/3})\) regret and demonstrate a matching lower bound by reducing the problem to a multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem with switching costs. The lower bound proof technique, which links strategic buyer models to MAB with switching costs, is particularly innovative and has potential applications in other domains.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Technical Depth: The reduction of the strategic buyer problem to an MAB problem with switching costs is a significant contribution. The lower bound proof technique is both creative and generalizable, making it a valuable addition to the literature.
2. Theoretical Rigor: The paper provides a tight analysis, with both upper and matching lower bounds clearly formulated. The regret bounds are sharp and demonstrate the impact of buyer patience on the complexity of the problem.
3. Clarity of Results: The results are well-presented, and the algorithm is carefully explained. The use of epochs to manage price changes is an elegant solution to mitigate the challenges posed by strategic buyers.
4. Relation to Prior Work: The paper situates itself well within the existing literature, particularly by extending the work of Kleinberg and Leighton [11] to settings with patient buyers (\(\tau \geq 1\)) and adversarial arrivals.
Weaknesses:
1. Assumptions on Buyer Patience: The algorithm assumes knowledge of buyers' patience levels (\(\tau\)), which may not be realistic in practice. Eliciting this information could introduce strategic manipulation by buyers, a concern not adequately addressed.
2. Lower Bound Assumptions: The lower bound assumes fixed price posting for specific time windows. This may not reflect true lower bounds if prices are adjusted dynamically, limiting the practical applicability of the theoretical results.
3. Comparison to Discounted Models: While the authors argue that modeling patient buyers via time windows is crucial, discounted buyer models have been explored in prior work. The paper could benefit from a more thorough comparison to these models to clarify its unique contributions.
4. Imprecision in Related Work: The claim that [11] is a special case of the current work is imprecise, as [11] focuses on \(\tau = 0\), while this paper addresses \(\tau \geq 1\). This distinction should be clarified to avoid overstating the generality of the results.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper introduces a novel and technically sound approach to a challenging problem, with significant theoretical contributions.
- The lower bound proof technique is innovative and has potential applications beyond the scope of this work.
- The results are clearly presented and advance the state of the art in online pricing with strategic buyers.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The practical applicability of the results is limited by the assumption of known buyer patience and the fixed price posting in the lower bound.
- The paper does not sufficiently address the relationship between its model and existing discounted buyer models, leaving some gaps in positioning its contributions.
Recommendation:
Overall, this paper makes a strong theoretical contribution to the field of online pricing and strategic buyer modeling. While there are concerns about practical assumptions and comparisons to prior work, the novelty and rigor of the results outweigh these limitations. I recommend acceptance, with minor revisions to address the concerns raised.
