This paper presents a novel approach to training a specific class of feedforward neural networks globally optimally using a nonlinear spectral method. The authors claim that their method achieves a linear convergence rate under certain conditions and provides the first practically feasible algorithm with such guarantees. The paper focuses on networks with one or two hidden layers and demonstrates the method's potential through experiments on low-dimensional UCI datasets.
Strengths:
1. Theoretical Contribution: The paper makes a significant theoretical contribution by proving the existence of a unique global optimizer for the proposed neural network architecture and deriving conditions under which the nonlinear spectral method converges. This is a notable advancement in addressing the non-convex optimization challenges in neural networks.
2. Linear Convergence: The proposed algorithm's linear convergence rate is a strong feature, especially compared to the slower convergence of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) methods.
3. Mathematical Rigor: The mathematical derivations are detailed and provide a solid foundation for the claims. The use of fixed-point theory and the Banach fixed-point theorem is particularly noteworthy.
4. Practical Feasibility: Unlike some prior work on global optimization for neural networks, this method is computationally feasible and does not require complex operations like tensor decomposition.
5. Empirical Validation: The experiments, though limited, demonstrate that the method achieves competitive results compared to ReLU-based networks and kernel SVMs, particularly on datasets like Cancer and Haberman.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity of Derivations: The transition from first-order derivatives in Theorem 3 to second-order derivatives in Theorem 4 is unclear and could benefit from additional explanation or examples to improve accessibility.
2. Network Design: Treating the last layer differently from hidden layers raises interpretability concerns, particularly regarding the gradients with respect to parameters like matrix \( u \).
3. Practical Constraints: The requirement for non-negative data and strictly positive weights limits the model's applicability to specific types of datasets, reducing its generalizability.
4. 1-Norm Maximization: The use of 1-norm maximization for connection parameters contrasts with standard weight decay practices, and the practical justification for this choice is not adequately addressed.
5. Experimental Scope: The experiments are limited to low-dimensional datasets, and the method's scalability to high-dimensional or more complex datasets remains untested. Additionally, the comparison with ReLU networks is constrained by the imposed architectural constraints.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper addresses a challenging and important problem in neural network optimization with a novel and theoretically grounded approach.
- The linear convergence rate and global optimality guarantee are significant contributions to the field.
- The method is computationally feasible and provides a new perspective on designing neural networks with provable optimization properties.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The practical limitations, such as the non-negativity constraint on data and weights, restrict the method's applicability.
- The unclear mathematical transitions and limited experimental scope weaken the paper's overall impact.
- The comparison with standard neural networks (e.g., ReLU) is not comprehensive, leaving questions about the method's practical advantages.
Recommendation:
While the paper makes a strong theoretical contribution, the practical limitations and unclear aspects of the derivations need to be addressed. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions, focusing on improving the clarity of mathematical derivations, providing more justification for design choices, and expanding the experimental evaluation to include higher-dimensional datasets and more robust comparisons with standard neural networks.
