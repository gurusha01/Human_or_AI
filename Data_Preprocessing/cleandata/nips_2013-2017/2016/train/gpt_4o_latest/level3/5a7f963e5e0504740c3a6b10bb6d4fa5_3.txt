The paper introduces a novel approach to representing probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) using Probabilistic Sentential Decision Diagrams (PSDDs) instead of traditional factor-based or model counting-based arithmetic circuits (ACs). The authors demonstrate that PSDDs uniquely support a polynomial-time (polytime) multiplication operator, which is not feasible for many other AC representations. This capability enables a new, efficient algorithm for compiling PGMs into arithmetic circuits by representing each model factor as a PSDD and multiplying them. However, the paper also establishes that PSDDs do not support a polytime summing-out operation, a limitation shared with other AC representations.
Strengths:
The proposed use of PSDDs for PGM representation is both innovative and practical. The polytime multiplication operator is a significant contribution, as it broadens the applicability of PSDDs to tasks like incremental reasoning and structure learning. The authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of their method, including a well-documented algorithm (Algorithm 1) for PSDD multiplication. The theoretical results are rigorously supported by proofs, and the empirical evaluations demonstrate the method's efficiency compared to existing approaches. Notably, the reduction in auxiliary variables during PSDD multiplication aligns with prior work, suggesting the potential for significant impact in the field.
The paper is well-organized and provides sufficient background on arithmetic circuits, PSDDs, and their properties, ensuring clarity for readers familiar with the domain. The experimental results, while limited in scope, show promise, particularly in reducing the size of compiled circuits compared to other methods.
Weaknesses:
While the paper makes a strong technical contribution, the broader impact of the proposed approach remains uncertain. The authors do not fully explore how PSDDs might be adopted in real-world applications or how they compare to other representations in diverse scenarios. Additionally, the lack of a polytime summing-out operation for PSDDs limits their utility in certain inference algorithms, such as variable elimination and message passing.
Specific areas for improvement include clarifications in Algorithm 1, particularly regarding the handling of edge cases and the caching mechanism. Theorem 4 could benefit from a more detailed discussion of its implications for practical applications. Terminology in Section 4 is occasionally inconsistent, which could confuse readers. Minor issues, such as fixing citation formats in Section 3, should also be addressed.
Recommendation:
Overall, this paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of probabilistic reasoning and learning. The use of PSDDs for efficient multiplication is a novel and impactful idea, and the paper is technically sound and well-written. However, the limited exploration of broader implications and the lack of a polytime summing-out operator temper its significance. I recommend acceptance, provided the authors address the noted weaknesses, particularly the need for clarifications and minor revisions.
