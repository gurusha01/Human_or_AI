The paper introduces TrailBlazer, a Monte Carlo-based planning algorithm designed for sample-efficient planning in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). The algorithm aims to minimize calls to a generative model while providing a PAC-consistent approximation of the optimal value function. TrailBlazer is applicable to both finite and infinite state spaces, making it versatile for various MDP scenarios. The paper provides theoretical guarantees, including high-probability bounds on generative model calls for finite state spaces and expected bounds for infinite state spaces. These contributions position TrailBlazer as a significant advancement in Monte Carlo planning.
Strengths
The paper makes a strong theoretical contribution by improving worst-case sample complexity bounds for finite state spaces and introducing new results for infinite state spaces, where prior work lacked polynomial guarantees. The algorithm's ability to adaptively focus on near-optimal nodes and paths is a key innovation, leveraging problem structure to reduce sample complexity. Its design—alternating between Avg nodes (Monte Carlo estimators) and Max nodes (best-arm identification)—is elegant and computationally efficient. The authors also demonstrate that TrailBlazer matches the performance of Monte Carlo sampling in simple cases, further validating its generality. The work is well-situated in the literature, with clear comparisons to prior algorithms like UCT and StOP, and it addresses a critical gap in planning for infinite state spaces.
Weaknesses
While the theoretical guarantees are compelling, the paper lacks sufficient intuition on why TrailBlazer outperforms other algorithms in practice. For instance, the role of parameters like κ and d in real-world scenarios is not well-explained, leaving readers uncertain about their practical implications. The proofs, though rigorous, rely heavily on tree induction and are difficult to follow, which may limit accessibility for non-specialists. Additionally, the expectation-based guarantee in Theorem 3 raises questions about its practical reliability, as it does not provide high-probability bounds for infinite state spaces. The algorithm also does not exploit potential regularities in the value function, which could further enhance its efficiency. Finally, the handling of distributed action-gaps remains underexplored, which could impact performance in challenging MDPs.
Clarity and Presentation
The paper is generally well-written, but Section 3.1 (bias and variance separation) is particularly unclear and would benefit from additional elaboration. The supplementary material contains several typos and formatting issues, which detract from the overall polish of the submission. The pseudocode for TrailBlazer is helpful, but some parameter choices (e.g., λ and m) are not intuitively motivated.
Arguments for Acceptance
1. Theoretical Contribution: The algorithm provides novel sample complexity bounds for infinite state spaces, a significant advancement in the field.
2. Generality: TrailBlazer is applicable to both finite and infinite state spaces, making it broadly relevant.
3. Efficiency: The algorithm exploits problem structure to achieve adaptive sampling, reducing sample complexity in favorable cases.
Arguments Against Acceptance
1. Clarity: The paper's theoretical sections are dense and lack sufficient intuition, limiting accessibility.
2. Practical Insights: The paper does not adequately address how TrailBlazer performs in real-world scenarios or how its parameters should be tuned.
3. Unexplored Opportunities: The algorithm does not leverage value function regularities or address distributed action-gaps comprehensively.
Recommendation
I recommend acceptance with minor revisions. The paper makes a strong theoretical contribution and addresses an important problem in Monte Carlo planning. However, the authors should improve the clarity of Section 3.1, provide more intuition for their theoretical results, and address the practical implications of their algorithm. Additionally, correcting typos and formatting issues in the supplementary material will enhance the overall quality of the submission.
