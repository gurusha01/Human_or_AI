The paper introduces a novel graph partitioning criterion, the "Product Cut," as an alternative to the widely used Normalized Cut. The Product Cut aims to achieve better balance among partition components by incorporating an entropic balance term. The authors present a continuous relaxation for optimizing the Product Cut, which is exact under certain conditions (connected graphs and fully dense similarity matrices). They also propose a randomized algorithm to address early termination issues and improve scalability. Experimental results demonstrate the method's clustering performance on several benchmark datasets.
Strengths
1. Theoretical Contribution: The Product Cut offers a fresh perspective on graph partitioning by addressing the imbalance issues inherent in the Normalized Cut. The theoretical analysis, including stability properties and the exact continuous relaxation, is rigorous and well-justified.
2. Algorithmic Innovation: The randomized sequential linear programming approach and the use of Algebraic Multigrid for efficiency are noteworthy contributions. The incremental addition of constraints is a practical solution to early termination.
3. Clarity: The paper is well-organized and provides detailed explanations of the mathematical properties and algorithmic design. The inclusion of proofs and supplementary material enhances reproducibility.
4. Experimental Results: The Product Cut achieves competitive clustering purity on benchmark datasets, demonstrating its potential as a viable alternative to existing methods.
Weaknesses
1. Comparison with Recent Methods: The paper critiques the Normalized Cut using older methods but does not compare the Product Cut against more recent alternatives (e.g., [Ref1, Ref2]). This omission weakens the claim of state-of-the-art performance.
2. Limitations of Continuous Relaxation: The proposed relaxation is undefined for non-dense matrices, which limits its applicability to sparse graphs, a common scenario in real-world applications.
3. Evaluation Metrics: Reporting the average purity over 500 runs is unconventional and less informative than reporting the best initialization's purity. Additionally, comparisons of Product Cut values for partitions found by other methods (e.g., NMFR) are missing.
4. Scalability: While the randomized algorithm improves scalability, the paper does not provide a detailed analysis of its computational complexity or performance on very large graphs.
Arguments for Acceptance
- The Product Cut introduces a novel and theoretically grounded approach to graph partitioning.
- The algorithm demonstrates strong empirical performance on benchmark datasets.
- The paper addresses a significant limitation of the Normalized Cut, providing a foundation for future research.
Arguments Against Acceptance
- The lack of comparison with recent methods undermines the claim of superiority.
- The continuous relaxation's reliance on dense matrices limits its generalizability.
- The evaluation methodology could be improved to better highlight the advantages of the Product Cut.
Recommendation
The paper makes a solid theoretical contribution and proposes an innovative algorithm. However, the lack of comparisons with recent methods and the limitations of the continuous relaxation reduce its impact. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions, emphasizing the need for additional experimental comparisons and a discussion of the method's limitations.
