The paper provides a theoretical analysis of the robustness and consistency properties of robust k-means (RKM), a variation of classical quadratic k-means clustering. The authors examine the finite sample breakdown point and consistency of RKM, demonstrating that the method is not robust to outliers on general datasets, as even two outliers can cause the clustering procedure to fail (Theorem 1). However, the paper highlights that RKM exhibits robustness when applied to "well-structured" or clusterable datasets, where inliers are well-separated and outliers have limited influence. The authors also establish the consistency of RKM, showing that its empirical clustering risk converges to the population risk as the sample size increases. A key contribution of the paper is the application of variational analysis techniques to study the robustness properties of RKM, which adds novelty to the work.
Strengths
The paper makes a significant contribution by rigorously analyzing the robustness of RKM, particularly through the lens of the finite sample breakdown point and consistency. The theoretical results, such as Theorem 1 and the restricted robustness analysis for clusterable datasets, provide valuable insights into the limitations and potential of RKM. The use of variational analysis techniques is a novel approach that differentiates this work from prior studies. Additionally, the paper underscores the importance of dataset structure in determining the robustness of clustering methods, which could inspire future research in this area.
Weaknesses
While the theoretical contributions are strong, the experimental section is somewhat disconnected from the theoretical focus of the paper. The experiments primarily compare RKM with trimmed k-means (TKM) but do not directly validate the theoretical findings, such as the breakdown point or restricted robustness on well-structured datasets. This limits the practical impact of the theoretical results. Furthermore, the paper's clarity could be improved, particularly in Section 3.3, where the connections between the results and related work are not well-articulated. The contextualization of the contributions within the broader literature is also lacking, as the paper does not sufficiently position itself relative to prior work on robust clustering methods. 
Arguments for Acceptance
1. The paper provides a rigorous theoretical analysis of RKM, addressing important properties like robustness and consistency.
2. The novelty of applying variational analysis techniques to study clustering objectives is a valuable contribution.
3. The results highlight critical limitations of RKM, advancing our understanding of robust clustering methods.
Arguments Against Acceptance
1. The experimental section does not adequately support or validate the theoretical findings, reducing the overall impact.
2. The paper lacks clarity in certain sections and could better contextualize its contributions within existing literature.
3. The practical implications of the results are not thoroughly explored, leaving questions about the applicability of the findings.
Recommendation
Overall, the paper makes a solid theoretical contribution but falls short in experimental validation and contextual clarity. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions, focusing on improving the connection between theory and experiments, enhancing clarity in Section 3.3, and better situating the work within the broader context of robust clustering research.
