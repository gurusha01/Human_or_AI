This paper introduces novel methods for approximate marginal inference and partition function estimation in cooperative graphical models, extending the scope of pairwise Markov Random Fields (MRFs) by incorporating a submodular cost function. The authors build on prior work focused on Maximum-a-Posteriori (MAP) inference, leveraging polyhedral results and variational inference to address the more challenging problem of marginal inference. The paper is well-written, with clear motivation, comprehensive background, and illustrative examples that enhance understanding. It makes a significant contribution by deriving convex upper and lower bounds for the log-partition function (log Z) and estimating these bounds using a variety of inference methods, including Frank-Wolfe, projected gradient descent (PGD), tree-reweighted belief propagation (TRWBP), belief propagation (BP), mean-field, and perturb-and-MAP.
Strengths:
1. Technical Novelty: The paper introduces a new family of cooperative graphical models that generalize existing models while retaining exploitable structure. The derivation of convex bounds for log Z and their optimization using scalable algorithms is a notable advancement.
2. Methodological Rigor: The integration of submodular function properties with variational inference is both technically sound and innovative. The use of polyhedral structures, such as the base polytope and upper submodular polyhedron, is well-motivated and effectively executed.
3. Empirical Validation: The experiments on synthetic datasets and a real-world computer vision task demonstrate the scalability and efficacy of the proposed methods. The larger computer vision example is particularly compelling, showcasing the practical utility of the approach.
4. Clarity and Organization: The paper is well-organized, with clear explanations of complex concepts. The inclusion of illustrative examples and detailed experimental results aids comprehension.
Weaknesses:
1. Limited Discussion of Exact Inference: While the paper provides approximate methods, it lacks a detailed discussion of exact inference for small models (e.g., brute force) as a baseline for comparison. This omission makes it harder to fully evaluate the accuracy of the proposed methods.
2. Clarity in Specific Sections: Some terms in the abstract and footnotes require clarification. Additionally, certain equations and lines could benefit from improved readability and error corrections.
3. Bethe Approximations: The use of Bethe entropy approximations is a promising idea, but the paper does not sufficiently clarify the conditions under which these approximations are most effective.
4. Scalability of TRWBP: While TRWBP is shown to be effective, its computational bottleneck is noted. A more detailed discussion of potential optimizations or alternatives would strengthen the paper.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:
Pros:
