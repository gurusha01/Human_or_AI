The paper provides a rigorous analysis of the sample complexity of automated mechanism design (AMD) for high-revenue combinatorial auctions (CAs), a fundamental yet unresolved problem in computational economics. It addresses a critical gap in the literature by deriving tight sample complexity bounds for a hierarchy of deterministic auction classes, including AMAs, VVCAs, λ-auctions, MBAs, and MBARPs. The authors demonstrate that while general auction classes like AMAs, VVCAs, and λ-auctions exhibit exponential sample complexity, more structured classes such as MBAs and MBARPs achieve polynomial sample complexity. This distinction highlights the trade-off between auction class expressiveness and learnability. The analysis leverages advanced tools from learning theory, including Rademacher complexity and pseudo-dimension, to establish these results.
Strengths:
1. Technical Rigor and Novelty: The paper introduces a novel research direction by applying learning theory to AMD, specifically in the context of combinatorial auctions. The use of Rademacher complexity and pseudo-dimension to analyze auction class complexity is both innovative and technically sound.
2. Significant Contributions: The results provide foundational insights into the sample complexity required for AMD, offering practical implications for designing scalable algorithms. The polynomial sample complexity results for MBAs and MBARPs are particularly impactful, as these classes are more feasible for real-world applications.
3. Clarity and Organization: The paper is well-written and logically structured, making complex concepts accessible to readers. The detailed proofs and supplementary materials further enhance its clarity.
4. Broader Impact: By bridging AMD and learning theory, the work has the potential to inspire future research in both fields. It also sheds light on the hierarchy of auction classes, offering a deeper understanding of their structure and practical utility.
Weaknesses:
1. Unexplained Quantity "U": A critical parameter, "U," which appears in the sample complexity bounds, is not adequately explained. This omission could hinder the reproducibility and practical interpretation of the results.
2. Limited Empirical Validation: While the theoretical contributions are robust, the paper lacks empirical experiments to validate the practical implications of the derived bounds. Demonstrating the results on synthetic or real-world data would strengthen the paper.
3. Restricted Scope: The focus on deterministic auctions, while justified, limits the generality of the results. Randomized mechanisms, which are often used in practice, are not considered.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper makes a significant theoretical contribution to AMD and learning theory, addressing a longstanding open problem in computational economics.
- The results are technically sound, novel, and relevant to the NeurIPS audience.
- The work is well-written and provides a solid foundation for future research.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The unexplained quantity "U" and lack of empirical validation detract from the paper's practical applicability.
- The scope is limited to deterministic auctions, excluding randomized mechanisms.
Recommendation:
Overall, the paper is a high-quality contribution that advances the state of the art in AMD and learning theory. Addressing the unexplained parameter "U" and including empirical validation would further strengthen the work. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address these issues.
