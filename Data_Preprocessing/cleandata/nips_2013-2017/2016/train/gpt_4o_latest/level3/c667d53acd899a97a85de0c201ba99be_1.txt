The paper addresses the critical problem of sample complexity in automated mechanism design (AMD) for revenue-maximizing combinatorial auctions (CAs), a fundamental and challenging topic in computational economics. It extends prior work on "simple auctions" by analyzing a broader hierarchy of deterministic auction classes, including AMA, VVCA, Î»-auctions, MBAs, and MBARPs. The authors provide both theoretical upper and lower bounds on sample complexity, offering valuable insights into the trade-offs between auction expressiveness and learnability.
Strengths:  
1. Comprehensive Analysis: The paper rigorously investigates sample complexity across a hierarchy of auction classes, making significant contributions to AMD by providing tight bounds for both general and specific auction families. Notably, the polynomial bounds for MBA and MBARP classes are particularly encouraging for practical applications.  
2. Technical Depth: The use of advanced learning theory tools, such as Rademacher complexity and pseudo-dimension, is well-executed and demonstrates a deep understanding of the interplay between auction parameters and revenue functions. The results are not only practically relevant but also advance the theoretical understanding of learning in complex hypothesis spaces.  
3. Broader Applicability: The results apply to any algorithm, whether optimal or approximate, making the findings broadly relevant to the AMD community.  
4. Clarity of Results: The distinction between exponential and polynomial sample complexity bounds across auction classes is well-articulated, providing clear guidance for future research and practical implementation.
Weaknesses:  
1. Limited Novelty Relative to Prior Work: While the paper extends prior research to more expressive auction classes, the novelty of the techniques and results may not be groundbreaking enough for a top-tier conference like NIPS. The reliance on existing tools from learning theory, though applied in a novel context, might limit its perceived originality.  
2. Focus on Deterministic Auctions: The restriction to deterministic mechanisms, while justified for practical reasons, excludes randomized auctions, which are known to achieve higher revenues in some settings. This limits the scope of the work.  
3. Clarity of Presentation: While the technical content is robust, the paper could benefit from improved organization and clearer explanations in some sections, particularly for readers less familiar with the intricacies of AMD or learning theory. For instance, the detailed derivations of Rademacher complexity bounds could be streamlined or moved to supplementary materials.  
Arguments for Acceptance:  
- The paper addresses an important and open question in AMD, providing rigorous theoretical results that fill a critical gap in the literature.  
- The findings have practical relevance for designing scalable and high-revenue CAs, particularly for MBA and MBARP classes.  
- The work is technically sound, with well-supported claims and thorough proofs.  
Arguments Against Acceptance:  
- The novelty of the work may not meet the high bar for NIPS, given its incremental nature relative to prior research.  
- The focus on deterministic auctions limits the generality of the results.  
- Some sections of the paper could be better organized to enhance readability and accessibility.  
Recommendation: While the paper makes a solid contribution to AMD and learning theory, its limited novelty relative to prior work suggests it may be better suited for a specialized conference in computational economics or mechanism design rather than NIPS. Nonetheless, it is a high-quality piece of work that advances the state of the art in its domain.
