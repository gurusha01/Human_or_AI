This paper presents a significant advancement in the theoretical understanding of fast learning rates for unbounded loss functions, particularly in the presence of heavy-tailed distributions. The authors introduce two novel conditions: the multi-scale Bernstein's condition and the integrability of the envelope function, which together enable the derivation of learning rates faster than \(O(n^{-1/2})\). The sharp oracle inequality established in Theorem 3.2 demonstrates convergence rates of \(O(n^{-\beta})\), where \(\beta\) can approach 1 with higher \(r\), marking a notable improvement over existing results.
The paper is technically rigorous, with sound proofs that are well-supported by prior work. The authors effectively situate their contributions within the broader literature, addressing gaps in the study of unbounded losses and extending results beyond bounded or sub-Gaussian settings. For instance, the application of the multi-scale Bernstein's condition to k-means clustering with heavy-tailed distributions (Theorem 4.1) demonstrates the practical relevance of their framework. This result not only generalizes prior work but also achieves a convergence rate arbitrarily close to \(O(n^{-1})\) under appropriate conditions, which is a substantial improvement over previous bounds for heavy-tailed losses.
The paper is well-written and concise, managing to convey dense technical content within eight pages. The introduction is particularly commendable for its accessibility to non-experts, clearly outlining the paper's goals, contributions, and the novelty of the proposed framework. The authors also provide a detailed discussion of how the multi-scale Bernstein's condition can be verified in practice, which enhances the paper's utility for researchers working on related problems.
However, there are minor issues that should be addressed. Some citations use "et al." without properly crediting all authors, which detracts from the scholarly rigor. Additionally, while the proofs are thorough, the paper could benefit from more intuitive explanations or examples to make the results more accessible to a broader audience.
Strengths:
1. Technical Contribution: Extends fast learning rates to unbounded losses with heavy tails, introducing novel conditions.
2. Theoretical Rigor: Provides sharp oracle inequalities and demonstrates practical applicability to k-means clustering.
3. Clarity and Organization: Well-structured and concise, with an accessible introduction.
4. Impact: Results are expected to influence multiple research communities, including statistical learning and robust optimization.
Weaknesses:
1. Citation Practices: Needs proper attribution for all referenced works.
2. Accessibility: Some technical sections could benefit from additional intuitive explanations or illustrative examples.
Recommendation:
I strongly recommend acceptance of this paper. Its contributions are both novel and significant, addressing an important gap in the literature on fast learning rates for unbounded losses. The minor issues can be easily resolved in the final version. This paper is likely to have a broad impact and stimulate further research in the field.
