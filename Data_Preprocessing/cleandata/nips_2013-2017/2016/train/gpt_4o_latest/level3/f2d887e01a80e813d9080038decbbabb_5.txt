The paper presents a tensor-decomposition-based methodology for unsupervised risk estimation under a 3-view assumption, extending this to a semi-supervised learning algorithm. The authors tackle the challenging problem of estimating model risk without labeled data, particularly in scenarios where the test distribution diverges significantly from the training distribution. The proposed approach leverages the method of moments to exploit conditional independencies, avoiding parametric assumptions about the true distribution. The framework supports a wide family of loss functions, including log and exponential losses, and extends to structured output settings like conditional random fields. The authors also demonstrate how their method enables unsupervised domain adaptation with minimal labeled data through a seed model.
Strengths:
1. Problem Importance: The problem of unsupervised risk estimation is critical for building reliable machine learning systems, especially in domain adaptation and semi-supervised learning contexts.
2. Theoretical Rigor: The paper provides a solid theoretical foundation, including sample complexity bounds and guarantees under the 3-view assumption. The use of tensor decomposition to estimate risk matrices and gradients is well-motivated and technically sound.
3. Generality: The methodology is applicable to a broad class of loss functions and extends to structured prediction tasks, making it versatile.
4. Empirical Validation: The experiments on a modified MNIST dataset demonstrate the feasibility of the approach for risk estimation and unsupervised domain adaptation, with promising results even under significant train-test distribution shifts.
Weaknesses:
1. Novelty: While the paper makes incremental advancements, the 3-view assumption and the use of tensor decomposition are reminiscent of prior work, such as Dawid and Skene (1979) and Anandkumar et al. (2012). The authors should explicitly compare their approach to related methods like "Estimating Accuracy from Unlabeled Data: A Bayesian Approach" (ICML 2016) and discrepancy-based methods (e.g., Ben-David et al., Mohri et al.).
2. Assumption Realism: The 3-view assumption, akin to the Naive Bayes assumption, may rarely hold in real-world scenarios. The paper does not adequately address the robustness of the method when this assumption is violated.
3. Experimental Scope: The experiments are limited to a single dataset (modified MNIST), and the robustness of the approach under different datasets, assumptions, and loss functions is not explored. Additionally, the section on different structures lacks experimental validation.
4. Practicality: While the theoretical guarantees are compelling, the computational complexity of tensor decomposition and the reliance on a seed model may limit practical applicability.
Pro vs. Con Arguments:
- Pro: The paper addresses a significant problem, provides a theoretically sound framework, and demonstrates its potential through experiments.
- Con: The reliance on stringent assumptions, limited novelty, and insufficient empirical validation reduce its practical impact.
Recommendation: Weak Accept. While the paper makes a meaningful contribution to unsupervised risk estimation, its assumptions and limited experimental scope need further exploration. The authors should address these concerns in a revised version to strengthen the paper's impact.
