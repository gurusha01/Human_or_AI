This paper introduces a novel method for training recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with full-capacity unitary transition matrices, addressing limitations in prior parameterizations of unitary RNNs (uRNNs). The authors provide a theoretical framework to quantify the representational capacity of unitary matrices using Sard's theorem and demonstrate that the original restricted-capacity uRNN parameterization fails to represent all unitary matrices for hidden state dimensions \( N > 7 \). To overcome this, they propose a gradient descent optimization method on the Stiefel manifold, enabling the training of full-capacity unitary matrices. Empirical results show that this approach outperforms both restricted-capacity uRNNs and LSTMs on tasks requiring long-term memory and sequential data processing.
Strengths
1. Theoretical Contributions: The paper makes a significant theoretical contribution by rigorously quantifying the limitations of restricted-capacity uRNNs and providing a mathematical foundation for the proposed full-capacity approach. The proofs, included in the supplementary material, appear sound and well-constructed.
2. Optimization Method: The proposed gradient descent method on the Stiefel manifold is elegant and avoids the need for gradient clipping or learning rate adaptation, which are common challenges in RNN training.
3. Empirical Performance: The full-capacity uRNN demonstrates superior performance on synthetic tasks (e.g., system identification, copy memory) and real-world tasks (e.g., speech prediction, permuted pixel-by-pixel MNIST), often outperforming LSTMs and restricted-capacity uRNNs.
4. Clarity and Accessibility: The paper is well-written and organized, making complex theoretical concepts accessible to readers. The authors provide implementation details and open-source code, which enhances reproducibility.
Weaknesses
1. Empirical Analysis: While the empirical results are promising, the analysis lacks depth in some areas. For example, the absence of a sudden performance gap for \( N > 7 \) in the experiments is not discussed, leaving a disconnect between the theoretical claims and empirical observations.
2. Experimental Design: Reporting the best test results over 100 epochs raises concerns about potential overfitting or early stopping on test data. Including standard errors or deviations would strengthen the statistical validity of the results.
3. Baseline Comparisons: The copy memory task highlights a negative result for the restricted uRNN, but the authors do not perform a thorough hyperparameter search for this baseline, which could undermine the credibility of the comparison.
4. Speech Task Limitations: The speech task feels somewhat artificial, as the results suggest that neighboring frames may not require long-term dependencies. This diminishes the significance of the full-capacity uRNN's performance advantage in this context.
5. Scalability: The paper does not explore larger RNNs (e.g., 500 hidden units), which could provide additional insights into the scalability and practical utility of the proposed method.
Recommendation
This paper makes a strong theoretical and methodological contribution to the field of recurrent neural networks, addressing a critical limitation in prior work on unitary RNNs. However, the empirical analysis could be more thorough, and some experimental design choices raise concerns. Despite these weaknesses, the paper advances the state of the art and is likely to inspire further research on unitary RNNs and optimization on manifolds. I recommend acceptance, provided the authors address the concerns regarding experimental rigor and baseline comparisons.
