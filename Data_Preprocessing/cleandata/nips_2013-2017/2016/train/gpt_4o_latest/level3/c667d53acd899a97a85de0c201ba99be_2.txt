This paper presents a significant contribution to the intersection of learning theory and mechanism design, focusing on the sample complexity of revenue-maximizing combinatorial auctions (CAs). The authors address a critical gap in automated mechanism design (AMD) by providing the first formal sample complexity analysis for a hierarchy of deterministic CA classes. The study is motivated by the challenge of designing revenue-optimal auctions when the bidders' valuation distribution is unknown, requiring mechanisms to generalize from samples. The work builds on prior research in single-item and single-dimensional settings but extends to the more complex combinatorial auction setting, which involves multi-stage optimization procedures.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Originality: The paper tackles an open problem in computational economics, providing tight sample complexity bounds for five general classes of auctions, including affine maximizer auctions (AMAs), virtual valuation combinatorial auctions (VVCAs), Î»-auctions, mixed bundling auctions (MBAs), and MBAs with reserve prices (MBARPs). The results are novel and extend beyond the scope of prior work, such as that by Morgenstern and Roughgarden, which does not apply to these settings.
   
2. Technical Depth: The authors derive exponential lower bounds for uniform convergence in general classes like AMAs and VVCAs, while demonstrating polylogarithmic pseudo-dimensions for more structured classes like MBAs. The use of Rademacher complexity and pseudo-dimension analysis is rigorous and well-motivated, showcasing the authors' deep understanding of both mechanism design and learning theory.
3. Clarity of Presentation: The pseudo-dimension constructions are well-presented and informative, making the results accessible to readers familiar with learning theory. The hierarchical organization of auction classes and the detailed proofs in the supplementary material further enhance the paper's clarity.
4. Significance: The results have practical implications for AMD, setting firm theoretical foundations for designing high-revenue auctions with limited samples. The work also advances learning theory by analyzing complex function classes that diverge from traditional machine learning settings.
Weaknesses:
1. Proof Verification: While the pseudo-dimension constructions are clear, the proofs were not fully checked due to their complexity. A more concise summary of key proof techniques in the main text could improve accessibility and allow for easier verification.
   
2. Experimental Validation: The paper lacks empirical validation of the theoretical results. Demonstrating the practical applicability of the sample complexity bounds through simulations or real-world auction data would strengthen the paper's impact.
3. Scope of Mechanisms: The focus on deterministic auctions is well-justified, but the exclusion of randomized mechanisms limits the generality of the results. Randomized mechanisms, though less common in practice, are known to achieve higher revenues in some settings.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper addresses a critical and underexplored problem in AMD, providing rigorous theoretical results with potential for significant impact.
- The technical contributions are novel, deep, and well-executed, advancing both mechanism design and learning theory.
- The clarity of presentation and organization make the paper accessible to the broader research community.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The lack of empirical validation leaves open questions about the practical applicability of the results.
- The exclusion of randomized mechanisms limits the generality of the findings.
Recommendation:
Overall, this paper makes a strong theoretical contribution to an important problem in computational economics and learning theory. While empirical validation and broader scope could enhance its impact, the novelty and rigor of the results justify acceptance. Recommendation: Accept.
