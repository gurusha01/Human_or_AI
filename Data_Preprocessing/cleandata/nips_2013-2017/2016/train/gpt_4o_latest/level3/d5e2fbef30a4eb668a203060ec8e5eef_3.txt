This paper introduces CMICOT, a feature selection method based on sequential forward selection (SFS) that addresses high-order feature interactions using conditional mutual information (MI). The authors propose a novel saddle point optimization problem to identify joint interactions among features and mitigate computational and sample complexity challenges through a two-stage greedy search and binary representatives. Empirical results on synthetic and benchmark datasets demonstrate the method's ability to outperform state-of-the-art interaction-aware and interaction-agnostic filters in specific scenarios.
Strengths:
1. Proposed Method: The paper presents a novel approach to high-order feature interaction detection, addressing a known limitation in MI-based SFS methods. The use of binary representatives for scalability is a practical and innovative solution to reduce sample complexity.
2. Empirical Validation: The authors provide empirical evidence of CMICOT's effectiveness on synthetic and real-world datasets. The results demonstrate its superiority in identifying high-order interactions, particularly for classifiers like kNN and AdaBoost.
3. Clarity of Contributions: The paper clearly positions its contributions relative to existing methods, emphasizing its ability to handle higher-order interactions compared to competitors like RelaxMRMR, IWFS, and RCDFS.
4. Potential Impact: While incremental, the work addresses an important problem in feature selection, particularly for datasets with complex feature dependencies.
Weaknesses:
1. Empirical Comparison: The experimental evaluation, while promising, lacks sufficient breadth. The authors test on 10 datasets, but additional datasets and classifiers would strengthen the claims. Furthermore, the analysis of results could be deeper, particularly regarding the trade-offs between computational cost and performance.
2. Technical Quality: The proposed method relies on several heuristics (e.g., greedy approximations), which, while practical, may not guarantee optimality. The paper could benefit from a more rigorous theoretical analysis of these approximations.
3. Novelty: The methodology, while innovative in its application, is incremental rather than groundbreaking. The reliance on existing MI-based techniques and SFS strategies limits its originality.
4. Clarity and Presentation: While the overall presentation is acceptable, some notations are misleading or overly complex, which may hinder reproducibility. For example, the explanation of the saddle point optimization problem could be simplified.
5. Related Work: The paper provides a comprehensive review of related work but omits a key reference (Liu et al., 2012), which could provide additional context for the proposed method.
Pro and Con Arguments:
- Pro: The method addresses a significant gap in feature selection by enabling high-order interaction detection, and the empirical results support its effectiveness.
- Con: The paper lacks sufficient experimental rigor and theoretical depth, and its contributions are incremental.
Recommendations:
To improve the paper, the authors should:
1. Expand the experimental evaluation to include more datasets, classifiers, and scenarios.
2. Provide a more detailed analysis of the computational trade-offs and the impact of the binary representative technique.
3. Simplify and clarify the notation and presentation to enhance accessibility.
4. Include the missing reference (Liu et al., 2012) and discuss its relevance.
5. Explore the potential of submodularity in the optimization process, as suggested in the guidelines.
Conclusion:
The paper makes a meaningful contribution to feature selection by addressing high-order interactions, but it requires additional empirical validation, theoretical analysis, and presentation improvements to reach its full potential. I recommend acceptance with major revisions.
