Review of the Paper
This paper introduces a spectral analysis framework for nonlinear dynamical systems using the Koopman operator in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). The authors propose a kernel-based modal decomposition algorithm, which extends Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) to richer nonlinear representations. The method is shown to decompose dynamics into finite modes, providing a feature extraction mechanism for nonlinear systems. Applications such as prediction, change-point detection, and dynamics recognition are demonstrated on synthetic and real-world datasets.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Motivation: The extension of Koopman spectral analysis to RKHS is a significant contribution, as it allows for the use of nonlinear basis functions, overcoming limitations of traditional DMD methods. The motivation for this extension is well-articulated, and the kernel-based approach is theoretically sound.
2. Algorithmic Development: The proposed algorithm is mathematically rigorous, leveraging Krylov subspaces and eigendecomposition in RKHS. The robustification using POD bases is a practical enhancement, addressing numerical stability issues.
3. Experimental Validation: The paper includes experiments on synthetic systems (e.g., Henon map) and real-world data (e.g., locomotion dynamics), demonstrating the utility of the method. The results show promise for applications in prediction, clustering, and change detection.
4. Applications: The exploration of diverse applications, such as sequential change-point detection and dynamics recognition, highlights the versatility of the proposed approach and its potential impact on machine learning and dynamical systems analysis.
Weaknesses:
1. Comparison with Prior Work: The paper lacks a clear discussion on how the proposed method differs from or improves upon prior work, particularly Williams et al. (2015). Section 4 could benefit from a deeper comparison to highlight the methodological advancements.
2. Missing References: The paper does not adequately situate itself within the broader literature on kernel-based methods for nonlinear dynamical systems. Key works by Ralaivola, d'Alché Buc, Tuia, Rojo-Alvarez, Mouattamid, Schaback, Franz, and Schölkopf are notably absent.
3. Stochastic Dynamics: The performance of the proposed method in stochastic settings is underexplored. While the authors briefly mention extensions to stochastic systems, no experiments or detailed discussions are provided. Toy examples in stochastic scenarios would strengthen the paper.
4. Experimental Ambition: The experimental settings are relatively modest. The paper does not compare its approach to state-of-the-art methods for time-series clustering or online change detection, which limits the evaluation of its practical significance.
5. Assumptions and Clarity: The implications of the assumption regarding pointwise relations in multidimensional time series and the causal assumptions in the setting are not sufficiently clarified. This could confuse readers unfamiliar with the underlying theory.
6. Minor Issues: There are two typos: indices on τ-1 vs. τ and a misplaced dot in \( k(xi, xj) \) (last equation on page 7).
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper presents a novel and theoretically sound extension of Koopman spectral analysis to RKHS, addressing a significant gap in the literature.
- The proposed algorithm is well-motivated, mathematically rigorous, and experimentally validated.
- The applications demonstrate the method's versatility and potential impact on machine learning and dynamical systems.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The lack of clarity on differences from prior work and missing references weakens the contextualization of the contribution.
- The experimental evaluation is limited in scope and lacks comparisons to state-of-the-art methods.
- The paper does not adequately address stochastic dynamics, a critical aspect of real-world systems.
Recommendation:
I recommend conditional acceptance of this paper, provided the authors address the following:
1. Improve the discussion on differences from prior work, particularly Williams et al. (2015).
2. Add missing references to related work on kernel methods for nonlinear dynamical systems.
3. Include experiments in stochastic settings and compare the method to state-of-the-art approaches for time-series clustering and change detection.
4. Clarify assumptions regarding pointwise relations and causality in multidimensional time series.
This paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field, but addressing these issues is essential to strengthen its impact and clarity.
