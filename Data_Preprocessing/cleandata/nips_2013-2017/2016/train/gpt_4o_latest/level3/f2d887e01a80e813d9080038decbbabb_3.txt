The paper presents a novel method for estimating test error from unlabeled data on distributions that differ from the training set. The approach leverages the method of moments and a 3-views conditional independence assumption, avoiding assumptions about the optimal predictor or the parametric form of the distribution. This framework is particularly notable for its applicability to structured output settings, such as hidden Markov models (HMMs) and conditional random fields (CRFs). The authors also demonstrate the method's utility in unsupervised learning and domain adaptation, providing theoretical guarantees and empirical validation.
Strengths
1. Technical Soundness: The paper is technically rigorous, with sound proofs and clear derivations. The use of the method of moments to exploit conditional independencies is innovative and well-grounded in theory.
2. Generality: The framework is applicable to a broad range of settings, including structured outputs and various loss functions (e.g., log loss, exponential loss). This generality makes the approach versatile and impactful.
3. Clarity and Organization: The paper is well-written and logically structured, with clear explanations of the methodology, theoretical results, and extensions. The inclusion of empirical results further supports the claims.
4. Significance: The ability to estimate test error without labeled data or strong assumptions about the test distribution is a significant contribution to unsupervised learning and domain adaptation. The method addresses a critical challenge in building reliable machine learning systems.
Weaknesses
1. 3-Views Assumption: A key limitation is the reliance on the 3-views conditional independence assumption, which may be unrealistic in many real-world scenarios, particularly in mono-view learning. While the authors acknowledge this limitation, the paper would benefit from a deeper discussion on how to relax this assumption or address cases where it does not hold.
2. Practical Applicability: The method's reliance on tensor decomposition and the associated computational complexity might limit its scalability to high-dimensional settings. Additionally, the requirement for a seed model in unsupervised learning introduces a dependency that may not always be feasible.
3. Limited Exploration of Dependencies: While the authors briefly discuss extensions to cases with mediating variables or partial independence, the treatment is not exhaustive. More empirical analysis on how the method performs under varying degrees of dependence between views would strengthen the paper.
Arguments for Acceptance
- The paper addresses a fundamental problem in machine learning with a novel and theoretically sound approach.
- The method is broadly applicable and advances the state of the art in unsupervised risk estimation and domain adaptation.
- The writing and organization make the paper accessible to a wide audience, including both theoreticians and practitioners.
Arguments Against Acceptance
- The 3-views assumption may limit the method's applicability in practice, and the paper does not provide sufficient alternatives or relaxations.
- The computational demands of the approach might hinder its adoption in large-scale or high-dimensional settings.
Recommendation
Overall, the paper makes a strong theoretical contribution to unsupervised risk estimation and domain adaptation. While the 3-views assumption is a notable limitation, the authors have laid a solid foundation for future work to address this issue. I recommend acceptance, with the suggestion that the authors expand their discussion on relaxing the 3-views assumption and provide more empirical insights into its practical limitations.
