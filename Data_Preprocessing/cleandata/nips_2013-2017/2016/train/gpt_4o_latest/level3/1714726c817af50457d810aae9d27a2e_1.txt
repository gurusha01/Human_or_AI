This paper presents a novel adaptive averaging heuristic for accelerated descent dynamics in constrained convex optimization, building on the ODE interpretation of Nesterov's acceleration (Krichene et al., NIPS 2015). By leveraging a Lyapunov argument, the authors derive sufficient conditions on the weight functions \( \eta(t) \) and \( w(t) \) to achieve a desired convergence rate. The key contribution is the introduction of an adaptive weighting scheme that dynamically adjusts weights to enhance convergence, with guarantees in continuous time and preservation of quadratic convergence rates in discrete time. Empirical results demonstrate significant speed-ups across a variety of functions, including strongly convex, weakly convex, and linear objectives, outperforming existing heuristics like adaptive restarting.
Strengths:
1. Technical Soundness and Clarity: The mathematical arguments are clear, rigorous, and build directly on prior work, making the paper accessible to readers familiar with optimization dynamics. The use of Lyapunov functions to establish convergence guarantees is well-motivated and straightforward.
2. Novelty and Originality: The adaptive averaging heuristic is a novel contribution that extends the utility of Nesterov's acceleration. Unlike prior adaptive methods, this approach guarantees dominance over fixed-schedule averaging, addressing a gap in the literature.
3. Empirical Validation: The experimental results are comprehensive and demonstrate the practical utility of the proposed method. The significant improvements over existing heuristics, particularly in strongly convex cases, highlight the potential impact of this work.
4. Potential Impact: Given the widespread use of Nesterov's acceleration in machine learning and optimization, the proposed method has high relevance and applicability. The findings suggest that small modifications to existing algorithms can yield substantial performance gains.
Weaknesses:
1. Discretized Process Analysis: While the paper provides guarantees in continuous time, the analysis of the discretized process is less detailed. A more thorough examination of how the convergence rate is preserved in discrete settings would strengthen the theoretical contribution.
2. Connections to Conjugate Gradient Methods: The paper does not explore potential connections between adaptive averaging and the Conjugate Gradient method for strongly convex quadratic optimization. This could provide additional insights into the broader applicability of the heuristic.
3. Limited Discussion of Limitations: While the method performs well empirically, the paper does not discuss potential limitations, such as cases where adaptive averaging may fail to outperform fixed-schedule methods or restarting heuristics.
Recommendation:
I recommend acceptance of this paper. The adaptive averaging heuristic is a significant and well-supported contribution to the field of optimization. The combination of theoretical guarantees, empirical validation, and practical relevance makes this work a strong candidate for presentation at the conference.
Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Include a detailed analysis of the discretized process to confirm that the convergence rate is preserved in practical implementations.
2. Explore connections to the Conjugate Gradient method to broaden the theoretical impact of the work.
3. Add a discussion of potential limitations and scenarios where the method may underperform.
Overall, this paper advances the state of the art in accelerated optimization methods and provides a strong foundation for future research in adaptive techniques.
