The paper addresses the problem of learning Supervised PageRank models by proposing two novel optimization methods: a gradient-based approach and a gradient-free method. These methods aim to overcome limitations of the state-of-the-art algorithm [21], which lacks convergence guarantees. The authors provide theoretical convergence rate guarantees for both methods and demonstrate their application to a real-world web ranking task. The proposed framework is motivated by PageRank and incorporates node and edge features into the ranking process. The authors also analyze the trade-off between computational complexity and accuracy, presenting lemmas and theorems to support their claims. Experimental results are briefly discussed, with additional details relegated to the appendix.
Strengths:
1. Theoretical Contributions: The paper provides convergence guarantees for both gradient-based and gradient-free methods, addressing a significant gap in the prior work [21]. This is a notable theoretical advancement.
2. Novelty in Optimization: The adaptation of gradient-free methods to constrained optimization problems with inexact oracles is innovative and could have broader applicability.
3. Experimental Validation: The proposed methods outperform the state-of-the-art algorithm in terms of ranking quality, as demonstrated on a real-world dataset.
4. Trade-off Analysis: The authors analyze the trade-off between accuracy and computational complexity, which is a practical consideration for large-scale applications.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity and Writing Quality: The paper suffers from poor writing, with grammatical errors and unclear explanations. Key concepts, such as the significance of the problem and practical implications, are not well-articulated. Sloppy citations further detract from the quality.
2. Reproducibility: The main body lacks sufficient details on experimental setup, key parameters, and algorithmic improvements. Critical empirical results are relegated to the appendix, making it difficult for readers to assess the work's practical impact.
3. Originality Concerns: The framework appears to reproduce work from [21] under different notation and naming conventions, raising questions about the novelty of the contributions.
4. Generalizability: The experiments are limited to a single web graph dataset, and it is unclear whether the methods generalize to other types of graphs or domains.
5. Impact and Assumptions: The practical significance of the problem is questionable, and some technical assumptions may not hold in real-world scenarios. The restricted search space for parameters (Ï•) further limits applicability, but this issue is not adequately discussed.
Recommendation:
While the paper makes valuable theoretical contributions, its weaknesses in clarity, originality, and empirical validation are significant. The lack of detailed analysis and poor writing quality hinder its impact. To strengthen the paper, the authors should:
- Improve the clarity and organization of the manuscript.
- Provide a more thorough discussion of experimental results and their implications.
- Address originality concerns by explicitly differentiating their work from [21].
- Test the methods on diverse datasets to demonstrate generalizability.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Theoretical guarantees for convergence are a notable contribution.
- The gradient-free method is innovative and could inspire further research.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Poor writing and unclear presentation undermine the paper's accessibility.
- Limited empirical validation and questionable novelty reduce its impact.
- The practical significance of the problem is not convincingly demonstrated.
Final Decision: Reject, but encourage resubmission after addressing the above concerns.
