This paper addresses the challenging problem of deriving fast learning rates for unbounded, heavy-tailed loss functions, a domain that has received limited attention in the literature. The authors introduce two key conditions: (i) the integrability of the envelope function of the hypothesis class and (ii) the multi-scale Bernstein condition, a novel generalization of the standard Bernstein condition. Under these assumptions, the authors demonstrate that learning rates faster than \(O(n^{-1/2})\) are achievable and can approach \(O(n^{-1})\) depending on the moment conditions and the multi-scale Bernstein powers. The paper also applies its theoretical framework to k-means clustering with heavy-tailed distributions, deriving new convergence rates that extend prior results.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Significance: The paper tackles an important open problem in empirical process theory, extending fast learning rate results to unbounded, heavy-tailed losses. This is a significant contribution, as existing work primarily focuses on bounded losses or sub-Gaussian settings.
2. Soundness: The theoretical results are well-supported by rigorous mathematical analysis, relying on advanced concentration inequalities for unbounded empirical processes from Lederer and van de Geer.
3. Practical Relevance: The application to k-means clustering demonstrates the utility of the framework in a practical setting, providing insights into the behavior of algorithms under heavy-tailed distributions.
4. Improvement Over Prior Work: The results improve upon existing literature by relaxing assumptions such as sub-exponential envelope functions and bounded losses, broadening the applicability of fast learning rates.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity of the Multi-Scale Bernstein Condition: While the multi-scale Bernstein condition is central to the paper, its necessity and intuition are not sufficiently explained. Concrete examples illustrating its importance would greatly enhance understanding.
2. Comparative Analysis: The comparison with Audibert (2009) raises questions about whether simpler conditions might suffice for achieving fast rates. Similarly, connections to Mehta & Grunwald (2016) and their v-PPC condition are underexplored, leaving room for a more thorough discussion of related work.
3. Generality: The extension to hypothesis classes with polynomial entropy bounds is not immediate, and the paper does not elaborate on why this is the case. This limits the generality of the results.
4. Presentation Issues: The abstract is overly long, and the terminology (e.g., "weak-tailed") is non-standard. Additionally, there are typographical errors in Section 3.4 and Theorem 4.2, and the references require cleanup to remove excessive "et al." mentions.
Recommendation:
Despite the above weaknesses, the paper makes a substantial contribution to the field by addressing a challenging and underexplored problem. Its results are novel, technically sound, and practically relevant. The issues with clarity and presentation can be addressed in a revision. I recommend acceptance, with the suggestion that the authors improve the explanation of the multi-scale Bernstein condition, provide clearer comparisons to related work, and refine the paper's presentation.
