This paper presents a novel approach to efficiently estimate the coefficients of Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) in large-scale settings (where \( n \gg p \)) by leveraging a proportionality relationship between GLM coefficients and Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) coefficients. The authors introduce the Scaled Least Squares (SLS) estimator, which bypasses the computationally expensive iterative optimization required for Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). Theoretical results demonstrate that the SLS estimator achieves comparable accuracy to MLE, with a significant reduction in computational cost. The paper also provides rigorous analysis and experimental validation, showcasing the method's performance across synthetic and real datasets.
Strengths:
1. Theoretical Contribution: The paper establishes a general proportionality relationship between OLS and GLM coefficients, extending prior work that focused on Gaussian predictors. This is a notable theoretical advancement, particularly in its generalization to non-Gaussian predictors using zero-bias transformations (Theorem 1).
2. Computational Efficiency: The proposed SLS algorithm avoids iterative optimization for the OLS step and achieves up to cubic convergence in estimating the proportionality constant. This results in significant computational savings, particularly for large-scale datasets, as demonstrated in Section 5.
3. Empirical Validation: The experiments convincingly show that SLS achieves comparable accuracy to MLE while being computationally faster. The results on both synthetic and real datasets (e.g., Higgs and Covertype) highlight the practical utility of the method.
4. Potential for Extension: The discussion on regularization (Section 3.1) and the possibility of extending the proportionality relationship to other optimization problems (e.g., SVMs) opens avenues for future research.
Weaknesses:
1. Scope of Applicability: While the proportionality relationship is compelling, the paper does not fully explore the range of regularizers and link functions where this relationship holds. For instance, the extension to \( \ell_1 \)-regularization (lasso) is only briefly mentioned.
2. Error Bound Analysis: The unexpected performance of SLS in Figure 2 (where it outperforms MLE in certain regimes) raises questions about the error bounds in specific scenarios. A deeper exploration of these regimes and their implications is warranted.
3. Assumptions on \( n \gg p \): The theoretical guarantees rely heavily on the assumption that \( n \gg p \). While this is reasonable for many large-scale problems, the paper does not discuss how the method performs when \( n \) and \( p \) are of similar magnitude.
4. Clarity of Presentation: While the paper is well-organized, some sections (e.g., the derivation of Theorem 1) are dense and may be challenging for readers unfamiliar with zero-bias transformations. Simplifying these explanations or providing additional intuition could improve accessibility.
Recommendation:
This paper makes a strong theoretical and practical contribution to the field of scalable GLM estimation. The reduction of GLM estimation to an OLS-based approach is both elegant and impactful, with clear computational benefits. However, the paper would benefit from a more detailed exploration of the limitations and edge cases of the proposed method. I recommend acceptance, provided the authors address the concerns regarding the scope of regularizers, error bounds, and clarity.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Novel theoretical insight into the proportionality between GLM and OLS coefficients.
- Significant computational speedup for large-scale problems.
- Strong empirical results demonstrating practical utility.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Limited exploration of the generalizability of the proportionality relationship.
- Insufficient discussion of error bounds in regimes where SLS outperforms MLE.
In summary, the paper advances the state of the art in scalable GLM estimation and has the potential to inspire further research in computationally efficient methods for large-scale statistical modeling.
