This paper investigates support recovery guarantees for sparse regression using `1-norm regularization with non-smooth loss functions, specifically `1 and `∞ losses, contrasting them with the traditional `2 loss. The authors extend existing theory for the smooth `2 case to these non-smooth cases, providing sharp conditions for support stability under small noise. The main theorem establishes that, with appropriately tuned parameters, the support of the recovered vector remains stable or transitions to an extended support, which is also stable. Numerical experiments illustrate these theoretical findings, particularly in a compressed sensing context. The work builds on prior results in sparse recovery and compressed sensing, such as those involving the irrepresentable condition for `2 loss, while addressing the less-explored `1 and `∞ cases.
Strengths
1. Theoretical Contribution: The paper provides a significant theoretical extension to the literature by addressing non-smooth loss functions (`1 and `∞). The main theorem is a novel and rigorous result, offering insights into support stability and instability.
2. Clarity: The paper is well-written and organized, with clear definitions, detailed proofs, and a logical flow. The distinction between stable and extended support is particularly well-articulated.
3. Numerical Validation: The numerical experiments effectively illustrate the theoretical results, highlighting the behavior of support recovery under different loss functions.
4. Relevance: The work addresses an important problem in sparse recovery and compressed sensing, which is of broad interest to the machine learning and signal processing communities.
Weaknesses
1. Noise Model Ambiguity: The simulations lack clarity regarding the noise model used. It is unclear how the methods perform under different noise distributions, which limits the practical applicability of the results.
2. Small Noise Assumption: Theorem 1 is restricted to small noise levels, and the paper does not provide insights or bounds for larger noise regimes. This limits the scope of the theoretical guarantees.
3. Experimental Details: The numerical experiments do not specify the noise levels used, making it difficult to interpret the results or assess their robustness.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance
Pros:
- The paper addresses a novel and challenging problem, extending sparse recovery theory to non-smooth loss functions.
- The theoretical results are rigorous and well-supported by numerical experiments.
- The paper is clearly written and accessible, making it a valuable contribution to the field.
Cons:
- The scope is limited to small noise levels, with no discussion of larger noise regimes.
- The lack of clarity in the noise model and experimental setup reduces the practical impact of the results.
Recommendation
Overall, this paper makes a strong theoretical contribution to the field of sparse recovery and compressed sensing. While the limitations in noise modeling and experimental clarity should be addressed, the novelty and rigor of the work justify its acceptance. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to improve the clarity of the simulations and provide more discussion on the limitations of the small noise assumption.
