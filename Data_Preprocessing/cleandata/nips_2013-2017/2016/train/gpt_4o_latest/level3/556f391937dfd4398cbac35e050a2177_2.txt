The paper introduces a novel method for local similarity-aware embedding using a deep neural network, termed the Position-Dependent Deep Metric (PDDM). The authors propose a pluggable PDDM unit that adapts similarity metrics to local feature structures, addressing limitations of global Euclidean metrics in complex visual feature spaces. Key contributions include hard sample selection for faster convergence, a double-header hinge loss for local structure learning, the incorporation of absolute position information for heterogeneous features, and a quadruplet-based fast sampling strategy. The method demonstrates superior performance in image retrieval and transfer learning tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on datasets like CUB-200-2011, CARS196, and ImageNet.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Originality: The paper tackles a significant limitation of global similarity metrics by introducing a locally adaptive metric. The integration of absolute position information and the use of a double-header hinge loss are innovative and well-motivated.
2. Performance: The proposed method achieves notable improvements in image retrieval and transfer learning tasks, with faster convergence and better generalization in open-set scenarios. The experimental results, particularly Recall@K and transfer learning accuracy, substantiate the claims.
3. Generalization: The method's ability to generalize to new classes in transfer and zero-shot learning scenarios is a significant contribution, highlighting its potential for broader applications.
4. Efficiency: The quadruplet-based sampling strategy reduces computational complexity compared to dense pairwise approaches, making the method more scalable.
Weaknesses:
1. Missing Details: The paper lacks critical details for reproducibility. For instance, parameter initialization, optimization specifics (e.g., gradients), and the impact of mini-batch sizes on performance are not adequately discussed.
2. Architecture Clarity: Figure 2 requires more detailed explanations, particularly regarding the CNN architecture in Fig. 2(a). The role and configuration of the PDDM unit need further elaboration.
3. Comparison in Fig. 3: The differences between contrastive, triplet, lifted structured embeddings, and the proposed method are not sufficiently clarified. A more detailed comparative analysis would enhance understanding.
4. Running Time: While the paper claims speed advantages, no quantitative results on running time are reported. This omission weakens the claim of computational efficiency.
5. Statistical Significance: The results in Table 1 lack standard deviation or confidence intervals, making it difficult to assess the robustness of the reported improvements.
6. Reproducibility: The absence of sufficient implementation details, such as network architecture specifics and optimization strategies, limits the reproducibility of the work.
Recommendation:
The paper presents a significant contribution to the field of deep metric learning and local similarity-aware embedding. However, the lack of clarity in architecture details, missing running time analysis, and insufficient reproducibility considerations are notable drawbacks. If these issues are addressed, the paper would make a strong case for acceptance. 
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Novel approach addressing a critical limitation in metric learning.
- Strong empirical results demonstrating state-of-the-art performance.
- Scalability and efficiency of the proposed method.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Insufficient technical details for reproducibility.
- Missing running time analysis undermines claims of efficiency.
- Lack of clarity in key figures and comparative explanations.
Overall, the paper is a promising contribution but requires revisions to address the identified weaknesses.
