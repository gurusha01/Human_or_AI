This paper presents a novel contribution to the spectral analysis of the Koopman operator in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs), introducing a modal decomposition algorithm that extends the widely-used dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) approach via the kernel trick. The authors aim to provide a robust framework for analyzing nonlinear dynamical systems, offering a feature extraction procedure that decomposes dynamics into finite modes. The paper also explores applications such as prediction, change-point detection, and dynamics recognition, supported by empirical demonstrations on synthetic and real-world datasets.
Strengths:
The paper is well-written, technically solid, and logically organized. The authors provide a clear exposition of the theoretical foundations, including the derivation of the proposed algorithm and its connection to existing DMD methods. The use of RKHSs allows for richer basis functions, addressing limitations of traditional DMD approaches that rely on linear monomials. Numerical experiments demonstrate the utility of the method, with examples ranging from toy systems to chaotic maps and real-world locomotion data. The applications section highlights the versatility of the proposed framework, making it relevant to both machine learning and physics communities. The inclusion of a robustified variant using POD bases is a practical addition, addressing potential numerical instability issues.
Weaknesses:
The paper lacks a thorough comparison with state-of-the-art methods, particularly extended DMD and other kernel-based approaches. While the numerical experiments are sufficient to demonstrate feasibility, a deeper quantitative evaluation against competing techniques would strengthen the paper's claims. Additionally, Section 3.1, particularly Equation (7) and the proof of Theorem 1, raises concerns about clarity and consistency. The role of \( K_H \) as a linear operator on \( H \), despite \( \phi \) not being in \( H \), is unclear and requires further elaboration. The proof of Theorem 1 appears to rely on strong, implicit assumptions that are not explicitly stated, undermining the rigor of the theoretical claims. Minor typographical errors, such as "the the" on Line 55 and incorrect subscripts on Line 153, should also be corrected.
Major Flaw:
The primary issue lies in the unclear exposition of Equation (7) and the proof of Theorem 1. The assumptions underlying the consistency of the operator \( K_H \) and the derivation of the empirical Ritz values need to be explicitly stated and justified. Without this, the theoretical foundation of the proposed algorithm remains questionable.
Recommendation:
While the paper makes a significant contribution to the spectral analysis of nonlinear dynamical systems and introduces a promising algorithm, the lack of clarity in key theoretical sections and the absence of comprehensive comparisons with state-of-the-art methods are notable drawbacks. I recommend acceptance conditional on the authors addressing the issues in Section 3.1, explicitly stating and justifying the assumptions, and providing a more detailed comparison with existing approaches. The minor typographical errors should also be corrected. 
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Novel extension of DMD using RKHSs with a kernel-based approach.
- Clear exposition of theoretical concepts and practical implementation.
- Demonstrated utility through diverse applications and empirical examples.
- Potential impact on both machine learning and physics communities.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Lack of clarity and rigor in Section 3.1, particularly Equation (7) and Theorem 1.
- Insufficient comparison with state-of-the-art methods.
- Minor typographical errors that detract from the paper's polish.
In summary, this paper has the potential to be a valuable contribution to the field, provided the authors address the noted theoretical and comparative gaps.
