This paper presents a novel study of accelerated descent dynamics for constrained convex optimization, focusing on a family of ODEs with a generalized averaging scheme. The authors leverage a Lyapunov argument to provide sufficient conditions for convergence and propose an adaptive averaging heuristic to accelerate the decrease of the Lyapunov function. The paper is well-supported by theoretical guarantees and numerical experiments, which validate the proposed approach and compare it to existing heuristics like adaptive restarting.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Originality: The key contribution lies in the adaptive averaging heuristic, which adaptively computes weights along solution trajectories to accelerate convergence. This approach is both innovative and insightful, as it builds on the connection between averaging and acceleration in optimization dynamics. The extension of replicator dynamics, a well-known ODE in evolutionary game theory, to an accelerated version is particularly compelling.
   
2. Theoretical Rigor: The paper provides a solid theoretical foundation, including sufficient conditions for convergence rates and guarantees for the proposed heuristic. The use of Lyapunov functions to establish these results is a strong point, as it ensures mathematical soundness.
3. Numerical Validation: The numerical experiments are thorough and demonstrate that adaptive averaging performs favorably compared to existing heuristics. The experiments are well-designed, covering a range of objective functions (e.g., strongly convex, weakly convex, and linear) and providing clear visualizations of trajectories and convergence behavior.
4. Clarity and Organization: The paper is well-written and logically organized. The theoretical results are clearly stated, and the adaptive averaging heuristic is described in sufficient detail to enable reproducibility. The inclusion of both continuous-time and discrete-time formulations enhances the paper's accessibility to a broader audience.
Weaknesses:
1. Scope of Numerical Experiments: While the experiments are insightful, they are limited to relatively low-dimensional problems (e.g., RÂ³). It would be beneficial to evaluate the heuristic on higher-dimensional and more complex optimization problems to better assess its scalability and robustness.
2. Comparison to Related Work: Although the paper references existing heuristics like adaptive restarting, it could benefit from a more detailed discussion of how the proposed method compares to other adaptive techniques, such as Adagrad or Adam, in terms of practical implementation and computational cost.
3. Practical Implications: The paper focuses heavily on theoretical guarantees and continuous-time dynamics. While this is valuable, a more explicit discussion of the practical implications for discrete-time optimization algorithms (e.g., in machine learning) would strengthen the paper's significance.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:
Pros:
- The paper introduces a novel and theoretically sound method for accelerating convergence in convex optimization.
- The adaptive averaging heuristic is a meaningful contribution that could inspire further research in optimization dynamics.
- The numerical results validate the method's effectiveness and provide insights into its behavior compared to existing heuristics.
Cons:
- The experiments are somewhat limited in scope, and the paper could explore more challenging or higher-dimensional problems.
- The practical implications for discrete-time algorithms and real-world applications are not fully explored.
Recommendation:
I recommend acceptance of this paper, as it makes a significant theoretical and methodological contribution to the field of optimization. While there is room for improvement in terms of experimental scope and practical discussions, the strengths of the paper outweigh its weaknesses. It is a valuable addition to the conference and will likely stimulate further research in adaptive methods for accelerated optimization.
