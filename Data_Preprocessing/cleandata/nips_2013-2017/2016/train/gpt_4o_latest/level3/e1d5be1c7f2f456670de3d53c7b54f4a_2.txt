This paper addresses the challenging problem of contextual semi-bandits, proposing efficient algorithms that leverage a supervised learning oracle (AMO). The authors tackle two distinct cases: (1) when the reward is a known linear function of feedback, and (2) when the reward involves an unknown linear transformation. For the former, the proposed VCEE algorithm builds on the work of Agarwal et al. [1], introducing key modifications to improve regret bounds and computational efficiency. For the latter, the EELS algorithm employs a phased explore-exploit strategy to estimate the reward vector and subsequently apply an optimal policy. These contributions are significant as they extend the applicability of contextual semi-bandits to more general settings while maintaining computational efficiency.
Strengths:
1. Technical Contributions: The paper provides rigorous theoretical guarantees for both algorithms. VCEE achieves a regret bound of \( \tilde{O}(\sqrt{KLT \log N}) \), which is competitive with state-of-the-art methods. EELS, in the more challenging unknown-weight setting, achieves sublinear regret with a bound of \( \tilde{O}(T^{2/3}(K \log N)^{1/3}) \), which is notable given the computational constraints.
2. Novelty: The reduction of contextual semi-bandits to supervised learning is a compelling approach, allowing the use of powerful supervised learning methods in a partial-feedback setting. The introduction of EELS for unknown transformations is particularly novel, addressing a previously unstudied problem.
3. Empirical Validation: The empirical evaluation on large-scale learning-to-rank datasets demonstrates the practical utility of VCEE. The experiments show that VCEE outperforms existing approaches like LinUCB and \(\epsilon\)-greedy, particularly when using richer policy classes.
4. Clarity of Theoretical Analysis: The theoretical results are well-supported with detailed proofs, and the paper provides a clear comparison with prior work.
Weaknesses:
1. Application of AMO: While the paper introduces AMO as a key component, the discussion on how it is applied to specific policy classes, such as linear classifiers, is somewhat limited. A more detailed explanation or examples would enhance clarity.
2. Optimization Perspective: The reviewer suggests exploring an optimization version of the OP problem to minimize empirical regret under variance constraints. This could provide additional insights into the trade-offs between exploration and exploitation.
3. Unknown Weights Setting: While EELS achieves sublinear regret, its \( T^{2/3} \) dependence is suboptimal compared to the \( \sqrt{T} \) dependence achieved in simpler settings. The authors acknowledge this limitation but do not propose concrete directions to address it.
4. Empirical Scope: The experiments focus solely on the known-weight setting (VCEE). Evaluating EELS on synthetic or real-world datasets would strengthen the empirical contributions.
Recommendation:
The paper makes significant theoretical and empirical contributions to contextual semi-bandits, particularly with its novel reduction to supervised learning and the introduction of EELS. However, the lack of empirical evaluation for EELS and limited discussion on AMO applications are areas for improvement. The paper is well-suited for NIPS, given its alignment with topics in online learning and decision-making. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the aforementioned weaknesses.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Strong theoretical contributions with competitive regret bounds.
- Novel algorithms addressing both known and unknown reward transformations.
- Empirical results demonstrate practical improvements over state-of-the-art methods.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Limited empirical evaluation for the unknown-weight setting.
- Insufficient discussion on the practical implementation of AMO for specific policy classes. 
Overall, this paper advances the state of the art in contextual semi-bandits and provides a solid foundation for future work in this area.
