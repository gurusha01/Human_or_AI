Review of the Paper
This paper addresses the problem of contextual combinatorial semi-bandits, proposing novel learning algorithms for both known and unknown weight settings. The authors present two algorithms: VCEE for the known weight case and EELS for the unknown weight case, and provide theoretical regret bounds for both. The paper is notable for introducing the first computationally efficient algorithm for contextual combinatorial semi-bandits with unknown weights, making a significant contribution to the field. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, particularly VCEE, on real-world datasets.
Strengths:
1. Novelty: The paper makes a strong contribution by addressing the previously unexplored setting of contextual combinatorial semi-bandits with unknown weights. The introduction of EELS fills a gap in the literature and opens up new avenues for research.
2. Theoretical Guarantees: The regret bounds provided in Theorems 1 and 2 are well-analyzed and supported by rigorous proofs. The regret bound for VCEE matches or improves upon existing computationally efficient methods, while EELS achieves sublinear regret in the unknown weight setting.
3. Practical Relevance: The empirical evaluation on large-scale learning-to-rank datasets demonstrates the practical utility of VCEE, showing significant improvements over existing methods like LINUCB and Îµ-GREEDY.
4. Clarity of Theoretical Contributions: The paper clearly explains the differences between its approach and prior work, particularly in the use of supervised learning oracles and the handling of structured action spaces.
Weaknesses:
1. Suboptimal Regret Bound for EELS: The regret bound of \(O(T^{2/3})\) for EELS is suboptimal compared to the \(O(\sqrt{T})\) bounds achieved in some related settings. The authors should discuss whether this suboptimality is intrinsic to the problem or a limitation of their analysis.
2. Clarity of Algorithm 2: The explanation of EELS is difficult to follow, particularly its motivation and the role of the eigenvalue-based stopping condition. A clearer and more intuitive presentation would greatly enhance readability.
3. Missing Citation: The paper does not cite the work of Wen et al. (2014), which is relevant to contextual combinatorial semi-bandits. Including this citation and discussing its relation to the proposed methods would strengthen the paper.
4. Limited Evaluation of EELS: The experimental results focus exclusively on VCEE, leaving the performance of EELS untested. While the datasets used have known weights, a synthetic experiment to evaluate EELS in the unknown weight setting would provide a more comprehensive evaluation.
Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Discussion on Suboptimality: Include a discussion about whether the \(O(T^{2/3})\) regret bound for EELS is fundamental or could be improved with a different approach.
2. Rewrite Algorithm 2: Improve the clarity of the explanation and motivation for EELS, particularly its exploration-exploitation transition mechanism.
3. Cite Wen et al. (2014): Add the missing citation and compare the proposed methods to this work.
4. Evaluate EELS: Conduct experiments to evaluate EELS, even if only on synthetic data, to validate its practical performance.
Recommendation:
I recommend acceptance of this paper, as it makes a significant contribution to the field of contextual combinatorial semi-bandits, particularly with its novel treatment of the unknown weight setting. However, the authors should address the weaknesses mentioned above, particularly the clarity of Algorithm 2 and the missing citation, to further strengthen the paper.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Novel and impactful contribution to the field.
- Rigorous theoretical analysis with strong regret guarantees.
- Empirical results demonstrate practical relevance and superiority over existing methods.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Suboptimal regret bound for EELS.
- Lack of clarity in the presentation of Algorithm 2.
- Missing experimental evaluation of EELS.
Overall, the strengths of the paper outweigh its weaknesses, and it represents a valuable addition to the literature.
