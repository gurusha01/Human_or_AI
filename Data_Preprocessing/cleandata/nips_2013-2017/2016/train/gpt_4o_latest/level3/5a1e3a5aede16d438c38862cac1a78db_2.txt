This paper investigates the support recovery guarantees of sparse regression using the `1-norm regularization with non-smooth loss functions, specifically the `1 and `∞ norms, extending the theory from the smooth `2 case. The authors derive conditions under which the support of the estimated vector remains stable under small additive noise and introduce the concept of an "extended support" when stability is not achieved. The analysis is framed in terms of dual certificates, which are used to characterize stability and instability. Experiments are conducted to illustrate the theoretical findings in a compressed sensing setting.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Originality: The paper addresses a significant gap in the literature by providing the first rigorous analysis of support recovery using non-smooth loss functions (`1 and `∞ norms). While the `2 case has been well-studied, extending the analysis to non-smooth cases is a meaningful contribution.
2. Theoretical Contribution: The derivation of sharp conditions for support stability and the introduction of the extended support concept are valuable theoretical advancements. The use of dual certificates to characterize stability is a novel approach in this context.
3. Relevance: The results are relevant to compressed sensing and other high-dimensional problems, where non-smooth loss functions are often used to model noise or outliers.
4. Numerical Validation: The experiments provide some empirical support for the theoretical findings, demonstrating the behavior of support stability under different loss functions.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity of Presentation: The main results are framed in terms of dual certificates, which may obscure their practical implications for readers unfamiliar with this concept. A reformulation or simplification of the results could enhance accessibility.
2. Injectivity Condition: The restricted injectivity condition is critical to the results but is not thoroughly discussed. Its practical implications and the likelihood of it being satisfied in real-world scenarios remain unclear.
3. Experimental Limitations: While the experiments illustrate the theoretical findings, they lack clarity on how the recovered support compares quantitatively to the true signal. A more detailed analysis of the degree of mismatch between the estimated and true support would strengthen the empirical validation.
4. Generalization: The paper focuses on specific loss functions (`1 and `∞) and does not fully explore the general case for α ∈ [1, ∞]. While the authors acknowledge this limitation, it leaves the work somewhat incomplete.
Recommendation:
The paper makes a significant theoretical contribution to the field of sparse regression and compressed sensing by extending support recovery guarantees to non-smooth loss functions. However, its presentation could be improved to enhance clarity and accessibility. The authors should consider reformulating the main results to reduce reliance on dual certificates and providing more detailed experimental analysis. Despite these limitations, the paper is a valuable addition to the literature and merits acceptance after revisions.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Significant theoretical contribution to a challenging and underexplored problem.
- Novel results that extend existing theory to non-smooth loss functions.
- Relevance to practical applications in compressed sensing and high-dimensional regression.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Lack of clarity in the presentation of key results.
- Limited discussion of the injectivity condition and its practical implications.
- Insufficient experimental analysis to fully validate the theoretical claims.
Overall, the paper is a strong candidate for acceptance, provided the authors address the clarity and experimental concerns in a revised version.
