This paper introduces two novel models for microclustering—NBNB and NBD—by relaxing the "consistence in distribution" assumption, enabling sublinear cluster size growth. The authors argue convincingly that traditional clustering models, such as Dirichlet process and Pitman–Yor process mixture models, are unsuitable for applications like entity resolution, where cluster sizes should remain small regardless of dataset size. By defining the microclustering property and proposing Kolchin Partition (KP) models, the paper makes a significant contribution to Bayesian clustering methodologies. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed models outperform traditional approaches on several entity resolution datasets, particularly for realistic scenarios where cluster sizes decay sublinearly.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Originality: The paper introduces the microclustering property and KP models, which represent a significant departure from traditional clustering assumptions. This innovation is particularly relevant for applications like entity resolution, where linear growth in cluster sizes is inappropriate.
2. Methodological Rigor: The derivation of the NBNB and NBD models is thorough, with detailed explanations of their properties and posterior inference procedures. The inclusion of the chaperones algorithm for efficient sampling is a practical addition.
3. Empirical Validation: The experiments are well-designed, comparing the proposed models to established alternatives across multiple datasets. The results clearly demonstrate the advantages of the NBNB and NBD models in capturing realistic clustering behaviors.
4. Relevance to NIPS: The paper addresses a challenging and practical problem in machine learning, making it a strong fit for the conference.
Weaknesses:
1. Limited Discussion of Microclustering Property: While the microclustering property is central to the paper, its implications and theoretical underpinnings could be explored in greater depth. For instance, the observed power-law decay in Figure 2 warrants further discussion to provide deeper insights into the behavior of the proposed models.
2. Presentation Issues: The identical plots in Figure 2 need updating, and the caption referring to "top/bottom" should be corrected. These minor issues detract from the paper's overall clarity.
3. Notation and Formatting: Several equations and notations require corrections for consistency, such as the subscript \(N\) in Equation (3) and line 85. Additionally, partition ordering in footnote 3 could improve clarity.
4. Limited Scope of Experiments: While the proposed models perform well on most datasets, their performance on noisy datasets like Syria2000 is less convincing. A broader discussion of these limitations and potential remedies would strengthen the paper.
Recommendations:
- Expand the discussion on the microclustering property, particularly the power-law decay observed in Figure 2.
- Address formatting and notation inconsistencies, including specific corrections to lines 81, 151, 287, 298, and 303.
- Update Figure 2 and its caption to improve clarity.
- Provide additional insights into the models' limitations on noisy datasets and suggest potential extensions.
Decision:
This paper is a strong candidate for acceptance at NIPS. Its contributions are novel, well-motivated, and empirically validated, addressing a critical gap in clustering methodologies. While minor presentation and discussion issues exist, they do not detract significantly from the paper's overall quality. With revisions, this work has the potential to make a lasting impact on the field.
