The paper provides a comprehensive global analysis of the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm for mixtures of two Gaussians with identical covariance matrices and equal weights, addressing both the population and sample-based versions. The authors establish global convergence results for the population EM, fully characterizing its behavior under idealized conditions with access to true distributions. They further demonstrate that sample-based EM exhibits similar behavior to population EM using consistency-type arguments, showing convergence in probability to the true parameters under certain conditions.
The paper's strengths lie in its rigorous theoretical contributions. By analyzing the population EM in the infinite sample limit, the authors provide a clear understanding of the algorithm's dynamics and fixed points. Their results, such as the convergence of population EM to global maxima or saddle points depending on initialization, are significant for understanding the limitations and potential pitfalls of EM. The extension of these results to sample-based EM, demonstrating statistical consistency, is another strong point, as it bridges the gap between theoretical and practical applications of EM.
However, the paper has a notable limitation in its treatment of the finite sample case. While the authors provide consistency-type results, they do not extend their analysis to finite sample global guarantees. This omission raises questions about the practical applicability of their findings in real-world scenarios, where sample sizes are finite and initialization schemes are critical. The reviewer seeks clarification on why the analysis could not yield finite sample global results and whether this limitation stems from inherent challenges in the problem or methodological constraints. Additionally, while the paper is well-written and organized, certain technical sections could benefit from more intuitive explanations to enhance accessibility for a broader audience.
In terms of originality, the paper builds on prior work, such as Balakrishnan et al. (2014), by providing global analyses without separation or initialization conditions. This distinguishes it from earlier studies that focused on local convergence or required specific initialization schemes. The authors also relate their findings to the expected log-likelihood function, offering insights into the stationary points of EM and their implications for optimization.
The paper's significance lies in advancing the theoretical understanding of EM, particularly in the context of Gaussian mixtures. Its results are likely to influence future research on EM and related algorithms, especially in exploring extensions to more complex models or high-dimensional settings. However, the lack of finite sample guarantees limits its immediate practical impact.
Arguments for acceptance:
1. Rigorous and novel theoretical contributions to the global analysis of EM.
2. Clear characterization of population EM dynamics and its implications for sample-based EM.
3. Strong connections to prior work, with meaningful extensions.
Arguments against acceptance:
1. Lack of finite sample global results, which limits practical applicability.
2. Some technical sections could be more accessible to a broader audience.
3. Limited discussion on the implications of initialization in finite sample scenarios.
Overall, the paper makes a valuable theoretical contribution to the study of EM but would benefit from addressing its limitations in finite sample analysis.
