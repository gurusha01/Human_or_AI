The paper explores the application of information-theoretic principles, specifically rate-distortion theory and channel coding theorems, to derive bounds on the budget-fidelity tradeoff in crowdsourcing systems. This novel approach models crowdsourcing as a communication system, where workers are treated as noisy channels and tasks as encoded queries. The authors derive theoretical bounds for the minimum number of queries required to achieve a given fidelity and propose a query scheme called k-ary incidence coding (kIC) to enhance error correction. While the theoretical framework is intriguing, the paper raises questions about its practical relevance and novelty.
Strengths:
1. Novel Application of Information Theory: The use of rate-distortion theory and channel coding theorems to analyze crowdsourcing systems is innovative and potentially impactful if this is indeed the first attempt in this direction. The theoretical derivation of bounds provides insights into the fundamental limits of crowdsourcing performance.
2. Clarity of Theoretical Framework: The paper is well-organized in presenting the mathematical modeling of workers as noisy channels and the derivation of bounds. The inclusion of specific worker models, such as the spammer-hammer channel, adds depth to the analysis.
3. Introduction of k-ary Incidence Coding: The kIC scheme is an interesting contribution that leverages redundancy in query design to improve error correction, offering a concrete example of how the theoretical framework can be applied.
Weaknesses:
1. Questionable Practical Relevance: While the theoretical bounds are elegant, their looseness and the assumptions made (e.g., iid workers, no feedback) limit their applicability to real-world crowdsourcing systems. For instance, the inability to assign the same query to the same worker multiple times violates the iid assumption, creating a fundamental disconnect from channel coding problems.
2. Lack of Novelty in Derivation: The derivation of bounds appears straightforward and does not seem to introduce fundamentally new techniques beyond existing information-theoretic tools. This undermines the originality of the work.
3. Limited Guidance on Encoding Schemes: The paper does not provide sufficient clarity on how to design practical encoding schemes (e.g., u^n) that improve error correction beyond simple methods like repetition coding. This omission weakens the paper's contribution to practical crowdsourcing system design.
4. Absence of Empirical Validation: The paper would benefit from a comparison of its theoretical bounds with state-of-the-art methods in crowdsourcing. Empirical results demonstrating the utility of the derived bounds in real-world scenarios are missing.
5. Minor Issues: The min operator in equation (8) requires clarification, and the proofs of Theorem 4 and the inequality therein need elaboration. Additionally, equation (17) lacks sufficient explanation or citation.
Recommendation:
While the paper presents an interesting theoretical framework, its practical value and novelty are limited. To strengthen its contribution, the authors should address the looseness of the bounds, provide practical encoding schemes, and compare their results with state-of-the-art methods. Empirical validation would also enhance the paper's significance. For now, I recommend a weak reject, as the work requires further development to meet the standards of a high-impact conference like NeurIPS.
