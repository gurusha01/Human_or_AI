The paper presents a novel and technically deep approach to prediction with structured latent variable models, leveraging convex relaxation to achieve tractability under specific assumptions. The authors address the challenging problem of jointly optimizing latent structures and model parameters in a two-layer conditional model, a topic that has been explored extensively in the literature but remains computationally demanding. By employing semidefinite programming (SDP) and polar operator tractability, the proposed method circumvents the intractability of marginal inference and normalization, which are common bottlenecks in existing approaches like CRF-AE. The paper demonstrates the flexibility of the framework through applications in graph matching and structured inpainting, with empirical results showing improved performance over state-of-the-art methods.
Strengths:  
1. Technical Depth and Novelty: The paper introduces a convex relaxation for bi-level optimization problems in structured latent variable models, a significant theoretical advancement. The use of SDP to linearize quadratic terms and the characterization of extreme points as low-rank solutions are particularly innovative.  
2. Clarity: Despite the technical complexity, the paper is well-written and organized. The authors provide detailed derivations, making the methodology accessible to readers familiar with optimization and structured prediction.  
3. Significance: The approach addresses a long-standing challenge in machine learning and has the potential to inspire follow-up work in both theoretical and applied domains. The empirical results, particularly in transliteration and image inpainting, suggest that the method can outperform locally trained models like CRF-AE.  
4. Generality: The framework is flexible and accommodates a variety of structured prediction problems, as demonstrated by its application to graph matching and temporal models.
Weaknesses:  
1. Scalability: The reliance on SDP raises concerns about computational scalability, especially for large-scale problems. While the authors discuss optimization techniques, the practical feasibility of the approach for high-dimensional datasets remains unclear.  
2. Justification of Relaxations: The relaxation in Eq. (5), involving \(\Omega(Ux)\) and the max-margin principle, raises questions about its probabilistic interpretation. The authors could provide a stronger theoretical justification or empirical validation for this choice.  
3. Distinction Between Novel and Known Ideas: While the paper is technically rigorous, it could more clearly delineate its contributions from prior work, particularly in the context of related methods like CRF-AE and max-margin estimation.
Arguments for Acceptance:  
- The paper makes a significant theoretical contribution by introducing a convex relaxation for structured latent variable models.  
- It addresses a challenging and impactful problem, with empirical results that demonstrate practical utility.  
- The clarity of the presentation and the breadth of applications make it a valuable addition to the field.
Arguments Against Acceptance:  
- Scalability concerns due to the reliance on SDP may limit the practical applicability of the method.  
- The justification for certain relaxations, such as Eq. (5), could be more robust.  
- The distinction between novel contributions and prior work could be improved.
Conclusion: Overall, the paper represents a strong scientific contribution with substantial theoretical and practical implications. While scalability and certain theoretical aspects warrant further exploration, the novelty and significance of the work justify its acceptance.
