This paper presents a significant theoretical advancement in understanding the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm by proving its convergence to the global minimum for mean estimation in mixture-of-Gaussian distributions. The authors analyze both Population EM and Sample-based EM, providing a comprehensive characterization of their fixed points and convergence properties. Specifically, the paper demonstrates that Population EM converges to the true parameters (or their symmetric counterparts) under certain conditions, and that Sample-based EM inherits this consistency in the large sample limit. These results bridge a critical gap in the literature by addressing the global behavior of EM without relying on restrictive initialization or separation assumptions, which were common in prior work.
The novelty of this contribution is undeniable. While earlier studies (e.g., Balakrishnan et al., 2014) focused on local convergence properties or required specific initialization schemes, this paper provides a global analysis that is both rigorous and generalizable. The authors also connect their findings to the expected log-likelihood function, offering insights into the stationary points and their implications for optimization. To the best of my knowledge, no prior work has achieved such a comprehensive characterization of EM's global behavior for Gaussian mixtures.
The technical depth of the paper is impressive, with the proofs appearing robust and nontrivial. However, as the reviewer, I have not fully verified every detail of the mathematical derivations due to their complexity. That said, the results align well with established theoretical principles, lending credibility to the claims. The authors also situate their work effectively within the broader literature, referencing relevant studies and clearly delineating their contributions.
The paper is exceptionally well-written, with clear organization and precise exposition. The authors provide sufficient background for readers unfamiliar with the nuances of EM, and the results are presented in a logical progression. The inclusion of both theoretical insights and their practical implications enhances the paper's readability and impact.
Strengths:
1. Significance: The results advance our understanding of EM's global convergence properties, addressing a longstanding open question.
2. Originality: The work is novel, with no prior studies achieving similar results for Gaussian mixtures without restrictive assumptions.
3. Clarity: The paper is well-organized and accessible, even for readers not deeply familiar with the topic.
4. Broader Impact: The findings have implications for both theoretical research and practical applications of EM in machine learning and statistics.
Weaknesses:
1. Proof Verification: While the proofs appear sound, their complexity makes full verification challenging within the review timeline.
2. Scope: The results are limited to mixtures of two Gaussians, and it remains unclear how easily they generalize to more complex models.
Recommendation:
I strongly recommend acceptance of this paper. Its theoretical contributions are substantial, and the clarity of presentation ensures its accessibility to the broader research community. While the scope is somewhat narrow, the insights provided are foundational and likely to inspire further research on EM and related algorithms.
