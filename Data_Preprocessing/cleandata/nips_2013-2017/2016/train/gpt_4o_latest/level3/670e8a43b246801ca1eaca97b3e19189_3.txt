The paper introduces a novel Bayesian nonparametric framework for clustering, addressing the critical need for models that produce clusters with sizes growing sublinearly with the dataset size, termed the "microclustering property." This is a significant departure from traditional clustering models like Dirichlet Process (DP) and Pitman-Yor Process (PYP), which assume cluster sizes grow linearly with the dataset size. The authors propose Kolchin Partition (KP) models, including two specific variants—NBNB (Negative Binomial-Negative Binomial) and NBD (Negative Binomial-Dirichlet)—to achieve microclustering. The models are tested on entity resolution tasks using synthetic and real-world survey datasets, demonstrating their potential to outperform traditional exchangeable models in scenarios requiring small cluster sizes.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Relevance: The introduction of the microclustering property and KP models addresses a well-motivated gap in Bayesian clustering literature, particularly for applications like entity resolution where small cluster sizes are critical.
2. Technical Rigor: The paper provides a thorough theoretical foundation, including proofs of the microclustering property for KP models and detailed derivations of posterior inference algorithms.
3. Empirical Validation: The experiments on real-world datasets (e.g., Italy and NLTCS5000) demonstrate the practical utility of the proposed models, with NBNB and NBD outperforming DP and PYP models in most cases.
4. Clarity: The paper is well-written and organized, with clear explanations of the models, algorithms, and experimental setup. The inclusion of a faster Gibbs sampling algorithm (chaperones algorithm) is a practical contribution.
5. Significance: The work advances the state of the art in clustering by providing a flexible framework for applications requiring sublinear cluster growth, which is relevant to domains like record linkage and de-duplication.
Weaknesses:
1. Model Incoherence: The paper sacrifices projectivity to achieve microclustering, but the implications of this choice are not fully explored. For instance, how does this affect the generalizability of the model to subsets of data or its interpretability in practical applications?
2. Exchangeability Trade-off: While the authors argue that non-exchangeability is reasonable for microclustering, they do not provide sufficient counterexamples or real-world motivations to justify this assumption.
3. Experimental Limitations: The models perform poorly on noisy datasets like Syria2000 and SyriaSizes, raising questions about their robustness. Additionally, the comparison to DP and PYP models could be extended to include other state-of-the-art clustering approaches.
4. Practical Implications: The discussion on the practical limitations of incoherence and its impact on generative modeling is underdeveloped. This could hinder broader adoption of the proposed models.
5. Moderate Usefulness: While the models are innovative, their applicability may be limited to niche scenarios, as evidenced by the mixed results across datasets.
Recommendation:
The paper makes a meaningful contribution to Bayesian clustering by introducing KP models and the microclustering property. However, the trade-offs between exchangeability and incoherence, as well as the practical implications of these trade-offs, require further exploration. The experimental results are promising but highlight the need for robustness in noisy settings. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the limitations discussed, particularly the theoretical and practical implications of model incoherence. 
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Novel and well-motivated problem formulation (microclustering property).
- Strong theoretical contributions and empirical validation.
- Clear writing and well-implemented methods.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Insufficient exploration of the trade-offs between exchangeability and incoherence.
- Limited robustness on noisy datasets.
- Practical implications of the proposed models are not fully discussed.
Overall, the paper is a valuable scientific contribution to the field of Bayesian clustering, with potential to inspire further research on microclustering and non-exchangeable models.
