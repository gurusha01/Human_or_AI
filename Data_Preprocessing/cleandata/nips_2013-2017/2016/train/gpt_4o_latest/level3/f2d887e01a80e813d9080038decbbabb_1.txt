Review of the Paper
This paper addresses the challenging problem of unsupervised risk estimation and optimization on unlabeled data, particularly under distributional shifts between training and testing. The authors propose a novel framework leveraging the structural assumption of conditional independence across three views of the data. By utilizing higher-order moments and tensor decomposition techniques, the method avoids parametric assumptions about the underlying distribution, making it both elegant and flexible. The approach extends to a wide family of loss functions, including log and exponential losses, and demonstrates potential for unsupervised learning and domain adaptation.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Theoretical Contribution: The paper provides a theoretically grounded framework for unsupervised risk estimation, which is a significant contribution to the field. The use of higher-order moments and tensor decomposition to estimate class-conditional risks is a key insight, and the extension to structured output settings like conditional random fields is notable.
2. Flexibility: By avoiding parametric assumptions and relying only on conditional independence, the method is broadly applicable to various settings, including scenarios with covariate shift and mis-specified models.
3. Clarity of Presentation: The technical content is well-presented, with clear explanations of the framework, assumptions, and proofs. The authors provide high-level intuition for their results, making the paper accessible to a broad audience.
4. Preliminary Empirical Results: The experiments on a modified MNIST dataset demonstrate the promise of the approach, particularly for domain adaptation under covariate shift. The method's ability to perform unsupervised learning with limited labeled data is a practical strength.
Weaknesses:
1. Unclear Novelty: While the use of tensor decomposition for unsupervised risk estimation is intriguing, the reliance on prior work (e.g., Anandkumar et al., 2012) raises questions about the extent of novelty. The authors should more explicitly differentiate their contributions from existing tensor-based methods for latent variable models.
2. Limited Empirical Evaluation: The experiments, though promising, are preliminary and conducted on a synthetic version of MNIST. A broader evaluation on real-world datasets and tasks would strengthen the paper's claims.
3. Assumption of Three Views: The three-view conditional independence assumption, while mathematically elegant, may be restrictive in practice. The paper does not explore how violations of this assumption affect performance, which limits its practical applicability.
4. Inconsistencies in Semi-Supervised Learning: The results for semi-supervised learning are less consistent, and the paper lacks a detailed discussion of these limitations.
5. Minor Clarity Issues: Certain aspects, such as the dimensionality of feature maps, hinge loss assumptions, and the role of the seed model, are not explained clearly. Additionally, the domain adaptation experiments align more closely with covariate shift scenarios, which could be clarified.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper addresses an important and underexplored problem in machine learning.
- The proposed method is theoretically sound, flexible, and has potential for practical impact.
- The use of higher-order moments and tensor decomposition is innovative and well-motivated.
- Preliminary results demonstrate promise, particularly for domain adaptation.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The novelty of the approach is somewhat unclear due to reliance on prior work.
- The three-view assumption may limit the method's applicability in real-world scenarios.
- The empirical evaluation is limited and does not fully validate the theoretical claims.
- Certain technical aspects and experimental inconsistencies require further clarification.
Recommendation:
Overall, this paper makes a meaningful theoretical contribution to unsupervised risk estimation and optimization. However, the concerns about novelty, practical applicability, and limited empirical validation temper its impact. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions, focusing on clarifying the novelty, addressing the limitations of the three-view assumption, and expanding the empirical evaluation.
