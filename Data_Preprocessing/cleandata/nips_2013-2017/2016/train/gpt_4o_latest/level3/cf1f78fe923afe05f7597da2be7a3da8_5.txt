The paper introduces a novel manifold learning algorithm, Riemannian Relaxation (RR), that minimizes deviation from isometry by iteratively optimizing a distortion loss function using projected gradient descent. Unlike existing methods, which either rely on heuristically chosen loss functions or are limited to embeddings where the intrinsic and embedding dimensions are equal (s = d), RR explicitly accommodates embeddings in higher dimensions (s > d). The proposed loss function is derived from the push-forward Riemannian metric, enabling the simultaneous preservation of geometric properties such as lengths, angles, and volumes. This approach is theoretically grounded, leveraging results from differential geometry and Laplace-Beltrami operator estimation. The paper demonstrates the algorithm's effectiveness through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, showing its ability to achieve low-distortion embeddings and scale to large datasets via a subsampling extension (PCS-RR).
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Theoretical Rigor: The paper presents a unique approach to manifold learning by directly optimizing the Riemannian metric, distinguishing it from existing methods that optimize pairwise distances or local reconstruction errors. The theoretical foundation, including the use of Laplace-Beltrami operators and spectral norms, is well-developed.
2. Flexibility: The algorithm supports embeddings in dimensions higher than the intrinsic dimension (s > d), addressing a limitation of many existing methods like Isomap and HLLE.
3. Empirical Validation: The experiments convincingly demonstrate the algorithm's superiority in reducing distortion, particularly in challenging scenarios where isometric embeddings are not possible. The application to the SDSS galaxy dataset highlights its practical utility.
4. Scalability: The PCS-RR extension for large or noisy datasets is a valuable contribution, making the method applicable to real-world problems with high-dimensional data.
Weaknesses:
1. Parameter Selection: The paper does not provide sufficient guidance on how to systematically choose the intrinsic dimension (d) and embedding dimension (s) in Algorithm 1. While a heuristic is mentioned, a more robust method or empirical analysis would strengthen the paper.
2. Clarity Issues: 
   - The function `poly` in line 25 is undefined, leaving a gap in the algorithm's description.
   - Line 27 contains an unclear sentence that requires revision for better comprehension.
3. Typographical Errors: Several typographical issues detract from the paper's polish:
   - Line 71: `W{ij}` should be corrected to `W{kl}`.
   - Equation (1): `D = W1` should be corrected to `D = diag(W1)`.
   - Line 77: "give" should be corrected to "gives."
4. Comparative Analysis: While the paper compares RR to existing methods qualitatively and numerically, it lacks a detailed breakdown of the two loss terms in Equation (10) for different algorithms. Additionally, a comparison of computational complexities would provide a clearer understanding of the algorithm's efficiency.
5. Visualization: In Figure 2, while RR performs better numerically, HLLE and Isomap appear to have better qualitative performance. This discrepancy warrants further discussion.
Recommendation:
The paper makes a significant contribution to manifold learning by introducing a theoretically grounded and flexible algorithm for low-distortion embeddings. However, the lack of clarity in parameter selection, unresolved typographical issues, and incomplete comparative analysis detract from its overall quality. I recommend acceptance conditional on addressing these concerns, as the work is both novel and impactful, with potential for broad applicability in the field.
