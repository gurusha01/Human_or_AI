This paper presents an information-theoretic framework for analyzing crowdsourcing systems, modeling workers as noisy channels, and exploring the trade-offs between budget and fidelity. The authors focus on two channel models: the symmetric memoryless channel (MSC) and the spammer-hammer channel (SHC). The problem is framed as a coding problem, with the goal of optimizing query schemes and inference algorithms to minimize distortion for a given budget. A novel coding scheme, k-ary incidence coding (kIC), is proposed and its performance is analyzed under these models.
Strengths:  
The paper addresses an important and challenging problem in crowdsourcing, where worker reliability is often unknown or variable. By leveraging information-theoretic tools, the authors provide a rigorous framework to derive fundamental limits on budget-fidelity trade-offs. The introduction of kIC as a query scheme is particularly intriguing, as it incorporates error correction by removing invalid responses, which could improve labeling accuracy. The theoretical results, including the derivation of rate-distortion bounds and the analysis of kIC under the SHC model, are well-founded and offer valuable insights into the design of efficient crowdsourcing systems. The paper also connects its contributions to prior work, such as majority voting and the Dawid-Skene algorithm, situating its contributions within the broader literature.
Weaknesses:  
While the theoretical contributions are significant, the paper lacks empirical validation of its proposed methods. For example, experimental results comparing kIC to existing query schemes on real-world crowdsourcing datasets would strengthen the practical relevance of the work. Additionally, the paper assumes idealized conditions, such as large datasets and uniform worker distributions, which may not hold in practical scenarios. The analysis of kIC is limited to specific worker models (MSC and SHC), and it is unclear how the scheme would perform under more complex or heterogeneous worker behaviors. Finally, the paper is dense and technical, which may limit accessibility for readers outside the information theory community.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:  
Pro:  
- The paper provides a novel and rigorous theoretical framework for crowdsourcing.  
- The kIC scheme introduces a promising approach to improve labeling accuracy.  
- The results advance the state of the art by deriving fundamental limits on budget-fidelity trade-offs.  
Con:  
- The lack of empirical validation limits the practical applicability of the results.  
- Assumptions about worker behavior and dataset size may not generalize to real-world settings.  
- The paper's technical density could hinder its accessibility to a broader audience.  
Recommendation:  
Overall, this paper makes a strong theoretical contribution to the field of crowdsourcing and information theory. While the lack of empirical results is a limitation, the novelty and rigor of the work justify its acceptance, provided the authors address the practical implications and limitations in a revised version.
