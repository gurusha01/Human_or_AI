The paper addresses the critical problem of sample complexity in automated mechanism design (AMD) for revenue-maximizing combinatorial auctions, a longstanding challenge in computational economics. By analyzing bidder valuation samples, the authors provide tight sample complexity bounds for a hierarchy of deterministic combinatorial auction classes, including affine maximizer auctions (AMAs), virtual valuation combinatorial auctions (VVCAs), and mixed bundling auctions (MBAs). This work is notable for its focus on VCG-like mechanisms and its innovative reduction of the problem to selecting weights in an exponentially large parameter space. The authors' use of advanced learning theory tools, such as Rademacher complexity and pseudo-dimension, to derive these bounds is both rigorous and insightful.
The paper's primary strength lies in its theoretical contributions, which fill a significant gap in AMD by linking empirical revenue performance to expected revenue under unknown bidder valuation distributions. The results are broadly applicable to any AMD algorithm, making them highly relevant for both theoretical and practical advancements in the field. Furthermore, the authors' exploration of the inherent complexity of multi-stage optimization procedures in auction design pushes the boundaries of learning theory, offering novel insights into function classes that diverge from traditional machine learning contexts.
However, the paper has some areas for improvement. While the results are impressive, certain bounds and constants, such as the H constants, are difficult to interpret without additional clarification. For instance, the implications of the exponential lower bounds in Section 3.1 could be more explicitly communicated to help readers understand the practical limitations of the presented methods. Additionally, the role of uniform convergence in negative results and its broader implications for sample complexity warrants further discussion. This would provide a clearer picture of the obstacles to achieving stronger goals, such as designing approximately optimal auctions with fewer samples.
The paper is well-written and organized, but some sections, particularly those involving technical derivations, could benefit from more intuitive explanations or examples. This would make the work more accessible to a wider audience, including researchers less familiar with the intricacies of combinatorial auctions or advanced learning theory.
In summary, this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of automated mechanism design by providing foundational sample complexity results for combinatorial auctions. Its strengths in originality and theoretical rigor outweigh its minor weaknesses in clarity and communication. I recommend acceptance, with the suggestion that the authors address the noted areas for improvement to enhance the paper's impact and accessibility.
