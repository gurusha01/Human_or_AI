The paper introduces the concept of a Product Cut (PCut) for graph clustering, which is presented as a more natural and stable alternative to existing objectives like the Normalized Cut (NCut). The authors provide a theoretical framework for PCut, emphasizing its advantages in stability and balance, and propose an algorithm for optimizing this objective. Experimental results demonstrate that PCut achieves superior cluster purity compared to other methods, such as NCut and NMFR, while also running faster in some cases.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Motivation: The Product Cut objective is a novel contribution that addresses key limitations of existing graph clustering objectives, such as the instability and imbalance of NCut. The motivation is well-articulated, with theoretical bounds and stability properties that distinguish PCut from its predecessors.
2. Theoretical Rigor: The paper provides a detailed mathematical analysis of PCut, including its convex relaxation and equivalence to the discrete problem. The proofs, while not fully verified in this review, appear to be grounded in solid mathematical reasoning.
3. Algorithm Design: The proposed algorithm is well-constructed, leveraging exact relaxation and randomized linear programming to efficiently optimize PCut. The use of Algebraic Multigrid (AMG) for computational efficiency is a practical addition.
4. Experimental Results: The experimental results are promising, with PCut consistently outperforming other methods in cluster purity across diverse datasets. The algorithm's faster runtime compared to NMFR on large datasets is an additional strength.
Weaknesses:
1. Experimental Setup: The experimental section lacks clarity regarding the computational environment. Details such as the machine specifications and programming language used are missing, which hinders reproducibility.
2. Running Time Analysis: While PCut is shown to be faster than NMFR, the paper does not provide sufficient explanation for this speedup. A deeper analysis or comparison with other methods would strengthen the claims.
3. Computational Complexity: The paper does not discuss the computational complexity of the PCut optimization problem or its algorithm. Addressing whether the problem is NP-hard and providing a complexity analysis would enhance the paper's completeness.
4. Minor Issues: There are several editorial issues, such as unclear captions (e.g., Figure 1a), ambiguous construction details (Lines 111-115), and potential formula errors (Line 119). Additionally, typos (e.g., "close" instead of "closed" on Line 209) and unclear references (e.g., Table 2.1 vs. Figure 2) need to be corrected.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper introduces a novel and theoretically sound objective for graph clustering.
- The proposed algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of cluster purity.
- The stability and balance properties of PCut address significant limitations of existing methods.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The experimental setup lacks clarity, and the running time analysis is insufficiently detailed.
- Computational complexity is not discussed, leaving a gap in the theoretical analysis.
- Minor editorial and formula issues detract from the paper's overall polish.
Recommendation:
This paper makes a strong contribution to the field of graph clustering with its novel PCut objective and effective algorithm. However, the authors should address the weaknesses outlined above, particularly the experimental clarity and computational complexity discussion. With these improvements, the paper would be a valuable addition to the conference. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions.
