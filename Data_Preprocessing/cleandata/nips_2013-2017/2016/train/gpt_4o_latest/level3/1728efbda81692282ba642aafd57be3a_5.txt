This paper proposes an extension of Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) into the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS), resulting in the Kernel DMD (KDMD) algorithm. By leveraging kernel methods, KDMD generalizes DMD to approximate Koopman eigenfunctions with nonlinear basis functions, enabling richer representations of nonlinear dynamical systems. The authors demonstrate the algorithm's ability to decompose dynamics into finite modes, which can be used for feature extraction and machine learning applications, such as prediction, change-point detection, and dynamics recognition. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world data validate the method's efficacy.
Strengths:
1. Technical Contribution: The extension of DMD to RKHS is a meaningful advancement, as it addresses the limitations of traditional DMD in capturing nonlinear dynamics. The use of kernel methods allows for a more expressive representation of Koopman eigenfunctions.
2. Applications: The paper demonstrates the versatility of KDMD by applying it to diverse tasks, including prediction, sequential change-point detection, and dynamics recognition. These applications highlight the practical utility of the proposed method.
3. Theoretical Rigor: The mathematical formulation is thorough, with detailed derivations of the algorithm and its robustification using POD bases. This ensures the method's correctness and robustness in practical scenarios.
4. Empirical Validation: The empirical results, particularly on the toy nonlinear system and the HÃ©non map, showcase the algorithm's ability to estimate Koopman eigenvalues and modes accurately.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity and Accessibility: The manuscript is excessively verbose and overly mathematical, making it difficult to read even for specialists. Key ideas are buried under dense derivations, and the lack of pedagogical explanations limits accessibility.
2. Redundancy: Section 4 overlaps significantly with the introduction and could be condensed or integrated elsewhere. Similarly, Section 5 (related works) could be summarized in the conclusion.
3. Lack of Illustrations: Section 5 lacks visual aids or diagrams to clarify the connections between KDMD and related methods, which would enhance comprehension.
4. Condensed Empirical Section: Section 6 is overly condensed, with insufficient detail on experimental setups and results. More illustrative examples or visualizations would improve the reader's understanding.
5. Typographical Error: A typo mischaracterizes the toy nonlinear system as linear, which could confuse readers.
Suggestions for Improvement:
- Rewrite the paper in a more pedagogical style, focusing on simplifying the presentation and emphasizing key insights.
- Remove redundant sections and streamline the organization for better flow.
- Expand Section 6 with more detailed explanations and additional visualizations of the results.
- Include illustrative diagrams in Section 5 to clarify the connections between KDMD and related methods.
- Correct the typo in the description of the toy nonlinear system.
Recommendation:
While the paper is technically sound and presents a significant contribution, its current presentation makes it unsuitable for publication. The manuscript has high potential if rewritten with improved clarity and organization. I recommend a major revision to address the issues outlined above.
Pros for Acceptance:
- Novel extension of DMD to RKHS with theoretical rigor.
- Practical utility demonstrated through diverse applications.
- Advances the state of the art in Koopman operator-based methods.
Cons for Acceptance:
- Poor readability due to excessive mathematical verbosity.
- Redundant sections and lack of clarity in empirical results.
- Requires significant rewriting to make the contribution accessible to a broader audience.
