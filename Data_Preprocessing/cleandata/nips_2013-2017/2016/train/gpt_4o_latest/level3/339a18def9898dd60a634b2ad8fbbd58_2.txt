The paper presents a novel information-theoretic framework for modeling crowdsourcing as a joint source-channel coding (JSCC) problem with random channel states, offering a fresh perspective on the fundamental limits of crowdsourcing systems. By leveraging existing JSCC results, the authors derive asymptotic bounds on the number of queries per item and establish a lower bound on the error probability for "k-ary incidence coding" under specific crowdsourcing models. This approach is theoretically rigorous and addresses a critical aspect of crowdsourcing: the trade-off between query budget and inference fidelity.
Strengths:  
1. Theoretical Contribution: The paper provides a solid theoretical foundation for analyzing crowdsourcing systems, introducing a new lens through which to study query design and inference. The use of JSCC concepts is innovative and demonstrates the authors' deep understanding of information theory.  
2. Clarity in Modeling: The modeling of workers as noisy channels, including the use of M-ary symmetric channels (MSC) and spammer-hammer channels (SHC), is well-motivated and aligns with real-world crowdsourcing scenarios.  
3. k-ary Incidence Coding: The analysis of k-ary incidence coding (kIC) is a valuable contribution, offering insights into its error correction capabilities and its potential for improving crowdsourcing performance.  
4. Practical Implications: The discussion on query pricing strategies and the numerical results in Figure 2 provide practical takeaways for designing efficient crowdsourcing systems.
Weaknesses:  
1. Separation Theorem Applicability: While the separation theorem is a key tool in the analysis, its applicability to channels with random states unknown at the encoder is assumed but not rigorously proven. This is a significant gap that weakens the theoretical robustness of the results.  
2. Unrealistic Assumptions: The assumption that taskmasters and crowdsourcers lack access to original data may not hold in many practical scenarios. Incorporating side information could make the model more realistic and applicable.  
3. Interpretation of Results: The interpretation of lower bounds in Figure 2 is unclear, particularly in the absence of an upper bound for comparison. This limits the ability to assess the claimed improvements.  
4. Non-Asymptotic Analysis: The paper focuses on asymptotic limits, which, while theoretically important, may not be directly applicable to real-world settings. A non-asymptotic characterization, as suggested by prior work (e.g., Kostina and Verdu), would enhance the practical relevance of the results.  
5. Related Work: While the paper references foundational works, it could benefit from a more comprehensive discussion of related literature, particularly recent advances in probabilistic modeling and inference in crowdsourcing.
Recommendation:  
The paper is a strong theoretical contribution to the field of crowdsourcing and information theory. However, the lack of proof for the separation theorem's applicability and the absence of non-asymptotic results are notable weaknesses. I recommend acceptance conditional on the authors addressing these concerns, particularly by providing a justification for the separation theorem and exploring non-asymptotic bounds. Additionally, clarifying the interpretation of Figure 2 and expanding the discussion of related work would further strengthen the paper.
