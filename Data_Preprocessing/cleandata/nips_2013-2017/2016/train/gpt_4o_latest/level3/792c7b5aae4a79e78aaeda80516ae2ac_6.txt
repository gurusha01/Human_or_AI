This paper provides a rigorous analysis of the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm for Gaussian mixture models (GMMs), specifically focusing on the convergence behavior of the algorithm under varying initializations. The authors introduce a novel approach by analyzing an idealized version of EM, termed "Population EM," which operates in the infinite sample limit using the true Q function. They establish that the parameter sequence generated by the actual EM algorithm probabilistically converges to the sequence derived from Population EM. Furthermore, the paper characterizes the stationary points of the expected log-likelihood function and explores their implications for EM's convergence properties.
The study is technically sound, with results that are both non-trivial and insightful. The authors rigorously prove convergence properties for two specific GMMs: one with symmetric means and another with asymmetric means. They also provide a detailed characterization of the conditions under which EM converges to true parameters, stationary points, or degenerate solutions. The analysis of the expected log-likelihood near stationary points is particularly noteworthy, as it sheds light on how EM can get trapped in local minima or saddle points. The paper's findings are significant for understanding EM's sensitivity to initialization and its limitations in practical scenarios.
The paper is well-written and organized, with clear mathematical exposition and commentary that aids intuition. The use of Population EM as an analytical tool is a novel contribution, providing a deeper understanding of EM's behavior in the large sample limit. However, the scope of the results is limited to restrictive models (e.g., mixtures of two Gaussians with known covariance), which may reduce their applicability to more complex or real-world scenarios. Additionally, the claim about generalizing the analysis to other ascent algorithms, such as gradient ascent, is underdeveloped and lacks sufficient justification.
Strengths:
1. Rigorous and novel analysis of EM using the true Q function.
2. Clear characterization of convergence conditions and stationary points.
3. Accessible presentation of complex mathematical results.
Weaknesses:
1. Results are limited to highly specific models, reducing general applicability.
2. Insufficient clarity and justification for claims about generalizing to other ascent algorithms.
Recommendation: Accept without reservations. While the scope is limited, the paper provides valuable theoretical insights into EM's behavior and introduces a novel analytical framework that could inspire future research.
