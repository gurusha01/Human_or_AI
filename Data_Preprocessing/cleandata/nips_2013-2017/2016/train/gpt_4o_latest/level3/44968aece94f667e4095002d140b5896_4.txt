The paper addresses the seller's pricing strategy in the presence of adversarial and strategic buyers, focusing on minimizing regret in an online setting. The authors propose a model where the seller posts prices \(\tau\) days in advance, simplifying the strategic interactions between buyers and the seller. They demonstrate that the regret in this setting scales as \(\Theta(T^{2/3})\), a significant departure from the \(\Theta(\sqrt{T})\) regret observed in simpler models without buyer patience. The paper provides both upper and lower bounds for regret, relying on a no-regret algorithm that fixes prices over \(T^{1/3}\) steps. The results are supported by reductions to prior work and are well-executed, with a particularly strong discussion section.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Significance: The paper introduces an interesting model that captures the strategic behavior of buyers with patience, a realistic extension of existing pricing models. The shift in regret bounds from \(\sqrt{T}\) to \(T^{2/3}\) due to buyer patience is a compelling result that advances our understanding of pricing strategies in adversarial settings.
2. Theoretical Rigor: The proofs for both upper and lower bounds are thorough and well-constructed. The use of epochs and reductions to multi-armed bandit problems with switching costs is a clever approach, and the results are consistent with prior literature.
3. Clarity of Results: While the abstract and some sections of the main text could be clearer, the discussion section is particularly well-done, providing valuable insights into the implications of the results and potential future directions.
4. Broader Impact: The work has practical implications for online marketplaces and dynamic pricing strategies, making it relevant to both theoretical and applied research communities.
Weaknesses:
1. Presentation Issues: The abstract is unclear and does not adequately highlight the key contributions of the paper. Additionally, there are minor typos and organizational issues that detract from the overall readability.
2. Appendix Dependence: The proof for general \(\tau\) is relegated to the appendix, which is a critical result that should be explicitly mentioned in the main text. This omission may hinder accessibility for readers unfamiliar with the details of the model.
3. Reliance on Prior Work: While the reductions to prior work are well-executed, the paper leans heavily on existing techniques, which may limit its perceived originality. The authors could have better emphasized the novel aspects of their approach.
Recommendation:
I recommend acceptance of this paper. Its contributions are significant, and the theoretical results are both novel and well-supported. However, the authors should address the clarity issues in the abstract and main text, explicitly mention the general \(\tau\) proof in the main body, and correct minor presentation errors. These improvements would enhance the paper's accessibility and impact.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Novel and significant results on regret bounds in a strategic buyer setting.
- Theoretical rigor and well-executed proofs.
- Strong discussion section with practical implications.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Unclear abstract and minor presentation issues.
- Heavy reliance on prior work, though the contributions are still meaningful.
