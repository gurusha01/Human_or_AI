The paper introduces an adaptive averaging heuristic for accelerating constrained convex optimization, presenting a novel approach to improving the performance of first-order methods. The authors leverage a Lyapunov-based analysis to provide theoretical guarantees on the convergence rate, even for non-strongly convex objective functions. The heuristic adaptively adjusts the averaging weights to enhance the decrease of the Lyapunov function, preserving the quadratic convergence rate of accelerated methods. The paper also demonstrates the heuristic's advantages over existing restarting techniques through numerical experiments, particularly in low-dimensional settings.
Strengths:
1. Theoretical Contribution: The paper provides a rigorous theoretical foundation for the proposed heuristic, ensuring that the original convergence rate is preserved. This is a significant improvement over existing restarting heuristics, which lack such guarantees for non-strongly convex objectives.
2. Novelty: The adaptive averaging heuristic is a fresh contribution to the field, addressing limitations of prior methods like gradient and speed restarting.
3. Experimental Validation: The experiments, though limited to low-dimensional settings, show that adaptive averaging consistently outperforms existing heuristics, particularly in strongly convex cases.
4. Connection to Existing Work: The paper builds on prior work, such as Nesterov's accelerated methods and mirror descent, and extends these ideas in a meaningful way.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity and Accessibility: The paper is highly technical and difficult to follow, especially for readers unfamiliar with advanced optimization concepts. Key terms, abbreviations, and equations (e.g., lines 33-34 and 46-47) lack intuitive explanations, limiting accessibility.
2. Practical Significance: The experiments are confined to low-dimensional settings (e.g., RÂ³), raising concerns about the scalability of the method to high-dimensional problems commonly encountered in machine learning.
3. Relation to Existing Methods: While the paper mentions methods like Adagrad and Adam, it does not adequately discuss how adaptive averaging compares or complements these widely used techniques.
4. Figure Ambiguity: The solid line in Figure 1 is ambiguous. Using a dotted line or color coding would improve clarity.
Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Provide more background information and intuitive explanations for key equations and concepts to make the paper accessible to a broader audience.
2. Include experiments in higher-dimensional settings to demonstrate the scalability and practical significance of the method.
3. Discuss the relationship between adaptive averaging and adaptive gradient methods like Adagrad and Adam in greater detail.
4. Revise Figure 1 for better visual clarity.
Recommendation:
While the paper makes a strong theoretical contribution and introduces a promising heuristic, its limited practical evaluation and lack of clarity hinder its impact. If the authors address these concerns, particularly by demonstrating scalability and improving accessibility, the paper would be a valuable addition to the field. Conditional acceptance is recommended.
