The paper addresses a fundamental problem in computational economics: the sample complexity of learning approximately optimal combinatorial auctions. It provides tight sample complexity bounds for various deterministic auction classes, including affine maximizer auctions (AMAs), virtual valuation combinatorial auctions (VVCAs), and mixed bundling auctions (MBAs). The authors leverage advanced tools from learning theory, such as Rademacher complexities and pseudo-dimensions, to analyze the revenue objective's complexity. This work bridges the gap between mechanism design and learning theory, offering significant insights into automated mechanism design (AMD) and the theoretical underpinnings of auction revenue functions.
Strengths:
1. Technical Depth and Rigor: The paper is technically sound, with thorough mathematical derivations and clear proofs. The use of Rademacher complexity and pseudo-dimension to analyze multi-stage optimization procedures is novel and demonstrates a deep understanding of both mechanism design and learning theory.
2. Interdisciplinary Contribution: By introducing learning-theoretic tools to mechanism design, the paper advances both fields. The results are relevant not only for automated mechanism design but also for the broader study of complex function classes in machine learning.
3. Practical Relevance: The results provide actionable insights for AMD algorithms, offering guarantees on the number of samples required to design high-revenue auctions. This has implications for real-world applications, such as spectrum auctions and procurement auctions.
4. Clarity and Organization: The paper is well-organized, with a clear exposition of the problem, related work, and methodology. The authors effectively position their contributions relative to prior work, particularly in distinguishing their focus on combinatorial settings from simpler single-item or single-bidder cases.
Weaknesses:
1. Limited Experimental Validation: While the theoretical results are robust, the paper lacks empirical validation to demonstrate the practical applicability of the derived bounds. Simulations on synthetic or real-world auction data would strengthen the work.
2. Complexity of Presentation: Although the paper is clear for experts, the technical depth may make it less accessible to a broader audience. Simplifying some explanations or including more intuitive examples could improve readability.
3. Focus on Deterministic Auctions: The restriction to deterministic auctions, while justified, limits the generality of the results. Extending the analysis to randomized mechanisms could broaden the paper's impact.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper makes a significant theoretical contribution by addressing an open question in AMD and providing tight sample complexity bounds for well-studied auction classes.
- It introduces novel methodologies that are likely to influence future research at the intersection of learning theory and mechanism design.
- The results have practical implications for designing scalable, high-revenue auctions in real-world settings.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The lack of empirical validation leaves open questions about the practical utility of the theoretical results.
- The focus on deterministic auctions may limit the paper's relevance to some applications where randomized mechanisms are preferred.
Recommendation:
I recommend acceptance of this paper. Its technical rigor, interdisciplinary contributions, and relevance to both theory and practice make it a strong candidate for inclusion in the conference. Addressing the weaknesses in future work, particularly through empirical validation and extensions to randomized mechanisms, would further enhance its impact.
