This paper addresses a fundamental question in matrix completion by proving that all local minima are global minima for the symmetric, noiseless case. Furthermore, it demonstrates that gradient descent converges to the global minimum even with random initialization, a significant departure from prior work that required careful initialization. The results are extended to noisy settings in the appendix, highlighting the robustness of the proposed theoretical framework. These contributions are pioneering in showing geometric properties of matrix completion problems and provide a foundation for exploring similar properties in other nonconvex machine learning problems.
Strengths:
1. Theoretical Contributions: The paper makes a strong theoretical advance by proving the absence of spurious local minima in the symmetric matrix completion problem. This is a significant result that deepens our understanding of the geometry of nonconvex optimization problems.
2. Novelty: Unlike prior work, which relied on carefully chosen initialization schemes, this paper shows that gradient descent converges to the global minimum with random initialization. This is a notable improvement in both theoretical guarantees and practical applicability.
3. Clarity and Organization: The paper is exceptionally well-written and organized. The proof strategies, particularly for the rank-1 case, are clearly presented, making the results accessible to readers. The use of "simple" proofs that generalize well is a commendable methodological choice.
4. Impact: The findings have the potential to inspire further research into geometric properties of other nonconvex problems, making this work highly significant for the broader machine learning community.
Weaknesses:
1. Practical Applicability: A key limitation of the paper is its restriction to symmetric matrices. While this simplifies the analysis, it reduces the practical applicability of the results, as many real-world matrix completion problems involve asymmetric matrices.
2. Experimental Validation: The paper focuses entirely on theoretical analysis. While this is not inherently a weakness, some experimental validation could strengthen the claims and demonstrate the practical utility of the results.
3. Extensions to Other Settings: Although the appendix extends the results to noisy settings, the paper does not address more complex scenarios, such as weighted matrix completion or alternative distance measures, which are common in applications.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper makes a significant theoretical contribution by resolving a key question in matrix completion.
- It provides novel insights into the geometry of nonconvex optimization problems, with implications for other areas of machine learning.
- The writing and organization are exemplary, making the results accessible and reproducible.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The restriction to symmetric matrices limits the practical impact of the results.
- The lack of experimental validation leaves open questions about the applicability of the findings to real-world problems.
Recommendation:
Overall, this paper represents a high-quality scientific contribution that advances the state of the art in matrix completion and nonconvex optimization. While the practical limitations are noteworthy, the theoretical insights and potential for broader impact justify acceptance. I recommend accepting the paper, with a suggestion to include a discussion on extending the results to asymmetric matrices and other practical settings in future work.
