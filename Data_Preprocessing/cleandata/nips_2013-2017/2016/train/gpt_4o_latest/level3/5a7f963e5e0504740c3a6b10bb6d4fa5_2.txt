This paper investigates the tractability of operations on arithmetic circuits (ACs), focusing on the Probabilistic Sentential Decision Diagram (PSDD) introduced by Kisa et al. (2014). The authors present an algorithm for compiling Markov networks into PSDDs, leveraging a polytime multiplication operator unique to PSDDs. Experimental results suggest that PSDD-based compilation can yield smaller arithmetic circuits compared to existing methods, such as those based on AOMDDs or SDDs. However, the paper also highlights that PSDDs do not support a polytime summing-out operation, limiting their applicability for certain inference tasks.
Strengths:
1. Experimental Contribution: The paper demonstrates empirically that PSDD compilation can outperform AOMDD-based methods in terms of circuit size, which is a significant practical advantage for certain applications.
2. Simplified Compilation Algorithm: The proposed compilation approach avoids intermediate logical representations, such as SDDs or d-DNNFs, making it conceptually simpler and potentially easier to implement.
3. Theoretical Insights: The paper rigorously establishes the tractability of the multiplication operator for PSDDs and provides complexity-theoretic guarantees for their compilation size, bounded by treewidth.
Weaknesses:
1. Limited Novelty: The algorithm closely resembles existing methods for AOMDD compilation, and Theorem 6 is a direct extension of known results for AOMDDs. This diminishes the originality of the contribution.
2. Misrepresentation of Results: Theorem 6 is misleadingly framed, as it guarantees the existence of a small PSDD but does not ensure that the proposed algorithm will find it. This distinction is critical and should have been clarified.
3. Lack of Analysis: While the experimental results are promising, the paper does not provide a deeper analysis of why PSDD compilation outperforms AOMDD compilation. This omission weakens the paper's explanatory power.
4. Clarity Issues: The paper is challenging to follow without prior knowledge of foundational works, such as Darwiche (2011) and Kisa et al. (2014). Additionally, Definition 6 is unclear and should be revised using the more precise definition from Darwiche (2011).
5. Misrepresentation of SDD-PSDD Relationship: The paper inaccurately claims that the SDD underlying a PSDD is not compressed, which could mislead readers unfamiliar with the nuances of these representations.
6. Scope of Results: The lack of a polytime summing-out operator for PSDDs limits their utility for broader probabilistic inference tasks, such as variable elimination or message-passing algorithms.
Recommendation:
While the paper provides a useful empirical contribution and a simplified compilation algorithm, its limited novelty, misrepresentation of results, and lack of clarity weaken its overall impact. To strengthen the work, the authors should (1) clarify the relationship between PSDDs and AOMDDs, emphasizing the trade-offs in succinctness and tractability, (2) provide a deeper theoretical or empirical analysis of why PSDD compilation is more effective, and (3) improve the clarity of definitions and theorems. Based on the current state, I recommend a weak reject, though the paper has potential for improvement with revisions.
