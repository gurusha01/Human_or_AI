The paper presents a novel approach to quantifying and improving the robustness of neural networks against adversarial examples. The authors introduce a point-wise robustness metric, defined as the smallest perturbation (in \( \ell_\infty \) norm) required to change a neural network's prediction. Two additional metrics—adversarial frequency (the probability of point-wise robustness below a threshold) and adversarial severity (the conditional expected value of point-wise robustness below a threshold)—are proposed to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of robustness. To address the computational challenges of robustness estimation in networks with ReLU activations, the authors propose a tractable convex relaxation, enabling efficient computation of an upper bound for the robustness metric. The paper also demonstrates methods to improve neural network robustness using the proposed metrics, with experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets showing superiority over existing schemes.
Strengths:
1. Novel Metrics: The introduction of point-wise robustness and its associated statistics (adversarial frequency and severity) provides a more nuanced understanding of robustness compared to existing methods.
2. Tractable Approximation: The convex relaxation approach is well-motivated and effectively addresses the computational intractability of robustness estimation for ReLU networks.
3. Experimental Validation: The paper demonstrates the utility of the proposed metrics in identifying overfitting to specific adversarial attack algorithms and shows improvements in robustness for MNIST and CIFAR-10 networks.
4. Significance: The work addresses a critical issue in deploying neural networks in real-world, adversarially vulnerable scenarios, making it relevant to both researchers and practitioners.
Weaknesses:
1. Limited Novelty: While the proposed metrics and methods are solid contributions, they build incrementally on prior work (e.g., [21]), and the overall contribution is not groundbreaking.
2. Unintuitive Adversarial Severity: The adversarial severity metric, as defined, may not align with practical intuitions about robustness. A more intuitive alternative, such as \( E[\rho \mathbb{1}(\rho \leq \epsilon)] \), could be explored.
3. Limited Improvement for NiN: The proposed methods show only marginal improvements in robustness for the NiN model on CIFAR-10, suggesting that the approach may not scale well to larger or more complex networks.
4. Clarity Issues: Minor organizational issues, such as the placement of the subsection on rounding errors (which would fit better in the experiments section), detract from the paper's clarity. Additionally, a typo ("when when") should be corrected.
Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Connection to Margin: The authors could explore the relationship between point-wise robustness and the concept of "margin" in classification, which might provide additional theoretical insights.
2. Intuitive Explanation for NiN Results: The paper lacks an intuitive explanation for why the proposed method does not significantly improve the robustness of NiN. Addressing this would strengthen the paper's conclusions.
3. Alternative Metrics: Revisiting the definition of adversarial severity to align it more closely with practical interpretations of robustness could enhance the paper's impact.
