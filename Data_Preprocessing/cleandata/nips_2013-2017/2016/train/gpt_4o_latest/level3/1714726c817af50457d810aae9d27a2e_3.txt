The paper presents a study on accelerated first-order methods for constrained convex optimization, focusing on both continuous and discrete settings. Building on the work of Krichene et al., which connects Nesterov's method to an ODE system coupling primal and dual trajectories, the authors propose a generalized averaging scheme for the primal trajectory in the continuous setting. The central contribution is Theorem 2, which establishes faster convergence rates under specific conditions on the averaging coefficients, achieving rates faster than \(1/t^2\). Additionally, the paper introduces an adaptive weighting heuristic with convergence guarantees, which is tested experimentally and compared to restarting techniques.
Strengths
1. Theoretical Contributions: The paper rigorously analyzes a family of ODEs with generalized averaging and provides sufficient conditions for achieving accelerated convergence rates. The results extend prior work and offer a deeper understanding of the role of averaging in optimization dynamics.
2. Novelty: The adaptive averaging heuristic is a significant contribution, as it preserves convergence guarantees while empirically outperforming existing restarting heuristics in some cases.
3. Experimental Validation: The numerical experiments are well-designed, demonstrating the practical advantages of adaptive averaging over other heuristics. The visualizations provide clear insights into the behavior of the proposed method.
4. Clarity and Organization: The paper is well-written and logically structured, making complex mathematical concepts accessible. The use of Lyapunov functions and energy functions is clearly explained.
5. Relevance: The work addresses a timely and important problem in optimization, particularly relevant to large-scale machine learning applications.
Weaknesses
1. Discrete Setting: While the continuous-time analysis is thorough, the theoretical analysis of the discrete version of the algorithm is missing. This limits the practical applicability of the results, as most optimization algorithms are implemented in discrete time.
2. Related Work: The paper could benefit from a more comprehensive discussion of related work, particularly the contributions of Attouch, Peypouquet, and coauthors, which are not mentioned but seem relevant to the topic.
3. Practical Impact: Although the adaptive averaging heuristic shows promise, its performance gains are not uniformly significant across all tested cases. Further exploration of its limitations and potential extensions would strengthen the paper.
4. Generality of Results: The faster convergence rates are established under specific conditions on the averaging coefficients. It would be helpful to discuss the generality of these conditions and their applicability to broader problem settings.
Recommendation
Accept with Minor Revisions. The paper makes a solid theoretical and experimental contribution to the field of accelerated optimization methods. However, addressing the theoretical gap in the discrete setting and expanding the discussion of related work would enhance its impact. The adaptive averaging heuristic is a promising direction that warrants further exploration.
Arguments for Acceptance
- Significant theoretical contribution with faster convergence rates.
- Novel adaptive averaging heuristic with empirical validation.
- Clear and well-organized presentation.
Arguments Against Acceptance
- Lack of theoretical analysis for the discrete setting.
- Incomplete discussion of related work.
In summary, the paper advances the understanding of accelerated methods for constrained convex optimization and introduces a novel heuristic with practical potential. With minor revisions, it would be a strong contribution to the conference.
