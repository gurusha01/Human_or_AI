The paper proposes an iterative framework for improving similarity measures in an unsupervised setting by leveraging compact cliques and optimization-based training batch selection. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained on these batches to refine similarity representations iteratively. The approach is tested on human pose similarity tasks (Olympic Sports and Leeds Sports datasets) and object classification (PASCAL VOC 2007), demonstrating competitive results.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Potential Impact: The paper addresses a challenging problem in unsupervised similarity learning, which is crucial for tasks like pose estimation and object classification. The proposed method innovatively combines clique-based grouping with CNN training, offering a promising alternative to supervised approaches that require extensive labeled data.
2. Experimental Validation: The method achieves significant performance improvements over baseline approaches, particularly in human pose similarity tasks. The results on the Leeds Sports dataset demonstrate that the method is competitive even against supervised techniques, which is noteworthy for an unsupervised approach.
3. Scalability: The optimization framework reduces computational costs by selecting mutually consistent cliques for training, making it more efficient than methods requiring exhaustive pairwise comparisons.
4. Generalizability: The approach is evaluated across diverse datasets (Olympic Sports, Leeds Sports, and PASCAL VOC), showcasing its adaptability to different tasks.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity and Presentation: The problem introduction and step-by-step explanation of the method are not well-articulated. Key concepts, such as the clique creation process and the optimization objective, are difficult to follow without significant effort. Improved clarity would make the paper more accessible to readers.
2. Ad-hoc Nature of the Method: The proposed framework involves multiple components (e.g., clique creation, batch selection, iterative training), but their individual contributions to the overall performance are not evaluated. This makes it difficult to assess the necessity of each component.
3. Lack of Baseline Comparisons: The selection of components, such as the clique-based grouping, is not justified by comparisons with simpler alternatives like random batch assignments. This raises questions about whether the observed improvements are due to the proposed method or inherent properties of CNNs.
4. Limited Theoretical Insights: While the empirical results are promising, the paper lacks a strong theoretical foundation or analysis to explain why the proposed iterative process improves similarity measures.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper addresses an important and underexplored problem in unsupervised similarity learning.
- The experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods.
- The approach has potential applications in various computer vision tasks, making it relevant to the broader research community.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The method appears ad-hoc, and the lack of component-wise evaluation undermines its scientific rigor.
- The unclear presentation of the methodology could hinder reproducibility and understanding.
- The paper does not sufficiently justify its design choices or compare them with simpler baselines.
Recommendation:
While the paper demonstrates promise and contributes to the field of unsupervised similarity learning, its weaknesses in clarity, justification of components, and theoretical grounding limit its impact. I recommend conditional acceptance, provided the authors address the clarity issues, evaluate the contributions of individual components, and compare their method with simpler baselines.
