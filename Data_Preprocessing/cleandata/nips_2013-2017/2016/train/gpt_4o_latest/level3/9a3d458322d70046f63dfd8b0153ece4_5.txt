This paper tackles the critical problem of deriving safe policies in sequential decision-making under uncertainty, ensuring performance guarantees relative to a baseline policy. The authors propose a novel model-based approach that minimizes robust regret with respect to the baseline policy, allowing for selective improvement in states with high model accuracy while reverting to the baseline policy in states with high uncertainty. This approach addresses key limitations of existing methods, which often adopt overly conservative strategies or fail to improve when model uncertainties are non-uniform across the state space.
The paper's contributions are significant. First, the authors provide a rigorous theoretical foundation for their approach, proving that their robust regret minimization formulation is NP-hard but offering a practical approximation algorithm. This algorithm is well-justified and supported by both theoretical analysis and empirical results, demonstrating its effectiveness in outperforming standard robust methods. Additionally, the paper derives performance bounds for various safe policy learning approaches, though the comparisons among these bounds could be more detailed. The experimental results, conducted on diverse domains such as grid problems and energy arbitrage, convincingly show the proposed method's superiority in balancing safety and performance improvement, particularly in settings with significant model uncertainties.
The paper is technically sound, with claims well-supported by theoretical proofs and empirical validation. The necessity of the approximation is clearly articulated, and the proposed algorithm is both practical and effective. However, the computational complexity of the exact solution is a limitation, and while the approximation is promising, further exploration of its scalability to larger, more complex domains would strengthen the paper. Additionally, the discussion of performance bounds could benefit from more detailed comparative analysis to provide deeper insights into the trade-offs between different approaches.
The paper is clearly written and well-organized, with a logical flow from problem formulation to theoretical analysis and experimental validation. The related work is adequately referenced, situating the contributions within the broader literature on robust MDPs and safe policy learning. The novelty of the approach, particularly the focus on robust regret minimization relative to a baseline policy, distinguishes it from prior work.
In terms of significance, the proposed method addresses a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning and has the potential to advance the state of the art in safe policy learning. Its applicability to real-world problems, such as energy arbitrage, highlights its practical relevance. However, the lack of detailed comparisons among performance bounds and the limited exploration of scalability are areas for improvement.
