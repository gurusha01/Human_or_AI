The paper explores accelerated descent dynamics for constrained convex optimization, focusing on a novel adaptive averaging heuristic to enhance convergence rates. The authors leverage Lyapunov functions to derive sufficient conditions for achieving desired convergence rates and propose a generalized framework for accelerated mirror descent (AMD) dynamics. A key contribution is the introduction of adaptive averaging, which adaptively computes weights to minimize the Lyapunov function, preserving the quadratic convergence rate of accelerated first-order methods in discrete-time. Numerical experiments demonstrate that adaptive averaging performs at least as well as, and often better than, existing heuristics like adaptive restarting, particularly in strongly convex settings.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Originality: The adaptive averaging heuristic is a promising and innovative approach to improving convergence rates. Its ability to preserve the Lyapunov function while adaptively adjusting weights is a significant advancement over static methods.
2. Theoretical Rigor: The paper provides a solid theoretical foundation, using Lyapunov functions to establish convergence guarantees. The sufficient conditions for weight functions are clearly derived and well-supported.
3. Practical Relevance: The connection between continuous-time dynamics and discrete-time algorithms is well-motivated, particularly given the resurgence of first-order methods in large-scale machine learning problems.
4. Empirical Validation: The numerical experiments are thorough, comparing adaptive averaging against established heuristics like gradient and speed restarting. The results convincingly demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in specific scenarios, such as strongly convex problems.
5. Clarity in Examples: The application of AMD to replicator dynamics is a compelling example, bridging optimization and evolutionary game theory.
Weaknesses:
1. Limited Scope of Experiments: While the experiments are insightful, they are restricted to low-dimensional settings (e.g., RÂ³) and a limited set of objective functions. Testing on higher-dimensional, real-world datasets would strengthen the empirical claims.
2. Comparative Analysis: Although adaptive averaging is shown to outperform restarting heuristics, the paper does not benchmark against other adaptive methods like Adam or Adagrad, which are widely used in practice.
3. Heuristic Nature: The adaptive averaging heuristic lacks theoretical guarantees for faster rates beyond quadratic convergence. This limits its theoretical impact, particularly for strongly convex functions.
4. Complexity of Implementation: The proposed heuristic introduces additional computational overhead due to the need for adaptive weight adjustments. A discussion on the trade-off between computational cost and performance gains would be beneficial.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:
- Pro: The paper presents a novel and theoretically grounded approach to improving convergence rates in constrained convex optimization. The adaptive averaging heuristic is both innovative and empirically validated, making it a valuable contribution to the field.
- Con: The empirical evaluation could be more comprehensive, and the heuristic lacks theoretical guarantees for faster rates in specific settings. Additionally, the computational overhead of adaptive averaging is not thoroughly analyzed.
Recommendation:
Overall, the paper is a strong contribution to the field of optimization and machine learning. While there are areas for improvement, particularly in empirical validation and theoretical guarantees, the novelty and potential impact of adaptive averaging justify its acceptance. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the noted weaknesses.
