The paper presents a theoretical analysis of the robustness and consistency properties of the robust k-means (RKM) algorithm, a variant of the classical k-means clustering method. The authors focus on two key aspects: the algorithm's robustness to outliers and its consistency under various structural assumptions. While the paper provides some interesting insights, there are several areas that require clarification and improvement.
Strengths:
1. Theoretical Contributions: The paper rigorously analyzes the robustness of RKM, showing that one outlier can break the algorithm for convex penalty functions \(f\lambda\), while two outliers suffice for non-convex \(f\lambda\). This highlights the limitations of RKM in handling arbitrary contamination.
2. Restricted Robustness: Under structural assumptions on well-clustered datasets, the authors establish a non-trivial breakdown point for RKM, which is a useful contribution for practical scenarios.
3. Consistency Analysis: The generalization of consistency results from convex to non-convex \(f_\lambda\) is a noteworthy extension, leveraging tools from Vapnik-Chervonenkis theory.
4. Comparative Experiments: The empirical comparison between RKM and trimmed k-means (TKM) provides some practical context, showing that both methods perform similarly under certain conditions.
Weaknesses:
1. Broader Appeal: RKM is not a widely established method in the machine learning community, which raises questions about the broader impact and relevance of the paper. The authors could strengthen the motivation by connecting RKM to more widely used clustering methods or applications.
2. Originality Concerns: Section 3.3 appears to primarily recap existing literature without presenting a formal theorem, which detracts from the originality of the work. The authors should clarify how their contributions differ from prior results.
3. Contradictory Claims: Theorem 2 seems to contradict the abstract's claim about non-asymptotic results, as the proof relies on asymptotic convergence arguments. This inconsistency needs to be addressed to avoid confusion.
4. Simulation Results: The experimental results lack clear conclusions, particularly regarding the comparison with TKM. While the authors report similar performance, they do not provide a detailed analysis of when and why one method might outperform the other.
5. Limited Generalization: The techniques used in the paper are specific to RKM and may not generalize easily to other clustering methods, limiting the broader applicability of the theoretical results.
Suggestions for Improvement:
- Clarify the contradiction between Theorem 2 and the abstract's claim about non-asymptotic results.
- Strengthen the experimental section by providing more detailed insights into the scenarios where RKM outperforms or underperforms compared to TKM.
- Address the originality concerns in Section 3.3 by explicitly stating how the results build upon or differ from prior work.
- Expand the discussion on the practical relevance of RKM, possibly by exploring connections to real-world applications or other robust clustering methods.
Recommendation:
While the paper provides valuable theoretical insights, its limited broader appeal, originality concerns, and lack of clarity in some sections reduce its impact. I recommend major revisions to address these issues before acceptance.
