This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of game-theoretical control by analyzing learning algorithms in smooth games and demonstrating their fast convergence under a novel "Low Approximate Regret" property. The integration of learning theory techniques with price of anarchy results is particularly noteworthy, as it bridges two important areas of research. The authors extend prior work by Syrgkanis et al. [28] in several meaningful ways, including relaxing the reliance on expected feedback, improving convergence speed by a factor of the number of players, and addressing dynamic population games with player churn. These advancements are supported by rigorous theoretical analysis and novel algorithmic contributions, such as a new bandit algorithm with improved regret bounds.
The paper's strengths lie in its originality and technical depth. The introduction of the Low Approximate Regret property is a compelling theoretical innovation, and the demonstration of its ubiquity across a wide range of algorithms (e.g., Hedge, Optimistic Hedge) is both practical and impactful. The extension of results to dynamic population games and bandit feedback settings further broadens the applicability of the work. Additionally, the authors' critique of the unrealistic expectation feedback assumption in prior work is well-argued, and their focus on realized feedback enhances the relevance of their findings to real-world scenarios.
However, the paper suffers from several weaknesses. The presentation is dense, with too much material packed into a limited space, which compromises clarity. Key definitions and motivations are not always well-articulated, making it challenging for readers to follow the narrative, especially those without specialist knowledge in the field. This lack of accessibility may limit the paper's appeal to the broader NIPS audience. Additionally, the title does not adequately reflect the paper's main contributions, such as the benefits of low approximate regret and its implications for fast convergence.
Arguments for acceptance:
1. The paper introduces a novel and impactful theoretical framework (Low Approximate Regret) with broad applicability.
2. It significantly advances the state of the art in smooth games and dynamic population games, addressing important limitations of prior work.
3. The integration of learning theory with price of anarchy results is both innovative and relevant to the field.
Arguments against acceptance:
1. The paper is overly dense and poorly organized, which hinders comprehension and accessibility.
2. It requires a high level of specialist knowledge, making it less suitable for a general NIPS audience.
3. The title does not clearly convey the paper's core contributions, potentially misleading readers.
Post-rebuttal suggestions: The authors should emphasize their main contribution—the benefits of low approximate regret—and revise the title to better reflect this focus. Additionally, they should streamline the presentation by reducing the breadth of topics covered and improving the clarity of definitions and motivations.
In conclusion, while the paper has significant merits and advances the field, its clarity and accessibility issues must be addressed for it to fully realize its potential impact.
