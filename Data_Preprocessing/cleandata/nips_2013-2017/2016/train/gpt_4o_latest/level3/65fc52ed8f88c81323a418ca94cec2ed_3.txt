The paper proposes an innovative unsupervised learning method for deep networks that addresses the challenges of exemplar-based similarity learning, particularly in scenarios with limited positive samples and unreliable initial relationships. The authors introduce a framework that classifies samples into compact cliques and optimizes batch partitioning to ensure mutually consistent relationships within batches. By iteratively refining a CNN using this clique-based approach, starting with HOG-LDA similarities, the method demonstrates improved performance in tasks like posture analysis and object classification.
Strengths:
1. Technical Soundness: The optimization problem in Section 2.3 is well-defined and addresses the transitivity issues in similarity relationships. The use of compact cliques to structure training batches is novel and technically compelling.
2. Iterative Refinement: The iterative process of refining similarities and updating the CNN is a robust mechanism for improving the quality of learned representations, as evidenced by the experimental results.
3. Experimental Validation: The paper provides meaningful comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating competitive performance in multiple benchmarks. The results on the Olympic Sports and Leeds Sports datasets highlight the method's ability to capture fine-grained similarity structures.
4. Practical Implications: The approach reduces computational costs compared to traditional pairwise or triplet-based methods, making it scalable for large datasets.
Weaknesses:
1. Ad-hoc Nature: The use of cliques, while effective, feels somewhat heuristic. The authors could explore whether raw samples could be directly used for batch assignments, as cliques appear to be an engineering workaround to reduce problem complexity.
2. Objective Framing: The optimization objective could be better tied to the overarching goal of handling unreliable initial similarities. Explicitly addressing how the method avoids incorporating incorrect relationships would strengthen the narrative.
3. Clarity Issues: Section 2.2 is overly terse and lacks sufficient references, which hinders reproducibility. A more detailed explanation of the clique construction process and its theoretical underpinnings would be beneficial.
4. Experimental Breakdown: The experiments do not isolate the contributions of individual pipeline components, such as the impact of clique clustering or alternative baselines like two-stream networks. This limits the interpretability of the results.
5. Validation Metrics: Relying on visualizations of merged RGB images to demonstrate semantic similarity is subjective. Objective metrics like cluster purity or silhouette scores would provide stronger validation.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The method addresses a challenging and relevant problem in unsupervised similarity learning.
- The proposed optimization framework and iterative refinement process are novel and technically sound.
- The experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing methods.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The method relies on heuristic design choices (e.g., cliques) that are not thoroughly justified or compared against simpler alternatives.
- The paper lacks clarity in critical sections, particularly in the clique construction and optimization details.
- The experimental analysis does not sufficiently disentangle the contributions of different components.
Recommendation:
Overall, the paper presents a promising approach with strong experimental results. However, the ad-hoc nature of some design choices and the lack of clarity in certain sections slightly undermine its impact. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions, focusing on improving clarity, providing additional baselines, and incorporating objective validation metrics.
