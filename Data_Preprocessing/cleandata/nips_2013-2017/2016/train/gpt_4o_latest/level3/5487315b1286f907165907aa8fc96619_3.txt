The paper presents a novel approach to unsupervised learning of structured predictors by introducing a two-layer model that leverages convex relaxation via sublinear constraints. This method addresses key challenges in learning latent structures, such as the intractability of bi-level optimization, by formulating a convex relaxation that ensures global optimality. The authors demonstrate the flexibility of their approach through applications to graph matching and linear chain models, both of which are supported by the total unimodularity property.
Strengths:
1. Technical Contribution: The paper makes a significant technical contribution by proposing a convex relaxation for two-layer models with latent structures. This is a novel and impactful approach, as it directly addresses the intractability of bi-level optimization, a long-standing challenge in the field.
2. Theoretical Rigor: The assumptions and analysis are well-articulated, with a solid mathematical foundation. The authors provide a detailed derivation of the convex relaxation and characterize the low-rank properties of the feasible region, which is a notable theoretical insight.
3. Empirical Validation: The experimental results on transliteration and image inpainting tasks demonstrate the utility and effectiveness of the proposed method. The comparison with state-of-the-art methods, such as CRF-AE and locally trained models, highlights the superiority of the proposed approach in terms of both accuracy and robustness.
4. Generality and Impact: The method is general and has the potential to influence a wide range of applications involving latent structures, such as natural language processing and computer vision.
Weaknesses:
1. Presentation: While the writing is generally clear, the introduction could be better connected to the proposed approach. Lines 41-45 are particularly unclear and would benefit from a concrete example to illustrate the motivation behind the method. Additionally, the connection to deep learning with structured prediction is weak and could be more thoroughly discussed.
2. Related Work: The paper does not adequately relate its method to existing latent structured prediction approaches, such as hidden CRFs and latent structured SVMs. Highlighting the key differences would strengthen the positioning of the work.
3. Experimental Clarity: The performance of the proposed approach under the experimental setting of [12] is unclear, and there is ambiguity about whether the authors implemented [12] correctly. This raises concerns about the validity of the comparative results.
4. Implementation Details: The description of the optimization algorithm and implementation is somewhat dense and could be made more accessible to readers unfamiliar with SDP relaxations.
Recommendation:
The paper is technically sound, novel, and addresses an important problem in machine learning. However, improvements in presentation, clarity, and connection to related work are needed. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the identified weaknesses.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Novel and impactful technical contribution.
- Strong theoretical foundation and empirical validation.
- General applicability to diverse latent structure problems.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Weak connection to related work.
- Lack of clarity in some parts of the introduction and experimental setup.
- Ambiguity in the implementation of comparative baselines.
Overall, the paper makes a valuable contribution to the field and is well-suited for publication at the conference.
