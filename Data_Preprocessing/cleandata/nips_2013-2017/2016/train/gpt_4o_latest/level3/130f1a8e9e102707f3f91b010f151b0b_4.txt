The paper introduces a novel method, Smooth Sparse Online Dictionary Learning (Smooth-SODL), which combines Sobolev (Laplacian) and L1 regularization to analyze fMRI data. The approach aims to extract sparse and spatially smooth functional components, addressing the need for structured and interpretable decompositions in neuroimaging. By extending the Sparse Online Dictionary Learning (SODL) framework of Mairal et al. (2010), the authors incorporate spatial regularization at a relatively minor computational cost. The method is evaluated on task fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project, demonstrating improvements in interpretability, stability, and the ability to capture inter-subject variability compared to traditional methods like CanICA and unstructured SODL.
Strengths:
1. Originality: The integration of Sobolev regularization into the online dictionary-learning framework is a novel contribution, enabling the extraction of spatially structured components. This is a meaningful extension of prior work and addresses a critical gap in neuroimaging analysis.
2. Scalability: The method is computationally efficient, scaling well to large datasets, which is crucial for modern neuroimaging studies.
3. Interpretability: The proposed approach produces more interpretable and denoised dictionary atoms compared to competing methods, as demonstrated qualitatively and quantitatively.
4. Comprehensive Evaluation: The paper evaluates the method across multiple metrics, including explained variance, stability, and behavioral prediction, providing a well-rounded assessment of its performance.
Weaknesses:
1. Incremental Contribution: While the addition of spatial regularization is novel, the improvement over simpler methods such as SODL is modest. The paper does not convincingly demonstrate that the proposed method significantly advances the state of the art.
2. Clarity and Presentation: The manuscript is poorly organized and contains draft comments, making it difficult to follow. Key concepts, such as the choice of hyperparameters and the impact of spatial regularization, are not explained clearly. The presentation of results is tedious and occasionally confusing.
3. Insufficient Explanation of Improvements: The paper lacks a thorough discussion of why the proposed method outperforms others in certain metrics. For example, the mechanisms behind the improved stability and behavioral prediction performance are not adequately explored.
4. Limited Significance: While the method shows some advantages, its practical impact on the field remains unclear. The improvements in explained variance and behavioral prediction, though present, are incremental and may not justify the added complexity.
Recommendation:
The paper presents a technically sound and moderately original contribution, but its incremental nature and lack of clarity reduce its overall impact. For acceptance, the authors should:
- Improve the manuscript's organization and address draft comments.
- Provide a deeper analysis of the observed improvements and their implications.
- Clarify the practical significance of the method in advancing neuroimaging research.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Novel combination of spatial and sparsity constraints.
- Computational efficiency and scalability.
- Improved interpretability of results.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Incremental improvement over existing methods.
- Poor clarity and rushed presentation.
- Insufficient discussion of the method's broader significance.
Overall, the paper has potential but requires substantial revisions to meet the standards of the conference.
