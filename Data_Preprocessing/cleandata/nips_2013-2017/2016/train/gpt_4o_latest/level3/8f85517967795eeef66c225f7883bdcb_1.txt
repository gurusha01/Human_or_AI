The paper introduces a novel approach to inference in cooperative graphical models, a rich family of distributions that extend beyond traditional low-treewidth, pairwise, or log-supermodular models. By leveraging the polyhedral structure of submodular functions and combining it with variational inference techniques, the authors derive both upper and lower bounds on the partition function. The key innovations include linear bounds on the submodular function to transform it into low-order factor terms and variational bounds on the resulting Markov Random Field (MRF). These techniques yield rigorous bounds on the original MRF's partition function, which are optimized using methods such as tree-reweighted belief propagation (TRWBP), semidefinite programming (SDP), and mean-field algorithms.
Strengths:
1. Technical Soundness: The paper is technically robust, with well-grounded theoretical derivations and strong connections to prior work. The authors clearly situate their contributions within the context of existing methods, such as TRWBP, SDP relaxations, and MAP perturbations, while highlighting the novelty of their approach.
2. Clarity and Organization: The paper is well-written and logically structured, providing sufficient detail for an expert reader to reproduce the results. The use of illustrative examples, such as synthetic experiments and a real-world image segmentation task, enhances understanding.
3. Originality: The combination of submodular function approximations with variational inference techniques is novel. The proposed methods extend the applicability of variational inference to higher-order models that were previously intractable.
4. Connections to Prior Work: The paper establishes strong links to foundational work in variational inference, submodular optimization, and graphical models, citing relevant literature and clearly differentiating its contributions.
Weaknesses:
1. Unclear Utility of Bounds: While the paper focuses on deriving bounds for the partition function, the experiments primarily evaluate pseudomarginals rather than the partition function itself. This raises questions about the practical utility of the bounds, particularly for applications where the partition function is critical.
2. Experimental Limitations: The experimental results, though promising, are somewhat limited in scope. For instance, the evaluation of partition function bounds is indirect, and the scalability of the proposed methods is not thoroughly benchmarked against state-of-the-art techniques.
3. Technical Suggestion: The use of the marginal polytope form of TRW could be computationally expensive. Replacing it with decomposition-based methods (e.g., spanning trees or dual decomposition) might improve efficiency, and this avenue could be explored further.
Pro and Con Arguments:
Pro:
- The paper advances the state of the art in inference for higher-order graphical models.
- The methods are theoretically sound and scalable to real-world applications, as demonstrated by the image segmentation task.
- The connections to existing work are well-explained, making the contributions clear and impactful.
Con:
- The practical relevance of the partition function bounds is not convincingly demonstrated.
- The experiments focus more on pseudomarginals, leaving the evaluation of the partition function bounds underexplored.
- Computational efficiency could be improved with alternative formulations.
Recommendation:
The paper is a significant contribution to the field of probabilistic graphical models and variational inference. However, the authors should clarify the utility of their partition function bounds and address the computational efficiency concerns. Pending these revisions, I recommend acceptance with minor revisions.
