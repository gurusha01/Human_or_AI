The paper presents a novel approach to solving contextual semibandit problems by leveraging supervised learning oracles, introducing two algorithms—VCEE for known weight mappings and EELS for unknown weights. The authors provide theoretical regret bounds for both algorithms and demonstrate their empirical performance on large-scale search datasets. This work addresses a significant and challenging problem, particularly in domains like recommendation systems, where understanding the relationship between individual actions and overall rewards is crucial.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Significance: The paper tackles an important problem in online decision-making with partial feedback, extending the contextual bandit framework to semibandits. The introduction of EELS for unknown weights is particularly innovative, addressing a previously unexplored setting.
2. Theoretical Contributions: The regret bounds for both algorithms are rigorously derived and represent state-of-the-art performance for computationally efficient methods. The authors also provide a detailed comparison with existing approaches, highlighting the advantages of their methods.
3. Empirical Validation: The experimental results on real-world learning-to-rank datasets (MSLR and Yahoo!) are comprehensive. VCEE consistently outperforms baseline methods like ε-GREEDY and LINUCB when using richer policy classes, demonstrating the practical utility of the proposed approach.
4. Balanced Discussion: The authors acknowledge the limitations of their work, such as the suboptimal dependence on \( T \) for EELS and the challenges of structured action spaces for VCEE. This transparency strengthens the credibility of the paper.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity: The explanation of the contextual semibandit problem, particularly in the introduction, is dense and requires multiple readings to fully grasp. Simplifying or rephrasing key concepts could make the paper more accessible to a broader audience.
2. Empirical Scope: While the experiments convincingly demonstrate the superiority of VCEE, the evaluation of EELS is absent. Including experiments for EELS, even on synthetic data, would strengthen the empirical validation of the paper.
3. Assumptions: The assumption that all rankings are valid in the unknown weights setting may limit the applicability of EELS in some real-world scenarios. A discussion on how this assumption could be relaxed would be valuable.
Recommendation:
The paper makes a strong theoretical and empirical contribution to the field of contextual semibandits, advancing the state of the art in both known and unknown weight settings. Despite some clarity issues and the lack of empirical evaluation for EELS, the work is highly relevant and impactful. I recommend acceptance, with minor revisions to improve the clarity of the problem formulation and to address the absence of EELS experiments.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Significant theoretical advancements with rigorous regret analysis.
- Novel algorithmic contributions addressing both known and unknown weight settings.
- Strong empirical results demonstrating practical utility.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Unclear explanation of the problem setup, which could hinder accessibility.
- Lack of empirical evaluation for EELS.
In conclusion, the paper is a valuable contribution to the field and aligns well with the conference's focus on advancing machine learning research.
