The paper proposes an extension of the Bidirectional Monte Carlo (BDMC) framework to assess the reliability and efficiency of MCMC-based posterior inference algorithms. The authors introduce a method, Bounding Divergences with Reverse Annealing (BREAD), which uses BDMC to bound the symmetrized KL divergence (Jeffreys divergence) between approximate posterior samples and the true posterior distribution. The methodology is integrated into two probabilistic programming languages, WebPPL and Stan, and is validated on several models and datasets. The authors also propose a heuristic for approximating posterior samples using synthetic data, enabling the application of BREAD to real-world datasets.
Strengths
1. Novelty and Relevance: The paper addresses a critical challenge in probabilistic inference—evaluating the quality of MCMC samples—by extending BDMC to measure posterior accuracy. This is a meaningful contribution to the field of Bayesian inference and probabilistic programming.
2. Integration and Validation: The integration of BREAD into WebPPL and Stan demonstrates practical applicability, and the experiments validate its utility in diagnosing inference quality.
3. Scientific Insights: The method provides insights into the trade-offs between different model representations, showcasing its potential to guide algorithmic and modeling decisions.
4. Debugging Utility: The authors demonstrate how BREAD can identify implementation bugs, highlighting its potential as a diagnostic tool for probabilistic programming systems.
Weaknesses
1. Reliance on Strong Assumptions: The method assumes access to a representative hyperparameter value (\(\eta_{real}\)) and that synthetic data posteriors have similar convergence properties to the true posterior. These assumptions are problematic, especially in cases of model misspecification or poorly chosen priors.
2. Limited Applicability: The approach is tailored to AIS and SMC samplers, which restricts its generalizability to other MCMC methods. Additionally, its reliance on exact posterior samples limits its use to simulated or synthetic data.
3. Insufficient Evidence for General Applicability: While the method performs well on simple examples, the experiments lack diversity and do not convincingly demonstrate its robustness across complex, multimodal, or high-dimensional posteriors.
4. Comparison with Existing Methods: Although the authors critique existing diagnostic tools, they do not provide direct evidence that BREAD outperforms these methods in challenging scenarios, such as multimodal distributions or low-expressivity cases.
5. Experimental Gaps: The lack of simulations comparing BREAD with standard diagnostic tools weakens the paper's claims about its advantages.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance
Pros:
- The paper tackles an important problem in MCMC diagnostics and proposes a novel extension of BDMC.
- The integration into widely used probabilistic programming languages enhances its practical relevance.
- The method provides valuable insights into model representation and debugging.
Cons:
- The reliance on strong assumptions and synthetic data undermines the method's appeal for real-world applications.
- The experimental validation is limited in scope and does not address concerns about general applicability.
- The lack of comparative analysis with existing tools leaves the claimed advantages unsubstantiated.
Recommendation
While the paper presents an interesting and potentially impactful methodology, its reliance on restrictive assumptions and the limited scope of its validation reduce its overall significance. Strengthening the experimental evaluation, particularly by comparing BREAD with standard diagnostic tools and testing on more complex models, would significantly improve the paper. For now, I recommend weak rejection, with encouragement to address the outlined weaknesses in a future submission.
