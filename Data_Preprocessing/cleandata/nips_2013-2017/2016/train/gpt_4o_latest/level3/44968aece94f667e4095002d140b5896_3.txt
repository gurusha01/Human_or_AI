Review
This paper investigates the problem of repeated posted-price auctions with patient buyers, where the seller has an unlimited supply of a single good and buyers have private valuations and patience levels. The novelty lies in modeling strategic buyers who wait for a specified time window to accept the best price, with the seller committing to announcing prices in advance. The authors propose an algorithm based on EXP3 that achieves a regret rate of \(O(\tau^{1/3} T^{2/3})\) with respect to the best fixed price in hindsight and prove that the \(T^{2/3}\) term is optimal via a non-trivial lower bound reduction from multi-armed bandits (MAB) with switching costs.
The paper makes a significant contribution to the field by extending the study of posted-price mechanisms to settings with strategic buyers who exhibit patience. The connection to MAB with switching costs is particularly compelling and adds depth to the analysis. The lower bound proof is intricate and demonstrates the inherent difficulty of achieving lower regret in this setting. Furthermore, the simplicity of the proposed model makes it a promising framework for understanding strategic buyer behavior, and the results are likely to inspire further research in this area.
However, the paper suffers from several weaknesses. First, the clarity of the presentation is a major issue. There are numerous typos, grammatical errors, and inconsistent notations that make the paper difficult to follow. For example, the notation for buyer patience and the feedback model is not introduced systematically, leading to confusion in the technical sections. Additionally, Section 4.1, which discusses the reduction from switching cost regret, is poorly organized. Theorem 3 and its connection to Algorithm A' should be presented in a more structured manner to improve readability. The authors should also provide more intuition behind the construction of the lower bound, as the current explanation is overly terse.
In terms of originality, the paper builds on prior work by Kleinberg and Leighton (2016) but extends it to the more complex setting of patient buyers. The reduction to MAB with switching costs is novel and well-motivated. However, the related work section could be expanded to include a more comprehensive discussion of prior research in strategic pricing and regret minimization.
The significance of the results is clear, as the paper establishes tight regret bounds and highlights the impact of buyer patience on the seller's performance. The findings are likely to be of interest to researchers in online learning, auction theory, and algorithmic game theory.
Strengths:
1. Novel and well-motivated model of strategic buyers with patience.
2. Tight upper and lower bounds for regret, with a surprising connection to MAB with switching costs.
3. Simple yet effective algorithm that achieves sub-linear regret.
4. Potential for significant impact on future research in strategic pricing.
Weaknesses:
1. Poor clarity due to typos, inconsistent notation, and lack of organization.
2. Insufficient intuition and explanation for the lower bound construction.
3. Related work section could be more comprehensive.
Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Reorganize Section 4.1 to align Theorem 3 with the construction of Algorithm A'.
2. Address clarity issues by proofreading for typos and improving notation consistency.
3. Expand the related work section to better contextualize the contributions.
4. Provide more intuition and detailed explanations for the lower bound proof.
Recommendation:
The paper makes a valuable contribution to the field and addresses an important problem with a novel approach. However, the clarity issues and organizational weaknesses detract from its overall quality. With revisions to improve readability and presentation, the paper would be a strong candidate for acceptance. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions.
