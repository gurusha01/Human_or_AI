This paper introduces the first linearly convergent algorithms for solving convex-concave saddle-point problems using variance reduction techniques such as SVRG and SAGA. The authors extend these techniques to address challenges specific to saddle-point problems, where traditional convex minimization analysis does not apply. The key innovation lies in leveraging monotone operator theory to prove convergence, which broadens the applicability of the methods to include variational inequality problems. This novel proof technique, which interprets saddle-point problems as finding zeros of monotone operators, is a significant contribution and has potential for wider adoption in related fields.
The paper also addresses practical challenges in machine learning, such as handling non-separable loss functions and regularizers, by formulating them as saddle-point problems. The proposed algorithms incorporate non-uniform sampling, which improves both theoretical guarantees and empirical performance. Additionally, the authors simplify proofs for existing algorithms like forward-backward splitting and its stochastic variants, making the theoretical contributions more accessible.
Strengths:
1. Originality: The work is highly original, introducing the first linearly convergent algorithms for saddle-point problems using variance reduction. The proof technique based on monotone operators is novel and widely applicable.
2. Significance: The results are important for both theoretical and practical advancements in optimization and machine learning, particularly for problems involving non-separable structures.
3. Clarity: The paper is generally well-written and organized, with a clear exposition of the problem, contributions, and experimental results.
4. Quality: The theoretical analysis is rigorous, and the experimental results convincingly demonstrate the superiority of the proposed methods over existing approaches.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity of Proofs: While the theoretical contributions are strong, the paper could benefit from including a proof sketch or additional details to make the monotone operator-based analysis more accessible to readers.
2. Non-Uniform Sampling: The role of non-uniform sampling in non-bilinear problems is not fully clarified, leaving some ambiguity about its general applicability.
3. Experimental Details: The paper lacks sufficient discussion on step size settings in experiments and the practical implications of non-uniform sampling for saddle-point problems.
4. Minor Issues: There are minor typographical errors on lines 78 and 121, which should be corrected.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper addresses a significant gap in the literature by extending variance reduction techniques to saddle-point problems.
- The theoretical contributions are novel, rigorous, and have broad applicability.
- The experimental results demonstrate clear improvements over existing methods.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The lack of detailed explanations for the proof technique and non-uniform sampling may hinder reproducibility and understanding.
- Some experimental details are underexplored, which could limit the practical impact of the work.
Recommendation: Accept with minor revisions. The paper makes a substantial contribution to the field, but addressing the clarity issues and providing additional experimental details would strengthen its impact.
