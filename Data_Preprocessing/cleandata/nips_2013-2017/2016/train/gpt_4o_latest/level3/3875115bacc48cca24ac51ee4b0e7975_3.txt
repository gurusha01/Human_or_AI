This paper addresses two fundamental questions about the population log-likelihood of Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) with isotropic components and known scales. Specifically, it disproves Srebro's [2007] conjecture that local maxima in the population likelihood are always global maxima in well-specified GMMs, even with infinite data. The authors construct examples of bad local maxima that are arbitrarily worse than the global optima and demonstrate that random initialization of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is highly likely to converge to suboptimal critical points as the number of components increases. These findings highlight the necessity of careful initialization for EM, even in favorable settings.
The paper's strengths lie in its rigorous theoretical contributions. The authors resolve a long-standing open question by constructing explicit counterexamples to Srebro's conjecture, providing valuable insights into the geometry of the likelihood surface for GMMs. Theorem 1 is particularly impactful, as it establishes the existence of arbitrarily bad local maxima under specific configurations. Theorem 2 extends this by showing that random initialization almost surely leads to suboptimal solutions, emphasizing the practical limitations of EM. The authors also prove that the first-order EM algorithm avoids strict saddle points, attributing its failure to bad local maxima rather than saddle points. These results are significant for both theoretical understanding and practical application of GMMs.
However, the paper has notable weaknesses. The practical relevance of the results is questionable, as the likelihood of encountering the "bad" configurations described in Theorem 1 in real-world datasets is not quantified. While the authors focus on worst-case scenarios, it remains unclear how often these arise in practice. Theorem 2 assumes random initialization, but in real-world applications, data-driven initialization methods (e.g., k-means) are often used, which may mitigate the issues highlighted. Furthermore, the example on lines 74-81 is unclear and does not convincingly support Srebro's conjecture. The necessity of requirement (1) in L233-235 is also unclear and warrants further explanation. Finally, the paper contains several minor typos and phrasing issues, which detract from its overall clarity.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, with well-supported claims and rigorous proofs. However, its clarity could be improved, particularly in the examples and explanations of key results. The originality is strong, as the paper resolves an open problem and introduces novel constructions and techniques. The significance is moderate, as the results are primarily theoretical and their practical implications are limited without further exploration of real-world relevance.
Arguments for acceptance: Resolves a long-standing open question, rigorous theoretical contributions, and novel insights into GMM likelihood surfaces.
Arguments against acceptance: Limited practical relevance, unclear examples, and insufficient exploration of real-world scenarios.
In summary, while the paper makes a strong theoretical contribution, its practical impact is limited. Acceptance should depend on the conference's emphasis on theoretical versus applied work.
