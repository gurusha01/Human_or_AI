The paper introduces a large-scale online dictionary learning framework, termed Smooth-SODL, which incorporates Sobolev (Laplacian) regularization to extract structured and sparse components from brain imaging data. The authors aim to address the challenge of defining regions of interest (ROIs) in neuroimaging by leveraging inter-subject variability and imposing spatial smoothness on dictionary atoms. While the method builds on the Sparse Online Dictionary Learning (SODL) framework by Mairal et al. (2010), it adds a Laplacian penalty to encourage spatially compact and smooth dictionary atoms. The proposed approach is evaluated on task fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and compared against baseline methods, including SODL and CanICA.
Strengths:  
1. Scalability: The online nature of the algorithm allows it to handle massive datasets, a critical requirement for modern neuroimaging studies.  
2. Improved Interpretability: The addition of the Laplacian penalty results in dictionary atoms that are more spatially structured and interpretable compared to unstructured methods like SODL and dense methods like CanICA.  
3. Comprehensive Evaluation: The authors provide a thorough comparison of Smooth-SODL with competing methods across multiple metrics, including explained variance, stability, and behavioral prediction.  
4. Practical Contributions: The method demonstrates utility in small, medium, and large-scale data regimes, making it broadly applicable.  
Weaknesses:  
1. Weak Novelty: The work primarily extends the framework of Mairal et al. (2010) with the addition of a Laplacian regularization term. While this is a meaningful extension, the level of innovation is limited.  
2. Unclear Motivation for Sobolev Regularization: The paper does not adequately explain the choice of Sobolev regularization or its specific impact on sparsity. The term "structured" remains vaguely defined, and its implications for the results are not thoroughly analyzed.  
3. Equation Error: There appears to be an error in Eq. (1), which should be corrected to [V^1, V^2, ..., V^r]^T. This oversight raises concerns about the rigor of the mathematical formulation.  
4. Insufficient Justification for l2 Norm: The use of the l2 norm for the code regularization in Eq. (2) is not well-motivated, especially given the potential benefits of l1 regularization for sparsity.  
5. Clarity Issues: The paper contains numerous typos and unclear references, such as "line 146," which detract from its readability and professionalism.  
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:  
- Pro: The method is scalable, practical, and demonstrates improved interpretability of results compared to baseline methods. It addresses a relevant problem in neuroimaging and provides a detailed experimental evaluation.  
- Con: The contribution is incremental, with limited novelty beyond the addition of Sobolev regularization. The lack of clarity in motivation, mathematical rigor, and language refinement undermines its overall quality.  
Recommendation: Weak Accept. While the paper offers a useful extension to an established framework and demonstrates practical utility, the limited novelty and clarity issues need to be addressed. The authors should provide a stronger justification for their design choices, correct the identified errors, and refine the manuscript for better readability.
