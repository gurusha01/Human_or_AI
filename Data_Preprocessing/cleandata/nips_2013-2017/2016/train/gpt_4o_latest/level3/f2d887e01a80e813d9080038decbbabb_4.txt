Review of the Paper
This paper addresses the challenging problem of unsupervised risk estimation, proposing a novel framework that relies on conditional independence assumptions and the method of moments. The authors extend prior work by generalizing to continuous losses and structured outputs, such as conditional random fields (CRFs), and by introducing a gradient-based learning algorithm for unsupervised domain adaptation. The paper is technically ambitious and provides a significant contribution to the field, particularly in its novel application of tensor decomposition to unsupervised risk estimation.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Originality: The application of tensor decomposition to unsupervised risk estimation is innovative, and the extension to continuous losses and structured outputs represents a meaningful advancement over prior work. The paper also bridges connections between domain adaptation, semi-supervised learning, and multi-view learning.
2. Theoretical Contributions: The authors provide rigorous theoretical guarantees, including sample complexity bounds and error rates, under the proposed framework. The use of the method of moments to avoid fully specifying the loss distribution is particularly elegant.
3. Practical Relevance: The proposed framework has practical implications for unsupervised domain adaptation and semi-supervised learning, especially in scenarios where labeled data is scarce or unavailable. The experiments on a modified MNIST dataset demonstrate the utility of the approach in estimating risk and adapting models to new distributions.
4. Clarity in Algorithm Design: The paper clearly outlines the estimation and learning algorithms, providing sufficient detail for reproducibility. The inclusion of extensions to CRFs and exponential losses further strengthens the generality of the approach.
Weaknesses:
1. Assumption (i) on Factorized Distributions: While the authors claim that the 3-view assumption is weak, it is, in fact, quite restrictive. For example, requiring block-diagonal covariance matrices in Gaussian settings is a strong assumption. The paper would benefit from better motivation for this assumption, potentially by explicitly linking it to multi-view learning earlier in the text.
2. Assumption (ii) on Separable Loss Functions: The exclusion of commonly used nonlinear losses, such as hinge and logistic losses, limits the applicability of the framework. While the authors propose a separable hinge loss, this deviation from standard losses is not sufficiently justified.
3. Lack of Real-World Applications: The experiments focus on a synthetic modification of MNIST, which, while illustrative, does not convincingly demonstrate the framework's applicability to real-world problems. Including a real-world application example in the introduction or experiments would strengthen the paper's impact.
4. Complexity of Tensor Decomposition: While tensor decomposition is a powerful tool, its computational complexity may limit scalability to high-dimensional or large-scale datasets. The authors briefly address this through random projections but do not provide empirical evidence of scalability.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper makes a significant theoretical contribution by extending unsupervised risk estimation to continuous losses and structured outputs.
- The use of tensor decomposition is novel and addresses a challenging problem in a principled manner.
- The framework has potential applications in domain adaptation and semi-supervised learning, which are critical areas in machine learning.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The strong independence assumptions (3-view) may limit the framework's applicability in practical scenarios.
- The lack of real-world experiments raises questions about the generalizability of the proposed methods.
- The exclusion of standard nonlinear losses reduces the flexibility of the framework.
Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Provide stronger motivation for the 3-view assumption, perhaps by linking it more explicitly to multi-view learning earlier in the paper.
2. Justify the use of separable losses more thoroughly, especially in the context of multi-view learning.
3. Include a real-world application example to demonstrate the practical utility of the framework.
4. Discuss the computational scalability of tensor decomposition in greater detail, including empirical results on larger datasets.
Conclusion:
This paper presents a novel and theoretically sound approach to unsupervised risk estimation, with significant extensions to prior work. However, the restrictive assumptions and lack of real-world validation temper its practical impact. With additional justification of assumptions and real-world experiments, this work has the potential to make a strong contribution to the field. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions.
