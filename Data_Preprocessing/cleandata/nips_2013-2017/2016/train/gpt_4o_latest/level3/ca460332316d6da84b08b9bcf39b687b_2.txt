The paper introduces a novel graph partitioning method, termed the Product Cut, which is inspired by the classical Normalized Cut optimization but diverges significantly in its formulation and properties. The authors reformulate the problem as a convex maximization program, enabling an exact continuous relaxation of the discrete problem. This is a key innovation, as it allows for a theoretically grounded and computationally efficient approach to multi-way graph partitioning. The proposed method is supported by a monotonic algorithm based on sequential linear programming, with a randomized variant to enhance exploration and simplicity. The authors also incorporate a tailored Algebraic Multigrid (AMG) technique to optimize computational efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in terms of cluster purity on several real-world datasets, including text and image data.
Strengths:
1. Theoretical Contributions: The convex maximization formulation is a significant innovation, providing a rigorous mathematical framework for solving the multi-way graph partitioning problem. The exact relaxation ensures that the continuous and discrete solutions coincide, which is a notable strength.
2. Algorithmic Design: The monotonic algorithm and its randomized variant are well-motivated. The use of AMG for efficient computation further enhances the practicality of the method.
3. Experimental Rigor: The experimental evaluation is thorough, comparing the proposed method against several state-of-the-art algorithms on diverse datasets. The results convincingly demonstrate superior cluster purity and computational efficiency.
4. Clarity and Organization: The paper is well-written and logically structured, making it accessible to readers. The theoretical results are clearly presented, and the experimental methodology is robust.
5. Significance: The method addresses a fundamental problem in graph partitioning and demonstrates clear utility in real-world applications. Its superior stability and performance properties make it a valuable contribution to the field.
Weaknesses:
1. Comparison with Normalized Cut: While the comparison with the Normalized Cut is meaningful, additional analysis on more complex or noisy graph structures would strengthen the claims about the Product Cut's stability and robustness.
2. Scalability: Although the method is computationally efficient for medium-scale graphs, its scalability to very large graphs (e.g., with millions of nodes) is not explicitly addressed.
3. Parameter Sensitivity: The choice of the parameter α and the rate of constraint enforcement (∆sk) in the randomized algorithm could benefit from further discussion or sensitivity analysis.
