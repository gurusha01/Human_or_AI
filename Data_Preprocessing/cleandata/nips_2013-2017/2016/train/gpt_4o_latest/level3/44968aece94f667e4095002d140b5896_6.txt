Review of the Paper
This paper investigates a dynamic pricing model where a seller adjusts prices over time in response to buyers with uncertain "patience" levels. The authors propose an algorithm that achieves an additive regret of \(O(T^{2/3})\), which matches a proven lower bound of \(\Omega(T^{2/3})\) for the worst-case scenario. The key novelty lies in the seller's lack of prior knowledge about buyers' patience levels, which are inferred indirectly through their purchasing behavior. The paper also introduces a mechanism where the seller commits to future prices, simplifying buyer decision-making and making their behavior more tractable for analysis.
Strengths
1. Novelty and Contribution: The paper addresses an important and underexplored problem in dynamic pricing with strategic buyers. The focus on adversarial settings and the sharp regret bounds are significant contributions to the field. The results extend prior work (e.g., Kleinberg and Leighton) by incorporating buyer patience into the model and demonstrating its impact on regret rates.
2. Technical Rigor: The theoretical analysis is thorough, with well-defined proofs for both the upper and lower bounds. The use of multi-armed bandit algorithms (e.g., EXP3) and the introduction of epochs to control price fluctuations are innovative and well-justified.
3. Clarity of Results: The distinction between the \(O(T^{2/3})\) regret for patient buyers and the \(\Theta(T^{1/2})\) regret for non-patient buyers is clearly articulated, highlighting the challenges introduced by strategic behavior.
Weaknesses
1. Unclear Justification of Buyer Behavior: The paper assumes that buyers act optimally in response to the seller's algorithm, but this assumption is not sufficiently justified. It is unclear why buyers would always behave in this manner, especially in adversarial settings. A deeper exploration of buyer behavior under the proposed pricing mechanism is needed.
2. Equilibrium Analysis: The paper does not adequately describe the equilibrium dynamics under the proposed algorithm. While the seller's strategy is well-defined, the interplay between strategic buyers and the seller is not fully explored. This omission limits the paper's ability to address the strategic interactions inherent in the model.
3. Practical Implications: While the theoretical contributions are strong, the practical applicability of the results is not discussed in detail. For instance, how realistic is the assumption that the seller can commit to future prices? Additionally, the impact of discretizing prices on real-world implementations is not addressed.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance
Pros:
- Strong theoretical contributions with sharp regret bounds.
- Novel extension of prior work to include buyer patience.
- Rigorous and technically sound analysis.
Cons:
- Insufficient justification for buyer behavior assumptions.
- Lack of equilibrium analysis to account for strategic interactions.
- Limited discussion of practical implications.
Recommendation
This paper makes a strong theoretical contribution to the field of dynamic pricing and regret minimization. However, it would benefit from a more thorough exploration of buyer behavior and equilibrium dynamics, as well as a discussion of practical considerations. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions, contingent on addressing these concerns.
