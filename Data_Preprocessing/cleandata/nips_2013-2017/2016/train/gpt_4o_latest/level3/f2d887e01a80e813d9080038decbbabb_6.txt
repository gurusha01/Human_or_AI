The paper presents a novel approach for unsupervised risk estimation using the method of moments, leveraging conditional independence assumptions to estimate classifier error on test distributions that may differ significantly from the training distribution. The authors extend this framework to semi-supervised learning, combining unlabeled data with minimal labeled data to improve performance. The paper employs advanced tools like tensor decomposition and demonstrates significant improvements in both risk estimation and unsupervised domain adaptation. The approach is applied to structured output settings, such as conditional random fields, and supports a wide range of loss functions, including log and exponential losses. 
Strengths
1. Technical Novelty: The use of the method of moments for unsupervised risk estimation is innovative, particularly in the context of estimating test error without assuming proximity between train and test distributions. The extension to structured outputs and gradient-based learning is a significant contribution.
2. Theoretical Rigor: The authors provide strong theoretical guarantees, including sample complexity bounds and proofs of correctness under the 3-view assumption. The use of tensor decomposition to solve moment equations is well-motivated and technically sound.
3. Practical Relevance: The method addresses a challenging problem in unsupervised learning and domain adaptation, offering a principled way to estimate risk and adapt models without relying on restrictive assumptions like covariate shift.
4. Empirical Validation: The experiments on a modified MNIST dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in both risk estimation and unsupervised domain adaptation. The results highlight the robustness of the approach, even with limited labeled data.
Weaknesses
1. Strong Assumptions: The 3-view conditional independence assumption is a significant limitation. While the authors acknowledge this, it may restrict the applicability of the method to real-world datasets where such independence is unlikely to hold.
2. Scalability Concerns: The reliance on tensor decomposition, particularly for high-dimensional parameter spaces, raises questions about computational efficiency and scalability to larger datasets or more complex models.
3. Limited Practical Examples: The experiments are conducted on a synthetic variant of MNIST, which may not fully capture the complexities of real-world scenarios. Additional experiments on more diverse datasets would strengthen the paper.
4. Seed Model Dependency: The reliance on a seed model for unsupervised learning, while practical, introduces an additional dependency that may not always be feasible in purely unsupervised settings.
Arguments for Acceptance
- The paper addresses an important and underexplored problem in unsupervised learning and domain adaptation.
- It introduces a novel and theoretically grounded approach with promising experimental results.
- The work opens up new avenues for research, particularly in extending the method to relax the 3-view assumption or handle more complex dependencies.
Arguments Against Acceptance
- The strong generative assumption (3-view independence) limits the generalizability of the method.
- The scalability and computational feasibility of the approach are not thoroughly addressed.
- The experimental validation is somewhat limited in scope and may not generalize to more complex datasets.
Recommendation
Overall, this paper makes a significant theoretical contribution to unsupervised learning and risk estimation. While the assumptions and scalability concerns are notable limitations, the novelty and potential impact of the work justify its acceptance. I recommend acceptance, with the suggestion that the authors further explore relaxing the 3-view assumption and provide additional empirical validation in future work.
