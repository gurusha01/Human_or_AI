The paper introduces a novel class of probabilistic models termed "cooperative graphical models," which extend the representational power of traditional pairwise graphical models by incorporating a submodular disagreement variable into the energy function. This innovation enables the modeling of higher-order interactions while retaining enough structure to allow for efficient inference. The authors derive variational lower and upper bounds for the partition function by leveraging the polyhedral properties of submodular functions and adapting existing methods such as mean-field approximation, semidefinite programming (SDP), and belief propagation (BP) to this new setting. Algorithms like Frank-Wolfe and projected gradient descent (PGD) are proposed to compute these bounds, and experimental results demonstrate the superiority of cooperative graphical models over pairwise models in tasks like image segmentation.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Scope: The introduction of cooperative graphical models is a significant contribution, as it generalizes pairwise models and log-supermodular models, enabling more expressive representations of variable interactions.
2. Theoretical Rigor: The derivation of variational bounds and the adaptation of classical inference methods to cooperative models are thorough and well-grounded in theory. The use of submodular polytopes (B(f) and U(f)) is particularly innovative.
3. Practical Algorithms: The proposed algorithms (Frank-Wolfe, PGD, BP) are computationally efficient and scalable, as evidenced by their application to real-world image segmentation tasks.
4. Experimental Validation: The experiments convincingly demonstrate the advantages of cooperative models in synthetic and real-world scenarios. The qualitative results in image segmentation highlight the practical utility of the proposed approach.
Weaknesses:
1. Looseness of Bounds: While the variational bounds are rigorously derived, the consecutive bounding process (cooperative models to pairwise models) introduces potential looseness, which may limit the tightness of the results.
2. Intractability of Lower Bound: The optimization over U(f) for the lower bound is intractable, and the block coordinate descent algorithm proposed may yield suboptimal results.
3. Generality of Techniques: While the method for constructing B(f) and U(f) is generic, its applicability to broader classes of functions or distributions remains unclear and warrants further discussion.
4. Dependence on Submodularity: Although the optimization objectives appear independent of submodularity, the algorithms rely heavily on it. This dependency may restrict the applicability of the approach to non-submodular settings.
5. Clarity and Presentation: The manuscript contains several minor typos and formatting issues, which detract from its readability. Additionally, some technical details (e.g., smoothness conditions for convergence) could benefit from clearer exposition.
Recommendation:
The paper makes a strong theoretical and practical contribution to the field of probabilistic graphical models. Its novelty, rigorous methodology, and practical relevance outweigh the identified weaknesses. However, addressing the looseness of bounds, improving the clarity of presentation, and discussing the broader applicability of the techniques would strengthen the paper further.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Significant theoretical advancement in graphical models.
- Practical utility demonstrated in image segmentation tasks.
- Rigorous adaptation of classical inference methods to a novel setting.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Potential looseness in variational bounds.
- Limited discussion on the generality of the proposed techniques.
- Minor issues with clarity and presentation.
Overall, I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the clarity and generality concerns.
