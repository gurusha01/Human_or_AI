The paper presents a novel leverage scores-based sampling method for alternating least squares (ALS) in tensor CP decomposition, addressing computational challenges in large-scale tensor analytics. The key contribution is an efficient computation of leverage scores for Khatri-Rao products (KRPs) using an upper bound derived from the scores of constituent matrices. This approach enables sublinear time per iteration for ALS, which is a significant advancement for handling large tensors. The authors demonstrate the method's efficacy through experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, such as the Amazon review tensor, achieving notable speedups without compromising accuracy.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Contribution: The paper introduces a novel and practical method for leveraging statistical properties of KRPs to accelerate ALS. The derivation of leverage score bounds and their application to CP decomposition is a meaningful contribution to tensor analytics.
2. Empirical Validation: The experimental results are compelling, showing significant speedups over existing methods while maintaining comparable accuracy. The evaluation on a large-scale real-world dataset highlights the scalability of the proposed method.
3. Potential Impact: The proposed SPALS algorithm has broad applicability in tensor decomposition tasks, particularly for large-scale and sparse datasets, making it relevant for both academia and industry.
4. Clarity in Algorithm Design: The algorithmic details, including the sampling strategy and its theoretical guarantees, are well-articulated, making it easier for practitioners to implement.
Weaknesses:
1. Theoretical Justification: The paper does not adequately justify why leverage-based sampling is preferable over other randomized methods with lower sample complexity. This omission weakens the theoretical foundation of the proposed approach.
2. Sample Complexity Derivation: The derivation for the sample complexity \( m = \Theta(R^2 \log n / \epsilon^2) \) is missing, leaving a gap in the theoretical analysis.
3. Missing Definitions: Key terms and symbols, such as matrices \( C \) and \( D \) in Lemma E.2 and Corollary E.3, and the connection between \(\rho(x_B)\) and \(\|\mathcal{T} - [A,B,C]\|^2\), are not clearly defined, which may confuse readers.
4. Runtime Analysis: The claimed runtime of \(\tilde{O}(nR^3)\) per iteration is not rigorously analyzed, leaving the computational efficiency claims partially unsupported.
5. Clarity and Notation: The paper suffers from inconsistent notation (e.g., 'r', 'R', and 'p') and incomplete statements (e.g., lines 46, 164, 165, and 444). These issues detract from the overall readability and professionalism of the manuscript.
6. Minor Typos: The manuscript contains minor typographical errors (e.g., "the the" on line 5, "SPASL" on line 52) that should be corrected.
Recommendation:
While the paper makes a valuable contribution to tensor decomposition, the weaknesses in theoretical justification, clarity, and presentation need to be addressed. Specifically, the authors should:
- Provide a detailed comparison with other randomized sampling methods, including theoretical and empirical justifications.
- Include the derivation for sample complexity and a rigorous runtime analysis.
- Clarify missing definitions and ensure consistent notation throughout the paper.
- Address incomplete statements and correct typographical errors.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The proposed method is novel and addresses a significant computational bottleneck in tensor decomposition.
- The experimental results demonstrate practical utility and scalability, which are critical for real-world applications.
- The method has the potential to inspire further research in randomized tensor algorithms.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Theoretical gaps and missing derivations undermine the rigor of the work.
- Clarity issues, including inconsistent notation and incomplete statements, hinder accessibility for readers.
- The paper requires additional polish to meet the standards of a top-tier conference.
In conclusion, the paper is a promising contribution but requires revisions to address the identified weaknesses. With improvements, it could make a strong addition to the conference.
