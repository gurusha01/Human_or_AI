The paper introduces TrailBlazer, a novel sampling algorithm for planning in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), with a focus on sample efficiency and theoretical guarantees. The key contribution lies in its ability to handle both finite and countably infinite state transitions, providing problem-dependent sample complexity bounds. This work builds on prior approaches, notably those by Busoniu and Munos (2012) and Kearns et al. (1999), while introducing new techniques for balancing confidence intervals and managing uncertainties. The theoretical analysis is rigorous, and the algorithm is positioned as a natural extension of Monte Carlo sampling to stochastic control problems.
Strengths:
1. Theoretical Contributions: The paper provides a strong theoretical foundation, including PAC (Probably Approximately Correct) guarantees and problem-dependent sample complexity bounds. The results improve upon prior worst-case guarantees and offer polynomial complexity for specific cases, even when the state space is infinite.
2. Novelty and Generalization: TrailBlazer extends prior work by addressing MDPs with countably infinite state transitions, a significant generalization. The introduction of problem-specific measures like \( \kappa \) and \( d \) to quantify near-optimal nodes and path difficulty is innovative.
3. Practical Relevance: The algorithm is computationally efficient and easy to implement, making it a practical tool for real-world applications where generative models are costly to query.
4. Clarity of Intuition: The paper makes commendable efforts to explain the intuition behind the algorithm's design, particularly its focus on refining only necessary paths and balancing bias-variance trade-offs.
Weaknesses:
1. Presentation Issues: While the paper is generally clear, some sections, particularly the introduction of the algorithm, could benefit from reorganization for better flow. For instance, the semantics of key parameters like \( \eta \) and \( \lambda \) should be clarified earlier.
2. Parameter Choices: The discussion on parameter choices, such as \( kl/(1-\eta)^2 \) and \( \eta \max(Ul\epsilon) \), is insufficiently detailed. Providing practical guidelines or sensitivity analyses would enhance the paper's utility.
3. Redundant Proofs: The MAX node component resembles action elimination in best-arm identification, suggesting that some proofs could be replaced by references to existing results, streamlining the presentation.
4. Complexity Interpretation: The complexity measures \( \kappa \) and \( d \), while insightful, are challenging to interpret intuitively. This limitation is acknowledged but remains a barrier for broader accessibility.
5. Unsubstantiated Claims: The claim about extending the algorithm to general MDPs with loops and merged states is not well-supported and should either be elaborated or removed.
6. Minor Issues: Typos, missing definitions (e.g., \( \delta \)), and small errors (e.g., "output" instead of "outputs") detract from the overall polish.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper addresses a significant problem in MDP planning and advances the state of the art with theoretical and practical contributions.
- The algorithm's ability to handle infinite state spaces and provide problem-dependent guarantees is a notable achievement.
- The work is relevant to the NeurIPS community, particularly in reinforcement learning and planning.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Presentation issues and insufficient discussion of parameter choices may hinder reproducibility and practical adoption.
- Some claims, such as extensions to general MDPs, lack sufficient justification.
Recommendation:
I recommend acceptance with minor revisions. The paper makes a meaningful contribution to MDP planning, but addressing the presentation issues and providing more clarity on parameters and claims would significantly enhance its impact.
