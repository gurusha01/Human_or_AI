This paper introduces CMICOT, a novel filter-based feature selection method designed to address the challenge of identifying high-order feature interactionsâ€”a limitation of existing mutual information (MI)-based sequential forward selection (SFS) techniques. CMICOT formalizes a saddle point optimization problem to capture interactions among multiple features and mitigates the computational and sample complexity issues inherent in such high-dimensional tasks through a two-stage greedy search and binary feature representation. The method is empirically validated on synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating its ability to detect higher-order interactions and outperform state-of-the-art feature selection methods in many cases.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Contribution: CMICOT fills a critical gap in MI-based SFS methods by enabling the detection of interactions among more than three features, a significant advancement over existing methods like RelaxMRMR, IWFS, and RCDFS. The use of binary representatives and a two-stage greedy approximation is innovative and effectively addresses computational and sample complexity challenges.
2. Theoretical Foundation: The paper provides a rigorous formalization of the proposed method, including proofs and algorithmic details, which enhance its credibility and reproducibility.
3. Clarity and Writing: The paper is well-written and clearly situates CMICOT within the context of existing literature. The arguments are logically structured, and the methodology is explained in detail.
4. Empirical Validation: The experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate CMICOT's ability to detect high-order feature interactions and its competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods. The inclusion of multiple classifiers (NBC, kNN, AdaBoost) and datasets adds robustness to the evaluation.
Weaknesses:
1. Evaluation Limitations: While the results are promising, the evaluation in the main paper is aggregated, making it difficult to discern the specific conditions under which CMICOT excels or underperforms. The appendix contains additional results, but these should have been more prominently integrated into the main text.
2. Figure 1 Issues: The lack of a y-axis in Figure 1 hinders the interpretation of performance gaps, reducing the clarity of the presented results.
3. Scalability and Practicality: While the authors claim linear computational complexity with respect to the SFS iteration, the method's scalability to very large datasets or extremely high-dimensional feature spaces remains unclear. This could have been better addressed through additional experiments or discussion.
4. Classifier Dependence: The method's advantage is most pronounced for classifiers like kNN and AdaBoost that exploit high-order interactions, but its performance on NBC (which does not) is comparable to simpler methods. This limits the generalizability of the claimed benefits.
Recommendation:
Pros for Acceptance:
- CMICOT addresses a significant bottleneck in feature selection, advancing the state of the art in detecting high-order feature interactions.
- Theoretical rigor and methodological clarity make it a strong scientific contribution.
- Empirical results demonstrate its practical utility across diverse datasets and classifiers.
Cons for Acceptance:
- Limited detail in the main paper's evaluation and unclear scalability to very large datasets.
- Performance gains are classifier-dependent, which may limit broader applicability.
Overall, CMICOT represents a meaningful contribution to feature selection research, and its strengths outweigh its weaknesses. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions, particularly addressing the clarity of results presentation (e.g., Figure 1) and providing more detailed insights into the method's scalability and practical limitations.
