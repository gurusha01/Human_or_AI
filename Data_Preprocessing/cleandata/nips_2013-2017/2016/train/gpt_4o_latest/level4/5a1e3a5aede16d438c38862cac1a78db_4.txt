This paper establishes support recovery guarantees for the sparse regression problem when the data term is an \( l_p \) norm with \( p \in \{1, 2, \infty\} \). The guarantees are derived based on the constrained formulation. The work addresses a highly intriguing question, which is tackled comprehensively through rigorous theoretical analysis and well-designed experiments.
