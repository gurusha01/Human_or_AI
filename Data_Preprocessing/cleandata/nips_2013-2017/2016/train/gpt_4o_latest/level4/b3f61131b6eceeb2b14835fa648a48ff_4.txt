The authors investigate repeated games where players employ regret-minimizing algorithms to select their actions, extending recent work in meaningful ways. Notably, they rely solely on "realized feedback" rather than the expectation over other players' actionsâ€”a much more practical and realistic framework. The paper also includes some valuable extensions and insights related to bandit feedback and dynamic population games. This is a well-written and compelling paper, with the problem clearly articulated and the advancements over prior work (SAL15 and LST16) being conceptually noteworthy, even though the technical methods appear somewhat similar. Specifically, the shift from "expected feedback" to "realized feedback" is a significant contribution, as it aligns the problem more closely with real-world scenarios. However, I would have appreciated an experimental comparison with SAL15 and LST16, as it remains unclear whether the absence of this assumption impacts performance in practice. For instance, if "expected feedback" is available, would it be preferable to use it?  Thank you for addressing this in your rebuttal. Please ensure that your empirical results are included in the final version of the paper.  Overall, this is a strong contribution that will likely appeal to researchers in game theory.
