The authors claim that quantum computing has the potential to (a) significantly accelerate perceptron training and (b) enhance performance bounds. However, I find the paper challenging to understand, including its motivation and the conclusions derived from the study. For example, the authors assert that quantum computing can substantially speed up standard perceptron training. However, I struggle to see how this justifies labeling the perceptron as a "quantum perceptron" or how it might "lead to a deeper understanding of ... our ability to learn," as the authors suggest.
