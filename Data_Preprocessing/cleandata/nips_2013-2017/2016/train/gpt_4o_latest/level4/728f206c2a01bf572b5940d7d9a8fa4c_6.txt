The paper proposes augmenting the standard maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) objective for training a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) with a smooth Wasserstein distance. The Wasserstein distance depends on a chosen metric in the data space, which encourages the model to assign probability mass to regions close to the data according to this metric. This approach leads to the generation of more plausible samples, though potentially at the cost of reduced coverage. The manuscript is well-written and easy to follow. The clustering or shrinkage behavior demonstrated in the experiments is compelling and could have significant utility if the method can be scaled to address problems of practical relevance. In this regard, it would be helpful to provide details about the runtime of the experiments and, more broadly, to include information about the computational complexity of the steps involved. Designing objective functions that promote the generation of realistic samples is a prominent topic in the variational autoencoder (VAE) and generative adversarial network (GAN) communities, and this work offers a valuable contribution in a similar vein for RBMs. Exploring potential applications of this approach to those methods could also be a fruitful direction for future research.
