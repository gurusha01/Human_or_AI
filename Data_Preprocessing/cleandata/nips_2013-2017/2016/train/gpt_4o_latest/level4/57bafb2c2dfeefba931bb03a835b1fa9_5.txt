The authors investigate the problem of community recovery within the stochastic block model and demonstrate that semidefinite programming can recover communities with characteristics (e.g., smaller sizes) that were not achievable in prior analyses. I found this paper to be an engaging read:  
* The paper is well-structured and straightforward to follow.  
* The theoretical result showing the possibility of recovering communities smaller than sqrt(log n) using convex optimization is particularly compelling.  
* The paper includes numerous examples that help clarify the theoretical findings. Table 1 is especially useful for identifying the applicable theorem across different regimes.  
Theorem 1 (and 2) guarantees that, under certain regularity conditions, \hat{Y} and Y^ are equivalent. However, since \hat{Y} can be continuous while Y^ is a binary matrix, is there a projection or thresholding step applied at the end of the process? Additionally, it is unclear over which set the maximization in (2.4) is performedâ€”please provide clarification.
