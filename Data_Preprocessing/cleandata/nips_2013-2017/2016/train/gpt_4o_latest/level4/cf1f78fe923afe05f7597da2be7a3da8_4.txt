This paper introduces a novel data embedding technique designed to preserve the geometry of the data as defined by a Riemannian metric (inner product on the tensor space at each point). The authors then propose a gradient descent-based method to solve the associated optimization problem, given that the objective function is non-convex. However, the paper asserts—without sufficient motivation or intuition—that the Riemannian metric is superior for geometry preservation compared to the embeddings utilized in prior works [3, 4, 12, 19, 20]. Furthermore, while the authors claim their approach differs from previous methods by avoiding a one-shot mapping, they fail to acknowledge existing methods like t-SNE, which also rely on gradient descent to derive embeddings. 
The experimental evaluation is limited, as the authors do not test their method on a sufficiently diverse set of large-scale datasets to demonstrate its superiority over existing approaches or its practicality in terms of runtime. 
Figure 1: The initialization used in the experiments already closely resembles the true shape of the data. It is unclear how the algorithm would perform with less favorable initial conditions. Additionally, the plot of MSE/loss versus sigma is poorly constructed. If runtime constraints are not an issue, the authors should include A) intervals for MSE and loss derived from multiple randomized initializations, and B) a denser sampling of sigma values to provide a clearer trend.
Figure 2: The figure is poorly formatted, making it difficult to interpret. For instance, it is not immediately evident that two datasets share the same embeddings. The labeling scheme (e.g., top-left/top-right) is confusing; the figure would benefit from distinct sections labeled A-G, with corresponding references in the legend. Moreover, the line plots lack publication-quality standards, as they require more densely sampled points along the X-axis or replicates of each condition to provide confidence intervals. The observed trends—such as the oscillations in the plots—may simply be artifacts of individual runs.
Figure 3: The analysis presented here is incomplete. While the authors apply their method to a real dataset and report superficial improvements, they fail to provide a physics-based analysis to substantiate that their method enhances the ability of scientists to interpret or analyze this type of data effectively.
