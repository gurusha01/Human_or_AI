The authors introduce a concept termed "Givens capacity," which quantifies the complexity of a unitary matrix. They establish bounds on the Givens capacity for a parametrized family of unitary matrices introduced in prior work. Based on this, they argue that the parametrization spans only a proper subset of the space of unitary matrices. To address this limitation, they propose an alternative approach that operates over the entire set of unitary matrices and demonstrate its effectiveness on certain examples, where it outperforms the parametrized method. While the experimental results of the paper appear more impactful than the theoretical contributions, they are accompanied by notable concerns. 
First, the original motivation for the parametrization in equation (3) was to reduce the number of parameters, thereby balancing representation power and computational efficiency. In contrast, the proposed method not only introduces significantly more parameters but also seemingly relies on matrix inversion for computation. The authors briefly discuss computational efficiency in lines 178–181, claiming that matrix inversion is faster. However, this suggests a potential issue with the Theano implementation, as matrix inversion typically has a computational complexity of O(N³), whereas the reduced-capacity method should have a complexity of O(N log N) with smaller constants, implying that the latter should be much faster.
Second, the paper lacks a direct, controlled comparison of the methods. Different optimization algorithms are used—RMSprop for some methods and SGD for others—without any justification for these choices. This raises the possibility that the observed performance differences are attributable to the choice of optimization method rather than the methods themselves. While I am not claiming this to be the case, the authors have not provided evidence to rule out this confounding factor.
Lastly, a minor issue: the authors introduce Stiefel manifolds, but this seems unnecessary. They only consider the case of square matrices, which coincides with unitary matrices. It appears that the inclusion of Stiefel manifolds is motivated by a desire to apply a technique from a paper addressing the more general Stiefel manifolds. However, since this generality is not required for the current work, the introduction of Stiefel manifolds seems unwarranted.
