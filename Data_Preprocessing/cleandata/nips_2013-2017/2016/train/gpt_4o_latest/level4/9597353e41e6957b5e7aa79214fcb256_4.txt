The paper addresses a clustering problem where there is a margin separating points from different clusters, and an oracle is available to verify whether any two points belong to the same cluster. The authors propose a probabilistic polynomial-time algorithm for this problem that uses a bounded number of oracle queries. They also demonstrate that the k-means objective is NP-hard for instances with gamma margins below approximately 1.84 and establish a lower bound on the number of oracle queries required for such cases to be solvable in polynomial time. 
The writing and notation are occasionally unclear or unnecessarily complex. There are minor grammatical errors, and some sections are difficult to follow. Additionally, the manuscript appears not to have undergone thorough spell-checking. The algorithm employs an intriguing use of binary search, but a poor choice of estimator for the cluster center could lead to either false negatives or false positives. This potential issue is not discussed in the paper, and I believe it warrants acknowledgment. 
The algorithm's description on page 4 differs slightly from the detailed algorithm on page 5, primarily due to confusing phrasing. The description suggests that points are selected until one cluster becomes sufficiently large, whereas the algorithm specifies selecting a fixed number of points to ensure this condition is met. While this distinction is minor, clarifying the description would improve readability. The authors claim that the algorithm is guaranteed to succeed when the gamma condition is satisfied, but I am not entirely convinced by the current presentation. Specifically, the proof of Lemma 5 assumes that the difference between the true and sample centers is always less than \(\epsilon \times \text{radius}\), which is only probabilistically established in Lemma 6. This suggests that Lemma 5 should also be probabilistic. The results in Theorem 7 are stated to hold with probability \(1-\delta\), which is weaker than the "guaranteed success" claimed in the abstract and introduction. If the stronger guarantee does follow from the results, the details should be made more explicit.
Section 4.1 is somewhat terse, though it appears to rely on supplementary material. A more concise presentation in the "proceedings" version, avoiding excessive notation that is only referenced in the supplementary content, would enhance clarity. On a positive note, the proof of the query lower bound is elegant. 
Overall, the paper requires editing and additional details to clarify the results. The main result appears weaker than claimed (probabilistic rather than guaranteed, unless I have overlooked something), and Lemmas 5 and 6 need to be reordered and elaborated upon.
