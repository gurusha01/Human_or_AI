This paper demonstrates that the EM algorithm converges to the global minimum when used for mean estimation in mixture-of-Gaussian distributions. The result is significant and represents a valuable contribution to our understanding of the EM algorithm. Unfortunately, I began this review too late to thoroughly examine the proofs in detail; I plan to review them carefully in the coming days. To the best of my knowledge, the result appears to be highly novel. While I cannot yet provide detailed feedback on the proof, it seems intricate and nontrivial. The result is elegant, and both the writing and presentation are excellent. Reading this paper has been an enjoyable experience.
