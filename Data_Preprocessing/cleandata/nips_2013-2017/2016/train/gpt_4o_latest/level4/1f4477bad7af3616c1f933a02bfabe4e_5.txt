The paper introduces and formalizes a specific type of feedforward neural network for which a unique global optimizer can be determined. As part of this contribution, it presents an algorithm to find the global optimizer, which is shown to have a linear convergence rate. The mathematical derivations are insightful, though certain aspects remain unclear to me. 
1. In Theorem 3, the computation relies on first-order derivatives as demonstrated in the inequalities, whereas Theorem 4 involves second-order derivatives. What is the reasoning behind this shift?  
2. The network's design appears to treat the last layer differently from the hidden layers. Since \( u \) is a matrix representing the parameters connected to the hidden layer, is the gradient with respect to \( u \) in \( G^\Phi \) (Equation 3) simply the gradient with respect to the vectorized form of \( u \)? Similar ambiguities arise in other parts of the paper, such as when \( u \) is constrained to lie within a ball.  
One concern (or am I misunderstanding something?) is the rationale for maximizing the 1-norm of the connection parameters in Equation (2). Typically, in neural network models, weight decay is used to minimize the 1-norm. It seems that the inclusion of an arbitrarily small \( \epsilon \) in Equation (2) is intended solely to ensure that the gradient remains strictly positive, placing it in \( V_{++} \). While this is necessary for the theoretical proof, it does not appear to be well-justified in the context of practical neural networks. What ensures that there are no free parameters here? The model requires all input data to be non-negative and enforces strictly positive weights (not even allowing zeros), which results in cumulative addition. How practical is this design in real-world scenarios?  
In the experiments, the proposed neural network is compared to SVM, presumably because both methods guarantee a global optimizer. However, in practical applications, does this type of neural network offer any distinct advantages over other, more commonly used neural networks (e.g., those employing ReLU)?
