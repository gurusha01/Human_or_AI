The paper presents an extension of the word mover's distance by incorporating supervision to learn weights for the distance metric. It includes a thorough and comprehensive experimental evaluation. I am pleased to see the approach of word mover's distance being advanced through the use of discriminative training to develop a domain-specific metric. The proposed method is conceptually sound, clearly articulated, and provides an appropriate level of detail. The experiments are highly extensive, covering multiple classification datasets and a diverse range of baseline methods and features. The proposed approach significantly outperforms all baselines by a substantial margin. This is a strong and well-executed paper that I would be delighted to see presented at NIPS.
