The paper falls outside the scope of my expertise for a thorough evaluation. The sole intriguing aspect is its application to fast k-means clustering. The authors provide a provable guarantee for accelerated learning rates. However, the absence of experimental results is a significant limitation. This makes it challenging to assess the practical utility of the theorem. In particular, how can the assumption in Theorem 4.1 be validated?
