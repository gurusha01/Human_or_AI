This paper employs the recently developed bidirectional Monte Carlo approach to assess MCMC-based posterior inference techniques. The authors investigate lower bounds on the KL-divergence between the true posterior and the approximate distribution. The proposed method is implemented within WebPPL and Stan. Overall, this is a well-executed paper. The authors leverage a recent advancement, namely bidirectional Monte Carlo, to study MCMC-based posterior inference. The problem addressed is timely and significant, and the proposed idea is compelling. I recommend accepting this paper.
