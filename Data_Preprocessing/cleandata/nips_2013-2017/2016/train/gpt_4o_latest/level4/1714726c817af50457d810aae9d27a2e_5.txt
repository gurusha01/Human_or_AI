The paper investigates accelerated descent dynamics in the context of constrained convex optimization. Through the use of a Lyapunov function, the authors successfully establish the desired convergence rate. Additionally, they propose an adaptive averaging heuristic aimed at enhancing the convergence rate of the Lyapunov function. Experimental results indicate that adaptive averaging performs on par with or surpasses adaptive restarting in terms of effectiveness. While my expertise in this area is limited, the concept of leveraging adaptive averaging to achieve faster convergence in constrained convex optimization appears intriguing and holds promise.
