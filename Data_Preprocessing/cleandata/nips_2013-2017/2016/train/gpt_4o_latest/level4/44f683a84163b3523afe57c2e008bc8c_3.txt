The authors introduce a latent representation for voxelized volumes that is applicable to both generative and discriminative tasks. This representation is also connected to cropped 2D images. The proposed system builds on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs, Goodfellow et al. 2014), but replaces the generative network with a VAE encoder, following the approach of Larsen et al. 2016. Unlike the 2D image focus of the aforementioned works, this manuscript centers on 3D volumetric data. The method is evaluated through qualitative and quantitative experiments on 3D object generation, 3D object classification, and 3D reconstruction from RGB images, achieving strong results compared to the state of the art. The paper effectively applies the system from Larsen 2016 to 3D volumetric data. Prior work on volumetric data, which is well-discussed in the manuscript, primarily focuses on combining existing parts or creating latent spaces using class labels or simple voxel-space losses. Here, the authors leverage VAE and GAN research (Larsen 2016) and adapt convolutional layers to volumetric ones, enhancing state-of-the-art performance on volumetric data. The experiments highlight three compelling applications: object generation, 3D object classification, and 3D reconstruction from RGB images. Additionally, the analysis of the latent representation in Section 5 is noteworthy.
On the downside, the paper lacks significant technical novelty, as it primarily applies an existing framework (Larsen 2016) to volumetric data by substituting 2D convolutional layers with volumetric ones. While the manuscript is relatively clear—partly due to its substantial overlap with prior work—there are a few areas where clarity could be improved:  
- In the object classification experiment (Section 4.2), the authors use the learned representation as features for classification, but the specific classifier employed is not mentioned. Is the same classifier used across all algorithms?  
- Given the emphasis on the probabilistic nature of the latent space, it would be helpful to report the likelihood of the interpolations shown in Figure 6. For instance, how likely are interpolations that result in broken components, such as missing arms or legs in chairs?  
- The idea of analyzing the effect of altering specific dimensions in the latent representation or examining neuron activations based on input volumes is promising, but the paper presents too few results. A more comprehensive analysis, potentially presented in a video format, would be valuable.
In summary, this paper successfully adapts and applies established ideas from 2D image research to 3D volumetric data, advancing the state of the art in this domain. However, the limited technical novelty constrains the potential impact of the work.
