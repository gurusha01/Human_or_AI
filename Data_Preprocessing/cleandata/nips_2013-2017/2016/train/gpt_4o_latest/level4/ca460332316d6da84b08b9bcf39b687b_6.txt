The paper under review introduces a novel measurement for multi-way graph partitioning problems, referred to as the product cut, and further presents an algorithm designed to address the product cut problem. The authors assert that the proposed algorithm achieves significantly better performance compared to existing algorithms. The problem addressed in the paper is highly intriguing and offers fresh insights into clustering, which, to the best of my knowledge, are novel. The overall presentation of the paper is commendable, with the content being accessible even to non-experts.  
Detailed comments:  
- The runtime analysis of the proposed algorithm is absent. Including a lemma that summarizes the algorithm's runtime and performance would be beneficial. Additionally, on Line 235, you mention that the algorithm typically runs significantly faster than other algorithms. Is this assertion based solely on experimental observations? A more rigorous analysis is required to substantiate this claim.  
- The parameter Purity is used to evaluate the performance of the algorithms. A discussion justifying the choice of this parameter would be helpful. Furthermore, the definition of this parameter is unclear. Does it correspond to the number of misclassified nodes? If so, why does a higher purity value provide a better guarantee for the algorithm's performance?  
- Line 224: There is a typo in the phrase "By and large."
