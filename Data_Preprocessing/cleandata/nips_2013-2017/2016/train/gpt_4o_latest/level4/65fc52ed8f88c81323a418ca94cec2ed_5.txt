Starting with a basic similarity measure, the paper aims to enhance similarity quality through an iterative process. In each iteration, the method first forms cliques (small groups of similar samples) and then selects optimal training batches by solving an optimization problem. These training batches are subsequently used to train a CNN. The proposed approach is primarily evaluated on human pose similarity, where it achieves competitive results. Additionally, the authors include a similarity test on the PASCAL VOC dataset. While the technical aspects (formulations) are sound, the problem introduction and the explanation of the steps lack clarity. It would be beneficial for the authors to provide a clear overarching view of the problem and then elaborate on each step in detail. The method feels somewhat ad-hoc, as it involves multiple components whose individual contributions are not thoroughly analyzed. The selection of each component could be better justified by comparing it with simpler alternatives. For example, it would be insightful to compare random batch assignments (or another simpler method) with the proposed batch assignment on at least one task. The experimental results demonstrate some promising outcomes for unsupervised pose similarity learning.
