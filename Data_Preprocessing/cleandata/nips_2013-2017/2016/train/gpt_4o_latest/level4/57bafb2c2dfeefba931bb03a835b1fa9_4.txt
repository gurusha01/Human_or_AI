This paper examines the conditions for recoverability of the heterogeneous stochastic block model under more general settings, removing restrictions on the number and sizes of communities, their growth with the number of nodes, and the connectivity probabilities within or between communities. The author(s) present results addressing both the statistical and computational aspects of recoverability. The examples provided in the paper help clarify the abstract theorems, offering valuable insights. Additionally, the author(s) identify specific parameter configurations that can be efficiently recovered using semidefinite programming, which could serve as practical guidance for its application. The problem formulation and results are clearly articulated and easy to follow.  
1. Section 2.3 Partial Observations: The authors assume that "the entries of the A (adjacency matrix) have been observed independently." Could this assumption be overly strong in practical scenarios? It would be helpful if the authors could discuss how their conclusions might change if this assumption were relaxed.  
2. In Table 1, Ex. 1 and Ex. 2 are equally important but exhibit different recoverability outcomes under Thm. 1 and Thm. 2. It would be beneficial if the authors could explicitly list the differences between these two examples in the table for better clarity.
