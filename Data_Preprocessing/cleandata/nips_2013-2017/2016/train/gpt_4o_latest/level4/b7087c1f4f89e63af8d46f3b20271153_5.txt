This paper proposes a practical solution to the problem of dimensionality reduction for very large-scale sparse matrices, offering performance guarantees. The approach relies on a weighted subset of the data and is independent of both the data's size and dimensionality. Additionally, the authors present an efficient algorithm for performing this reduction, with provable bounds on both size and running time. The paper also describes a system implementing this dimensionality reduction algorithm and demonstrates its application by computing latent semantic analysis (LSA) on the entire English Wikipedia. The work is interesting and addresses a relevant problem. However, given the abundance of algorithms for large-scale data, the authors should compare and discuss their approach in the context of related work. 
The writing of the paper is difficult to follow and requires significant language improvement. There are numerous typos, and the meaning of symbols, such as `||` in equation (2)-(i,ii), should be clearly defined. Additionally, equation (3) is hard to interpret and needs further clarification. The distance between A and S appears to align with the concept of manifold distance, as discussed in [R1], and the authors should cite this work: [R1] Wang, Ruiping, et al. "Manifold-manifold distance with application to face recognition based on image set." CVPR, 2008. Lastly, the formatting of the references is inconsistent and should be carefully reviewed. 
Overall, while the paper demonstrates novelty, substantial improvements in the language, clarity, and presentation are necessary.
