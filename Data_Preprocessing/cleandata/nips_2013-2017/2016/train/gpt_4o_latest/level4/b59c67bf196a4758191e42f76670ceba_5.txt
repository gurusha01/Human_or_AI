This paper introduces a novel deep learning model for unsupervised domain adaptation. The proposed approach replaces the conventional softmax layer and loss function with a specially designed domain-adaptive objective. This objective jointly addresses transduction and adaptation. By optimizing the proposed objective, the method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both digit and office benchmark datasets. The paper is well-structured and clearly written. While the contribution appears incremental, the experimental results are compelling.  
1. Does the alternating solver converge? How stable is the algorithm, and how consistent are the results? Can the same result be reproduced consistently?  
2. Line 166: It is unclear why Equation (3) is convex when the feature functions are convex, as the feature function appears in the negative term of Equation (3).  
3. The related work section seems insufficient. The most recent related work cited is [10] from ICML 2015. Additionally, [5], [19], and [32] are included in the experiments but are not discussed in the related work section. These works should also be reviewed in detail.  
4. The writing could be improved, particularly in the introduction and related work sections. In the related work section, many sentences are fragmented by references, which affects readability.
