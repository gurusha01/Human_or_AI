The manuscript establishes lower bounds for regression and classification in the limited attributes observation model. Specifically, it sharpens existing lower bounds for the squared loss in this context and introduces novel lower bounds for the absolute loss and hinge loss (in classification). Additionally, the paper presents an algorithm that achieves loss bounds up to a certain precision limit. The results are sufficiently novel, and the manuscript is well-written. The authors focus on the limited attributes observation model, where the learning algorithm has access to only a subset of attributes, and the goal is to control the excess loss relative to the Bayes optimal. The manuscript improves upon existing lower bounds in this setting and addresses some open questions. 
The contributions of the paper are noteworthy: the authors provide tighter lower bounds for the squared loss, derive novel lower bounds for the absolute loss and hinge loss (in classification), and propose an algorithm that achieves a loss bound up to a specific precision limit, matching the lower bound up to a polynomial factor in dimensionality (for regression). The results and proof techniques demonstrate sufficient novelty, and the manuscript is well-written. I recommend acceptance. However, the results in the classification setting appear less compelling, as there is an exponential gap between the lower bound and the guaranteed precision limits of the proposed algorithm for hinge loss. Additionally, Theorem 5 is only briefly stated in Section 2.1, and the authors do not provide further commentary on it. The nature of Theorem 5 differs from Theorems 1 and 3 (for regression) and appears weaker, as it establishes the existence of some epsilon rather than explicitly quantifying the precision limits. I encourage the authors to address this point and consider including an explanation in the main paper regarding the challenges of formulating a stronger result, if applicable. (I have reviewed the author response.)
