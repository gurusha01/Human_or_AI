Copulas are a standard approach for describing the dependency structure of both discrete and continuous random variables by decoupling it from the characterization of marginal distributions. While parametric copulas, such as Frank or Gaussian copulas, exist for multivariate random variables, these models can be restrictive. In this work, the author(s) introduced a method for constructing a joint model by iteratively combining bivariate copula models. The proposed sampling method and fitting procedure were adapted from established techniques. The author(s) validated their model using simulated mixture signals comprising count and continuous data. They further applied their approach to simulated LFP and spike count data generated via a virtual electrode recording toolbox, demonstrating that the dependency modeling significantly impacts the mutual information between neural activity and stimulus conditions. Recently, several researchers have begun employing copulas to model mixture signals of count and continuous data in neuroscience. This manuscript offers a practical and scalable method for analyzing larger datasets, such as those involving multiple neurons and LFPs, by iteratively performing pairwise analyses. Although the descriptions are intricate, the core concept is straightforward and easy to comprehend. It would be beneficial if the author(s) could include an intuitive visualization of the tree structure mentioned in lines 105â€“109. Below, I outline questions that arose while reviewing this manuscript, which I hope will assist the author(s) in further refining their work:  
* This method relies on pairwise analysis, which may overlook higher-order dependencies among signals. If this is the case, how significant is the loss of higher-order dependency information? If quantifying this is challenging, the author(s) could provide a discussion of this limitation in the manuscript.  
* Gaussian copulas are arguably the simplest models for constructing multivariate dependencies. It would be valuable if the author(s) compared the performance of their vine copula model with that of a Gaussian copula model, as both share the characteristic of pairwise analysis.  
* The final result on mutual information (MI) indicates a reduction in MI when constraining the dependency among signals. Does this suggest that count and LFP signals redundantly encode the two stimulus conditions? It is recommended that the author(s) elaborate on the implications of this finding.
