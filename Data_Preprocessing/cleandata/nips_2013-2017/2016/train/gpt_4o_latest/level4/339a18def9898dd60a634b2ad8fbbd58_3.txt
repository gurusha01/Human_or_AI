The paper addresses the challenge of aggregating worker outputs in crowdsourcing by leveraging the framework and methodologies of information theory, presenting the fundamental limits of the budget-fidelity tradeoff. Although I did not fully grasp all aspects of the paper (details below), I found the proposed model and insights to be both intriguing and potentially valuable for advancing the design of crowdsourcing aggregation techniques. I would have preferred a more prominent emphasis on the high-level intuition and insights derived from the results (e.g., the discussion at the end of Section 3), as well as a clearer conclusion summarizing the key takeaways (acknowledging the constraints of limited space). While I appreciated the authors' efforts to make the content accessible to readers like myself, who lack a strong background in information theory, the paper remained challenging to follow. I suggest restating many of the results in terms of the crowdsourcing application itself, rather than relying heavily on the terminology of channels, codes, and distortion. Additionally, the related work section should mention the complementary and gradually converging research on robust economic incentives for workers, often referred to as "crowdsourcing mechanisms" or "mechanism design for crowdsourcing." This body of work also explores varying worker abilities and, more recently, integrates these considerations with advanced aggregation methods.  
Minor issues:  
- Line 84: "is reviewed in" should likely be "are reviewed in."  
- Line 106: The distinction between the crowdsourcer and taskmaster was unclear to me (and earlier in the paper as well). This might stem from the term "crowdsourcing," which combines "crowd" and "outsourcing," suggesting that outsourcing occurs before workers are involved.  
- Line 122: Typographical error in "A A(X1,X2)."  
- Lines 275-276: The sentence beginning with "In case..." was difficult to parse.  
- Figure 2: I struggled to extract meaningful insights from this figure. A more detailed caption could improve its clarity.
