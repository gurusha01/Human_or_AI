The authors propose methods for approximate marginal inference and partition function estimation within a compelling and practical class of 'cooperative graphical models,' where an additional submodular cost function on edges significantly generalizes pairwise MRFs, offering potential benefits, such as for image segmentation. While prior work focused on MAP inference for a subset of these models, this paper addresses marginal inference by skillfully integrating polyhedral insights with earlier variational inference techniques. The paper is engaging, well-organized, and clearly written, with strong motivation, background, and illustrative examples. The authors derive novel convex upper bounds and lower bounds for log Z and employ a diverse set of existing inference methods to estimate these bounds, including Frank-Wolfe, PGD, TRW, BP, mean field, and perturb-and-MAP approaches. These methods are evaluated empirically, leading to initial conclusions and practical guidance. Regarding the empirical results on small models, how was exact inference conducted—was it through brute force? The larger computer vision example is informative and highlights the potential of this approach. 
Lines 216-223: The use of Bethe here is a clever idea.  
Line 224: This is another nice insight, but don't we again require both conditions from above, (i) and (ii), for this to hold?  
Minor comments:  
- Abstract: Consider clarifying "efficient inference techniques" as "methods for approximate inference" to emphasize the approximate nature and avoid using "efficient," since, for example, BP does not have guaranteed runtime.  
- Footnote 1: Could this be expanded upon in the Appendix?  
- Line 114: For clarity, consider rephrasing to something like "with an eye toward the bounds in Sec 3, we write a model using g instead of f, as..."  
- Equation after line 29: Typo—mu should be tau.  
- Line 146: Replace "an entropy" with "a concave entropy."  
- Line 236: Replace "solved exactly" with "solved exactly or upper bounded."
