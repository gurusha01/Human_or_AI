This paper introduces an unsupervised domain adaptation approach that simultaneously optimizes the target data labels and the representations of both source and target domains. The proposed method leverages two forms of consistency: cyclic consistency and structured consistency. Cyclic consistency ensures alignment between the predicted label of the source data (derived from the inferred target data labels) and its ground truth. Structured consistency enforces agreement between the inferred labels of two target data points that exhibit similarity. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art techniques. The central idea of this work is the joint optimization of target labels and domain-specific representations. I find this idea to be sound and potentially effective for unsupervised domain adaptation. However, I have significant concerns regarding its implementation, as detailed below. 
In Eq. (2), the first term from Eq. (1) is omitted, which seems problematic because the i+ or iâˆ’ terms in the first part of Eq. (1) depend on (y1, ..., yNu). Additionally, in Eq. (2), a new loss term, l(x, y), is introduced. This alters the original objective function and is not reflected in Eq. (3), raising concerns about the guaranteed convergence of the alternating minimization process. Furthermore, in Eq. (3), the second term from Eq. (1) is excluded, which is also questionable, as Phit in the second term of Eq. (1) depends on both thetat and theta_c.
After rebuttal: In their rebuttal, the authors provide evidence of the proposed method's stability, and I appreciate their rationale for omitting certain terms of the objective function in the sub-problems to address inaccuracies during the initial iterations. However, this approach appears somewhat ad hoc, and I remain uncertain whether the optimization process genuinely minimizes the original objective function outlined in Eq. (1). I believe the authors should consider modifying the objective function itself rather than altering the sub-problems. Additionally, the authors state in their rebuttal, "If cross-domain distances are accurate ...," but this seems to contradict the aforementioned inaccuracy issue.
