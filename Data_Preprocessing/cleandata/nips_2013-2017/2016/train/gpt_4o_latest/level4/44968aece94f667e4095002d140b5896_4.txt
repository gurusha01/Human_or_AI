A seller with an infinite supply of identical items can set prices dynamically as T bidders arrive, remain for a limited window of time, potentially purchase an item, and then leave. The seller aims to achieve low regret compared to the best fixed price in hindsight, even when faced with adversarially chosen bidders who strategically decide when to buy within their available window. The paper focuses on seller strategies that post prices \tau days in advance, where \tau corresponds to the longest bidder window, as allowing more flexibility introduces complex game-theoretic challenges. The authors establish T^(2/3) upper and lower bounds on regret by employing a no-regret algorithm that posts fixed prices for T^(1/3) consecutive steps. I find the model and ideas compelling, and the paper addresses them effectively. However, there are some presentation issues, such as typos and an unclear abstract, which should be straightforward to address. The results primarily build on reductions to prior work. On the positive side, the model is quite interesting. The most striking result, which I believe should be highlighted further, is the sharp transition in optimal regret: when bidder patience increases from 0 to 1, regret shifts from sqrt(T) to T^(2/3). Notably, the proof reduces to this case regardless of the initial bidder patience. (As a side note, the main text should explicitly mention that the proof for general \tau is in the appendix, as only the \tau=1 case is shown in the main body, and I either missed or did not see this clarified.) The techniques for both the upper and lower bounds are also well-executed. Additionally, I found the discussion section to be particularly insightful. ------------- After discussion and author response: My review and opinion remain largely unchanged.
