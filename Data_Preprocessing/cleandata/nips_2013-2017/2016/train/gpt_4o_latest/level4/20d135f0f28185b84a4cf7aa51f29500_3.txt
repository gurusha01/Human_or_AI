This paper introduces a straightforward solution to the multiple choice learning (MCL) problem in the context of deep networks. Existing approaches to MCL are not directly applicable to deep networks. The authors demonstrate that incorporating a simple winner-takes-the-gradient layer during backpropagation enables simultaneous training of the learners and solving the assignment problem within an ensemble framework. Experimental evaluations indicate that this method achieves strong performance across a variety of tasks, including image classification, image segmentation, and captioning.
Strengths:  
- The MCL problem for deep learning is a topic of significant relevance to the NIPS community.  
- The simplicity of the proposed method is appealing.  
- The experiments include results on three distinct tasks.  
Weaknesses:  
- A major concern is the heavy emphasis on "diversity" throughout the paper (even in the title), despite the fact that the model does not explicitly enforce diversity. The initial excitement about how diversity might be incorporated into the model was dampened upon realizing that no explicit mechanism for diversity is included.  
- The proposed solution represents an incremental improvement, particularly in light of the relaxation introduced by Guzman et al.  
Minor Suggestions:  
- The first sentence of the abstract should be revised for clarity.  
- The emphasis on diversity should be reduced.  
- On line 108, the first "f" should be replaced with "g" in the phrase "we fixed the form of...".  
- There is an extra period in the middle of a sentence on line 115.  
One Question:  
For the baseline MCL with deep learning, how did the authors ensure that each network converged to reasonable results? Terminating the training of learners prematurely could significantly impact the ensemble's overall performance.
