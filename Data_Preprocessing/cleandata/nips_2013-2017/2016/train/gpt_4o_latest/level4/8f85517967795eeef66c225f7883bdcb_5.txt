This paper derives variational lower and upper bounds for the partition function of a specific class of graphical models known as `cooperative graphical models.' A cooperative graphical model is a probability distribution similar to pairwise graphical models but includes an additional submodular function of a disagreement variable in its energy function. The primary approach for obtaining the variational bounds involves identifying a pairwise graphical model and its associated polytope that can upper or lower bound the original cooperative graphical model. The authors also propose algorithms for computing these bounds and present experimental results in the context of image segmentation. 
The proposed graphical model is both novel and interesting. The authors derive a fully convex upper bound and a lower bound for the partition function. Notably, the variational bounds are constructed using pairwise graphical models, such as mean-field approximation and semidefinite programming (SDP), which allows the application of existing variational methods for pairwise graphical models to cooperative graphical models. The authors further provide algorithms, including Frank-Wolfe, projected gradient descent (PGD), and belief propagation (BP), for computing these bounds. Experimental results demonstrate that cooperative graphical models and their variational methods outperform pairwise graphical models in image segmentation tasks.
The variational bounds are derived by approximating the cooperative graphical model with pairwise models and leveraging existing variational bounds for pairwise models. However, since the authors apply two bounds sequentially, the resulting bounds may lack tightness. Additionally, the lower bound is intractable. Because optimization over the polytope \( U(f) \) is computationally infeasible, the variational lower bound is also intractable. The authors propose a block coordinate descent algorithm to approximate the lower bound, but this algorithm explores only a finite set of points within \( U(f) \), which may result in a suboptimal lower bound.
The technique for constructing \( B(f) \) and \( U(f) \) appears to be general. It would be interesting to explore whether this technique can be extended to a broader class of functions \( f \) or other probability distributions. Additionally, while the optimization objectives (3) and (4) for the variational upper and lower bounds are not explicitly dependent on the submodularity of \( f \), the algorithms themselves do rely on this property.
