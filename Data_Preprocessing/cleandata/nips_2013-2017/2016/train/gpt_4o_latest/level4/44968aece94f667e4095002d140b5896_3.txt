The authors examine a specific class of repeated posted-price auctions involving patient buyers. They consider a seller with an unlimited supply of a homogeneous good who interacts with a sequence of T buyers, each having a private valuation \(vt\) for the good. The novelty of this work lies in the assumption that buyers are patient, meaning they are willing to wait \(\taut\) time steps and accept the best price within the window \(t, t+1, \ldots, t+\taut\). To ensure this behavior is optimal for the buyer, the seller is assumed to announce the price at time \(t+\tau\) during time step \(t\), where \(\tau\) serves as an upper bound on \(\taut\). As a result, a buyer's decision to accept or reject a price at time \(t\) does not influence any prices in the interval \(t, t+1, \ldots, t+\tau\). By applying a straightforward use of the EXP3 algorithm over epochs of length \(T^{1/3}\), during which the seller sets a fixed price, the authors achieve a regret rate of \(O(\tau^{1/3} T^{2/3})\) relative to the best fixed price in hindsight. Notably, the lower bound provided by the authors establishes that the \(T^{2/3}\) term is unimprovable. 
The model proposed by the authors is appealing and merits further exploration, particularly due to its simplicity. It offers a plausible representation of strategic behavior while allowing for a clear characterization of the buyer's optimal strategy. While the upper bound result is relatively straightforward and unsurprising, the lower bound is more intricate, involving a reduction from general multi-armed bandits (MAB) with switching costs to impatient sellers with switching costs, and subsequently to patient sellers without switching costs. The connection to MAB with switching costs is both unexpected and intriguing. 
However, one drawback of the paper is the presence of several clarity issues, as well as numerous typos and grammatical errors. Below is a partial list of such issues:  
- Several typos in the abstract.  
- Lines 145-146: "(there is a slight gain, by the increase probability of sell, but it does suffices to offset the loss)."  
- Line 179: Capitalization issue: "this we do again."  
- The arguments to the beta function are reversed in Lemma 4 compared to their usage elsewhere in the paper.  
- Appendix A, line 335: The variable \(\chi\) is not defined when it is first introduced.  
- Line 220: "The idea of construction is as follows."  
- Line 225: "Algorithm A' receive price."  
- Line 239: "therefore."  
Additionally, I suggest improving the organization of Section 4.1. The body of this section primarily discusses the key ideas behind Lemma 4, rather than Theorem 3. It would be more logical to move the statement of Theorem 3 closer to the construction of Algorithm \(A'\).
