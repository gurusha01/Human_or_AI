This paper enhances existing SG-MCMC methods by introducing a Richardson-Romberg scheme, which improves the convergence rates in terms of both bias and mean squared error (MSE). The proposed scheme is straightforward to implement, requiring only minimal modifications to traditional SG-MCMC algorithms. The paper is supported by strong theoretical results. Specifically, it introduces a Romberg-Richardson scheme that enhances the convergence rates of standard SG-MCMC methods. The approach appears promising, and the theoretical foundation is robust. However, my primary concern lies in how the specific convergence rates are derived from the theorem (as detailed in the "explain fatal flaws" section). Additionally, I have a practical concern regarding the matrix factorization experiment results. If the proposed method is executed on a single-core computer, it would take approximately three times longer than standard SG-MCMC due to the use of two chains, one of which requires twice as many steps. Considering this, the plots in Figure 5 may not be entirely fair; the runtime for SGLD should be scaled by a factor of 2/3, which would reduce the observed performance gap between SGLD and SGRRLD. 
In Figure 3, the bias plot suggests that the best convergence is achieved by the red curve, corresponding to \(\alpha = 0.2\), rather than the \(\alpha = 1/3\) stated in the text. Is there an error here? Additionally, the optimal curve exhibits significant fluctuations, which seems inconsistent with the rate for \(\alpha = 0.2\). Could you clarify why this occurs? Furthermore, in line 256, it is mentioned that when the step size is too small, the term \(1/K\gamma\) dominates. Why does this not apply to SGLD?
Some minor comments: 
- In Eq. 1, why is a different symbol used instead of \(\theta\)? 
- Line 94: "RR" is not defined. 
- Line 131: \(\Gamma_K\) is not defined. 
- Line 160: The term "smooth function \(f\)" is usedâ€”what specific type of smoothness is assumed? 
- Line 249: Figure 1(b) plots Bias vs. time, not dimension. Should this be Figure 1(c)?
