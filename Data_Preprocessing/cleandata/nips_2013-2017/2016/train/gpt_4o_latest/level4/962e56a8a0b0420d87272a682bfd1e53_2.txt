This paper systematically examines the mechanism by which rating values are influenced by a recommender system (RS). The primary objective of the study is to develop a method for inferring the true rating matrix (unaffected by an RS) from the observed rating matrix, based on certain plausible assumptions. To achieve this, the authors propose a truncated-SVD algorithm to recover the true rating matrix, along with a score to quantify the extent to which the rating matrix is influenced by an RS. While the authors validate their proposed algorithm extensively on both synthetic and real-world datasets, I believe the assumptions underlying their approach do not adequately capture the complexities of real-world RS. My detailed concerns are outlined below.
First, the problem addressed in this paper is both interesting and potentially valuable for applications requiring access to a true rating matrix that is unaffected by any RS. However, inferring the true rating matrix from the observed one is an inherently ill-posed problem, which necessitates the use of "strong" (and somewhat unrealistic) assumptions. My specific concerns regarding these assumptions are as follows:
1. Assumption 1: This assumption is overly restrictive because popular recommendation algorithms (e.g., Bayesian matrix factorization) cannot be effectively represented by Eq. (2). If a real-world RS employs a more complex recommendation algorithm that falls outside the scope of Assumption 1, it becomes challenging to validate the quality of the true rating matrix recovered by the proposed algorithm.
2. Assumption 2: In this assumption, a single Bernoulli random variable is used to approximate the indicator matrix (as described in Assumption 1), implying that all users follow the recommended ratings in the same manner. This is an unrealistic scenario, as user behavior in real-world RS is typically more diverse and nuanced. Therefore, I find Assumptions 1 and 2 to be overly "strong" for modeling real-world RS.
In addition to the assumptions, I have a concern regarding the score described in Eq. (10), which is intended to measure the extent to which ratings are influenced by an RS. I find the proposed score somewhat complex without sufficient justification. For instance, a simpler approach could involve using the distance between the observed ratings and a straight line as a measure of RS influence. If normalization is required, a sigmoid function could be employed to appropriately normalize the distance.
