This paper presents an elegant application of learning theory to mechanism design in the context of combinatorial auctions. Specifically, it addresses the question of how effectively the revenue-optimal mechanism, derived from a set of bids/values sampled from a distribution, generalizes to the true underlying distribution within a given class of strategy-proof mechanisms. The authors provide results for five broad classes of mechanisms, including a result for approximations. For the most general classes (such as affine maximizer auctions, virtual valuations, and lambda-auctions), they establish exponential lower bounds for uniform convergence. However, they demonstrate that mixed bundling auctions possess a polylogarithmic pseudo-dimension with respect to the number of bidders and items. Considering the significance of combinatorial auctions, it is surprising that the literature contains so few results on sample complexity. Importantly, the recent work of Morgenstern and Roughgarden does not seem applicable to the settings explored in this paper. While I did not verify all the proofs in detail, the key ideas underlying the pseudo-dimension constructions are clearly articulated and insightful. Overall, I find the problem investigated to be both significant and potentially highly impactful.
