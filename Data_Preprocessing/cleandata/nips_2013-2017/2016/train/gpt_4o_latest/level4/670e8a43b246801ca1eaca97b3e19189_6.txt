The paper addresses the clustering problem using models that produce clusters whose sizes grow sublinearly (rather than linearly) with the total number of data points. To formalize this requirement, the authors introduce the microclustering property and propose two novel models, the NBNB model and the NBD model, which satisfy this property. The microclustering property defined in the paper offers a framework to characterize models that enforce sublinear cluster size growth, with applications such as entity resolution. The authors evaluate the proposed NBNB and NBD models on real datasets to demonstrate their performance. While the paper lacks theoretical justification, it has the potential to significantly influence future research on clustering models.
