Review of 1820  
The proposed unsupervised risk estimation method relies on two primary assumptions: (i) the feature vector x can be partitioned as x = (x1, x2, ..., xv) such that the class-conditional distributions factorize into a product of distributions (one for each xi), and (ii) the loss function is separable, meaning it can be expressed as a sum of terms, one for each x_i. While the authors describe assumption (i) as a "surprisingly weak assumption," it appears to be quite restrictive. For instance, if the class-conditional distributions are Gaussian, assumption (i) necessitates that the covariance matrices are block-diagonal. The authors could strengthen their argument by discussing this assumption in the context of multi-view learning, as the term "view" is not introduced until page 3. Including a real-world example to motivate this assumption in the introduction could also enhance the paper's clarity and impact.  
Assumption (ii) similarly excludes many commonly used loss functions, such as the standard hinge and logistic losses, which are nonlinear and thus non-separable in x. For example, in Example 1 of the paper, the authors assume a logistic model of the form θ^T(φ1(x1, y) + φ2(x2, y) + φ3(x3, y)). However, the standard GLM logistic model for a linear classifier is expressed as y  w^T x = y  (w1^T x1 + w2^T x2 + w3^T x3), which cannot be represented in the form of Example 1 unless the φ_i functions include learnable parameters. Similarly, in Example 2, the authors propose a separable form of hinge loss, which aligns with their framework but deviates from the standard hinge loss. These modifications might be better justified if framed within the context of multi-view learning. The authors note that prior work in this area has only addressed 0/1-loss, but further elaboration on this distinction would be helpful.  
The primary contribution of the paper lies in extending the framework (factorized class-conditional distributions and separable loss functions) to continuous losses. To manage the computational complexity associated with continuous losses, the authors propose a method-of-moments approach, leveraging a decomposition of a third-order tensor under the "3-view" assumption. While the application of tensor decomposition techniques to unsupervised risk estimation appears novel, the tensor-based methods used to prove the main theorem are fairly standard.  
Overall, the paper is reasonably well written, but it would benefit from a stronger justification of the 3-view assumptions (conditional independence of views and separability of the loss function). Including a compelling real-world application example in the introduction could significantly improve the paper's motivation and accessibility.
