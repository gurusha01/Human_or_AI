The authors present a framework for clustering using same-clustering queries and provide a detailed analysis. Below are my comments:
Major Issues:
1. The paper lacks an essential component: empirical evaluations to validate (at least some of) the theoretical properties of the SSAC algorithm on real-world datasets. This omission is significant and should be addressed in any revised version of the paper, even if the results are included only in the supplementary material.  
2. The authors claim to focus on "center-based clustering in Euclidean space" while asserting that their results generalize to any Hilbert space. A more thorough discussion (or proof) supporting this claim is necessary. Additionally, the authors exclusively discuss K-means clustering. Is the proposed approach restricted to K-means, or can it be extended to other clustering methods? The authors should explore and elaborate on potential applications to alternative clustering techniques.  
3. The theoretical results in Section 3 feel misplaced, as they lack introductory context or discussion. The authors should include transitional or explanatory text to better integrate these results into the narrative. Ideally, the theoretical properties should be organized into a dedicated subsection for clarity.  
4. Some of the proofs are incomplete or lack sufficient rigor. For example, the proofs for Lemma 6, Theorem 14, and others appear scattered and omit critical details. The authors should provide fully detailed proofs, at least in the supplementary materials, to ensure completeness and transparency.
Minor Issues:
- Numerous typos are present throughout the paper. Below is a non-exhaustive list:  
  - "address this issues" → "address these issues"  
  - "exhibit some nice properties and likely to" → "exhibit some nice properties and are likely to"  
  - "In such cases, optimal" → incomplete sentence  
  - "help relaxing" → "help in relaxing"  
  - Remove the comma in "framework and, the rather unusual"  
  - Unnecessary parentheses around [ABS12]  
  - "interactiveness" → "interactivity"  
  - "niceness of data under" → unclear phrasing  
  - "Voroni" → "Voronoi"  
  - Terms like "section," "appendix," etc., should be capitalized consistently.  
  - Subsection titles lack consistent capitalization; refer to the NIPS guidelines for formatting.  
  - "be a clustering instane" → "be a clustering instance"  
  - "This results extends" → "This result extends"  
  - Overuse of "which" where "that" would be more appropriate in several instances.  
- The term "niceness" should be defined early in the paper to avoid ambiguity. The authors should clarify their technical usage of this term, as it may be confused with its colloquial meaning (e.g., "some nice properties").  
- In the abstract, the term "success" is ambiguous. Does it refer to the algorithm's completion or its accuracy? If it refers to accuracy, the authors should specify how "success" is being measured.  
- Section 1.1 contains redundant information already covered earlier in the paper. This repetition should be removed or rephrased for conciseness.  
- The choice of 3.4 as a specific value requires further explanation. The authors should clarify the rationale behind this choice.  
- The equivalence between Definition 4 and the same-cluster query definition in Definition 2 is mostly clear but could benefit from additional intuition. A brief example illustrating this equivalence would enhance the reader's understanding.  
- The statement "the solution of choice may vary significantly between different intended applications" requires supporting references. Similarly, the subsequent sentence would benefit from citations to strengthen its claims.
