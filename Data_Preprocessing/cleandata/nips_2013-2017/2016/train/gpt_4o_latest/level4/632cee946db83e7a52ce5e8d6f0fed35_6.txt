This paper proposes a method for learning SVMs to perform dimensionality reduction. The abbreviation LADDER should be clarified in the abstract (e.g., Large Margin Discriminant Dimensionality Reduction (LADDER)). In line 38, "than" should be corrected to "that." Several mathematical notations throughout the paper are incorrect. The term 'predictor' used in the manuscript is ambiguous and should be clarified (e.g., does it refer to a strong learner or a weak learner?). In equation 7, the definitions of 'l' and 'c_l' are unclear. In line 178, the notation 'dY' appears to be incorrect. Additionally, in line 179, the meaning of the small letter 'm' is not explained. In line 89, the function 'f(x)' is mentioned, but it is unclear whether it is a real-valued function. Furthermore, the paper should provide a detailed explanation of why the proposed algorithm is theoretically sound in terms of optimization.
