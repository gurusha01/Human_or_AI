This paper introduces the use of PSDDs as an alternative to factor and model counting-based representations. The authors demonstrate that multiplication can be executed efficiently, enabling the development of an efficient algorithm to represent the arithmetic circuit (AC) that encodes the distribution of a probabilistic graphical model (PGM), which is expressed as a product of factors. The proposed approach presents an intriguing and practical contribution to inference in probabilistic models. The methodology is articulated clearly and with sufficient detail. While the experimental results indicate progress, I remain uncertain about the broader impact of this method (as opposed to it being another heuristic/approach for compact AC representation, which often exhibits significant performance variability across different problems). However, considering prior work that has shown the advantages of reducing auxiliary variables during knowledge compilation for PGMs, I am inclined to believe this approach could have substantial implications.  
Detailed comments:  
- Algorithm 1, lines 12–13: The `multiply` function returns a tuple, so "P,c1" and "S,c2" could be used, and the cache calls in line 15 could be replaced with `c1` and `c2`.  
- Section 4, Theorem 4: The intuition (or a reference) to better understand this theorem is missing.  
- Section 4, lines 212–213: The phrase "the product AC" might be clearer as "resulting AC."  
Minor:  
- Section 3, line 156: Correct the citation format.
