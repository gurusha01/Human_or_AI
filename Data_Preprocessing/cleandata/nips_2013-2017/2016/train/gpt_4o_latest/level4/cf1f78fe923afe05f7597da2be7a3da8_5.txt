This paper introduces a novel manifold learning method that directly minimizes deviations from isometry. The proposed approach is optimized iteratively using projected gradient descent. Below are some comments regarding the paper:  
In Algorithm 1, how should the parameters d and s be set in practice? Is there a systematic approach to selecting s once d is determined?  
In line 25, please provide a definition for the function poly.  
Line 27: "An embedding ...": please review and revise this sentence for clarity.  
Line 71: Replace W{ij} with W{kl}.  
In equation (1), update D = W1 to D = diag(W1), and similarly, update tilde(D) = diag(tilde(W) 1).  
Line 77: Replace "give" with "gives."  
In the swiss roll and curved half-sphere examples (Fig. 2), the qualitative performance of HLLE and Isomap appears superior. However, the numerical results based on equation (10) favor the proposed RR method. It would be helpful to analyze how the two loss terms in equation (10) differ across the various algorithms. Additionally, a comparison of the computational complexities of each algorithm would strengthen the evaluation.
