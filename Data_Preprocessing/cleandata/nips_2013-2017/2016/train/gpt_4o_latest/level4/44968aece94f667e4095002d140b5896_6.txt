This paper examines a trading model in which a seller interacts with a sequence of buyers whose "patience" is uncertain. Since the seller does not know when buyers will decide to purchase the product, the seller updates the optimal price dynamically after each period. The paper presents an algorithm for adjusting prices in real-time and establishes a tight lower bound on the seller's regret. Two observations: 1. When analyzing the seller's feedback on any given day, the paper assumes that the seller has no prior knowledge of the buyers' patience. However, it seems reasonable to assume that the seller could have an initial prior on buyers' patience, which could be updated based on observing buyers' "not buy" decisions. 2. Perhaps I overlooked some details, but it is unclear to me why the buyers' behavior constitutes an optimal response to the seller's algorithm. Since the paper addresses the strategic interactions between buyers and the seller, it should provide a justification for this point. Specifically, the paper should include a discussion of the "equilibrium" concept under the proposed algorithm.
