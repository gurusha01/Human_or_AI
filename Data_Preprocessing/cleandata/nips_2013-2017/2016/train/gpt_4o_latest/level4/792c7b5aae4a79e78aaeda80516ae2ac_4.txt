The authors present a comprehensive global analysis of the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm for mixtures of two Gaussians, where the two components share the same covariance matrix and have equal weights in the mixture. Initially, the authors establish global results for the population version of the problem, demonstrating how the EM algorithm would perform if it had access to the true underlying distributions. Subsequently, leveraging the insights from the population-level analysis, the authors show that the behavior of sample-based EM closely mirrors that of the population EM, relying on consistency-type arguments. However, I have a question regarding why the authors have restricted their finite sample analysis to a consistency-type result. What factors or challenges prevent the authors' framework from providing finite sample global guarantees for the EM algorithm?
