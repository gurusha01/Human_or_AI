The paper establishes exact recoverability bounds for identifying communities in heterogeneous stochastic block models. It employs semi-definite program (SDP) relaxations and maximum likelihood methods to propose algorithms and subsequently demonstrates the conditions under which these algorithms achieve community recovery above specific thresholds. Additionally, the paper provides sufficient conditions for the failure of exact recovery below these thresholds. A series of theoretical results regarding community recovery in heterogeneous stochastic block models are presented, with detailed proofs included in the supplementary material. The paper explicitly outlines the conditions for community recovery for both the SDP relaxation and maximum likelihood algorithms, as well as sufficient conditions for non-recovery in these models. Several illustrative examples are also provided to support the recovery scenarios. However, the inclusion of simulation studies, particularly for block models in the parameter space between the recovery thresholds and the non-recovery conditions, would have strengthened the paper. The discussion on missing edges appears somewhat tangential to the main narrative and might be better suited for a separate paper. Overall, the paper offers significant theoretical insights into heterogeneous block models, with the results on SDP relaxation algorithms being particularly promising for practical applications. While SDP relaxation algorithms for community detection are gaining popularity, they remain computationally expensive. It would have been helpful to know whether any experiments were conducted with the convex relaxations and the scale of the graphs used in such experiments. The paper is well-written, and its key contributions are articulated clearly and effectively.
