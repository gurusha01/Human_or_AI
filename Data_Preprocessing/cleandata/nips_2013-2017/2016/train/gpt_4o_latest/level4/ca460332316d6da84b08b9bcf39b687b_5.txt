This paper introduces a clustering method. In contrast to normalized cut, the proposed approach employs a multiplicative cut-based objective function to achieve a more balanced graph partition. The authors provide theoretical proof to validate the model. Achieving balanced partitions is a significant and intriguing challenge in clustering. However, the paper lacks necessary comparisons with prior work on balanced partitions, such as [1]. Additionally, the paper's presentation is unclear in some parts. Specifically, the introduction section could be restructured and expanded. As it stands, readers may find Section 1 confusing before moving on to subsequent sections. Below are my suggestions for improving the paper: 1. I recommend including comparisons with prior studies on balanced partitions; 2. The introduction section is unclear and could benefit from additional background information before introducing Eq. (1); 3. Some derivations lack sufficient explanation, such as the steps leading to Eq. (3) and Eq. (10); 4. It is unclear what the three rows of numbers represent in Fig. 2â€”this should be clarified; 5. The meaning of the percentage values in Table 2 is not explained. [1] Ding, Chris HQ, Xiaofeng He, Hongyuan Zha, Ming Gu, and Horst D. Simon.
