Count-based exploration bonuses have been integrated into numerous RL algorithms. For large state spaces, generalization across neighboring states becomes essential to derive a meaningful count metric. This paper introduces a method to transform density estimation into a count-based measure. The transformation is straightforward and localized, yielding a pseudo-count with several appealing properties. The approach is validated by incorporating exploration into select Atari2600 games. I consider the proposed method to be both elegant and effective. The presentation is generally clear, though including additional details about the density estimation technique applied in the experiments would enhance the paper.
