The paper introduces a copula-based family of probabilistic models designed for datasets containing both discrete and continuous variables. It effectively avoids the curse of dimensionality by constraining the interaction structure among the discrete variables. The utility of the proposed models is demonstrated using simulated local field potential (LFP) and spike data generated from a simulated neuronal network. The results highlight that model likelihood estimates and mutual information estimates are significantly influenced by the choice of model, particularly when comparing the mixed copula models to independent-variable models. The manuscript is well written overall, although the explanation of C-vine copulas is challenging to follow without consulting the supplementary material and references. The experiments conducted on simulated neuronal data are well-designed and convincingly demonstrate the method's applicability. However, I found the construction of C-vine copulas difficult to grasp. While the supplementary material provided some clarification, it was not sufficient for a complete understanding. The integration of discrete and continuous variables appears relatively straightforward. As a contribution that addresses key challenges in applying such models to mixed neural data, I consider this work to be important and a notable advancement. That said, I feel that until a full-length journal article is published, the paper's audience may remain limited to a niche group already familiar with C-vine-related modeling and interested in mixed data modeling.
