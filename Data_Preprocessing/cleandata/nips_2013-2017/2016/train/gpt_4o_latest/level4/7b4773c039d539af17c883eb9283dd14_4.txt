The paper introduces an algorithm designed to address MDPs with either a finite or infinite number of transitions from state-action pairs to subsequent states, aiming to estimate the optimal value function at any state while minimizing the number of calls to the generative model, i.e., the sample complexity. My primary concern with this work is the absence of experimental results on simulation domains or real-world applications. While the paper is theoretical in nature, I believe such results are essential and should be included to validate the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. This is particularly important given that the authors themselves emphasize that one of their key contributions is the algorithm's ease of implementation and computational efficiency. Additionally, the manuscript would benefit from more thorough proofreading, as there are several typographical errors:  
- Line 58: 1 → [1]  
- Line 107: finite and infinite → finite or infinite  
- Line 111: is be related → is related  
- Line 174: The concept of "opened" should be clarified, as this is its first mention in the paper.  
- Line 220: an a term → a term  
- Line 355: using and approach → using an approach  
Furthermore, Figure 3 requires additional explanation.
