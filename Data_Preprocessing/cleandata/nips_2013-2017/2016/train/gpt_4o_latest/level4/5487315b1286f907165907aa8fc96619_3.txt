This paper introduces a two-layer model designed for learning problems with latent structures. The authors first define an objective function and then propose its convex relaxation by enforcing the first-order optimality condition through sublinear constraints. Experimental results on two distinct tasks demonstrate the utility of the proposed approach. [Technical]: The paper offers a solid theoretical analysis and clearly articulates the assumptions underlying their model. The empirical evaluations are thorough and well-executed. [Novelty]: To the best of my knowledge, the approach proposed in this paper is novel. [Impact]: The proposed method is general and has the potential to significantly impact applications involving latent structures. [Presentation]: Overall, the paper is well-written. Section 2, in particular, provides strong motivation for the work and is easy to follow. Below are some comments for the authors to consider:  
- Lines 41-45: The statement in the introduction is somewhat unclear. Could the authors provide an example to clarify? This becomes more comprehensible after reading the entire paper.  
- (Minor) While I appreciate the authors summarizing the literature on deep learning with structured prediction in the Introduction, the relevance of the proposed approach to this body of work seems limited. Specifically, the model involves only one latent layer, and the relationship between \(x\) and \(y\) is encoded through \(y'Ux\). Consequently, the connection to neural network models and auto-encoders appears weak. Section 2, in fact, provides a better introduction to the goals of the paper than the Introduction itself.  
- The proposed approach seems related to [a], although [a] does not incorporate structure into the latent layer. However, the joint likelihood approach and the convexification process bear similarities.  
- The authors might want to discuss and relate their methods to latent structured prediction approaches, such as hidden CRF [b] and latent Structured SVM [c]. The key distinction is that in [b] and [c], the relationships between \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) are directly encoded through features.

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS*  
Apologies for adding further comments after the rebuttal period has started. However, I believe the following clarifications regarding the experiments would be helpful:  
- [12] reported an MRR of 95.4, whereas the results in this paper are significantly lower. I understand that the experimental settings differ slightly. Could the authors report the performance of their proposed approach under the same experimental setting as [12]?  
- The authors state that "[12] trained it using a local optimization method, and we will refer to it as Local." However, [12] actually employed a global learning method, which is a central claim of [12]. Could the authors clarify whether they implemented [12] correctly, or have I misunderstood their description?
