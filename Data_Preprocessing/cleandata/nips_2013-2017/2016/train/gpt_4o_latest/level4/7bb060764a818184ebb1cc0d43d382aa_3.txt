This paper presents a novel sampling model for dropout, wherein distinct features/neurons are governed by separate multinomial distributions. The work proposes enhancements to traditional dropout that could have practical utility. I find Figure 2, Section 5.1, and Figure 3 particularly compelling with regard to the results and benchmarks.
