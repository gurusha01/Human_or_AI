The authors present results on exact recovery in the Stochastic Block Model for general regimes involving varying numbers of clusters and their sizes. The paper establishes recovery guarantees for novel and fairly broad regimes of the Stochastic Block Model. While the results are quite general, they appear to hold only up to constant factors, which I consider a significant limitation. A challenge in evaluating this work is the rapid evolution of research in the Stochastic Block Model, making it difficult to pinpoint the precise state of the art and to comprehensively cite all relevant references (many of which are understandably missing, as including all would be impractical). As a result, it is challenging to clearly delineate the specific contributions of this paper. Additionally, it is worth noting that what the authors refer to as "partial observations" is commonly known in the literature as the "Censored Block Model."
