The objective of this study is to recover the true ratings that reflect intrinsic user preferences from the observed ratings. To achieve this, sufficient assumptions are outlined to deconvolve the feedback loops. Additionally, this work introduces a metric designed to analyze the influence of recommendation systems (RS) on the entire user-item rating matrix. 
1. The study primarily concentrates on the user-item rating matrix, emphasizing item-item (or user-user) similarities as the key to recovering true ratings. However, many real-world datasets incorporate temporal, side, and contextual information. Addressing the recovery of true ratings in such datasets would be a more interesting and practical problem.  
2. A significant amount of material is relegated to the supplementary file, which somewhat undermines the completeness of the main work.  
3. In line 55, should "ans" be corrected to "and"?  
4. In line 148, should "standard normal" be revised to "normal"?
