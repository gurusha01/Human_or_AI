The paper conducts a sample complexity analysis of automated mechanism design, focusing on its application to identifying high-revenue combinatorial auctions within a given auction class. The primary contributions include uniform convergence bounds on revenue for a hierarchy of auction classes. These results demonstrate that exponential sample complexity is unavoidable for general AMA auctions, VVCA auctions, and Î» auctions, while polynomial sample complexity is achievable for MBARP and MBA auctions. The key methodology involves analyzing the complexity of various auction classes using tools such as Rademacher complexity and pseudo-dimension. + This work delves into an intriguing and emerging area of research within learning theory. By leveraging traditional techniques for sample complexity analysis, the findings provide fresh insights into the structural hierarchy of auction classes. The paper is well-organized and written in a manner that makes the content accessible and easy to understand. - The quantity "U," which appears in the bounds, is not adequately explained in the paper.
