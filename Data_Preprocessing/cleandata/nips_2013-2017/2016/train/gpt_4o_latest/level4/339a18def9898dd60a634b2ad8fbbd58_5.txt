The paper presents a model of digital crowdsourcing within an information-theoretic framework, deriving lower bounds on the required number of queries per task to achieve a specified probability of error. Workers are modeled as independent parallel channels, with two types of channels considered: symmetric discrete memoryless channels (MSC) to represent worker errors, and the spammer-hammer channel model SHC(q), which accounts for workers being spammers with probability 1-q. The analysis assumes a nonadaptive coding scheme. Two scenarios are examined: one where the crowdsourcer, responsible for determining task values after collecting worker responses, has full knowledge of worker skill levels, and another where the crowdsourcer has no such knowledge. In both cases, the taskmaster, who assigns tasks to workers, is assumed to lack information about worker skills, leading to an equal distribution of tasks among all workers. The paper also provides a necessary condition on the minimum required rate—the number of queries per task—for k-ary incidence coding, where workers are shown k items and asked to classify them as similar or different, under an SHC(q) worker pool. 
The paper is well-organized and well-written. However, it lacks experiments or simulations to demonstrate how current practical schemes, such as those used in Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT), compare to the derived theoretical limits. Section 2.4 could be condensed, and section 3.1 is either unnecessary or could also be shortened. Instead, including proof sketches for the theorems would add more value. The work appears novel, as there seems to be no prior analysis of the crowdsourcing problem from an information-theoretic perspective, as claimed by the authors. The results are potentially very useful, providing insights for designers of crowdsourcing systems to determine the minimum query rate required to achieve a desired error probability, which could also aid in pricing such projects. I did not review the appendix and therefore cannot comment on the validity of the proofs.
