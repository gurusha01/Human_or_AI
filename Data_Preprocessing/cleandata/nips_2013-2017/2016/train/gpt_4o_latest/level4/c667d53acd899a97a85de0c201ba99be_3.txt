The authors investigate the sample complexity involved in learning approximately optimal auctions within well-established combinatorial auction classes. They examine the relationship between the in-sample optimal mechanism within a given class and the revenue generated by this mechanism when applied to the true distribution of players' valuations. To achieve this, the authors extensively utilize tools from Rademacher complexities and Rademacher calculus, complemented by combinatorial techniques such as the VC dimension, to derive bounds on the Rademacher complexity of the revenue objective across these auction classes. The findings are technically compelling from both a learning theory perspective—where they successfully analyze and bound the complexity of intricate function classes—and a mechanism design perspective—where they introduce the Rademacher complexity framework to the field of mechanism design. Therefore, I recommend this work for acceptance.
