This paper employs the Cholesky decomposition in place of the eigen-decomposition to reduce the computational and storage complexity of the CMA-ES. Overall, the paper is well-written. The proposed approach appears sound, and the experimental results, particularly the speedup rates, are quite encouraging. I believe the proposed method has the potential to become a new standard version of CMA-ES in the future. However, while the paper has merit, its originality is somewhat limited, as it seems to be a straightforward extension of prior work: "A More Efficient Rank-one Covariance Matrix Update for Evolution Strategies." The methodologies are largely the same. Please clarify if my understanding is incorrect. Furthermore, several critical aspects are notably absent: 
1) It is necessary to demonstrate whether your algorithm is equivalent to formula (2). While I understand that space constraints and prior proofs in earlier work may have influenced this omission, this validation remains essential for the completeness of this paper.  
2) You state that the computational complexity is O(\mu d^2), which matches that of CMA-ES-Ref. A detailed discussion is needed to explain (perhaps using '\Theta' notation instead of 'O') why your algorithm achieves better performance.  
3) You argue that the error in the path is small and decreases over time, which contradicts Hansen's claim. Since your theoretical analysis is non-deterministic, experimental validation of this claim is necessary. Comparing only the final performance is insufficient.  
Minor comments:  
1) Please carefully review your notations. For instance, wk in Algorithm 2 should be \alphak, and n in Table 1 should be d.  
2) In line 185, 'F' should be corrected to 'f.'  
In its current state, I do not believe this paper meets the standards for acceptance at NIPS.
