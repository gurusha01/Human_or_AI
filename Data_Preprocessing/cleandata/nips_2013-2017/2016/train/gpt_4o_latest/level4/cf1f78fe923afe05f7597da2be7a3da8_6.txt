The authors introduce an algorithm designed to embed a set of points into a low-dimensional space. The algorithm begins with an initial embedding and iteratively refines it by minimizing a loss function. Experimental evaluations of the proposed algorithm on various tasks demonstrate promising results. The paper is well-written, with no evident flaws, and the authors effectively articulate the research questions they aim to address along with their contributions. However, the advancement appears to be incremental, as the proposed algorithm builds upon an existing estimator for the Laplace-Beltrami operator and another for the push-forward metric. The results, in comparison to state-of-the-art embedding algorithms, are clearly presented. Nonetheless, the authors have not clarified how to determine the embedding dimension or the intrinsic dimension parameters.
