The authors introduce the concept of micro clustering, defining models as exhibiting the micro clustering property if cluster sizes grow sublinearly with the size of the dataset. The motivation for developing models with this property is well justified by the entity resolution problem, which addresses the identification of duplicate records in noisy databases. The authors demonstrate that widely used mixture models for clustering fail to satisfy the micro clustering property and propose a novel class of partition models. They focus on two specific models within this class and provide empirical evidence that these models satisfy the micro clustering property. Additionally, they develop a Gibbs sampling algorithm for posterior inference. The authors evaluate their proposed models against the popular Dirichlet process and Pitman-Yor process mixture models on four realistic simulated datasets. Their findings indicate that the proposed models outperform the alternatives in simulated de-duplication scenarios but perform worse or comparably in noisy datasets with limited features. 
This paper is engaging, well-written, and the proposed models are thoughtfully motivated by the entity resolution problem. However, my primary concern lies with the introduced class of "Flexible Models for Microclustering" (FMMC). Specifically, I expected a formal proof that this class of models satisfies the micro clustering property, but no such proof is provided in the manuscript. Furthermore, the authors claim in lines 91-94 that the partition model induced by the Dirichlet Process (DP) is a special case of their framework (though this is somewhat unclear, as \(\mu\) and \(\kappa\) depend on the sample size \(N\), which conflicts with the definition in Equation (2)). At the same time, they argue that the DP does not satisfy the micro clustering property. This raises concerns about the appropriateness of the class name, as models within the class may not universally satisfy the micro clustering property. Consequently, the motivation for introducing this class of models becomes questionable. While I appreciated the motivation to develop micro clustering models for entity resolution, the introduced class may fail to meet the stated property. The paper would be significantly strengthened by including a theorem that specifies the conditions on \(\mu\) and \(\kappa\) required for the micro clustering property to hold. 
Additionally, I was disappointed that for the two proposed models, NBNB and NBD, the micro clustering property was only demonstrated empirically. The paper would benefit from showing that the specific choices of \(\mu\) and \(\kappa\) for these models satisfy the aforementioned theorem. 
Comments:  
1. pg. 3, eq. 3 and line 85: \(\kappa{|C|N}\) should be \(\kappa{|CN|}\).  
2. pg. 3, line 88: Revise to "We now present two flexible FMMC models" (remove "more").  
3. pg. 5, lines 200-201: The text should clarify that it refers to the "posterior expected number of clusters" and the "posterior expected value of \(\delta_l\)" (I assume posterior expectations are being used to estimate these quantities?).  
4. pg. 5, line 201: The posterior expected value of \(\delta_l\) reported in the tables is presented as a single number. I expected \(L\) different values. Are you assuming a common \(\delta\) across all \(l\) or reporting an average? Please clarify.
