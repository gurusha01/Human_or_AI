The paper addresses the problem of selecting a small subset of rows and appropriately reweighting them to approximate the sum of squared distances of the original point set to any k-dimensional affine subspace. The authors demonstrate that O(k^2/eps^2) rows can be selected deterministically. The approach begins with the base case for k = 0, and the method appears to resemble a derandomization of Chebyshev's inequality. However, the paper contains significant issues regarding prior work. Specifically, the authors cite [8] but should instead reference Cohen et al., "Dimensionality Reduction for k-Means Clustering and Low Rank Approximation." This is not a minor typographical error—the authors attribute a result from [8] about the operator norm, whereas the correct result from the Cohen et al. paper achieves O(k/eps^2) rescaled columns deterministically for the same problem considered in this submission (see part 5 of Lemma 11 and Section 7.3, which builds on BSS). This result is strictly stronger than the O(k^2/eps^2) bound presented in the submission. Consequently, the claim that "Our main result is the first algorithm for computing an (k,eps)-coreset C of size independent of both n and d" is incorrect. Furthermore, the authors incorrectly state that [8,7] minimize the 2-norm—again, [8] is the wrong reference, and the Cohen et al. paper should be cited instead. Additionally, the authors fail to compare their work to Theorem 8 in this paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.07263v1.pdf. I am also not fully convinced by their comparison to [7]; it is unclear why [7] could not be adapted to be deterministic and applicable to rank-k approximation using similar techniques. 
Despite these shortcomings, I appreciate that the paper explores deterministic sampling without relying on BSS, which, as demonstrated in the experiments, could be more practical than BSS. This aspect was the most compelling part of the paper for me, even though it results in a weaker O(k^2/eps^2) bound. Due to the novelty of the deterministic approach without BSS, I believe the paper has merit and can be accepted, provided the authors conduct a more thorough comparison with the aforementioned prior work and shift the focus toward the practical implications of their method.
