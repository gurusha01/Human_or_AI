This paper investigates the sample complexity of automated mechanism design for maximizing revenue in combinatorial auctions (CAs). Automated mechanism design, given a class of auction mechanisms, uses samples from bidders' valuation distributions (e.g., historical auction data) to select an auction mechanism that achieves high revenue. The authors establish several upper bounds on the sample complexities for different auction classes. While Morgenstern and Roughgarden (reference [19] in this paper) addressed the same problem of bounding sample complexities in CAs, their work focused exclusively on "simple auctions" reducible to single-bidder settings. In contrast, this paper explores a hierarchy of deterministic CA families based on VCG mechanisms. These auction classes are structurally more complex than sequential auctions and offer auctioneers greater flexibility in mechanism design. 
Specifically, the authors analyze the affine maximizer auction (AMA), the virtual valuation CA (VVCA), the lambda-auction, the mixed bundling auction with reserve prices (MBARPs), and the mixed bundling auction (MBA). For AMA, VVCA, and lambda-auction, the authors present certain negative results. They derive an exponential upper bound on the Rademacher complexity of the revenue function for AMA (Theorem 2), leading to an exponential upper bound on sample complexity for all three classes. Additionally, the authors provide two exponential lower bounds for lambda-auction and VVCA (Theorem 1). On the other hand, the less general models, MBARPs and MBA, yield more positive results. For MBA with two bidders, the authors demonstrate that the pseudo-dimension is 2 (Theorem 3) and establish a polynomial upper bound on sample complexity (Theorem 4). These results are then extended to the general case with n bidders (Theorems 5 and 6). Furthermore, polynomial upper bounds on the pseudo-dimension and sample complexity are provided for MBARPs.
This work builds on the foundational ideas introduced in [19], which applied learning theory to mechanism design problems and analyzed generalization error bounds. However, the present submission broadens the scope significantly by addressing a wider range of auction classes (affine maximizer auction, virtual valuation CA, lambda-auction, mixed bundling auction with reserve prices, and mixed bundling auction) and delivering more general results. The techniques and findings are compelling. Nevertheless, given that the core idea of applying learning theory to mechanism design was already established in prior work, I question whether the results presented here are sufficiently groundbreaking to merit publication at NIPS. That said, the paper is undoubtedly strong enough for other prominent conference venues.
