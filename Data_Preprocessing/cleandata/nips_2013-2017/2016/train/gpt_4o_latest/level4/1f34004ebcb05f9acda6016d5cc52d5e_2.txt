This paper formulates the Supervised PageRank models as a constrained non-convex optimization problem by incorporating node and edge properties. The authors propose two methods to address this optimization problem. The first is a gradient-free approach utilizing an inexact zero-order oracle, while the second is a gradient-based approach employing an inexact first-order oracle. My primary concern is that the experimental results are not included in the main text, which renders the paper incomplete. 
Detailed comments:  
1. The experimental results are presented in the supplementary material, leaving the main text incomplete.  
2. Theorem 1 assumes convexity, but the function in (2.4) is non-convex. How should the set $\Phi$ be chosen to ensure the convexity of the objective function?  
3. Theorem 3 establishes a bound for $MK(xK - x{K+1})$. Does this bound guarantee that the sequence $xk$ converges to a stationary point?  
4. Based on Figure 1 in the supplementary material, GFNM exhibits slow convergence. The authors should also consider reporting the efficiency of the proposed algorithms.
