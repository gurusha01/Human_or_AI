The paper thoroughly examines an important question: what potential advantages can quantum computing offer in the realm of machine learning? This is a challenging question to address, as many learning algorithms are characterized by either well-understood computational complexity or statistical complexity, but rarely both. The authors center their investigation on the well-studied perceptron model to explore the boundaries of quantum computing in machine learning. Their approach employs an integer discretization instead of the conventional floating-point representation and assumes the availability of quantum random access memory. The methodology hinges on a Grover-type search. The paper is carefully crafted and highly readable. A basic understanding of quantum mechanics suffices to grasp the core arguments. While the classical weight update scheme is admittedly simplistic, the authors provide extensive references to alternative algorithms, and this simplicity facilitates a clear and direct comparison with the quantum counterpart. Although Grover's search in machine learning is not a revolutionary concept, the rigorous exploration of its limitations fills a notable gap in the literature. The only significant shortcoming is the absence of citations to prior work on quantum perceptrons. In particular, Lewenstein (1994) studied quantum perceptrons through the lens of statistical learning theory, which closely aligns with the spirit of this paper. Reference: M. Lewenstein (1994).
