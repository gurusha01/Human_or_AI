The paper introduces a spectral method for analyzing nonlinear dynamical systems, leveraging the Koopman operator, which represents function composition as an operator. Specifically, the Koopman operator decomposition is applied to the forward nonlinear dynamics of the system, x(t+2) = f(f(x(t))). Using collected system trajectories, the authors perform an eigen-decomposition of the operator, drawing on concepts from kernel PCA and subspace analysis. The method is then applied to the embedding and recognition of dynamical systems, with results indicating strong performance. For an audience familiar with kernel methods, the novel contribution of the paper lies in demonstrating that function compositions can be represented as a linear operator, enabling interesting decompositions. Dynamical systems serve as a relevant application of this concept, being a specific instance of function composition. However, since the algorithm, dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), is already established in the dynamical systems literature, the paper's novelty appears to be limited to its kernelization. Moreover, alternative methods, such as recurrent neural networks, exist for recognizing dynamical systems and detecting changes. As such, the applications presented in the paper are not particularly compelling in showcasing the method's uniqueness or advantages.
