This paper primarily investigates whether it is feasible to decompose the observed rating matrix into the user's genuine preferences for items and the contribution of the recommendation system (RS). Under strong model assumptions, the authors introduce a singular value decomposition metric to extract users' true preferences from any given rating matrix. Additionally, the paper proposes a method to assess the influence of the RS on individual user-item rating pairs. Overall, I find this to be a solid piece of work addressing a challenging and novel problem. The task of understanding and quantifying the feedback loop has not been extensively explored, and this study serves as a pioneering effort in that direction. While the assumptions made in this work may not be entirely realistic, I recognize that they are, to some extent, necessary for deriving a theoretical solution. The same applies to the experimentsâ€”evaluating this work is inherently difficult due to the lack of ground truth RS data. Nevertheless, it appears that the authors have made a commendable effort to indirectly validate their model. My primary concern lies in the practical implications of this work. The paper does not clearly articulate the main applications of the proposed RS framework. For example, it would have been more compelling if the authors had demonstrated how the RS could be leveraged to enhance performance in a rating prediction task.
