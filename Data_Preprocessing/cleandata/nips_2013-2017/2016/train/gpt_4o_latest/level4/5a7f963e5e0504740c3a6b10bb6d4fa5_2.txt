This paper introduces an algorithm for compiling a Markov network into the PSDD representation of probability distributions, originally proposed by Kisa et al. (2014). The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can, in some cases, generate smaller arithmetic circuits compared to existing compilers. However, the level of novelty is limited, as the presented compilation algorithm closely resembles the one used for AND/OR Multi-Valued Decision Diagrams (AOMDDs), which are a specific subset of PSDDs. Notably, Theorem 6 is a straightforward extension of an analogous theorem already established for AOMDDs. Similarly, the multiplication algorithm described in Section 3 is essentially identical to the one used for SDDs, making its polynomial-time operation unsurprising. The primary contribution and significance of the paper lie in its experimental findings, which indicate that PSDD compilation may be more efficient than AOMDD compilation. A deeper analysis of the underlying reasons for these advantages would enhance the paper's impact.
The paper overlooks an important limitation regarding Theorem 6, which does not directly apply to the proposed compilation algorithm. While Theorem 6 establishes the existence of a compact PSDD, it does not guarantee that the algorithm will produce such a representation. In contrast, the corresponding theorem for AOMDDs ensures that the compiled representation will be compact. The paper is likely to appeal to a narrow audience, as it assumes familiarity with prior work by Darwiche (2011) and Kisa et al. (2014). For instance, Definition 6 is difficult to interpret. If each vtree node produces a single SDD ("the SDD"), it is unclear why the left child is described as having multiple SDDs. This definition appears to be adapted from Definition 5 in Darwiche (2011), which is much clearer. It is recommended to either revise this definition for clarity or directly adopt Definition 5 from Darwiche.
When discussing the connection between SDDs and PSDDs, it is crucial to emphasize (as Kisa et al. did) that the SDD underlying a PSDD is not compressed. However, Line 111 of the paper seems to imply otherwise. Additionally, the relationship between PSDDs and AOMDDs warrants a more thorough discussion, particularly the fact that AOMDDs are a special case of PSDDs. This distinction implies that PSDDs are more succinct but potentially less tractable than AOMDDs, as per the terminology of Darwiche (2011). This is exemplified by the fact that the AOMDD compilation algorithm has a provable upper bound based on treewidth, whereas the same algorithm for PSDDs lacks such a guarantee.
