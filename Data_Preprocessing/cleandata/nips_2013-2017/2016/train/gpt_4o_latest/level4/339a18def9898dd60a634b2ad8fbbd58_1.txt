The paper addresses the problem of labeling data obtained through crowdsourcing by modeling each worker as a noisy channel. Two specific channel models are examined: the symmetric memoryless channel without feedback and the spammer/hammer channel model. This formulation transforms the labeling task into a coding problem based on the chosen channel model. The authors analyze the relationship between the budget and the code rate, mapping the budget constraints to the rate of the code. The study explores the tradeoff between distortion and budget and introduces a basic coding scheme, referred to as k-incidence coding, which involves assigning crowdsourced tasks that require labeling subsets of k items simultaneously. While I found the paper to be reasonably engaging, it lies outside my primary area of expertise, so I do not have detailed feedback to provide.
