This paper demonstrates that the widely adopted non-convex objective function for matrix completion is free of spurious local minima. Consequently, gradient descent methods are capable of reaching the global optimum. The result appears to be highly significant, and the theoretical analysis is thorough and well-founded. I believe this work could represent a pivotal advancement in the field of matrix completion.
