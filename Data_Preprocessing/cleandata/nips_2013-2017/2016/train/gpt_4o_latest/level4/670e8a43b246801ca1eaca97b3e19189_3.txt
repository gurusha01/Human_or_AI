The authors introduce a Bayesian nonparametric approach for clustering data, focusing on scenarios where cluster sizes grow at a rate of o(n) rather than the O(n/log(n)) growth typically assumed in standard models like the Dirichlet process. Their method involves a generative framework where (1) the number of clusters is sampled from a specified distribution, followed by (2) the allocation of items to clusters based on another distribution. They present specific submodels depending on the priors chosen for (1) and (2), including a negative binomial/negative binomial (NBNB) model and a negative binomial/Dirichlet (NBD) model, which are evaluated on survey data. Addressing Bayesian clustering for small cluster sizes is both a challenging and relevant problem, as many real-world datasets exhibit numerous small clusters. 
Technical quality: The primary concern with the paper lies in model incoherence, as acknowledged by the authors. Incoherence implies that the marginal distributions derived from the full dataset do not necessarily align with those obtained from a subset of the data. While the model preserves data exchangeability, it does so at the expense of coherence. The trade-offs between exchangeability and incoherence in the context of microclustering are not sufficiently clarified. For instance, non-exchangeability may be a more plausible assumption for microclustering, yet the authors do not provide compelling counterexamples to justify their choice. While I do not consider incoherence to be an inherently disqualifying flaw, it requires more careful treatment. Specifically, the authors should address the following: Under what circumstances is this model appropriate? When is it unsuitable? What challenges arise when using this model as a generative framework?
Other aspects: The paper is generally well-written, the methods are competently executed, and the potential utility of the approach ranges from moderate to strong.
