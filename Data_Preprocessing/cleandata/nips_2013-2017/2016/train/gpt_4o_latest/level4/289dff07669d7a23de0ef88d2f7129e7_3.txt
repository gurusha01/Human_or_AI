This paper examines the Cholesky covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES) with both rank-1 and rank-\mu updates applied to the triangular Cholesky factor (in a sequence of rank-1 updates). Under the assumption of covariance convergence, the authors demonstrate that the modified cumulative step-size adaptation has no significant impact on the algorithm's behavior. Experimental results on algorithm performance are also provided. 
1. The paper focuses on the Cholesky CMA-ES and extends the update mechanism for the triangular Cholesky factor to include both rank-1 and rank-\mu updates. However, I find the contribution to be limited, given the prior work by Krause et al. (2015), which already employs rank-1 updates for the triangular Cholesky factor. This work essentially generalizes that approach to rank-\mu updates through a sequence of rank-1 updates. 
2. The convergence of the covariance matrix $C_t$ in CMA-ES has been theoretically analyzed in prior work (e.g., Beyer, ECJ, 2014), although such analyses are not based on the exact formulae of CMA-ES. This could lend some additional confidence to Lemma 1 presented in the paper. 
3. There are also a few issues that need to be addressed:  
   3.1. In equation (1), the denominator should use \sigma_t instead of \sigma. A similar issue is present in footnote 2 on page 3.  
   3.2. In line 94, the phrase "which can by be motivated by principles from ..." contains a typographical error, and the word "by" should be removed.
