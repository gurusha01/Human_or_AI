The paper provides a summary of previously published findings on bidirectional Monte Carlo and discusses its implementation using two probabilistic programming languages. The work appears to lack novel contributions, focusing instead on applying established methods within the WebPPL and Stan frameworks. This submission might be better suited for presentation at an MCMC-focused workshop.
