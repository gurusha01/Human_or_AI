This paper broadens the scope of Koopman spectral analysis by incorporating reproducing kernels. The proposed method is assessed using both simulated and real-world datasets. The manuscript is exceptionally well-written. However, I believe the paper could be further strengthened by addressing two additional aspects: first, including a comparison with non-RKHS Koopman spectral analysis in the simulation studies, and second, providing a discussion or investigation into the selection of kernels and their potential impact on the results, which could also be explored through simulations.
