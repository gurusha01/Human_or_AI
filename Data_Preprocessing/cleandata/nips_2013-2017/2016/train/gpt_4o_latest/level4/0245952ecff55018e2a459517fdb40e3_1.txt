This paper presents a neural network method based on a conditional maximum mean discrepancy criterion. The proposed approach is assessed on standard small benchmark tasks to evaluate both its discriminative and generative capabilities. Overall, this work represents an intriguing contribution to the subfield of deep learning research centered on generative models. The writing is fairly clear, though, as is common in this domain, the mathematical formulations can be somewhat challenging to follow at times. While the experimental tasks are relatively small in scale, they are not entirely out of line with those used in other recent studies in this area. Given that the model's training algorithm includes some computationally intensive steps, I recommend adding comments in the experimental section regarding the training time compared to existing methods such as DSN. Additionally, the paper would be significantly improved if reference code for the experiments were provided, as practitioners may find it difficult to replicate the exact models described in the paper based solely on the details in the model section.
