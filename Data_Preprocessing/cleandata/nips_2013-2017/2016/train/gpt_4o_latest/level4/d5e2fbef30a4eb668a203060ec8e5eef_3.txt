The paper introduces a sequential forward selection-based feature selection method capable of identifying high-order feature interactions. Additionally, the authors propose binary representations of features, which enhance the scalability of their feature selection approach. Empirical comparisons are presented to demonstrate its superior performance. [Technical quality] While the experimental methods are appropriate, there is room for improvement by including additional empirical experiments and providing more in-depth analysis of the results. [Novelty/originality] The methodology presented in this paper represents an incremental contribution. [Potential impact or usefulness] Although the potential impact of the work is not particularly significant, addressing high-order interactions in feature selection is a meaningful and important research problem. [Clarity and presentation] The overall presentation of the paper is satisfactory, but certain notations could lead to confusion. For instance, even though the authors clarify in Footnote 2 that I(f:g,h):=I(f;(g,h)), this abbreviation may still cause misunderstandings in several parts of the paper. For example, in Section 3.1, it would be clearer to use I(c;{f,H}) instead of I(c;f,H). Furthermore, in Footnote 2, the notation F={fi}{i=1}^{n} should be corrected to F=\cup{i=1}^{n}{fi}. The authors have done an excellent job summarizing related work, but they have overlooked a highly relevant study: "High-dimensional structured feature screening using binary Markov random fields" by Liu et al., 2012. [Qualitative assessment] Revising the paper, particularly by improving the notations, would significantly enhance its clarity. Expanding the experimental section with more comprehensive empirical studies would also strengthen the paper. Additionally, it would be valuable to investigate whether submodularity could be leveraged to provide theoretical insights into the proposed approach.
