The authors propose a method for dimensionality reduction in multi-class learning by leveraging a duality between SVMs and boosting. Specifically, the approach contrasts SVMs, which fix a feature transformation and optimize weights to define decision boundaries, with boosting, which fixes codewords and learns the transformation. Utilizing this duality, the authors develop the LADDER algorithm, which iteratively and efficiently updates both the codewords and the transformation. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through several experiments. The paper is well-structured and easy to comprehend. However, my primary concern lies with the experimental evaluation. For the hashing and retrieval tasks, the authors did not compare their method against several state-of-the-art approaches, such as SmartHash[1], FastHash[2], ShECC[3], OSH[4], and the method in [5], some of which outperform the proposed approach.

The authors should consider integrating their method into a state-of-the-art framework to demonstrate whether it can enhance performance. [6] Cimpoi, Mircea, Subhransu Maji, and Andrea Vedaldi.
