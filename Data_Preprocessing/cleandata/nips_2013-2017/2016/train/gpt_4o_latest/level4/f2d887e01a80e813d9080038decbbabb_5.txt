This paper introduces a tensor-decomposition-based approach for unsupervised risk estimation under the 3-view assumption. The proposed methodology is subsequently extended to develop a semi-supervised learning algorithm. The paper addresses an interesting and significant problem: risk estimation in the absence of labeled data. While some of the ideas presented are intriguing (though perhaps not particularly novel; see comments below), the overall contribution of the paper is borderline at this stage, and the final decision will depend on the rebuttal and subsequent discussion.
Questions/Comments:  
- The core idea relies on the 3-view assumption, where each view acts as an expert, and a consensus is sought among these experts. However, similar ideas have been explored previously, such as in "Estimating Accuracy from Unlabeled Data: A Bayesian Approach" (ICML 2016) and the references therein. A comparison with this line of work would be valuable.  
- Another related area is the "discrepancy"-based approaches by Ben-David et al. and Mohri et al. for domain adaptation. These methods do not rely on stringent 3-view assumptions and instead provide data-dependent guarantees, which contrasts with the results presented in this paper.  
- Can the 3-view assumption be empirically tested?  
- How realistic is this assumption in practice? For example, in the case of logistic regression, it appears to be analogous to the Naive Bayes assumption, which rarely holds in real-world scenarios.  
- How robust are the results if the 3-view assumption does not hold? Is there a way to quantify this robustness?  
- The experimental results are somewhat limited. It would be helpful to include more datasets and explore the robustness of the proposed approach. Since the 3-view assumption is unlikely to hold perfectly in practice, demonstrating the methodology's robustness under such conditions is crucial.  
- The paper includes a section discussing different structures, but there are no corresponding experiments. It would strengthen the paper to include results for these structures. Additionally, experiments with different loss functions would be valuable, as this aspect is heavily emphasized in the paper.
