The paper proposes the method of moments as a technique to estimate a classifier's error in an unsupervised manner. It assumes that the classifier can be decomposed into three conditionally independent parameters. While this is a strong generative assumption, the authors manage to establish a compelling result. They demonstrate how this approach can be leveraged in a semi-supervised setting to utilize both unlabeled data and a small number of labeled examples to improve performance. The findings are intriguing and make use of sophisticated and non-trivial tools, including the method of moments and tensor decomposition. The application of tensor decomposition in a semi-supervised context is particularly noteworthy and appears to yield significant performance gains. However, the assumptions made are quite strong, and it remains unclear how they could be validated in practical scenarios. Despite this, the paper presents an innovative classification method that holds promise for future research.
