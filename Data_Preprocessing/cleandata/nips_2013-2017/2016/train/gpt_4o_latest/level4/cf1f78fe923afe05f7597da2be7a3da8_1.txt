The authors introduce a practical algorithm designed for near-isometric embedding of manifold data. Building on prior theoretical advancements, they formulate an optimization problem aimed at minimizing the discrepancy between the Riemannian metric of the embedded data and that of the original ambient data. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques. I appreciate the overall methodology of estimating the local Riemannian metric to achieve near-isometric embedding of manifold data. However, given that the optimization criterion is non-convex, it would be beneficial to include a detailed discussion on the following points: - how the initial embedding influences the final outcome, and - since the solution relies on an iterative gradient descent approach, a quantitative comparison of its computational efficiency relative to standard eigendecomposition methods. Minor comments: - I suggest that the authors discuss the 'NuMax' algorithm in the related work section (referencing: "NuMax: a convex approach for learning near-isometric linear embeddings" by Hedge et al.). - The term "relaxation" in the title is unclear. The authors might consider rephrasing it for clarity. - There are minor typographical errors in lines 77 and 82, along with a potential missing square term in the integral of Eq. 4.
