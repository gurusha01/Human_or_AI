Given noisy linear observations of an underlying model, the authors address an \(\ell1\)-norm minimization problem constrained by data fidelity conditions expressed as \(\ell\alpha\)-norms of the error. They provide support recovery guarantees for this optimization framework. While some proofs focus on specific cases involving \(\ell1\) and \(\ell\infty\) constraints, the authors also offer valuable insights into results applicable to general \(\ell\alpha\) constraints for \(\alpha \geq 1\). The paper is excellently presented, with Figure 2 offering an intuitive understanding of the behavior of \(\ell\alpha\) constraints. 
A suggestion: it would be intriguing to visualize Figure 2 with \(1/\alpha\) plotted against \(k\). This might reveal a symmetric pattern around \(\alpha = 2\), as \(1/\alpha\) appears to be a natural parameter for analyzing the behavior of \(\ell\alpha\)-norms. Additionally, in the numerical experiments, it would be helpful to discuss the impact of the choice of \(x0\) (equal nonzero values in absolute magnitude) on the results.
Minor corrections:  
- Line 118: Replace "is often coined" with "is coined as" or "is often referred to as."  
- At the start of Section 2, it would be helpful to describe the names of the two equations (FO) within the text.  
- Line 139: The symbol "r" should not be bold.  
- Line 186: The first sentence could be rephrased for clarity.  
- Improve the spacing of figure captions for better readability.
