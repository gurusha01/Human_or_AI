The authors present a framework for semi-supervised active clustering, where the learner interacts with a domain expert through same-cluster queries. Assuming the expert adopts a k-center-based solution with a specified separability, the authors introduce an efficient probabilistic polynomial-time algorithm to identify the optimal clustering. They demonstrate that while certain separable instances make k-means clustering NP-hard, these instances can be efficiently solved with access to a relatively small number of same-cluster queries. Notably, the query complexity is shown to be close to the lower bound established in the paper. The manuscript is well-written, clearly motivated, and provides significant theoretical contributions to a challenging problem. I found it highly engaging and particularly appreciated the exploration of the phase transition behavior of the k-means objective as it relates to instance niceness. The result that a small number of same-cluster queries can transform an otherwise NP-hard problem into an efficiently solvable one is particularly compelling. 
That said, I would like to raise the following points for consideration:  
1. The framework assumes a perfect oracle. However, in practice, oracles may make mistakes. It would be valuable to explore what assumptions about the oracle are necessary to ensure the problem remains efficiently solvable.  
2. The practical benefits of the proposed approach are not entirely clear. For example, under a probabilistic model where the data satisfies the required separation condition, how does the proposed algorithm compare to k-means approximations like k-means++ in terms of time-quality tradeoff? It is possible that k-means++ performs exceptionally well under the same separability assumptions, and a comparison would provide useful insights.  
3. The analysis assumes that the expert adheres to a hard center-based clustering. Do the results extend to scenarios where the goal is to recover a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and the oracle provides probabilistic cluster assignments? With sufficient separation and reasonable assumptions on the covariance matrices, the two problems seem closely related, and it would be interesting to see if the findings generalize to this setting.  
Minor comment: In Theorem 7, "clustering instane" should be corrected to "clustering instance."
