This paper introduces formal definitions and metrics for assessing the robustness of neural networks against small input perturbations. It demonstrates the application of these metrics to evaluate the robustness of deep networks on MNIST and CIFAR datasets. Additionally, the paper outlines how the proposed metrics can be approximated and encoded using a linear programming framework. The study provides empirical evidence suggesting that prior methods addressing robustness through adversarial examples may lead to overfitting on those examples. Notably, the proposed approach is shown to enhance robustness with respect to both existing metrics and the newly introduced ones. 
The work offers a technically rigorous examination of robustness to input perturbations in neural networks, particularly in the context of adversarial examples. It introduces a novel formulation for defining and approximating metrics based on two proposed definitions: (a) adversarial severity and (b) adversarial frequency. As noted in the manuscript, the proposed adversarial frequency metric "corresponds to the accuracy on adversarial examples used to measure robustness in [5, 19]," while "severity can be used to differentiate between neural nets with similar adversarial frequency." I commend the technical precision in defining these metrics, developing a linear programming approach to approximate them, and leveraging this approach to generate or identify adversarial examples that can improve robustness. A key insight of the work lies in restricting the analysis to the local linear regime of neural networks with ReLU activations, thereby simplifying the problem.
However, the manuscript should provide greater clarity regarding the non-convexity of disjunctions discussed in lines 197â€“212. It is unclear whether the proposed strategy for handling disjunctions results in another approximation or an exact (convex) reformulation. The authors should address this in their response, specifying the exact language they would incorporate into the manuscript to clarify this point. 
The experimental work is reasonably well executed, though demonstrating a more significant practical impact in the CIFAR experiments would have strengthened the contribution. Overall, based on the value added by the technical analysis, the linear programming-based convex optimization formulation, and the experimental results, I assign this paper a solid poster rating.
