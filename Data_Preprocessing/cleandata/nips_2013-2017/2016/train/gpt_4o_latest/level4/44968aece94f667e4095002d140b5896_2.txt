Problem Studied  
This paper examines a model of online pricing with patient buyers. In this framework, a seller has an unlimited inventory, and buyers arrive sequentially at each time step. Buyers are patient and willing to wait, with each buyer \(i\) having a maximum waiting time of \(\tau_i \leq \tau\) steps. The seller posts a price for the next \(\tau\) steps, and each buyer selects the time within their waiting period that offers the lowest price. The seller's objective is to maximize revenue. The paper proposes an algorithm with regret \(\tau^{1/3} \cdot n^{1/3} \cdot T^{2/3}\) (where \(n\) is the number of possible prices that can be posted) and establishes a lower bound of \(\tau^{1/3} \cdot T^{2/3}\).  
Contributions of the Paper  
- The model explored in this work is compelling, as there has been a significant body of research on posted pricing for selling items. However, prior work does not adequately address the scenario where buyers can wait for a lower price. This paper tackles this gap by introducing a reasonable assumption that each buyer has an upper limit on their waiting time.  
- The proposed algorithm is intuitive yet non-trivial. It does not directly follow from existing literature and requires the seller to post the same price for slightly longer than \(\tau\) time steps to accurately estimate the probability of sale at a given price.  
- The lower bound is significant and is derived through a reduction to the problem of bandits with switching costs.  
Overall, this is a well-executed and interesting paper. The primary area for improvement would be achieving matching upper and lower bounds with respect to the number of arms.
