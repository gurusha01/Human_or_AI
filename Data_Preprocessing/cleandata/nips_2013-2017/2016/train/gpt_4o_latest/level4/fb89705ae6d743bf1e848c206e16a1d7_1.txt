The authors propose a vine copula model designed to handle high-dimensional datasets comprising mixed observation types (both continuous and discrete). The model can be fitted to data, and sampling-based estimates enable the computation of information-theoretic quantities. This approach appears to be both practical and relevant for researchers aiming to model complex datasets with heterogeneous observation types, such as neuron spike counts alongside continuous calcium signals. However, a general concern for applying this model in neuroscientific contexts is the absence of explicit inclusion of external variables, such as visual stimuli. Would incorporating external variables like visual stimuli or motor outputs into the model be challenging or computationally intractable? Furthermore, while the model accommodates diverse observation types, preparing data for this framework might prove challenging: for instance, continuous calcium signals are recorded at a much lower sampling rate compared to intracellular voltage signals.
