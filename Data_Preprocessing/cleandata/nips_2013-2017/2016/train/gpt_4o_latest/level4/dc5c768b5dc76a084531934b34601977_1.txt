The paper addresses the concept referred to by the authors as churn and introduces a specific regularization approach for classifiers to mitigate it. This appears to be a novel and intriguing idea with the potential to inspire further research. However, I find it challenging to fully assess its impact. The notion that "churn" is undesirable seems reasonable, and the proposed regularization approach appears to be a suitable method for curbing excessive churn. That said, the theoretical results do not seem to provide much guidance on how to select alpha and epsilon in practical scenarios. Additionally, I am unclear as to why the authors describe the method in Section 2.2 as a Markov chain Monte Carlo rather than simply a Markov chain. Overall, the results presented are promising.
