This paper proposes a novel criterion, termed the product cut, for graph partitioning as an alternative to the widely used normalized cut. The authors present an exact continuous relaxation for minimizing the product cut, provided the graph is connected, and solve the relaxed problem using sequential linear programming. The motivation behind introducing the product cut appears to be the desire to enforce stronger balance among the components of the partition. However, the literature already contains a variety of balanced cut criteria [Ref1] that address the imbalance issue highlighted in the paper. A comparison with these existing criteria is necessary to evaluate the advantages of the product cut. 
The authors rely on a relatively old method [14] to argue that normalized cut criteria produce highly imbalanced partitions on real-world data. It would be more appropriate to use recent methods [Ref1, Ref2], which have been shown to yield improved normalized cuts. Additionally, it seems that the authors use the fully dense smoothed version (\(\Gamma\alpha\)) to minimize the normalized cut instead of the similarity matrix \(W\), which is more commonly used in the literature. A critical limitation of the proposed continuous relaxation is that it only works when the product cut is defined on the fully dense matrix (\(\Gamma\alpha\)); otherwise, the objective function becomes ill-defined due to the logarithmic term (see lines 169-170). This represents a significant modeling constraint.
The algorithm for solving the continuous relaxation encounters early termination issues (line 197). To address this, the authors incorporate a random subset of the constraints initially and progressively add more constraints. Furthermore, to handle large datasets, the algorithm employs several approximations, such as those used for solving the two linear systems in each iteration. As a result, it remains unclear how effectively the proposed algorithm minimizes the product cut.
Experiments:
It is unusual that the authors report the average purity over 500 different runs for the product cut. Instead, they should report the purity corresponding to the best initialization, as determined by the product cut criterion. The experiments lack comparisons with recent methods [Ref1, Ref2] that minimize the normalized cut. Additionally, comparisons with other balanced cut criteria from [Ref1] are necessary to demonstrate the benefits of the product cut. Notably, the NMFR method [13] achieves clustering purity values that are nearly identical to those of the product cut. It would be insightful to evaluate the product cut values achieved by the partitions generated by NMFR and other methods, even if they do not directly minimize the product cut. This would help assess the effectiveness of the proposed approach in minimizing the product cut.
