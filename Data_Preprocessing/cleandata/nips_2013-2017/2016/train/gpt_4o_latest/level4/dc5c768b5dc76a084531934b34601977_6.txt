Machine learning algorithms typically require numerous training iterations and continuous refinement of the feature set, using a stream of training examples as input. In such scenarios, it is important to observe statistically significant improvements in the model's performance over successive iterations. The authors introduce a novel concept termed "churn," which quantifies whether a refined model (after additional training) demonstrates a statistically significant improvement compared to its earlier version. Additionally, the authors propose a new training scheme that can be applied to a wide range of classifiers to minimize churn, thereby ensuring that the model's improvement is meaningful. Through experimental results, the authors demonstrate a substantial reduction in the "churn" metric by applying their approach to three different classifiers across three distinct datasets.  
Pros: The introduction of the "churn" metric is particularly valuable in scenarios where classifiers are trained on a continuous stream of input data. Minimizing churn ensures that the additional computational resources expended lead to meaningful performance gains.  
Suggestions: In Table 3, the definitions of V1 and V2 are unclear. I assumed they represent the accuracies of classifiers A and B, respectively. Clarifying this would be helpful. Additionally, providing some intuition behind why Eqn 2 and the equation for the Diplopia operator effectively reduce churn would enhance the paper's clarity.
