The paper extends several recent incremental algorithms (such as SVRG, SAGA, and their accelerated variants via Catalyst) to address strongly convex-concave saddle point problems with a finite-sum structure, arising from two possible types of splits: individual or factored splits. The authors conduct a comprehensive analysis of the complexity of these algorithms under different splits and sampling strategies (both uniform and nonuniform). Experiments on a specific binary classification example demonstrate that nonuniform sampling and acceleration are crucial for outperforming competitive batch algorithms. While the concept of applying variance reduction and incremental algorithms to saddle point problems may initially appear straightforward, the results presented in this work are notably innovative, and the technical contributions are non-trivial. For the important case of bilinear saddle point problems, the authors provide a clear comparison between batch, stochastic, and incremental FB algorithms, which aligns with known results for convex minimization problems, and the findings are intuitive and reasonable.
However, I have a significant concern. While solving the saddle point problem addresses the challenge of non-separability in loss functions, the proposed incremental algorithms appear to face a fundamental limitation: the O(n + d) cost of computing the proximal operator at each iteration. Consequently, the overall complexity, even for the accelerated SVRG with nonuniform sampling (as shown in Tables 1 and 2), does not necessarily outperform the accelerated batch version. This issue is particularly pronounced when the number of data points, n, is much larger than the dimension, d, which is common in most machine learning applications. Under factored splits (used in the simulations), the complexity is actually worse than that of the batch FB algorithms, as shown in Table 2. Unlike the convex minimization setting, I do not observe a clear theoretical advantage of using variance reduction in this context. I recommend that the authors provide a more detailed discussion on this issue and address the following questions: (i) Is the factored split (theoretically) worse than the individual split? (ii) Under what conditions is the accelerated SVRG preferable to the batch FB? (iii) Is the dependence on n and d sufficiently tight?
Post-rebuttal response: I have reviewed the authors' rebuttal and am satisfied with their response. My scores remain unchanged.
