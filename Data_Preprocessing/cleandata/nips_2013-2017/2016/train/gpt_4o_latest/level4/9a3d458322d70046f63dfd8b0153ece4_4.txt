This paper introduces a novel formulation for robust optimization that unifies the maximization over policies and minimization over transition models into a single framework. The proposed objective simultaneously accounts for the performance of the proposed policy and the baseline policy under a shared (minimized) model. This approach enables policy improvement even in the presence of substantial uncertainties in the transition probabilities. Traditional robust optimization frameworks evaluate the baseline policy under the most optimistic model and the proposed policy under the most pessimistic model. However, in certain domains, this approach can be overly stringent, as the most pessimistic model may never achieve an expectation comparable to the most optimistic model, regardless of the number of samples used to construct the model. By jointly considering the baseline and proposed policies, the new formulation avoids the need to wait until the proposed policy definitively outperforms the baseline policy's optimistic performance. While I lack extensive expertise in robust optimization and cannot fully assess this work within the broader context of the field, I find the reformulation compelling. My primary concern lies in the potential additional computational cost of optimizing this formulation. Given that the authors establish the NP-hardness of the problem, their focus on promising approximation algorithms is appropriate. Minor point: I may have misunderstood, but the assumption that transition probabilities are known for actions consistent with the baseline policy seems unrealistic in the energy market example. Does this imply that the action involves controlling the price? I would be interested in further clarification on this aspect.
