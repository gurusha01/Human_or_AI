In this paper, the authors proposed a theoretical framework based on vine copulas to model stochastic systems with mixed (continuous and discrete) variables. They demonstrated the utility of this framework for generating samples, calculating probability densities, and inferring parameters from empirical data. The method was further applied to simulated neuronal dynamics to extract information jointly encoded by local field potentials (continuous variables) and spiking activities (discrete variables). By extending vine copulas to accommodate mixed variables, this work introduces a potentially valuable approach for jointly analyzing local field potentials and spiking activities.  
Technical quality: Overall, the technical aspects appear sound. However, there are areas that could be improved. For instance, in Figure 2, it would be helpful to include the results of the best-fitting mixed vine-based model alongside the ground truth model for comparison. Additionally, in Figure 3, it seems that a classifier based on the independent model performs significantly better. Why is this the case? Does the vine-based model introduce spurious information, or is it a limitation of accurately estimating parameters for more complex models with limited sample sizes?  
Novelty: The approach is novel, achieved through a relatively straightforward extension of previously established methods.  
Potential usefulness: There are two main concerns regarding the method's practical applicability:  
1. How feasible is it to accurately infer parameters in high-dimensional systems?  
2. The somewhat unexpected results in Figure 3B raise questions. If an independent model outperforms the proposed method in extracting information, how practical is this approach for real-world applications, such as brain-machine interfaces?  
Clarity of the presentation: It would be beneficial to more clearly explain the importance of combining local field potentials and spikes. Specifically, what additional insights does this provide compared to conventional methods?
