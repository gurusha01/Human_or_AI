This manuscript presents a dimensionality reduction method, which is developed by establishing a margin-based duality between SVMs and boosting. The proposed discriminant-based LADDER algorithm is rigorously analyzed, with the objective of learning a discriminant space of minimal dimensionality. While the experimental evaluation is somewhat limited, the discussion provides meaningful insights within the sign domain. The authors are encouraged to run a spell checker, as there are a few minor typographical errors.
