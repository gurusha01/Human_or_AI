In this paper, the authors present a coreset-based approach for feature selection (dimensionality reduction) tailored to very large-scale sparse matrices. The method leverages an efficient algorithm to compute the coreset, accompanied by a theoretical analysis of the bounds on its size and running time. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed method's effectiveness and superiority. The manuscript is well-written and well-structured. However, certain issues should be addressed. For instance, in Definition 1, the constraint on \( w_i \) should be made consistent.
