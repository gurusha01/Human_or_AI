The paper addresses the challenge of enhancing a baseline policy in the context of an MDP with known uncertainty in its transition dynamics. The authors propose an approach that involves solving an optimization problem aimed at maximizing the difference in returns between the new policy and the baseline policy, under the worst-case model within the uncertainty set. By using the same model for both the new policy and the baseline, the formulation is less conservative compared to a standard robust MDP. However, the authors demonstrate that this problem is NP-hard and subsequently introduce a heuristic approximation, which is supported by empirical validation. I found the paper to be an enjoyable read. The examples provided throughout are insightful, and the theoretical contributions are presented with clarity. The proposed optimization problem is thoroughly explored, and the comparisons with existing algorithms are compelling. While robust MDPs have been studied extensively, they are often criticized for being overly conservative and impractical. This novel application offers a promising direction to address such concerns, and I hope it fosters broader adoption of robust MDP frameworks. 
That said, I have one concern that I would like the authors to address: If my understanding is correct, Algorithm 1 does not offer theoretical guarantees for either safety or performance due to the heuristic approximation. If this is the case, how does it compare to simply solving the robust MDP: maxpi min{\xi \in \Xi(\hat{P}, e)} \rho(\pi,\xi)? (i.e., Algorithm 2 without the safety criterion in line 2 of Algorithm 2). This alternative seems like a reasonable baseline for empirical comparison, as it would help quantify the impact of the proposed heuristic modification to the uncertainty set. Since neither approach provides guarantees, there is no clear justification for preferring Algorithm 2 over this baseline.
Minor comments:  
- Line 134: This is subjective, but I believe examples would be more readable if given their own numbering.  
- Line 166: The problem of simultaneously minimizing the returns of two MDPs could be of independent interest. Is it a novel result that this problem is NP-hard? Does your proof extend to this general case? If so, it might be worth presenting it as a standalone contribution.
