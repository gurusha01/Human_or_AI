This paper proposes a method for unsupervised learning of similarities between exemplars. It tackles the challenge of selecting appropriate positive and negative examples for CNN-based similarity training. The proposed approach consists of two main steps. First, an optimization problem is solved to identify samples with mutually consistent relations. Next, a ConvNet is trained to learn a unified representation for all the samples. This process is iterativeâ€”the CNN is trained, and cliques/batches are recomputed based on similarities derived from the previous iteration. The authors demonstrate results on sports-related action datasets as well as the PASCAL image classification task. Overall, the paper effectively introduces an iterative algorithm for exemplar-based similarity learning using CNNs. The proposed method addresses several key challenges associated with exemplar "single-positive" approaches.  
Pros:  
- The algorithm performs well compared to baseline methods.  
Cons:  
- The computational complexity of the "mutually consistent relations" algorithm is not discussed.  
- It is unclear whether the algorithm could be improved by enhancing the selection of mutually consistent cliques or by improving the CNN training process.  
- Figures 1 and 4 lack clarity.
