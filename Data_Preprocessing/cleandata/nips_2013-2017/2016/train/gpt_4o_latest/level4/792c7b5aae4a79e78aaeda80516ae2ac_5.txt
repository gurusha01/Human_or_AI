This paper examines the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm applied to balanced mixtures of two Gaussians with known variance, focusing on the estimation of the means. It addresses key questions regarding the rate of convergence and the accuracy of the EM algorithm. The primary approach involves the analysis of Population EM, with stationary points of both EM and Population EM being thoroughly characterized. The findings are clearly presented and accompanied by sufficient commentary. This work holds practical significance as it bridges the gap between the theoretical properties of the maximum likelihood estimate and its computation via EM. The emphasis on asymptotic behavior provides a complementary perspective to existing literature.  
Remarks:  
- Another natural direction would be to explore the simultaneous estimation of both the means and variances, as well as mixtures involving more than two Gaussians.  
- A discussion on the robustness of EM under model misspecification could have been includedâ€”for instance, examining the behavior of EM when the data are generated from a single Gaussian.
