This paper investigates the support recovery guarantees of variants of the relaxed basis pursuit algorithm. Instead of the traditional l2 loss, the study focuses on l1 loss and infinity loss. This work extends the existing theoretical framework for the l2 loss case. The main theorem provides guarantees for support recovery under a specific small noise level assumption. The primary contribution of this paper lies in offering detailed support recovery guarantees for the l1 and infinity loss variants of relaxed basis pursuit, thereby completing the theoretical analysis of this problem in these particular cases. The paper clearly outlines the problem setup, main results, and experimental findings. There is a minor typo, such as on line 62, where "explicitely" should be corrected.
Below are some key weaknesses of the paper:  
- The motivation for using l1 loss and infinity loss stems from different noise models. However, the simulations do not clarify which noise model is being used. It would be valuable to examine how the three methods perform under distinct noise models. The simulations primarily demonstrate that l2 loss is superior for support recovery. Without presenting practically relevant cases, the theoretical support recovery guarantees may lack broader appeal.  
- Theorem 1 is restricted to a small noise setting and does not provide insights for scenarios with higher noise levels. As mentioned in line 215, it is possible that Theorem 1 is only valid in cases where no noise is present. The authors are encouraged to elaborate on the implications of larger noise levels, either through theoretical analysis or additional simulations.  
- While the paper provides most of the essential details about the numerical experiments, the noise level used in the experiments is not specified. This omission should be addressed for clarity and reproducibility.
