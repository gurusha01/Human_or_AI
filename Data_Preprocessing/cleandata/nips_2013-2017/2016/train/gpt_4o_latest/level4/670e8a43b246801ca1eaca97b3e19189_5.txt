The paper introduces two innovative models for microclustering. Traditional model-based clustering approaches often rely on latent (allocation) variables, such as those implied by Dirichlet (or related) process mixture models, which typically result in linear growth of cluster sizes. In contrast, this work achieves sublinear cluster size growth (demonstrated empirically through simulations rather than theoretically) by relaxing the "consistence in distribution" assumption. The paper is highly engaging, well-written, and aligns well with a conference like NIPS, as it presents novel methodology (both model and algorithm) to address significant applications, such as entity resolution. I would appreciate additional insights or discussion regarding the microclustering property, or references to ongoing research on the topic, either within the main text or in Appendix B. For example, the log-log plot in Fig. 2 of Appendix B suggests a power-law decay of M_N/N with an exponent close to 0.8, and it would be intriguing to see commentary on this observation. Additionally, note that both plots in Fig. 2 are identical (i.e., they share the same Monte Carlo error), and they should be updated. Also, correct the caption to specify "top/bottom."  
Minor comments:  
- Correct the subscript N in Eq. (3) and on line 85.  
- On page 4, footnote 3: Shouldn't the partitions C_N be ordered for zeta to be well-defined? While this is primarily a matter of notation, I suggest denoting them as, for example, ({1, 3, 4}, {2, 5}, {6}) instead of {{1, 3, 4}, {2, 5}, {6}}.  
- Ensure consistent notation for partition space on lines 81 and 151, such as using \mathcal{C}_N throughout.  
- On line 287, clarify that K = |C_N|.  
- After line 298, use the same Gamma parameters as those introduced in the main text on line 100.  
- On line 303, in the displayed equation, correct c \in C_N.
