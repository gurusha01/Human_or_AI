The paper introduces an object proposal algorithm that leverages reinforcement learning formulated as an MDP, along with a novel tree-structured search framework enabling the discovery of multiple objects in a single pass through two well-defined actions: translation and scale search. When combined with detection procedures, the proposed algorithm not only enhances performance on the object proposal task but also demonstrates its utility in object detection. The core idea of employing a tree-structured search scheme with multiple policies to identify multiple objects in a single pass is innovative, intuitive, and well-conceived. The approach is both technically robust and original, though the foundational MDP model (e.g., 13 actions) appears to be adapted and extended from prior work. The experiments are thoughtfully designed and effectively validate the proposed method's efficacy. However, I would recommend including detection results where either VGG or ResNet is consistently used as a baseline and in the proposed algorithm for better comparison. Additionally, while the authors claim that their object proposal improves detection performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, the reported mAP (~76%) appears to be somewhat lower than the best detection results currently available in the literature. Overall, the paper is well-written and has the potential to make a significant impact.
