The authors examine a variation of k-means known as robust k-means. They analyze its theoretical characteristics, focusing on its robustness and consistency. Their findings demonstrate that the presence of just two outliers can cause this clustering method to fail. However, if the data possesses the "well-structured" properties as defined by the authors, the algorithm is capable of recovering the cluster structure despite the outliers. Additionally, the authors establish the asymptotic behavior of the modified robust k-means approach. The paper is technically sound and presented in an engaging manner (I did not notice any grammatical errors). The research questions are clearly articulated. The authors identify the limitations of the existing robust k-means method and propose a solution to address these shortcomings. The paper offers compelling theoretical contributions.
