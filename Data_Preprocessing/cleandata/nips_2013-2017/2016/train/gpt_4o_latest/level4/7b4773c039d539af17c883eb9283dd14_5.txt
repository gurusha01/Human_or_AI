This paper introduces a novel algorithm, TrailBlazer, designed for Monte-Carlo Planning. The authors rigorously analyze and present the sample complexity of their proposed algorithm, extending their results to scenarios involving an infinite number of states. The paper makes a significant and original contribution by proposing the TrailBlazer algorithm, which demonstrates strong sampling efficiency and computational effectiveness. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on maintaining upper and lower bounds of the value function, this work innovatively employs two distinct parameters to manage errorâ€”one controlling variance and the other addressing bias. The authors further substantiate their approach by proving the sample complexity of their algorithm. Notably, their claim that the framework achieves polynomial sample complexity even in the presence of infinite states is compelling. Additionally, the algorithm avoids the need to visit all policies, which enhances its computational efficiency. Overall, this is a well-executed and high-quality paper.
