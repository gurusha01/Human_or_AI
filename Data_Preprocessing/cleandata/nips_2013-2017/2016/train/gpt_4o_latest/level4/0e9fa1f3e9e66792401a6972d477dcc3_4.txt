This paper introduces a method, referred to as AutoBDMC, for evaluating MCMC convergence. The proposed approach leverages the recently-developed Bidirectional Monte Carlo method to compute stochastic upper and lower bounds for the log marginal likelihood, utilizing annealed importance sampling in the process. The authors demonstrate that the gap between these bounds serves as a measure of the Jensen-Shannon divergence between the true posterior and the approximate sample distribution, thereby offering a single scalar metric to assess MCMC convergence. While the method is limited to analyzing convergence on synthetic data generated from the joint distribution, the authors provide experimental evidence suggesting that its performance on synthetic data is indicative of its behavior on real-world data. Additionally, they showcase applications of the method for tasks such as model selection and debugging. 
Overall, I found the paper to be well-written and its motivation clearly articulated. The proposed method appears to be both practical and valuable, with experimental results that are reasonably convincing. However, I found Section 3 to be notably more difficult to follow compared to the rest of the paper. The transition into Section 3.1, in particular, feels abrupt, as it introduces variables and equations without sufficient context or motivation. If the divergence bound presented in Section 3.1 is indeed a novel contribution (as I believe it to be), this should be explicitly stated, as the paper's primary contribution seems to rest on this result. Furthermore, the precise definition of AutoBDMC is unclear. Based on my understanding, AutoBDMC appears to refer to the application of AIS and rAIS for analyzing MCMC convergence, but this is never explicitly clarified in the paper. By the time Section 3.2 mentions that "â€¦this poses a challenge for AutoBDMC," the term should already have been clearly defined.
A few additional comments: 
- Line 149: Should p(theta, z | y) instead be p(theta, z, y)? 
- Notational inconsistencies: The paper alternates between using y and D to denote data/observations, which can be confusing. 
- WebPPL code in the supplemental material: This should include (a) the version(s) of WebPPL that the code is compatible with, and (b) instructions on how to integrate it into the WebPPL distribution. Ideally, the authors could release this as a WebPPL package installable via npm. Similarly, if feasible, providing a corresponding release for the Stan version of the code would be highly beneficial.
