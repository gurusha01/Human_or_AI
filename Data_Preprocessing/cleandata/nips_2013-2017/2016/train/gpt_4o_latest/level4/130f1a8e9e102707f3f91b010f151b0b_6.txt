A novel regularization technique for matrix factorization is proposed, aiming to enforce both sparsity and smoothness. While the existence of a solution is not formally established, the paper provides an algorithm to compute a solution. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method outperforms the current state-of-the-art approach. The introduction of a new regularizer within the optimization framework is a notable strength of the paper. The experimental findings highlight the potential of the proposed approach. However, as acknowledged by the author(s), the problem is non-convex, and the existence of a solution remains unproven. Furthermore, the algorithm's justification relies solely on empirical evidence. Another concern is the quality of the writing, which requires improvement, for example, at line 146.  
RE: after rebuttal  
I am satisfied with the response regarding the algorithm's presentation. Consequently, I am willing to revise my rating for Clarity and Presentation from 2 to 3.
