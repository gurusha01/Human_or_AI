This paper conducts a spectral analysis of the Koopman (composition) operator in RKHSs and introduces a modal decomposition algorithm to facilitate this analysis. The authors also propose a method to enhance robustness and provide several numerical experiments to demonstrate the practical utility of their approach. The proposed framework extends "dynamical mode decomposition" through the application of the kernel trick.  
Strengths of the paper:  
The paper is exceptionally well-written and systematically organized. The authors clearly articulate the various theoretical concepts underpinning the derivation of their method, which I find highly intriguing. Furthermore, the work is technically sound. While there is no in-depth comparison with state-of-the-art approaches, the numerical experiments adequately illustrate the method's utility, which I believe is sufficient for this context.  
Major flaws:  
In my opinion, the primary issue with this paper lies in Section 3.1, particularly Equation (7) and the proof of Theorem 1, which I find difficult to fully comprehend. First, Equation (7) appears to be quite similar to Equation (2), raising the question of its purpose. Second, Equation (7) seems inconsistent to me because \( KH \) is a linear operator mapping \( H \) to itself, while \( \phi \) is clearly not in \( H \) (it is a function mapping \( M \) to \( H \)). Could the authors provide a more detailed explanation of this point? This inconsistency also casts doubt on the proof presented in Lines 144â€“157. Additionally, the phrase "by applying the operator \( KH \) to both sides" (Line 149) is unclear to me. Since both sides are scalar values, the operator \( K_H : H \to H \) does not seem applicable.  
The assumptions in Theorem 1 also appear to be quite strong and not explicitly stated. Could the authors clarify these assumptions? Furthermore, additional assumptions emerge in the proof of the theorem. Why are these additional assumptions necessary, and can they be satisfied easily?

- Line 153: Replace \( \kappai / \lambdai \) with \( \kappaj / \lambdaj \)
