This paper introduces a large-scale online dictionary learning framework aimed at identifying significant brain regions. The topic is undoubtedly intriguing. However, the paper lacks any theoretical analysis to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Additionally, the authors appear to have been somewhat careless in preparing the manuscript. For instance, a comment such as "146 XXX: I don't understand the switch between V and v." remains in the submitted version, suggesting the draft was not thoroughly reviewed prior to submission.
