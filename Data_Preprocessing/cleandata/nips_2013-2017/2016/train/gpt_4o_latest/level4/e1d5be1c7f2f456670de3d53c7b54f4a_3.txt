This paper addresses the problem of contextual combinatorial semi-bandits and introduces learning algorithms leveraging supervised learning oracles for two scenarios: (1) the case with known weights and (2) the case with unknown weights. The authors derive regret bounds for both settings (Theorem 1 and 2) and provide preliminary experimental results (Section 6). Overall, this is an intriguing and valuable contribution, and I believe it meets the standard for a NIPS poster. Notably, to the best of my knowledge, this is the first work to tackle contextual combinatorial semi-bandits with unknown weights. That said, there are areas where the paper could be further refined, and I encourage the authors to address the following points in the final version: 1) Regarding Theorem 2: the O(T^{2/3}) regret bound is somewhat disappointing, as I would expect an O(T^{1/2}) regret bound. If the authors believe the O(T^{2/3}) bound is fundamental to the problem, they should provide a discussion. Alternatively, if the bound arises from limitations in the analysis, the authors should clarify which specific step in the analysis leads to this suboptimal bound. 2) Algorithm 2 is challenging to follow. I recommend revising the motivation and explanation to make it more accessible. 3) There is a recent paper on contextual combinatorial semi-bandits that is directly relevant and should be cited: @article{wen2014efficient, title={Efficient learning in large-scale combinatorial semi-bandits}, author={Wen, Zheng and Kveton, Branislav and Ashkan, Azin}, journal={http://jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v37/wen15.html}, year={2014} }.
