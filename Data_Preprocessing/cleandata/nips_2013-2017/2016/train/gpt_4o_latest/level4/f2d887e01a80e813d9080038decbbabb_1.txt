The paper introduces a method for estimating the risk of a model on unlabeled data and optimizing the model under the same conditions. The proposed approach is built on a structural assumption about the underlying data-generating distribution, specifically that it can be decomposed into label-independent views. Preliminary experimental results suggest the method is promising. The paper is well-written, clearly presented, and enjoyable to read. The problem addressed is compelling, and the proposed approach has notable strengths, particularly the absence of a need for parametric assumptions about the underlying distribution. The high-level idea of combining structural assumptions with discriminative models is elegant. 
The core insight for estimating risk from unlabeled data lies in leveraging a structural assumption—that the data consists of three independent views—to extract information about class-conditional risks by analyzing the first three moments of the label vectors. This results in a system of equations that can be solved to infer the class-conditional risks. A similar technique is applied to estimate the gradient of the risk from unlabeled data, enabling the optimization of models like logistic regression without labeled data. The ability to achieve this under relatively mild assumptions is surprising. 
The mechanics of the approach, as well as its inspiration from the tensor decomposition framework for latent variable models (e.g., Anandkumar et al. 2012), are intriguing. However, as I am not deeply familiar with this literature, I cannot confidently assess the novelty of the proposed method. From my initial reading, it appears that existing work has not applied such techniques to unsupervised risk estimation, making this a potentially valuable conceptual contribution. The use of the three-view assumption to estimate classification error is an interesting insight. 
The technical content is presented clearly, with high-level intuition provided for the main theorems. The proofs of Theorems 1 and 2 rely on Theorem 7 from Anandkumar et al. 2012, but it is unclear how much of the heavy lifting is done by the latter. Additionally, I lack intuition about the sample complexity's dependence on various parameters, though the paper attempts to justify these dependencies. While the paper's contribution is primarily theoretical, it is supported by preliminary experiments. These experiments suggest the method is useful in covariate shift scenarios, though its performance in semi-supervised learning is less consistent. There appear to be opportunities for practical extensions. 
Overall, this is an interesting and well-executed paper that addresses a non-trivial problem. However, as I am not an expert in this field, I cannot definitively evaluate the novelty of the work.
Minor comments:
- The assumption that the distribution decomposes into three views is intuitive. For logistic regression, it was unclear why the feature maps for the three views have the same dimensionality. Does one generally partition the ambient feature space into three components for the views?
- I did not fully understand the statement that Assumption 1 does not hold for the hinge loss. Which specific version of the multiclass hinge loss is being referred to?
- In Equation 1 and elsewhere, it might help to explicitly indicate that \( M \) depends on \( \theta \).
- For the extension to hidden Markov models, consider adding a line clarifying how this differs from Anandkumar et al. 2012, which also addresses parameter estimation for such models.
- The seed model in Assumption 2 is defined but not explicitly referenced later in the paper. It would be helpful to clarify its role in the body of the text.
- The domain adaptation experiment seems more specifically focused on covariate shift. 
- It was unclear why the proposed model underperformed relative to the seed model for small values of \( a \) in the domain adaptation experiments. Is this due to finite sample effects?
- The citation for Anandkumar et al. 2013 could be updated to the JMLR version.
- Some citations in the main body are only included in the complete reference list in the supplementary material. Consider reducing spacing or font size in the main body references to include all citations.
