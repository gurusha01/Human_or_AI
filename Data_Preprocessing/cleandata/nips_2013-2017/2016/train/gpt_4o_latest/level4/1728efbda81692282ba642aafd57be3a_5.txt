The manuscript, titled "Koopman Spectral Analysis of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems with Reproducing Kernels," extends the dynamical mode decomposition (DMD) framework into reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). The proposed algorithm, referred to as KDMD, is demonstrated on a few toy problems. This extension enables the use of feature maps as kernel definitions, thereby linking DMD more closely to specific features of interest. As such, KDMD represents a powerful generalization of DMD. 
However, my primary concern is that the paper is challenging to read. Even for relatively simple concepts, the authors rely heavily on dense mathematical formulations when concise and clear sentences would suffice. Conversely, some sections are overly verbose, which may hinder comprehension even for experts in the field. A number of points require clarification. As it stands, the manuscript is too cryptic for publication in the Neural Information Processing Systems conference proceedings. Nevertheless, I strongly recommend that the authors revise the paper to adopt a more pedagogical approach, as the resulting work has the potential to be highly impactful and widely cited.

I. MAJOR REMARKS
Below are my primary concerns regarding the manuscript:
1. The presentation is unnecessarily verbose in places where simplification would improve clarity. For example, the sentence: "Conceptually, DMD can be considered as producing an approximation of the Koopman eigenfunctions using a set of linear monomials of observables as basis functions, which is analogous to a one-term Taylor expansion at each point." could be rephrased into a much shorter and simpler statement.
2. Section 4 is redundant in a short paper, as much of its content has already been partially addressed in the introduction.
3. Section 5 would benefit from illustrations or could be summarized in the conclusion instead.
4. Section 6, in contrast, is overly condensed and should be expanded in a manner similar to Section 5 to provide more depth and clarity.

II. MINOR REMARKS
In addition, I have the following minor comments:
1. There appears to be a typo in the description of the toy nonlinear (NL) case, as the system described is actually linear.
2. The first two problems presented are polynomial in nature. This is precisely where KDMD should excelâ€”when the kernel can be intuitively selected, as in the first example. More details should be provided here, similar to the level of explanation given in Section 5.
