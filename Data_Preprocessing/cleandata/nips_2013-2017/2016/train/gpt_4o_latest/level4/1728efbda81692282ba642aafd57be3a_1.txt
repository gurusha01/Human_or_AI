This paper presents a spectral analysis framework leveraging the Koopman operator defined within an appropriate reproducing kernel Hilbert space. The authors then adopt a standard methodology to introduce a suite of kernel-based approaches for analyzing nonlinear dynamical systems using empirical data. The eigendecomposition of the projected Koopman operator demonstrates efficiency improvements in both synthetic and real-world data analysis scenarios. The work provides a notable kernel construction for studying nonlinear dynamical systems, with contributions that are well-motivated and supported by experimental validation. However, there are several concerns that I believe the authors should address:
* The distinction between this work and the prior study [35] M.O. Williams, I.G. Kevrekidis, and C.W. Rowley. "A data-driven approximation of the Koopman operator: Extending dynamic mode decomposition." Journal of Nonlinear Science, 25:1307–1346, 2015, is unclear. That paper already introduced Koopman eigenvalues, eigenfunctions, and modes for analyzing nonlinear system dynamics. I would appreciate a detailed discussion highlighting the key differences between the two works, as well as an expanded discussion in Section 4 to clarify this point.
* The field of nonlinear dynamical system analysis using kernels is extensive, yet some relevant references are missing. The authors should consider including works by L. Ralaivola and F. d'Alché Buc, Tuia et al., Rojo-Alvarez et al., M. Mouattamid and R. Schaback, and M. O. Franz and B. B. Schölkopf to provide a more comprehensive context for their contributions.
* While the Koopman operator is typically defined for deterministic systems, it would be valuable to include comments on its performance in stochastic settings, which are more relevant to real-world applications. Although the authors briefly touch on this topic, a more detailed discussion and possibly a toy experiment would strengthen the paper.
* The remark on line 216, page 5, that "the estimation procedure itself does not necessarily require a sequence but rather a collection of pairs of consecutive observables, where each pair is supposed to be" nonlinearly pointwise related, warrants further clarification. I am particularly interested in the implications of this assumption for multidimensional time series with potentially weak pointwise relationships. What advantages does the proposed kernel construction provide in such cases? Additionally, I would appreciate a discussion on the causal assumptions inherent in the proposed framework.
* Regarding the experimental setup, I find the scope somewhat limited. The prediction task via pre-imaging follows a standard approach, and the "Embedding and Recognition of Dynamics" subsection lacks sufficient discussion on the connections between the proposed method and the extensive literature on time series clustering (e.g., kernel k-means and related subspace kernel methods). Furthermore, the sequential change-point detection experiment would benefit from a comparison with state-of-the-art online change detection methods using kernels, as the approach employed by the authors is known to struggle with complex dynamics. More ambitious and convincing experiments are needed to substantiate the proposed methodology.
 Minor: The paper is well-written and clear overall. I noticed two minor typographical errors: please verify the indices for τ-1 versus τ, and replace the dot with a comma in k(xi, xj) (last equation on page 7).
