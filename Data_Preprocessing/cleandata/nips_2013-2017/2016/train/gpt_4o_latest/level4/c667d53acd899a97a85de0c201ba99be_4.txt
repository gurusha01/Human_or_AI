Examines the sample complexity of automated mechanism design for revenue: Given a set of samples representing bidders' valuations over bundles of items, the goal is to select an allocation and payment rule that can be applied to a new set of bidders, ensuring that the expected revenue is approximately maximized. The paper focuses on classes of VCG-like mechanisms, which I believe are broadly studied and applied. This reduces the problem to determining weights for each bidder and allocation, a space that is exponentially large. I find the paper and its results compelling. However, I occasionally found the bounds challenging to interpret, as they can be intricate or involve constants like H, whose significance is unclear to me. Some clarification would be helpfulâ€”for example, if the main takeaway of Section 3.1 is simply "it's exponential," stating that explicitly would improve clarity. That said, the overall message comes through effectively. One lingering question I have concerns the role of uniform convergence in the negative results. How significant is the negative result that achieving convergence across all auctions in the class demands such a large number of samples? A deeper discussion on this point, as well as on the barriers to achieving a stronger objective (e.g., the sample complexity of identifying an approximately optimal auction), would add valuable insight.
