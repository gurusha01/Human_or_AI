The paper investigates the conditions under which the critical points of a specific regularized problem (featuring a quaternary term in the regularization) align with the optima of the matrix completion problem. This is the most impressive paper I have reviewed this year. It presents a lucid exposition of a significant result, effectively connecting it to pertinent recent research. I would be interested to see whether the results could be extended to an ensemble with uniformly distributed entries (e.g., http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.2467). The paper shares a strong connection with a recent work: http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.08101. However, given that the submission deadline coincided with that work, I do not believe this raises any concerns. Nonetheless, it would be beneficial to cite it. Beyond this, I have only minor comments: -- "F" in Frobenius should be capitalized -- "our attention" (l. 229) -- "nice properties that ensure" should not include an "s" (l. 251).
