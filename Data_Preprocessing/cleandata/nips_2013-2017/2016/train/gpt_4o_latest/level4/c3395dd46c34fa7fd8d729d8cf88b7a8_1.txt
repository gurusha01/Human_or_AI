This paper presents the cooperative inverse reinforcement learning (CIRL) model to address learning from demonstration problems. The model conceptualizes the learning process as a two-player Markov game with shared payoffs between a demonstrator and a learner. The authors simplify solving the Markov game by reducing it to a POMDP problem, making the computational approach feasible for small-scale problems. They frame the apprenticeship learning task as a turn-based CIRL model, comprising a learning phase and a deployment phase. The primary contribution of this work is the demonstration that the learner's reward-maximizing policy (learner's deployment phase policy) derived from the CIRL model (learning phase) surpasses the expert demonstration assumed in prior inverse reinforcement learning research. This claim is substantiated through a coffee supplier counterexample and a 2D navigation grid experiment. The work appears novel and holds potential for scenarios where the learner can actively interact with the demonstrator. However, the experimental evidence provided is insufficient to establish the model's practical utility, particularly due to the absence of real-world data experiments. 
1. The counterexample assumes differing action domains for the demonstrator and learner. Does this discrepancy explain why the best response for H to \(\pi^R\) deviates from the expert demonstrator assumption? What would happen if the demonstrator and learner shared identical embodiments?  
2. Real-world experimental results are crucial to convincingly demonstrate the practical applicability of the CIRL model.  
3. Corollary 1 does not clarify the meaning of the symbol \(\Delta^\theta\), which I assume represents the domain of R's belief.
