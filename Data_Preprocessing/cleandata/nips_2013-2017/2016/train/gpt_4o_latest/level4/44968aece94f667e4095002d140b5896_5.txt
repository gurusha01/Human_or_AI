This paper addresses an online pricing problem where the seller interacts with a stream of incoming strategic and patient buyers. The patience of buyers is represented by a time window, beyond which buyers will leave. The arrival of buyer types is assumed to follow an adversarial pattern. The authors propose a learning algorithm based on EXP3. The core idea of the algorithm is to group time steps into epochs, during which a fixed price (determined by EXP3) is announced. Feedback from the entire epoch is then used to update the EXP3 algorithm. Using results from EXP3, the authors establish an upper bound on the learner's regret. The problem is further shown to be reducible to a multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem with switching costs, and a matching lower bound is derived through this reduction. The paper introduces a novel buyer patience model for online pricing. The techniques used to prove the lower bound, which relate the strategic buyer model to an MAB problem with switching costs, are innovative and may have broader applications. The results are clearly presented. After reading the authors' rebuttal, the reviewer acknowledges that the problem is well-formulated, and both the upper and matching lower bounds are effectively presented. However, the reviewer has the following concerns:
On modeling: The algorithm assumes knowledge of buyers' patience. While the paper mentions that this information can be obtained through buyer reports, eliciting such information may introduce strategic manipulation and complicate the algorithm's design. 
On the lower bound: Based on the reviewer's understanding, the lower bound is derived over a learning space where the algorithm always pre-posts prices for a time window of size τ+1. If this is the case, the established lower bound may not represent the true lower bound, as the learner could strategically adjust price postings, and buyers may respond accordingly. Additionally, before presenting Algorithm 1, the authors mention that the goal is to minimize the frequency of price changes, as buyers would select the lower of two prices when the window size is 2. However, this argument assumes that prices are pre-posted. If the learner can dynamically adjust prices, buyers may risk missing a lower price by forgoing the current one.
Other comments:  
- The authors emphasize that modeling patient buyers using a time window is a key contribution of this work, arguing that a discounted buyer model would be less tractable. However, it appears that the discounted model has already been explored in prior work, such as [1].  
- Clarification is needed regarding whether the window size equals τ (patience) + 1. If so, the claim that [11] is a special case of this paper may not be entirely accurate: [11] considers τ = 0, whereas the results in this paper apply to τ ≥ 1. For τ = 0, a lower bound of order √T can be directly established based on the results in [11].
