The manuscript introduces an end-to-end deep learning framework designed to learn transferable feature representations for predicting labels of data points in the target domain. The central innovation of the proposed approach lies in its iterative optimization strategy, which alternates between two primary components for adaptation and transduction. The authors validate their method on multiple unsupervised domain adaptation tasks, demonstrating strong performance in both classification and recognition. The paper is well-structured and easy to comprehend. The authors make two notable contributions to their optimization strategy: cyclic consistency for addressing domain shift and structured consistency for enhancing prediction. Based on my interpretation, the first heuristic emphasizes aligning source and target manifolds within the feature embedding space, while the second aims to cluster target examples with identical labels. The optimization approach appears sound, and the experimental results surpass those of existing state-of-the-art methods. However, as acknowledged by the authors, the approach faces a significant challenge due to the inaccuracy of transduction during the algorithm's initial stages. While two solutions are proposed to address this issue, I have the following questions for the authors: 
1) The structured consistency heuristic only focuses on separating examples with different class labels but does not explicitly optimize for bringing target data points of the same class closer together. Although cyclic consistency penalizes neighboring points with either the same or different labels, it primarily enforces this in the similarity metric between the source and target domains. Why not directly optimize the similarity metric for neighboring points with the same labels within the same domain? 
2) There is no clear explanation of how the parameters $\thetas$ and $\thetat$ are initialized. Are they initialized randomly? Given the tight coupling between $\thetas$ and $\thetat$, such an initialization could result in a noisy or suboptimal starting point. The authors should provide additional details to clarify how the algorithm converges to an optimal solution despite this potential drawback. For instance, including the accuracy curve of the learned metric over iterations would be helpful.
3) It would be beneficial if the authors could provide a convergence curve for the optimization loss. Additionally, specifying the value of "max_iter" in Algorithm 1 would be useful.
