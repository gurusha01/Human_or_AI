This paper investigates the support recovery of sparse vectors using an L1 regularizer combined with non-smooth fidelity terms such as L0 or sup norms. The authors examine support stability in these models with respect to small noise levels, utilizing the dual certificate framework. To the best of my knowledge, this work represents the first rigorous analysis of support stability under L0 and L∞ losses, which makes the contribution significant. However, the main result is framed in terms of dual certificates, which I believe reduces its clarity. For instance, under what conditions is the injectivity assumption satisfied? Is this generally evident? Furthermore, it is somewhat challenging to infer from the main result how closely the estimated support J approximates the true support I. Specifically, for a given noise level and possibly known vector magnitudes, how much larger can J be compared to I? While the experiments seem to address this question more directly, I would also like to see a comparison between the (support of the) actual minimizer x_τ and the (support of the) true signal. A reformulation of the main result and a clearer presentation of the experiments could enhance the overall clarity. In summary, while the contribution is substantial, the presentation obscures key parameters of interest. The authors should either explain why the extended support itself is relevant or revise the results to focus on the actual recovered support.
