In two specific cases involving mixtures of Gaussian distributions, the authors analyze the behavior of the population EM algorithm by examining its dependence on the initialization points. They further demonstrate that the sample-based EM algorithm exhibits the same asymptotic behavior as the population EM when initialized identically. The study centers on evaluating the performance of the EM algorithm for two highly specialized models (a mixture of two Gaussian distributions). The findings are compelling, and the analysis comprehensively addresses all relevant scenarios, providing a thorough account of the EM algorithm's behavior in this context. My only criticism is that the proofs are excessively lengthy, especially considering the paper's focus on a narrowly defined model. Nonetheless, given that mixtures of even two Gaussian components remain an area of incomplete understanding, I support the acceptance of this work at NIPS.
