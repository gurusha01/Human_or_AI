The information bottleneck method aims to extract the most relevant information from variable X about variable Y while minimizing redundant information. However, its practical implementation is often limited by the computational challenges associated with high-dimensional or non-Gaussian data. This paper introduces an alternative objective that serves as a lower bound for the information bottleneck objective, offering improved computational tractability. The authors present an algorithm based on this new objective and illustrate its use through two examples. Additionally, they develop a kernelized version of the method and apply it to an occlusion task. The paper provides a clear and thorough explanation of the proposed approach. The detailed exploration of a simplified case, the examination of the impact of a variation, and the application to a specific task help readers grasp the method's performance and potential use cases. The figures are well-designed, with captions that effectively convey their intended message, allowing readers to understand the key points without needing to refer extensively to the main text. I anticipate that this method will find productive applications in the field.
