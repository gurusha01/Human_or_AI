This paper presents an approach to prediction using structured latent variable models (which also extends to structured auto-encoders) that achieves convexity and tractability under a reasonable assumption (polar operator tractability) and a relaxation (related to rank in an SDP formulation). The proposed method is novel, technically sophisticated, and appears to be sound, addressing a challenging problem that has drawn significant attention from the research community. While the approach may face scalability challenges due to its reliance on SDP, it represents a fresh perspective on a difficult problem and has the potential to inspire substantial follow-up research. The paper is also impressively clear, particularly given the technical complexity of the subject matter. However, one notable weakness in the writing is that it does not always clearly distinguish between novel contributions and applications of existing ideas, which seems to stem from the writing style. This issue could be addressed with minor clarifications. A specific point of confusion arises in this context: the paper claims that the rank relaxation is the only relaxation, but this does not seem entirely accurate. For instance, in Equation 5, \Omega(Ux) is upper-bounded by max_y y'Ux, which is justified using a max-margin principle. While this relaxation is reasonable, it raises questions about its justification in the context of probabilistic models, where its validity is less clear.
