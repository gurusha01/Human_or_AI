This paper presents the concept of a Product Cut in a graph. The Product Cut objective for graph clustering is claimed to be more intuitive and robust compared to existing objectives. The authors propose an algorithm to identify partitions with a favorable product cut. Experimental results demonstrate that the algorithm produces superior clusters relative to existing methods. The rationale behind the product cut is convincing, and the paper is well-written. However, I did not independently verify all the details of the proofs or the algorithm for approximately maximizing the product cut. The experimental results on cluster purity are encouraging, indicating that PCut performs competitively. That said, the experiments on running time (Table 2) require further clarification. The experimental setup is not adequately describedâ€”details such as the machine specifications and the programming language used for the algorithms are missing. Additionally, there is no explanation for why PCut is faster than NMFR, nor is there a runtime comparison with other methods. 
Other comments: Is the problem NP-hard, as is the case with many existing objective functions? A discussion on computational complexity would be valuable, even if included briefly in the conclusion, should the complexity not yet be fully analyzed. Caption of Figure 1a: Should C be highlighted in red? Lines 111-115: Are you limiting the set of vertices in B that connect to C to have size n0? If so, does this mean each vertex in C connects to u0k0 vertices within that set of n0 vertices? If this is the intended construction, it should be explicitly stated that u0k0 <= n_0. Line 119: It appears that the denominator of the conductance should be min(vol(A), vol(A^C)). Line 146: What program is being referred to here? Line 152: What is Table 2.1? It seems this should be Figure 2. Line 209: "close" should be corrected to "closed."
