This paper introduces a supervised approach to learning document distances based on the word mover's distance (WMD). WMD, as established in prior literature, is inspired by the earth mover's distance, where the optimal transport between two distributions of words is computed to measure document similarity. In the original WMD framework, word2vec embeddings are used to calculate the transport distance between words. In this work, the authors propose learning (1) a linear transformation of word embeddings and (2) a reweighted word distribution, with the goal of better separating documents with different labels. The paper is well-written, clear, and easy to follow. It provides a comprehensive review of related works, demonstrating the authors' strong grasp of the existing literature. Additionally, the authors present experimental results using their algorithm on several novel datasets. 
However, the paper has some limitations in terms of motivation and significance. 1) The rationale behind reweighting the word distribution using `w` is not well-justified. This reweighting could potentially alter the document to the extent that it no longer represents the original content. The authors need to clarify how this reweighting improves performance without fundamentally changing the document. 2) The contribution of the work appears incremental. Applying a linear transformation `A` and reweighting `w` within the NCA objective function is a straightforward extension of WMD to a supervised setting, but the approach lacks novelty or significant innovation. 3) The method's applicability to unseen documents is unclear. Specifically, how would the reweighting factor `w` be determined for a completely new document? 4) The term "semantic difference" in the abstract seems ambiguous. It appears to refer to document labels, but it is unclear whether it also encompasses authorship or topic differences. If "semantic difference" implies something else, the authors should provide a clearer explanation.
Overall, while the paper is well-written and presents interesting ideas, the above concerns need to be addressed. I do not oppose the acceptance of this paper, provided the authors adequately clarify these points.
