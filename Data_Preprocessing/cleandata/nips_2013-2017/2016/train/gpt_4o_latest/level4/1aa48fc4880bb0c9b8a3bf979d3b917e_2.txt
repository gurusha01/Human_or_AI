This paper addresses the problem of minimizing convex-concave saddle point problems and extends recent variance reduction techniques to solve them. The authors present a convergence analysis for the proposed methods and demonstrate that these methods can be effectively accelerated using an extension of the catalyst framework. Additionally, the work includes an extension to monotone operators and provides numerical results. However, the assumption of strong convexity on both the primal and dual problems is overly restrictive; it would be more appropriate to assume strong convexity on either the primal or the dual problem, but not both. Furthermore, the paper would benefit from the inclusion of more numerical examples.
