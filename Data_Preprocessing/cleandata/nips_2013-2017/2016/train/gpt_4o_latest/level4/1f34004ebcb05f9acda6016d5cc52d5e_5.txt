The authors introduce the concept of PageRank and subsequently propose a framework incorporating node and edge weights derived from a feature model. They highlight that a prior algorithm for learning the model's parameters lacked performance guarantees. To address this, they propose a solution that combines an existing method for approximating the stationary distribution of a Markov random walk with an adaptation of a gradient-free optimization technique designed for scenarios where the loss function is only estimable. The authors reintroduce a framework under a different name and notation from [21]. They present several technical assumptions and a loss function, elaborating on the inherent difficulty of the problem. Some lemmas are provided to bound the approximate gradient. A general gradient-free method is described, utilizing a biased gradient-free oracle, and a theorem is stated regarding its performance. Additional assumptions are introduced, followed by the construction of an algorithm tailored to the learning problem, which adapts the gradient-free methods to their context and includes further bounds. Experimental results on a web graph previously used in related work are briefly outlined, but detailed reporting and analysis are deferred to the appendix. Key parameters are omitted, and while the novel algorithm is claimed to outperform others, there is no discussion of the magnitude or significance of the improvement. It is also unclear whether the algorithm was tested on a diverse set of graphs. The paper contains numerous grammatical errors. Citations are inconsistent; for instance, the problem is referred to as Supervised PageRank with a citation to [21], but only semi-supervised PageRank is discussed there. I remain unconvinced of the problem's impact. While the stated bounds are strong, I question whether the technical assumptions will hold in practice. Some assumptions appear restrictive—for example, constraining the search space of φ to an R-ball around a chosen φ₀ may significantly limit the algorithm's applicability and effectiveness, a point that warrants discussion. My primary concern is that the substantive content of the paper resides in the appendix. Neither proof outlines nor comprehensive empirical results are included in the main body. How were φ₀ and R selected in the empirical results? Were tests conducted on more than one graph? The main text lacks tables or specific results. What are the practical implications of the reported improvements? While the bounds, analysis, and algorithm appear promising, the paper itself fails to provide sufficient evidence to persuade me of its contributions.
