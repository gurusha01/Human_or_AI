The paper investigates lower bounds on the feasibility of learning when only a subset of the attributes for each sample is accessible to the learner. The scenario examined in the paper has been previously explored, and the authors provide a clear explanation of why their results do not conflict with established findings. Additionally, the paper introduces a general algorithm and establishes an upper bound on the error it achieves. Overall, this is a solid contribution that delivers significant results in a clear and precise manner, with a thorough review of prior work in the field. However, I believe the authors could improve their explanation, particularly for the first lower bound (general cost function), by elaborating on why the learning process fails in certain cases. While it appears that learning is feasible in most scenarios, there are exceptions. Providing a more detailed account of why these failures occur could offer researchers valuable insights, which, in my opinion, are more impactful than the precise mathematical lower bound itself.
