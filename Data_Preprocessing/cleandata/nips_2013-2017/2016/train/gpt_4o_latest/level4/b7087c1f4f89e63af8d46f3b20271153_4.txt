This paper focuses on the computation of PCA for extremely large and sparse matrices. Specifically, the authors leverage coresets, which are weighted subsets of the data matrix's rows. The work demonstrates how to construct a coreset that is independent of the data matrix's dimensions. Additionally, the authors showcase their algorithm on the massive Wikipedia document-term matrix, which serves as an impressive validation. The paper is well-written, with a clear and compelling motivation. Furthermore, the use of coresets to tackle such a challenging problem (the Wikipedia dataset) is particularly noteworthy. Overall, I found this paper engaging and thought-provoking.
