In this paper, the authors introduce two optimization methods to address the supervised PageRank problem. Unlike existing approaches, the authors propose a gradient-based method that comes with a theoretical guarantee on convergence rate and can achieve a specified accuracy. Additionally, the gradient-free method ensures a guaranteed decrease in the loss function. Both methods operate without requiring the exact value of the objective function and provide an estimate of the convergence rate. Furthermore, the proposed methods outperform state-of-the-art techniques in terms of ranking quality. The hyper-parameters utilized in both methods are explicitly provided. Although the datasets used are not publicly available, their descriptions are sufficiently detailed, making it feasible to reproduce the results.
The authors propose two two-level optimization methods, namely gradient-based (GBN) and gradient-free (GFN), to solve the supervised PageRank problem. The lower-level and upper-level optimizations are based on the work of Nesterov and Nemirovski (ref:17). The proposed methods do not require the exact value of the objective function and provide a proven estimate of the convergence rate for a given accuracy. Consequently, the methods avoid the computational burden of large matrix calculations while still delivering strong results. From Section 2 to Section 5, the authors thoroughly explain their methods and include all proofs in the supplementary material. However, it would be highly beneficial if the authors provided a symbol table, as the equations involve numerous symbols, making it easy to lose track of their meanings. For instance, in Line 139 and Equation 3.1, the symbol $N$ is used, but its meaning (number of steps) is not clarified until Line 193.
In the experimental section, the authors compare their work with GBP only in terms of the loss function rather than the ranking quality. Additionally, since this work serves as a generalization of ref:17, it would be valuable for the authors to include a direct comparison with it to assess whether the proposed methods demonstrate improved performance.
