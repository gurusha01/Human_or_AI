This paper presents a Q-learning approach integrated with deep learning for object detection and localization. Specifically, it proposes a tree-based reinforcement learning method that sequentially identifies the most suitable region in an image to represent an object's bounding box. The method is evaluated on VOC2007/2012 datasets, and the results are competitive with other state-of-the-art detectors. The paper introduces a noteworthy enhancement to conventional reinforcement learning techniques. However, several aspects could benefit from further clarification:  
- The desired number of proposals is treated as a parameter. While this was determined experimentally, it would be valuable to formalize the problem of proposal generation in a more systematic way.  
- Are there any modifications to the agent's tree-RL process when searching for different object categories?
