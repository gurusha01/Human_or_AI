The paper is well-written and presents some novel findings on community detection in the context of the so-called "heterogeneous SBM."  
Strengths:  
1) To the best of my knowledge, the results are novel and pertain to a heterogeneous regime where no substantial prior work exists.  
Weaknesses:  
1) The optimization problems employed are not particularly novel. The results appear to stem primarily from the use of stronger matrix concentration bounds by the authors, rather than from fundamentally new insights.  
2) The topic itself is not highly novel, as significant research has been conducted on it over the past decade.  
3) The proof techniques utilized are fairly standard.  
Overall, I enjoyed reading this paper, and I believe the heterogeneous regime explored here warrants further investigation. Based on the submitted version, I would like to see numerical demonstrations to support the theoretically derived results. Additionally, I think the paper would be well-suited for a poster presentation, given the relevance of the topic and the potential for further exploration in this regime.
