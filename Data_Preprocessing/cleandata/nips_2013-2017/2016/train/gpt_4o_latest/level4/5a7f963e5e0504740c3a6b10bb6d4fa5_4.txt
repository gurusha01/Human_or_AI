The authors present algorithms for operations on arithmetic circuits that are well-suited for representing probability distributions. These circuits offer a sparse and efficient way to represent probability distributions, making the manuscript highly impactful for practical applications in probabilistic reasoning and a strong fit for NIPS. Specifically, the authors focus on PSDDs (probabilistic sentential decision diagrams) and provide theoretical results on operations such as multiplying these representations, compiling PSDDs into arithmetic circuits, summing out probabilities, and performing empirical comparisons with other approaches. Additionally, they present several representation results. The manuscript contributes to advancing the theoretical framework of PSDDs and offers insights that could enhance the efficiency of probabilistic representation applications in the future.
The primary limitation of the manuscript is its lack of self-contained explanations, which makes it challenging to intuitively follow without prior background knowledge. This issue arises because the examples (figures) are not thoroughly explained, and some necessary preliminaries are omitted. Despite this, I recommend the manuscript for acceptance. Below are detailed comments on the drawbacks of the examples:
- Figure 1: This figure depicts a circuit for a network \( A \to B \) with numbers attached to nodes. However, the meaning of these numbers and their relationship to \( A \to B \) are not clarified in the text. My interpretation is that this represents an arbitrary example where \( \thetaa = 0.3, \dots \). Interestingly, \( \lambdab = 1 \) and \( \lambda_{\neg b} = 1 \), which should be inverses if they are indicators. Additionally, Figure 1 and Figure 2 appear to describe entirely distinct examples (Figure 2 involves three variables, while Figure 1 involves only two), which adds to the confusion.
- Figure 2: This figure contains several numbers (1, 1, 3, 4) that are not intuitive. In subfigures (b) and (c), these numbers are attached to the same topological OR-gates, but in subfigure (d), new numbers ("0" and "2") appear, and only one "1" remains. I suggest revising the presentation of these examples by placing the figures closer to the relevant text and potentially dedicating separate pages to the figures, as they seem unrelated. Additionally, I question whether the AND/OR gate representation of PSDDs is the best choice; representing them as graphs with edge labels might align more closely with the original arithmetic circuits. However, this choice seems to follow the conventions of prior work.
Minor comments:
- Line 18: "compilating" should be corrected to "compiling."
- Figure 4: Consider top-aligning the three trees for improved visual clarity.
- Table 1: Highlight the winning (shortest) times in bold for easier comparison.
- Table 1: Clarify the unit of size. It does not appear to be MB; is it the number of nodes?
