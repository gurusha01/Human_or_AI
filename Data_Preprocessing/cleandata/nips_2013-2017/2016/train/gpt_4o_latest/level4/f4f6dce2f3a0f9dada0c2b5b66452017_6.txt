This study leverages the spectral properties of the matrix Khatri-Rao product to design an efficient approach for accessing its statistical leverage scores, enabling nearly-optimal row sampling of the KRP. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The work extends leverage score computation from matrices to tensor data. My concerns are as follows: 
1. The derivation of the sampling row size (\(\alpha r^2 \log^2n\)) in Line 294 is unclear.  
2. Table 1 on Page 8 lacks a caption.  
3. In Table (a) at \(nsr = 0.1\), is there a plausible explanation for the decline in SPALS performance as the sampling size increases?  
4. In the introduction, the authors claim that the proposed method can be easily applied to other tensor-related applications, such as SGD or HOSVD, but no experiments are provided to substantiate this claim.  
5. Grammar issue: In Section 7, "Its worth noting that ..." should be corrected.
