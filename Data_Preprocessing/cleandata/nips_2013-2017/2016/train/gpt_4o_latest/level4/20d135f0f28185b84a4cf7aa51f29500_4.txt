The authors propose a stochastic gradient descent method integrated with Multiple Choice Learning (MCL). They claim that the proposed framework offers advantages across multiple tasks, including classification, segmentation, and captioning.  
1. The paper demonstrates that the sMCL method exhibits only incremental novelty. While the motivation behind MCL is clear, it cannot be considered a contribution of this work. Essentially, this work represents a neural network (NN) adaptation of [8] with certain modifications.  
2. The manuscript is not well-written. The technical section (Section 3) spans only a single page. Additionally, the distinction between the proposed framework and alternative training methods, which are widely used for multi-task learning, is not adequately clarified.  
3. The authors conduct experiments on various computer vision tasks, such as classification, image segmentation, and captioning. However, the experiments lack strong baseline comparisons, and the observed performance improvements are minimal. To convincingly demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed framework, the authors should conduct experiments on datasets like PASCAL VOC 2012 and compare their results against stronger baselines.
