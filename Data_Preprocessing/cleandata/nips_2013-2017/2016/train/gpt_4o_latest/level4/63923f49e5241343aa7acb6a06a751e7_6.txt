The paper extends the analysis of fast learning rates to scenarios involving unbounded losses with heavy-tailed distributions. Initially, the authors introduce the required initial conditions. Subsequently, they validate these conditions. Finally, they demonstrate that, under the stated assumptions, fast learning rates can indeed be achieved for heavy-tailed losses. However, not all variables used in the formulas are explicitly defined, which may pose challenges for a general audience. Additionally, some variable values are selected without sufficient justification or reasoning. The text also contains a few instances of repetition.
