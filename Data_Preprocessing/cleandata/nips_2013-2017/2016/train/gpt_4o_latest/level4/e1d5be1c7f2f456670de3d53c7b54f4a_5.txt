The authors tackle an online learning problem where, at each iteration, the goal is to select a list of items based on contextual information. The learner then receives scalar feedback values for each selected item along with an overall reward value. This problem, referred to by the authors as the contextual semi-bandit problem in a partial feedback setting, is addressed through the proposal of efficient algorithms that come with sublinear regret guarantees across various settings. 
1. While the problem formulation and contributions appear noteworthy, the proposed algorithms lack clear and intuitive motivation.  
2. The paper is challenging to follow due to its poor organization and writing quality. There are several notational inconsistencies and ambiguities, such as the vague definition of \( p{\text{min}} \), and the improper definition of \( Qt \) and \( \tilde{Q}_t \) in Algorithm 1 (VCEE).  
3. The dependence of the regret guarantee on the size of the policy set is unclear. Although the authors claim in the introduction that the dependence is \( O(\log|\pi|) \), this is not evident from Theorems 1 and 2.  
4. Providing insights into how the algorithm could be generalized to handle more general reward functions beyond the linear structure currently addressed in the paper would be a valuable addition.
