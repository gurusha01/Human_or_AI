The manuscript investigates the task of unsupervised feature construction for similarity determination using exemplars. It introduces a novel training paradigm and an associated loss function [a differentiable adaptation of a discrete clustering loss], where a CNN architecture is integrated with clustering algorithms. This approach addresses the challenge of highly imbalanced training data when exemplars are used with large neural networks. The authors evaluate their method on three standard datasets: Olympic images, Pose estimation, and the Pascal object recognition dataset. The paper presents an intriguing new approach to leveraging CNNs for learning unsupervised similarity features from exemplars. It proposes a unique differentiable loss function and employs clustering to partition data into mutually exclusive cliques, which helps balance the data (mitigating the common issue of a small number of exemplars versus a large number of negative examples). Overall, the paper is well-written, well-motivated, and contributes meaningfully to the growing trend of integrating discrete optimization techniques with deep networks for impactful results. The experimental results on several real-world datasets are promising, though there is room for further strengthening. 
One concern I have is the choice of switching to a different feature initialization for the PASCAL dataset (i.e., from HOG-LDA to Wang et al.). Does this imply that HOG-LDA features perform poorly for initialization in this scenario? If so, can the proposed method recover from such suboptimal initialization? 
Minor Issues: The phrase "gets corrupted" on line 41 could be rephrased for clarity. Line 130 would benefit from a citation for complete-linkage clustering. For the PASCAL dataset, results are only reported for k=5. It would be helpful to see results for k=1,...,10. Is the reported 3% improvement dependent on using k=5? 
Grammar/Spelling issues:  
- Line 2: The tense appears slightly inconsistent.  
- Line 76: "extracting patch for..." could be revised for grammatical accuracy.  
- Line 126: "but not to another due to..." could be rephrased for clarity.  
- Line 225: "by solve" should be corrected.
