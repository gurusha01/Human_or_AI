The authors present an analysis of the EM algorithm applied to two simplified Gaussian mixture models, focusing on identifying the initial parameter values that ensure convergence. Specifically, they leverage the true Q function—calculated as an expectation rather than a sample average—to derive the ideal parameter trajectory starting from a given initial value. This trajectory is then utilized to characterize the initial parameter values that converge to the true parameter. Additionally, the authors demonstrate that the actual parameter sequence from a real execution of the algorithm converges in probability to the idealized sequence. Subsequently, they use this framework to examine the shape of the expected log-likelihood in the vicinity of its stationary points. Congratulations to the authors on an excellent paper!  
Quality: The paper is technically rigorous and presents non-trivial results. The conclusions are well-supported by the theoretical analysis. The conditions on the initial parameters that lead to convergence to the true parameter are particularly noteworthy.  
Clarity: This is a very well-written paper with clear and accessible exposition. Despite the mathematical complexity, the presentation is highly intuitive, aided by thoughtful commentary that enhances understanding.  
Originality: The paper introduces a novel approach by analyzing an idealized execution of the EM algorithm using the true Q function instead of the sample-based approximation. The authors provide a thorough discussion of the relevant literature, situating their work appropriately within the context of existing research.  
Significance: The results are compelling, offering valuable insights into the sensitivity of the EM algorithm (for Gaussian mixtures) to initial parameter values. While the models considered are overly simplified for practical applications, they serve as an effective proof of concept for the proposed analytical technique. It remains to be seen whether this approach can be extended to more general models.  
Strengths: Rigorous and solid analysis.  
Weakness: Simplified models with limited applicability.  
Comments: In lines 188–192, the authors claim that their analysis of the EM algorithm provides insights into other ascent algorithms. However, the subsequent justification relies on conclusions about \( G(\eta) \) derived using the Q function, which is specific to the EM framework. It is unclear what the authors intend to generalize about other algorithms.  
Overall, I strongly recommend accepting this paper without reservations.
