In this paper, the authors establish the first lower bounds that constrain the precision achievable by any algorithm for various regression variants, as well as for classification using the hinge loss, under the condition of restricted attribution observation. The proofs of these theorems are comprehensive. However, the authors do not provide any experimental validation to support these findings and instead rely solely on theoretical justification.
