The authors propose two approaches for training the classical perceptron algorithm on a quantum computer, leveraging Grover's search algorithm. The central idea of their methods involves mapping the training process to a search for either misclassified data points or separating hyperplanes (within the version space), sampled from a uniform distribution over the data and a defined set of hyperplanes, respectively. This mapping is thoroughly explained in the paper. The authors rigorously demonstrate that their algorithms achieve a quadratic speedup in terms of the required number of training data points and the margin between the two classes. 
In my assessment, this paper merits attention from the NIPS audience, at least at the poster level, due to its rigorous exploration of a highly interdisciplinary and foundational question, which could eventually have a significant impact on machine learning. To the best of my knowledge, the arguments and proofs provided in the paper are sound and correct. While an experimental evaluation would have strengthened the theoretical claims, the absence of a quantum device capable of executing the algorithm is understandable and does not detract from the paper. As far as quantum algorithms are concerned, the results are well-presented and thoroughly analyzed. 
This work stands out in terms of originality and novelty, particularly for the NIPS audience. Although Grover's search is a well-known algorithm, its application in this context and the resulting interdisciplinary insights are novel by NIPS standards. The potential impact of the work is perhaps its most debatable aspect, as it is purely theoretical and currently distant from the practical concerns of most machine learning researchers. However, the paper bridges multiple disciplines, and if scalable quantum computers are realized in the future, this work could have a profound impact and inspire significant follow-up research. Even if the immediate impact is limited, researchers should take an interest in foundational developments that could shape the future of their field, as exemplified by this work.
From my perspective, the authors generally succeed in presenting their ideas in a manner accessible to the NIPS audience, minimizing the reliance on prior knowledge of quantum mechanics. The explanations and proofs are primarily based on mathematical reasoning, making them comprehensible. However, certain concepts, such as 'superposition' and the resulting speedups, could have been explained in greater detail. A lack of familiarity with basic principles of quantum mechanics might hinder some readers' understanding. Nevertheless, given the constraints of the page limit, the authors have done a commendable job of introducing the most critical quantum mechanics concepts. Apart from minor issues, such as the need to remove some redundant words and the incorrect reference to Algorithm 2 in the proof of Lemma 2 (which should refer to Algorithm 1), the paper is well-written and clear.
