The paper introduces a method for training a specific type of feed-forward neural networks under certain assumptions. The authors establish optimal convergence and demonstrate the applicability of their approach to a range of "real-world" problems. The problem addressed in the paper is intriguing, and any theoretical progress in this area is valuable. However, the paper does not fully convince the reader of the practical utility of the proposed class of neural networks. Specifically, since the authors themselves highlight the issue of the expressiveness of their restricted model (mentioned twice in the paper), I suggest including a discussion on the capabilities and limitations of their approach. Additionally, a comparison with concurrent methods is missing and should be incorporated. The experimental results also fail to clarify the boundaries of the model's applicability. While reviewing the experimental section, I was surprised that the authors only benchmarked their method against an SVM and omitted comparisons with other training techniques for neural networks or alternative algorithmic paradigms. Furthermore, details about the computational resources required by the three algorithms would have been helpful. 
The introduction is well-written, but the presentation in later sections could be improved. For instance, Section 2 lacks fluency and could benefit from better organization. There are also several typographical errors, which I have noted below. Some specific comments: While the definition of the loss function is straightforward, the function $\Phi$ is not well-motivated. The explanation of the epsilon term provided in the rebuttal should be included in the paper. Theorem 1 would benefit from an informal explanation before its formal statement, as the current presentation is difficult to parse. Additionally, the statement following Theorem 1, which claims that "the nonlinear spectral method [...] converges quickly typically in a few (less than 10) iterations to the global maximum," was clarified in the rebuttal as being based on experimental observations. This should be explicitly mentioned in the paper. 
Typographical issues: 
- Line 60: "polyomial" should be corrected to "polynomial."
- Line 67: "one CAN model" should be revised for clarity.
- Line 67: Variables $p1$ and $p2$ are not introduced.
- Line 67: The notation $R_{++}$ is not explained, which is problematic since other variables depend on its definition. This was clarified in the rebuttal, but the explanation should be included in the paper. 
Thank you for addressing these points in the rebuttal. I had not encountered this notation before.
