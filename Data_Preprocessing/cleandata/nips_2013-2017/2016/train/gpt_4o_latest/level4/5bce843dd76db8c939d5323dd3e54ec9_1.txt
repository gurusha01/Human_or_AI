The paper introduces an enhancement to LSTM by incorporating a "time gate." This gate is governed solely by time and learned parameters, with each LSTM cell having its own distinct time gate. When the time gate is closed, the corresponding cell remains unchanged. I appreciate the paper's attempt to explore a novel idea. 
Technical Quality:  
1) The proposed design of the time gate may not be optimal. A potential improvement could involve making the time gate a continuous function of time. For instance, a continuous time gate could be implemented as a piecewise linear function with values such as: alpha, 1, alpha, 0, alpha, 1, ...  
2) It would be beneficial to evaluate the model on a speech recognition benchmark.  
Novelty:  
The paper's focus on processing asynchronous events is commendable and adds to its originality.  
Impact:  
The work is inspiring and has the potential to motivate further advancements. The results demonstrate notable improvements on the tasks evaluated.  
Clarity:  
It is unclear whether the reported twenty-fold reduction in runtime computational cost is based on theoretical analysis or actual hardware measurements.
