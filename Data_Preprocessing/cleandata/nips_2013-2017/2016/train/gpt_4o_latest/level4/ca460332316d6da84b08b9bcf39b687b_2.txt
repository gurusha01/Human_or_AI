The authors present a novel approach for partitioning a given graph. The associated optimization problem aligns with the classical Normalized Cut optimization in its underlying concept of clustering. They demonstrate how this problem can be reformulated as a convex maximization program, enabling an exact continuous relaxation of the discrete problem. Based on this formulation, the authors develop a monotonic algorithm that solves the optimization problem through a sequence of linear programs and propose a randomized variant of this approach, resulting in a straightforward algorithm. An experimental evaluation of the proposed method is conducted, showcasing its performance in terms of cluster purity across various real-world datasets. The paper is clearly written and well-structured. The problem formulation is both intriguing and, to the best of my knowledge, novel. The comparison with the classical Normalized Cut is insightful, though I would have appreciated additional analysis involving more complex or significant input examples beyond a collection of isolated vertices, which might be perceived as a "pathological input case." Nonetheless, the utility of this partitioning method is evident, along with its superior stability and performance characteristics. The ability to reformulate the original minimization problem as a convex maximization program is particularly compelling and plays a pivotal role in addressing the original problem. The experimental evaluation is thorough and effectively demonstrates the method's strong algorithmic performance in terms of cluster purity across diverse real-world datasets. The results appear meaningful, and the methodology employed seems sufficiently rigorous. Overall, my evaluation of the paper is positive.
