The paper introduces an under-complete dictionary learning framework incorporating combined Sobolev/L1 regularization to identify functional components in fMRI data. The proposed method is conceptually interesting. Its relatively novel aspect lies in leveraging dictionary learning with Sobolev/L1 regularization to promote both smoothness and sparsity in the components. However, the performance gains of the proposed approach over simpler methods appear modest, or at the very least, the improvements are not adequately justified. Additionally, the manuscript seems hastily prepared, as evidenced by the presence of draft comments (e.g., line 146) and its overall presentation, which is somewhat tedious and occasionally difficult to follow.
