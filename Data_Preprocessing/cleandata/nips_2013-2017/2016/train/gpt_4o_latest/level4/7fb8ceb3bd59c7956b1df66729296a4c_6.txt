The authors demonstrate that, for a noiseless symmetric matrix completion problem, all local minima are guaranteed to be global minima. In contrast to prior works that rely on good initializations, this paper establishes that the gradient descent algorithm converges to the global minimum even when starting from random initialization. The appendix also explores an extension to the noisy setting. The primary theoretical contributions are significant and technically robust. The technical exposition is well-written, with proof strategies in the main body being clear and accessible. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first result to show that all local minima are global minima for matrix completion problems. This work paves the way for future research to investigate similar geometric properties in other nonconvex machine learning problems. A potential limitation is that the results are restricted to symmetric completion matrices, which reduces the practical applicability of the theory. Nonetheless, I believe this paper represents a substantial advancement in understanding the geometry of matrix completion problems. The writing is clear, and the organization is outstanding, making the paper easy to follow. While I did not grasp every detail of the proofs, I found the proof strategies for the rank-1 case straightforward to follow.
