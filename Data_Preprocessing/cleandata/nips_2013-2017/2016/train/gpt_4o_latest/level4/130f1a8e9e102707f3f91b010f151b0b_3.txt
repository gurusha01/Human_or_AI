The authors propose an extension of dictionary learning models by introducing a Sobolev prior. While this addresses an interesting problem, it is challenging to assess the impact or improvement brought by the proposed algorithm. The primary results are presented through a visual comparison of the clarity and consistency of identified brain blobs, but this approach is not easily interpretable for an untrained observer. Additionally, based on my experience with similar decomposition methods, the quality of the data is often just as critical—if not more so—than the algorithm itself. Given the inclusion of penalties for smoothness and spatial consistency, it is unsurprising that the resulting blobs appear smoother. This approach might be more beneficial for isolating regions with limited data, but with the extensive datasets available through the Human Connectome Project, this does not seem to be a pressing concern. I had anticipated that the paper would focus more on consolidating differences in brain regions across subjects and potentially use inter-subject variability or consistency as a means of validating the algorithm's performance. However, the validation provided in the paper appears highly subjective, and the practical benefits of the proposed method remain unclear.
