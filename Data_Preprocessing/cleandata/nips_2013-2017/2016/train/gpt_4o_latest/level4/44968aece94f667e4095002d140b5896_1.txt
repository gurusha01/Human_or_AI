The paper addresses the challenge of determining reserve prices for buyers who participate for only Ï„ rounds and make purchasing decisions based on whether the minimum price during their participation falls below their reserve.  After considering the authors' rebuttal, I have revised my perspective on this problem and now recognize that the primary contributions of the paper lie not in the upper bound but in the lower bound established by the authors. The abstract requires significant refinement. Additionally, the authors should prominently highlight that this problem can be framed as a policy regret problem.
