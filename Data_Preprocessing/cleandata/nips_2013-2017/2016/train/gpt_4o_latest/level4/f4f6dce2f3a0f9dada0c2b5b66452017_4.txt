This paper introduces a novel low-rank tensor CP decomposition approach, referred to as the sparse alternating least squares (SPALS) method. SPALS enhances the efficiency of traditional ALS algorithms through sampling. Additionally, the authors present valuable insights into the leverage scores of the matrix Khatri-Rao product. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is both effective and efficient. I have the following comments: 1. The theoretical analysis in this paper primarily addresses approximating the solution to problem (1), which constitutes the core step of ALS. Is there any theoretical discussion linking the sampling technique to the global convergence behavior of ALS? 2. I have a few concerns regarding the experiments: a) How are the initial parameter values selected? Are the results sensitive to these initializations? b) What is the practical stopping criterion used? c) Why are the sketching-based methods not included in the results presented in Table 1b? Thank you!
