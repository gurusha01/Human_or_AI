The authors propose an extension of moment matching networks to a conditional variant. While extending such models to handle single-example updates is straightforward (by feeding the conditional input directly into the network), the extension in this case is more complex. This complexity arises because the algorithm requires matching distributions of a large number of samples (mini-batches) to a large number of inputs, where the distributions differ unless the same conditional is used for each updateâ€”a strategy that would be inefficient. 
The primary issue with the paper is that it begins with formal mathematical derivations rather than providing an intuitive explanation of the underlying formula. Specifically, the authors do not clearly outline the computations performed during the algorithm, their efficiency, or the assumptions made to ensure the method works. For instance, while equation (2) is central to the approach, the paper does not adequately explain the intuition behind it, the steps required to transition from this formula to the practical algorithm, or the computational implications. Much of this information is relegated to the supplementary material, where it is difficult to follow.
In contrast, the non-conditional version of the algorithm, as presented in the original paper, is explained in an intuitive manner without relying on advanced mathematical constructs (e.g., reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces). The formula being minimized in that case is accessible and easy to understand. A similar level of clarity and intuition would greatly benefit the explanation of the conditional case. 
To improve the paper, the authors should address the following questions:
- How can one intuitively derive formula (2)?
- What are the concrete steps from formula (2) to the practical algorithm?
Providing clear answers to these questions would make the paper more accessible and enhance its overall impact.
