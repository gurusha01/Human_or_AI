The paper seems to be the first to establish fast learning rates for learning in unbounded domains with heavy-tailed loss functions, under the proposed conditions. For one of these conditions (multi-scale Bernstein), the authors provide a discussion on how it can be verified in practice. However, the other condition (polynomial entropy bounds on the hypothesis class) is less clearly addressed, and the discussion section at the end hints at potential extensions. In the case of bounded loss, the new result matches the state-of-the-art findings of (Mehta & Williamson 2014). The proof leverages recent results from (Lederer et al. 2014) to control the suprema of empirical unbounded processes. As an application, the authors analyze k-means clustering in the context of heavy-tailed data distributions. Overall, the paper appears to be both rigorous and valuable. My only concern is whether the authors could provide more detail on how restrictive the polynomial entropy boundedness condition is and whether there is any evidence to suggest that the results might generalize beyond this condition.
