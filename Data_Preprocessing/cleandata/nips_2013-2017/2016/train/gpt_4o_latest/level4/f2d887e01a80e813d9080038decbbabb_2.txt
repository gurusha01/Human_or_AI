The paper addresses the problem of estimating the risk of a classifier or regression function using only unlabeled data. This problem was originally introduced in prior work (Donmez, 2010). In the current paper, the authors assume that each object has at least three "views," which are conditionally independent given the labels. Under additional assumptions, the authors derive certain performance guarantees. My primary concern is that the main contribution or improvement over (Donmez, 2010) is not clearly articulated. Specifically, (Donmez, 2010) also incorporates conditional independence (see section 2.2, "Collaborative Estimation of the Risks: Conditionally Independent Predictors"), where the independence pertains to predictors rather than "views." In this paper, predictors are also decomposed view-wise, meaning their predictions are conditionally independent as well. Consequently, the assumption in this work seems stronger than the corresponding assumption in (Donmez, 2010). Is the conditional independence of views (as opposed to predictors' outputs) truly necessary? Regardless, what is the precise improvement over (Donmez, 2010)? Perhaps the authors could clarify this in their rebuttal. I acknowledge that the problem itself is rather unconventional, which I view as a strength, but I may be misunderstanding some aspects due to its unusual nature. Additionally, the use of the HMM setting is somewhat misleading, as it requires m i.i.d. time series for the i.i.d. assumption to hold. Typically, in HMMs, inference is performed using a single time series. UPDATE: After reviewing the other reviewers' comments, the novelty aspect—previously my main criticism—is now clearer to me. As a result, I withdraw this objection.
