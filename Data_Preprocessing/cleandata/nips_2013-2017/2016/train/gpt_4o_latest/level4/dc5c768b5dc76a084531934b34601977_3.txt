This paper introduces methods designed to mitigate prediction churn (variability in the predictor) while preserving the potential accuracy improvements that changes in the predictor might bring. The problem is well motivated, and the authors propose two stabilization operators that can be integrated with an MCMC chain, which iteratively perturbs the training sets to simulate the changes that may occur in real-world scenarios as new data is collected and additional features are introduced. Theoretical results, albeit in a restricted setting, are provided to support the proposed approach, alongside experiments conducted on real-world datasets. The paper is clearly written, and the problem is effectively framed. The stabilization operators are reasonable but come with the drawback of introducing two hyperparameters that require tuning. For the proposed MCMC chain to be impactful, it should realistically emulate the changes likely to occur in practiceâ€”namely, the gradual increase in the number of training examples and features over time. However, the current MCMC chain keeps both the number of training examples and features constant (or nearly constant) over time, which significantly limits the potential impact of the approach.
