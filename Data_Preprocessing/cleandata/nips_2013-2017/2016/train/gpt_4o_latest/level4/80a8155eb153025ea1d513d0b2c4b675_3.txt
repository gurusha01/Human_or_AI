The authors investigated the robustness and consistency of the robust k-means algorithm. They demonstrated that the presence of just two outliers can cause the algorithm to fail. However, they also showed that the algorithm remains robust to outliers when the data is well-structured. Additionally, they established that the consistency property of robust k-means holds even when a non-convex penalty function is employed. The problems addressed in this manuscript are both interesting and significant, and the analysis is rigorous. The only concern is that Chapter 5 appears disconnected from the rest of the paper. Moreover, the manuscript lacks an analysis of the experimental results. If simulations are relevant, the reviewer suggests conducting experiments to illustrate the previously derived findings on robustness and consistency.
