In this paper, the authors focus on deconvolving the feedback loops present in a recommender system. They introduce an observation model built on several assumptions, analyze it, and demonstrate that deconvolution is achievable. - The practical purpose or objective of this work is unclear to me. Is the aim to evaluate the effectiveness of an existing recommender system? I recommend that the authors clarify the problem they are addressing and articulate the practical implications of solving it. - If Rtrue can be obtained, is there a way to enhance recommendation performance? - Does the paper account for the fact that most ratings in Robs are missing? It is important to note that R_{true} should represent a dense matrix containing ratings (where every user has a rating for each item, even if it is not observed).
