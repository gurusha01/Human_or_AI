The paper presents a collection of modest results, including the intractability of multiplication and summing-out (i.e., marginalization) for arithmetic circuits (ACs) with specific properties. A recently introduced subclass of ACs, termed PSDDs, is defined and serves as the focal point of the main contributions. The two primary contributions are: (1) an algorithm for the multiplication of PSDDs, demonstrating that this operation can be performed in polynomial time—a limitation for general tractable circuits—and (2) the construction of a corresponding arithmetic circuit that is both decomposable and deterministic. These contributions enable a novel method for compiling probabilistic graphical models, which the authors compare against existing approaches in the paper. 
The results and algorithms presented are straightforward yet, to my knowledge, clever and novel. However, the overall contribution to the literature appears to be incremental. One concern is that the description of the algorithm for PSDD multiplication lacks clarity, with certain lines in the middle of the algorithm being particularly ambiguous. While I understand the constraints of space, I expected at least some elaboration on this point in the supplementary material. A similar issue arises with the comparison to other models in the literature. The performance of the proposed method seems to vary significantly depending on the choice of network, yet there is no discussion on which types of networks benefit most from this approach. Additionally, the paper makes almost no mention of compilation time, which appears to remain unimproved with the proposed method—something I found surprising.
The paper's writing quality is also subpar, with recurring errors throughout. Two notable issues include the inconsistent use of "s" at the end of verbs (e.g., p3 l105 "admits" and p7 l215 "exist") and confusion in the references (e.g., p5 l155 should cite "[Darwiche, 2009]," while l161 should cite "Larkin and Dechter [2003]"). Lastly, I have a question regarding the projection discussed graphically (e.g., Figure 4): do the authors not believe it functions similarly to marginalization over the remaining nodes and their parents in directed acyclic graphs (DAGs)?
