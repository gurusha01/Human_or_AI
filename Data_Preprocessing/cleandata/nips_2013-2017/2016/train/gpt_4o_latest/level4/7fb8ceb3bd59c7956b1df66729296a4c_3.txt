This paper investigates the Burer-Monteiro factorization method for addressing the matrix completion problem. It demonstrates that, despite the non-convex nature of this formulation, there are no problematic local minima. Specifically, the authors establish that all spurious stationary points are strict saddle points, enabling many optimization algorithms to escape these points and converge to the correct solution. The results are derived by examining the geometry of the objective function outside the strongly convex region, leveraging concentration inequalities. This is a robust and relevant contribution to a timely research area. While several recent studies establish local convergence for the non-convex factorization approach in matrix completion, this work extends these findings by proving global convergence. Unlike other concurrent efforts in this domain, the proof presented here introduces novel techniques to address challenges related to incoherence and the impact of the regularizer. The proof appears rigorous, and the paper is well-written and clearly presented. A minor observation: the first inequality in eq. (3.9) does not seem to hold uniformly over B. For instance, if x = e_1 / sqrt(d), then x belongs to B, and the LHS of (3.9) equals p||x||^3, as Omega is likely to miss the sole non-zero entry of xx^T with high probability. However, the RHS of the first inequality in (3.9) is p epsilon ||x||^3. The issue seems to arise because Theorem D.2 applies only to x in B whose infinity norm is smaller than their Frobenius norm by a factor of 1/sqrt(d). That said, this issue appears easily resolvable, as Lemma 3.4 ensures that all relevant x have Frobenius norms exceeding 1/4, which are significantly larger than their infinity norms. Consequently, Theorem D.2 can indeed be applied.
