The manuscript integrates two prominent concepts in theoretical neuroscience: the information bottleneck (IB) framework and sparse coding. In the reviewer's opinion, this combination holds significant potential to make a substantial impact on the field of neural coding. The paper is technically robust, introducing several algorithms, including an EM-IB-style algorithm that incorporates a sparse approximate prior \( p \) (encoding variable) and a kernel-based extension to handle more complex, non-linear relationships between observables. It addresses a range of intriguing problems. However, the presentation could benefit from emphasizing its neuroscientific and neural coding relevance, for example, by explicitly comparing its results to those obtained using standard sparse coding approaches. Thank you for providing such an engaging and thorough exposition of the concepts and methods. As mentioned earlier, I believe this work has the potential to significantly influence theoretical neuroscience.
I have a few questions, primarily driven by curiosity rather than critique. 
1. Could you hypothesize why the sparse IB filters in Fig. 1C appear curved? Based on your description, I understood the stimuli to be oriented bars rather than curved arcs. 
2. Regarding the horizontal bias in orientation representation, was this effect observed only under a strong bottleneck constraint? Would the bias diminish with a softer coding constraint? Additionally, to what extent did sparsity contribute to this result? There is a considerable body of neuroscience literature addressing asymmetries in orientation representation in V1, particularly the well-known "oblique effect." This phenomenon seems like an ideal context for your experimental framework. I believe your work could provide an intriguing functional hypothesis for how this effect arises in the brains of highly visual animals. Such a contribution might even warrant a standalone publication in a neuroscience-focused journal.
Good luck with this promising research! The manuscript is very well written, though I noticed a few minor typographical errors: 
- Line 90: Decide between \( \mu \) or 0.
- Line 93: Typo in the \( \Xi \) variable.
- Line 95: Should this be "row" instead of "column"?
- Line 175: "Features presented on..."
- Lines 195 and 222: "Asymmetric."
- Line 239: Reference to Fig. 3F-G.
- Line 256: "Neural."
- Equation 1: \( X \) and \( Y \) appear swapped in the first line.
Additionally, please double-check the X-axis label in Fig. 1F; should it read "units"? You might also consider clarifying that \( \phi(x) \) (line 146 and following) is a row vector. I found the notations \( \phi(x) \phi^T(x) \) slightly confusing, as I understand these represent dot products.
Thank you again for the fascinating read!
