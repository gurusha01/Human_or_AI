Building on prior work that links accelerated Mirror Descent (AMD) to continuous-time ODEs, the authors extend the ODE dynamics by incorporating a more general averaging scheme and propose a novel adaptive averaging strategy for one of its discretizations. In certain scenarios, the new variant of AMD with adaptive averaging demonstrates improved performance over existing AMD algorithms with restarting. The proposed adaptive averaging strategy is novel and supported by intuitive reasoning. While the paper is well-presented overall, concerns remain regarding its originality and practical utility. 
- Many components (e.g., Lyapunov function, discretization, etc.) are directly derived from an earlier NIPS paper [7]. The extension from simple averaging to generalized averaging appears somewhat trivial and of limited utility, as the authors ultimately focus on the quadratic rate case; achieving faster rates would necessitate higher-order methods, which are not universally applicable.  
- Some contributions, such as the interpretation of the energy function, reformulation into the primal form, and reduction to replicator dynamics, provide a deeper understanding of the accelerated Mirror Descent algorithm. However, these insights are not particularly impactful in advancing the field of machine learning.  
- Although the adaptive averaging strategy is designed to satisfy conditions sufficient for guaranteeing ODE convergence, it lacks a solid theoretical foundation due to approximations introduced during discretization. Furthermore, no explicit convergence results are provided, leaving the method as a heuristic, as acknowledged by the authors. Additionally, there are several alternative averaging schemes for Nesterov's accelerated algorithms; without a comparison to these alternatives, it remains unclear whether this adaptive variant offers significant advantages.  
- The experimental evaluation, limited to a toy example with quadratic/linear objectives, is neither compelling nor sufficient to demonstrate the benefits of adaptive averaging, particularly for more general cases involving strong convexity.

I have reviewed the authors' rebuttal, in which they commit to including the following in the revised version:  
- Additional experiments on higher-dimensional and non-quadratic examples.  
- A theoretical proof of convergence for the adaptive averaging strategy.  
- Implementation of adaptive averaging in Nesterov's cubic-regularized Newton method.  
- A discussion comparing the proposed adaptive averaging strategy to other alternatives.  
Based on these commitments, I have updated my scores accordingly.
