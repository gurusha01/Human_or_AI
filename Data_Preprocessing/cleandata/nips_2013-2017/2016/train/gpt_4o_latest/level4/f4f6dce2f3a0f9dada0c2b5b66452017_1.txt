This paper investigates the relationship between sampling-based regression and low-rank tensor factorization, introducing a novel method that leverages a straightforward bound on the leverage scores of the KRP matrix. The proposed algorithm and theoretical analysis are grounded in established results from sampling-based matrix approximation, with the derivations being relatively direct. Consequently, the primary contribution lies in synthesizing these elements into a cohesive framework. Nonetheless, the work is technically sound, and the practical outcomes demonstrate an improvement over the current state of the art, albeit a modestly incremental one. While the paper contains several typos, grammatical errors, and awkwardly phrased sentences, the core ideas are effectively communicated. 
Theorems 3.2 and 3.3: These are interesting observations, though the results themselves are relatively straightforward.  
Line 174: The phrase "The estimation is tight" could be misleading. It would be more accurate to state that the estimation is tight up to a constant factor R.  
The table between lines 295 and 296 is not explicitly labeled, though it is clear from the context that it refers to Table 1. Additionally, in part (a) of this table, it is not immediately evident that "sketch" corresponds to the method described in [37].
