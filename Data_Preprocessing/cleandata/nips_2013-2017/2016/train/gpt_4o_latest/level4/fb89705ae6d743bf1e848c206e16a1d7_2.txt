The authors present tractable methods for sampling from and calculating the likelihood of C-vine copulas that accommodate both discrete and continuous marginal distributions. The proposed algorithms extend prior work—specifically, the likelihood calculation approach of Aas et al. and the sampling methods of Panagiotelis et al. The key advantage of the proposed methods lies in their scalability: while naive approaches to sampling and likelihood calculation scale exponentially with the number of discrete random variables, the authors' methods scale quadratically. The authors apply these copulas to neural data, which include both continuous measurements (e.g., local field potentials) and discrete measurements (e.g., spike counts). They demonstrate that data generated from mixed copulas are better modeled by their approach compared to models assuming independence between marginals or treating discrete variables as continuous. Additionally, they simulate neural data under two different stimulus conditions and show that the mutual information (MI) between the stimulus and neural signals differs significantly when calculated using their mixed copula model versus models assuming independence or continuous marginals. 
The development of flexible methods for modeling joint distributions of continuous and discrete variables is a significant challenge with broad applicability, including in neuroscience. Copulas that handle both discrete and continuous variables represent a promising approach, and the authors' contributions to computationally efficient methods for fitting and inference with such models are noteworthy. The paper introduces several methodological innovations that I find valuable, and the proposed family of models appears both flexible and practically useful. While prior work has explored pair copula constructions and efficient sampling for discrete copulas, the authors' extension of these ideas to mixed discrete-continuous data is an important contribution.
However, there are areas where the paper could be improved. First, the clarity of the exposition could be enhanced. Certain parts of the paper were difficult to follow. For instance, equation 2 provides a general formula for the likelihood under a mixed copula model, but its derivation—based on differences of discrete random variables—was not immediately clear without consulting the cited references. While I am familiar with copulas in general, this was my first exposure to C-vine copulas, and the description provided required additional reading to fully understand. Given the general audience of a conference like NIPS, more explanation and background would be beneficial. Additionally, some symbols were introduced without definition (e.g., the superscript +/- signs, "c" for the copula density). While I could grasp the overall ideas, these omissions made it challenging to follow the technical details.
The paper would also benefit from a clearer discussion of why a copula-based approach is advantageous compared to existing methods commonly used in neuroscience. Although not cited in the paper, there is a well-established body of work in neuroscience that examines relationships between neural spiking and LFPs (e.g., the first three references below). Connecting the proposed methods to this literature would strengthen the paper's relevance to the neuroscience community.
Finally, the results section could be expanded for greater depth. In the first analysis, data were generated from a specific mixed copula model, and the fit of this model was compared to models assuming independence or continuous marginals. While the mixed copula model performed best, this result is somewhat expected, as models mismatched to the data's structure are unlikely to perform as well as a correctly specified model. To better demonstrate the utility of the proposed methods, an application to more realistic data is desirable. The authors address this by applying their methods to simulated spike and LFP data, showing that MI between the stimulus and neural signals differs under the mixed copula model versus alternative models. While this finding is interesting, I believe experimentalists would be more concerned with whether the proposed methods can detect differences in MI across experimental conditions. For example, one might ask whether MI between LFPs and spiking activity differs when a subject is attending versus not attending to a stimulus. In such scenarios, the key question is whether the proposed methods are sensitive enough to reveal differences in MI under different conditions. An analysis demonstrating this capability would make the results more compelling.
