This paper addresses dictionary learning in the context of brain region analysis. Specifically, the authors introduce a large-scale online dictionary learning framework that incorporates an additional Sobolev regularization term to enforce structure. My primary comments are as follows:  
1) In my view, this work primarily extends the online dictionary learning method (J. Mairal, JMLR 2010) by adding a Sobolev regularization term. As a result, I find the novelty of the contribution to be limited and not aligned with the standards of NIPS.  
2) The paper employs Sobolev regularization to impose structural constraints on the learned dictionary. However, the precise definition of "structure" is unclear. If "structure" refers to sparsity, it is not evident why the sparsity of the dictionary itself would lead to significant improvements for the problems addressed in this work. Overall, the motivation for using Sobolev regularization is insufficiently explained.  
3) There appears to be a potential error in Eq. (1); it should likely be expressed as [V^1, V^2, ..., V^r]^T.  
4) The construction of Eq. (2) requires further elaboration and analysis. For instance, why is the l2 norm applied to the codes instead of the l1 norm, as in (J. Mairal, JMLR 2010)?  
5) What is meant by "line 146"?  
6) The language throughout the paper requires refinement, as it contains numerous typographical errors.
