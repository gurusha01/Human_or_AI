This paper investigates fast learning rates in scenarios where the losses are unbounded and follow a heavy-tailed distribution. The authors propose two novel conditions: the first is the multi-scale Bernstein condition, and the second concerns the integrability of the envelope function. They establish a learning rate faster than O(n^(-1/2)) under these conditions. By introducing these two new conditions, the authors derive a learning rate for unbounded and heavy-tailed losses. This result generalizes certain existing studies and connects to some prior findings. To enhance clarity, the authors could elaborate on the significance of heavy-tailed losses. Providing an example of a heavy-tailed loss would also be beneficial. Typo: Assumption 2.1, There exist -> There exists.
