The paper introduces a novel approach to metric learning for textual documents, building on the "Word Mover's Distance" framework. While the original method operates in an unsupervised manner by measuring distances between word embeddings, this work extends it to a supervised context, leveraging supervision in the form of document class labels (i.e., 'these documents belong to the same class'). The authors have committed to releasing the code (in MATLAB). [I appreciated the authors' detailed responses, which addressed my queries effectively.] The proposed method involves two key components for learning the distance metric: a linear transformation matrix A (a conventional approach) and word importance weights w. However, I would have appreciated a clearer explanation of the intuition behind Eq. (5), which defines the role of w, as well as a breakdown of which component contributes more significantly to the observed improvements. In the experimental evaluation, the method is tested on a classification task. While I acknowledge the challenges of evaluating a distance metric, it would have been interesting to compare the results with a simple classifier on the same datasets for additional context. [These concerns are now resolved, as clarified by the authors.]
Questions: I am unclear about the specific context in which Eq. (2) is applied. The lambda parameter there appears to differ from the lambda mentioned in line 170—could this be clarified? Additionally, what evidence supports the claim in line 316 that the method is "particularly forgiving when two documents use syntactically different but conceptually similar words"?
Other comments: In line 257, the text mentions "on the right we also show the average error across datasets," but I was unable to locate this information—should this refer to Table 3? In Table 2, the distinction between "n" and "ne" is unclear, as I could not find an explanation. Lastly, it is not specified how the parameter k (for kNN classification) is determined—does it depend on the dataset or the method?
