This paper introduces a framework aimed at improving deep feature embedding, which is crucial for applications such as image retrieval and distance-based classification. The framework incorporates a newly defined metric called the Position-Dependent Deep Metric (PDDM), which accounts for not only the difference between two features but also their mean, thereby making the metric position-aware. Additionally, PDDM facilitates the identification of high-quality hard negative samples, which are essential for effective metric training. The framework combines two losses—one on the PDDM metric and another on the feature embeddings—to jointly optimize both the metric and the embedding. The authors validate the proposed framework through experimental studies on fine-grained image retrieval datasets and tasks such as transfer learning and zero-shot learning, demonstrating its effectiveness. 
The proposed deep feature embedding framework is both novel and engaging. The concept of a location-aware similarity metric is well-founded. While the idea of learning local distances to better capture variations in feature space is not entirely new in metric learning, its application to deep feature embedding in this manner appears to be innovative. The formulation of PDDM is clearly presented, and the experimental results substantiate the advantages of the proposed framework.
Comments:  
1. The need for such a local similarity metric likely arises because the learned deep features are not yet fully aligned with the semantic concept (as illustrated in Figure 1(a)). In this context, would the benefits and improvements offered by the proposed framework diminish as a more advanced deep learning network is trained, resulting in better deep feature representations? Please clarify.  
2. In Eq.(2), should u1 and v1 be replaced with u' and v'?  
3. It would be helpful to provide an illustration for the description of the quadruplet (lines 163 to 171) or to link this explanation to Figure 1(c).  
4. The relationship between the functions S(.,.) and D(.,.) could be more thoroughly explained to clarify the connection between the two losses, Em and Ee.  
5. The experimental study is somewhat limited. Expanding the comparisons to include additional benchmark datasets (e.g., fine-grained image retrieval) and more existing methods would further strengthen the work.
After the rebuttal:  
I appreciate the authors' rebuttal. After considering the responses and the feedback from other reviewers, I find this work to be both interesting and novel. The experimental study effectively demonstrates the framework's efficacy. I would like to maintain my original rating.
