This paper introduces an online algorithm for learning structured dictionaries to represent neuroimaging data across individuals. The proposed method extends a well-established framework from [14] by incorporating a Sobolev prior to promote spatial contiguity in dictionary atoms. The authors applied their approach to empirical data, explored the impact of varying tuning parameters, and compared its performance against two alternative methods in the field.
Technical quality: I would rate this aspect marginally below 3 if such an option were available. The model definition was clear, and the algorithms built upon the solid foundation of [14]. However, the paper did not convincingly demonstrate the empirical benefits of incorporating the Sobolev prior in the results section, which may have been partly due to its presentation. For example, in Figure 2, it was unclear in what specific way the SSMF method outperformed the two alternatives. Was the spatial boundary quantitatively smoother? Did SSMF identify certain regions known to be connected that the other methods missed? Beyond vaguely stating that the results from SSMF were "more structured," the authors could strengthen their claims by explicitly defining criteria supported by neuroscience literature and providing quantitative evidence of improvement based on these criteria.
Added after reading the rebuttal: The additional results provided in the rebuttal were highly informative, prompting me to revise my technical quality rating from 2 to 3. I encourage the authors to include these new results in their revised manuscript. Furthermore, they should demonstrate that the dictionary atoms learned by SSMF are more structured (using quantitative metrics) and more meaningful (with references to neuroscience literature).
Novelty/originality: The paper makes a notable original contribution by extending the framework in [14] to include Sobolev priors, which encourage spatially structured dictionary atoms.
Potential impact or usefulness: Dictionary learning is a valuable approach for analyzing neuroimaging data across large groups of subjects. The introduction of Sobolev priors—or similar spatial priors—has theoretical potential to improve results. This paper provides an efficient online algorithm for achieving this, which could become a useful tool for the neuroscience and medical imaging communities. The authors might also consider exploring additional applications of their method, such as image segmentation or regional sensing.
Presentation: While the general organization of the paper is adequate, the manuscript appears to lack thorough editing. Several confusing descriptions and typographical errors hinder comprehension. Below, I list specific issues, some of which are minor typos, while others require more detailed clarification:
- In the matrix decomposition equation between Lines 67 and 68, should the transpose symbol on the group of \( V^j \) (\( j = 1, \ldots, r \)) apply to each individual \( V^j \)?
- Line 73: The reference for the HCP dataset is missing.
- Line 83: "The Graph-Net penalty can imposes …" (grammatical error).
- Line 146: The bold sentence appears to be an unresolved co-author comment.
- The last line of Equation (6) and Equation (8) are inconsistent in their signs: \( V^j + At[j,j]^{-1}(VAt^j - Bt^j) \) versus \( At[j,j] V^j - (VAt^j - Bt^j) \). Additionally, in the last line of Equation (6), does \( V \) represent the dictionary from the previous iteration (i.e., where the \( j \)-th column is not the variable \( v \) being optimized)?
- Line 157: "a single, a single" (repetition).
- Line 169: "We did an extensive study of th how" (typo).
- In Section 3.3, the paragraph near Line 147 (just below Algorithm 2) would benefit from explicitly providing the mathematical/algorithmic solution to Equation (6), even if only in the appendix.
- Figure 2: Results from different methods are shown at different horizontal and sagittal slices, making direct comparisons difficult. Based on the figure, I could not follow the claim in Line 222 that the results from the SSMF model were more "structured."
- Figure 3: It is unclear what was being predicted. Was the task to regress brain data onto behavioral metrics? If so, was this based on the \( U_i \)'s? The legends are not explained in the main text or the figure caption. Additionally, the figure does not seem to include the PCA baseline mentioned in the caption. I also could not follow the description in Lines 224–227, which claimed \( R^2 > 0.1 \). Which curves should I examine to verify this claim?
