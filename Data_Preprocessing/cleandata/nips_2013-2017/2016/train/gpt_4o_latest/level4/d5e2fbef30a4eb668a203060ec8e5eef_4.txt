The paper presents a feature selection algorithm that claims the following contributions: 1) implementation of a two-stage greedy search algorithm applied to MI, and 2) the use of a binary representation of features. The authors refer to their method as CMICOT. Through various practical experiments, CMICOT is shown to outperform several related methods. However, there are a few issues with the paper: 1) on line 27, what does "SBS-based filters" refer to? 2) what is the y-axis in Figure 1? Since this is the only experimental figure provided in the paper, the absence of a labeled y-axis makes it challenging to assess the effectiveness of the proposed method. For instance, the figure could represent a significant difference of 10 or a negligible one, such as 0.00001, which is unclear without proper labeling.
