The manuscript investigates a heterogeneous extension of the widely studied stochastic block models, addressing scenarios where community sizes and connectivity can vary significantly. The authors establish sufficient recovery conditions for both convex relaxation methods and a modified maximum likelihood estimator, along with general lower bounds. Several illustrative examples are included to demonstrate the applicability of their results. Notably, the paper accommodates cases where certain communities are vanishingly small. The findings are compelling and represent a meaningful extension of prior work. I particularly appreciate the examples in Section 3, which effectively elucidate the tradeoffs inherent in heterogeneous SBMs. 
However, the paper has some limitations. It lacks detailed explanations for the key conditions in the main theorems (e.g., Theorem 1). While both upper and lower bounds on the performance of the MLE are presented, there is no discussion about the gap between these bounds, making it challenging to assess the tightness of the results. Additionally, the inclusion of numerical experiments would enhance the paper. 
1. The notion of "relative density" would benefit from a clearer operational interpretation.  
2. The sufficient recovery condition in Theorem 1 lacks interpretation. For instance, the first condition could be explained as requiring the mean difference (or signal strength) to exceed the variation. Providing intuition for each key condition would greatly aid readers.  
3. Around Equation (2.5), the authors transition from the original maximum likelihood estimator to a modified version that is independent of the parameters. While this modified estimator may be more practical, it is unclear whether this modification introduces any statistical loss. Comparisons, whether positive or negative, would be valuable.  
4. The lower bound in Theorem 4 also requires interpretation. At first glance, it appears quite distinct from the sufficient recovery condition in Theorem 3. The authors should discuss the tightness of Theorems 3 and 4â€”do they align in certain special cases?  
5. Although the paper primarily focuses on scaling results, it would be helpful if the authors could comment on the feasibility of obtaining tight pre-constants.  
6. On page 5, the phrase "sufficient conditions for when the exact recovery is impossible" is awkwardly phrased; "necessary conditions for exact recovery" would be more appropriate.  
7. One of the key contributions is demonstrating the robustness of convex relaxation methods even for communities of very small sizes. Numerical experiments using convex programming would help illustrate the practical relevance of these theoretical predictions.
