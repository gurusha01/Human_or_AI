Review
1. Quick Summary  
The authors introduce a novel objective function for clustering networks, termed the "product cut." This function is derived using the personalized PageRank matrix, although the choice of this specific matrix appears incidental, as a broader class of matrices might also be applicable. The primary innovation lies in employing a complex product of partition properties, as opposed to the more conventional approach of summing graph-based metrics for partitions. A key aspect of this complexity involves leveraging the personalized PageRank matrix to define the objective. The authors demonstrate that this objective satisfies a straightforward analytical property, which preserves the partitions in a specific region around a sample problem consisting of two clear clusters and a third cluster introduced as a perturbation. Interestingly, the authors show that the problem can be reformulated as a relaxed convex maximization problem. While this reformulation does not provide computational efficiency, it facilitates the development of more practical algorithms. Notably, the relaxed problem yields integer solutions at its extrema, which inspires a heuristic linear programming (LP) approach to optimize the function. The experimental results include standard evaluations on a few test problems, primarily using "purity" as the metric. However, additional evaluations using metrics such as NMI or F1 would strengthen the results.  
Small Issues & Questions  
1. A key concern with the paper is the convergence of the proposed optimization strategy for convex maximization. The results presented do not establish convergence to a local optimum, nor do they guarantee convergence of the clustering process itself. Specifically, if \( f(x{k+1}) \geq f(xk) \), this does not necessarily imply that a local maximum is found (even with an upper bound), nor does it ensure convergence of the \( x_k \) sequence. Did the authors rely on additional properties to support their conclusions regarding convergence?  
2. In the simple example provided, wouldn't clustering nodes A, B, and C together also be a reasonable outcome? The authors demonstrate that introducing a well-conducted cluster (C) disrupts the NCut objective for bi-partitioning, but this result is somewhat expected since NCut is designed for graph bisection rather than trisection. Could the authors clarify how their method would behave if a tripartition were requested in this scenario?  
Suggestions  
- The proposed method may extend to a broader class of matrices beyond personalized PageRank, such as the heat kernel. Exploring this possibility could enhance the generality of the approach.  
- A parameter study on the influence of \(\alpha\) would be valuable.  
- Since the paper primarily focuses on introducing a new objective function, providing additional motivation for its design and potential applications would strengthen the contribution.  
Presentation Notes  
- The objective function is initially defined without its most critical term, which makes it challenging to fully appreciate its properties at first glance.  
- There is a typo in Figure 1a.  
Final Remarks  
This paper raises some concerns regarding the use of the final optimization procedure, particularly in terms of convergence guarantees. Addressing these issues would be necessary to solidify the contribution. That said, the introduction of a new objective function is a modest but meaningful addition to the literature. Proposing new objective functions is akin to introducing new standardsâ€”while their utility remains uncertain, this particular function exhibits promising properties that justify its acceptance.
