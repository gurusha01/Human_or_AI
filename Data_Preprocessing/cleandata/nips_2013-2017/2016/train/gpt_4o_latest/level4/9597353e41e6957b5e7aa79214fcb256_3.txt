The paper investigates center-based clustering in Euclidean space. While it is well-established that the general k-means (or k-median) problem is computationally hard in this setting, prior work has shown that certain "instance niceness" properties can lead to polynomial-time clustering algorithms. This paper contributes to this body of research by exploring a scenario where the instance is "nice" and the algorithm has oracle access to a domain expert who can determine whether two data points belong to the same cluster. The authors propose a novel notion of niceness, termed the "\(\gamma\)-margin" (Def. 1), which asserts that for every cluster center \(ci\), any point \(x\) in cluster \(i\), and any point \(y\) not in cluster \(i\), the inequality \(d(y, ci) > \gamma d(x, c_i)\) holds. They then establish two key results for inputs satisfying this property: 
1. Upper Bound: They present an efficient algorithm that makes \(O(k^2 \log(k) + k \log(n))\) oracle queries and perfectly clusters the instance.  
2. Lower Bound: They prove that no polynomial-time algorithm without oracle access can cluster a \(\sqrt{3.4}\)-margin instance. Consequently, no polynomial-time algorithm can cluster a \(\sqrt{3.4}\)-margin instance with only \(\log(n)\) oracle queries, as one could exhaustively explore all possible query responses in polynomial time.
This is an excellent paper that offers a fresh and innovative perspective on an important line of research. While the results are not exceptionally technical, they are highly significant for the field. I strongly recommend acceptance and further suggest a presentation, as the paper has the potential to spark engaging discussions and inspire future research. Personally, I found the work thought-provoking and came up with several follow-up questions: Can this oracle be leveraged under other stability assumptions? What if the domain expert envisions a clustering that is not strictly center-based but can be well-approximated point-wise by a center-based clustering? Could the oracle be used to prune the search tree in [KSS04]'s \(O(n \cdot \exp(k))\) approximation for the k-means problem?
My primary concern lies with the lower bound proof, which is confusing and marred by cumbersome notation. I suspect there are technical and presentation errors that detract from the overall quality of an otherwise well-written paper. I expect the authors to address the following issues in their rebuttal, as they may require significant revisions to the lower bound proof:
1. \(Zl\) is ill-defined, as it depends on \(S{l+1}\) (lines 261-262).  
2. Figure 1 uses "d-\(\epsilon\)" instead of "d-\(\alpha\)" (unless I misunderstood the role of \(\alpha\)).  
3. It appears that \(L1\) represents the cost of a type B cluster per \(Ri\) row (line 131 of the appendix), and \(L1-\alpha\) per \(Ri\) row with type A clustering. Therefore, I believe \(L\) should include a term \(L_1 \cdot l\).  
4. For readers unfamiliar with [Vat09], the purpose of the construction is unclear. Specifically, what should "yes" instances map to? Is it \(m\) type-A rows (indicating selected sets) and \((l-m)\) type-B rows (unselected sets)? Or is it a specific selection of the \(B_{i,j}\) sets that encodes the selected sets?  
5. The construction itself is ambiguous. What is \(w\)? Is it \(\epsilon^{-0.5}\) (with \(\epsilon\) as a parameter) or a large polynomial in \(m, l\) as stated in the supplementary material? Additionally, the value of \(k = O(n^\epsilon)\) in this construction is unclear. Please rewrite the construction to clarify the algorithm's input and output.  
6. Explicitly mention the caveats in the lower bound (this also applies to Appendix B, as some constructions involve Steiner points, etc.). Notably, the construction places multiple points at the same location, resulting in instances with infinite (or exponentially high, if small perturbations are allowed) aspect ratios. This leaves open the question of hard instances with bounded aspect ratios.
Minor Comments (Nitpicks):  
- Lines 152-153: These assumptions should be explicitly stated in the introduction, perhaps as a bullet-point list.  
- Algorithm 1: The parameter \(\beta\) should either be included as an input or set as a sufficiently large constant (e.g., 20). Update the input description accordingly.  
- Can the \((\gamma-1)^{-4}\) term be improved to \((\gamma-1)^{-2}\) using Chernoff bounds instead of Hoeffding bounds (i.e., multiplicative bounds on the expected value)?  
- Line 213: "of the oracle" → "of an oracle".  
- Line 217: Capitalize "Section 3".  
- Line 220: "without query" → "without queries".  
- Use the canonical \(\textsc{}\) format to denote the X3C problem.  
- Section 4.1.2: Use \(\mathcal{X}\) consistently, as in the rest of the paper.  
- Theorem 14: Since \(k < |X|\), this effectively reduces to \(\log(n)\). Also, avoid using big-O notation in lower bound theorems, though the statement is otherwise clear.
