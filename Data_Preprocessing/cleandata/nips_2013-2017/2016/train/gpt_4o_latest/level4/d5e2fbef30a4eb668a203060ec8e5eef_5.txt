The authors introduce CMICOT, a filter-based feature selection technique capable of identifying interactions among more than three featuresâ€”a common limitation in capturing higher-order interactions. The manuscript is well-written, with the authors effectively situating their proposed method within the broader challenges of the field and existing literature. The formalization of the approach is clearly presented. However, the evaluation is somewhat limited. While multiple datasets are used, the aggregation of results obscures key details, such as the extent of performance improvements and the underlying reasons for the observed benefits. Although additional results are provided in the appendix, the material within the main text is insufficient on its own. Notably, Figure 1 lacks a y-axis, making it difficult to interpret the relative performance differences.
