This paper introduces a novel "exploration bonus" method grounded in the concept of "pseudo count." It highlights several appealing properties of pseudo count through experiments conducted on two computer games: FREEWAY and PITFALL (Section 4); examines the asymptotic relationship between pseudo count and count (Section 5); explores its connection to intrinsic motivation and information gain (Section 6); and presents experimental results showcasing the use of pseudo count for exploration (Section 7). Overall, the paper is engaging and thought-provoking. To the best of my knowledge, the concept of "pseudo count," its application to exploration, and its relationship to information gain are original contributions. The experimental results in Sections 4 and 7 are compelling. On the whole, I believe this paper meets the standard for a NIPS poster, although the theoretical component is somewhat underdeveloped. My primary concern is that the paper is not well-written overall. Specifically, the transitions between sections lack fluidity. Additionally, the title suggests that the paper will primarily focus on the relationship between pseudo count and intrinsic motivation (information gain). However, upon reading, it seems that this is only the emphasis of Section 6, while other sections appear to focus on different (and at times unrelated) topics. I recommend revising the final version of the paper for clarity and coherence. Minor comments: 1) The figures in Figure 1 and Figure 2 are too small. 2) What distinguishes \( Cn(x,a) \) in Section 2.1 from \( R^+n(x,a) \) in Equation 5? It seems they are equivalent (up to a factor of \( \beta \)), correct?
