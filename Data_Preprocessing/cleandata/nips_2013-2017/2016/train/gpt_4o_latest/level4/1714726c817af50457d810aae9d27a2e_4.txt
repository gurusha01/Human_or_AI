This paper investigates a class of ODEs employing a generalized averaging framework. It establishes sufficient conditions on the dual learning rate and the weights to ensure a desired convergence rate, leveraging a Lyapunov-based analysis. Additionally, the author(s) propose(s) an adaptive averaging heuristic to accelerate the decay of the Lyapunov function. The work includes both theoretical guarantees and numerical comparisons. There is an extensive body of literature focused on empirically enhancing the convergence of accelerated methods. This paper makes a key contribution by demonstrating, through ODEs, that adaptively averaging the weights along the solution trajectories can similarly achieve acceleration. I found this novel approach highly intriguing.
