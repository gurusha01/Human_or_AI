The authors address an intriguing problem: examining how recommender systems (RS) actually influence consumer behavior. They hypothesize that the observed rating matrix is composed of users' true preferences and the influence exerted by the RS. By incorporating sequence into their modeling, they treat the observation matrix as a fixed component (representing users' true preferences) alongside successive influences stemming from a basic RS based on item similarities. Ultimately, they aim to identify items impacted by the RS. To this end, they introduce a metric to quantify RS effects and compare results across various datasets, including those from real-world websites with and without RS. Additionally, the authors conduct experiments on synthetic datasets to fine-tune the method's hyperparameters. 
This work is original and addresses a crucial issue: assessing the effectiveness of RS in terms of their persuasive impact. While the proposed metric captures the RS's ability to influence users toward giving higher or lower ratings rather than reflecting their genuine preferences, the study remains highly compelling. Regarding the results, there appears to be a correlation between the item rating density (ratings/items) and the observed scores (e.g., for films, alcohol, and food). This suggests the possibility of a slight bias in the procedure. The findings on TV shows versus Indian films are particularly striking. Have you conducted further analyses on the average ratings in each case or on the level of consensus in the ratings? For instance, if an item is universally liked, it might exhibit no RS effect.
