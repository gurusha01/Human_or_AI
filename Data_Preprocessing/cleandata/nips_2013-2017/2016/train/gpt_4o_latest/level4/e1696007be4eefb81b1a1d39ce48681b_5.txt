This paper addresses the parameter estimation problem in generalized linear models under the scenario where the number of observations \( n \) significantly exceeds the number of predictors \( p \). The authors propose an algorithm for parameter estimation, leveraging the observation that GLM parameters are approximately proportional to the solution of ordinary least squares (OLS). The manuscript is well-organized and clearly written, and the derivations appear to be correct. Furthermore, the authors provide experimental evidence showing that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms standard methods. Overall, this is a strong paper, and I recommend its acceptance.
