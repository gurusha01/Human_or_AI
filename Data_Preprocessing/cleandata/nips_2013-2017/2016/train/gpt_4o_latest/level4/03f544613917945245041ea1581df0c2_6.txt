This paper introduces a numerical sequence acceleration technique, specifically the Richardson-Romberg extrapolation (a higher-order numerical integrator), to enhance the convergence of the SG-MCMC algorithm. The method involves running two SG-MCMC chains in parallel with distinct step sizes and correlated Gaussian noise. The authors provide both asymptotic and non-asymptotic convergence analyses. Synthetic Gaussian model experiments validate the bias and MSE bounds of the theoretical results, while real-data experiments on large-scale matrix factorization illustrate the practical advantages of the proposed algorithm over standard SGLD. Overall, this is a well-written paper with a solid proposed technique and clear presentation. I believe this work makes a meaningful contribution to the field of SG-MCMC methods and effectively situates the proposed approach within the context of related prior work. However, I have two primary concerns: (1) The novelty of the contribution may be limited, as the effect of numerical integrators on SG-MCMC has been previously studied in [10], and the Richardson-Romberg extrapolation has already been applied to approximate invariant distributions in [23]. (2) The practical applicability of the algorithm may be constrained, and the experimental comparisons might lack fairness. Since this is a parallel implementation of the SG-MCMC algorithm, the use of correlated Brownian motion necessitates communication between the two chains at every step. However, the authors appear to disregard the associated communication cost, assuming it to be negligible. This should be explicitly addressed. Additionally, the allocation of computational resources for SGRRLD and SGLD in the experiments is unclear. For instance, does the single SGLD chain utilize the same resources as the two SGRRLD chains? If not, the comparison may not be fair from a practical standpoint. If the resources are indeed shared, it raises the question of how they are divided between the two SGRRLD chains during the algorithm's execution. Since the primary computational cost of SG-MCMC arises from computing stochastic gradients, it is unclear how splitting resources between the two SGRRLD chains could result in shorter wall-clock times compared to using all resources for a single SGLD chain. The authors should provide more details on the experimental setup. Furthermore, it would be helpful to compare the proposed method with an alternative approach where two SGLD chains are run independently (without communication). Minor comments: (1) The term "Unadjusted Langevin Algorithm (ULA)" is repeated on lines 25 and 70.
