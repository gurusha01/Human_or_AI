This paper explores a specific class of neural networks, where the author successfully demonstrates that the network possesses a single stationary point. The author proposes a fast algorithm that converges to this unique fixed point, which corresponds to the global minimum of the cost function. The study addresses an intriguing problem by showing that a relatively complex model, under carefully chosen constraints, can exhibit a unique stationary point. Beyond convexity (or its generalizations such as geodesic convexity), a common approach for proving the uniqueness of stationary points involves fixed-point theory, which is the methodology adopted in this work. The author constructs a contractive mapping, whose fixed point serves as the unique minimizer of the cost function. 
However, one limitation of the proposed method is its reliance on the boundedness of the spectral radius of a non-trivial matrix for the convergence proof. As the authors note, this constraint prevents the application of their approach to networks with a larger number of hidden units. Another drawback is the significant number of parameters that need to be tuned, which makes the method less intuitive to use. Additionally, for each parameter configuration, the spectral condition must be verified. In their experiments, the authors tested approximately 150,000 different parameter combinations and selected the optimal configuration based on cross-validation accuracy. Despite this extensive search, their method outperformed linear SVMs on only 2 out of 7 datasets. This raises questions about the true effectiveness of the neural network model under investigation.
