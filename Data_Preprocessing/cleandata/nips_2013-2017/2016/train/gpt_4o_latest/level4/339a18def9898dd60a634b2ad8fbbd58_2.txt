The authors present an information-theoretic framework for analyzing the crowdsourcing problem and derive fundamental limits on the number of queries per item in an asymptotic regime under this model. Specifically, they formulate the crowdsourcing problem as an instance of joint source-channel coding (JSCC) with random channel state. In their formulation, the channel state is assumed to be unknown at the encoder but may or may not be known at the decoder. The labels of the items are modeled as an i.i.d. source; the taskmaster is treated as the encoder; the crowd workers are represented as multiple uses of a channel; the workers' skill levels are modeled as random channel states; and the crowdsourcer is treated as the decoder. Using this framework, the authors leverage existing results on coding rates in JSCC to establish the asymptotic fundamental limits on the number of queries per item in crowdsourcing. Additionally, they derive a lower bound on the error probability for a specific coding scheme, referred to as "k-ary incidence coding," under a particular crowdsourcing model (or equivalently, a channel model in their information-theoretic framework). Overall, the paper is well-written and represents a potential first step toward applying JSCC to the modeling of crowdsourcing. 
Some technical comments:  
1. The authors model the crowdsourcing problem as JSCC with random channel state and rely on the standard source-channel separation theorem to derive their results (Theorems 2 and 3). However, they should first justify that the source-channel separation theorem remains valid in the case where the channel state is random, unknown at the encoder, and potentially known at the decoder. While I believe the separation theorem still holds under these conditions, the authors should either provide a proof or cite an existing one.  
2. The taskmaster is modeled as an encoder that only observes the labels of the items, while the crowdsourcer is modeled as a decoder that only observes the labels generated by the workers. This modeling choice may be overly restrictive, as it neglects the possibility that both the taskmaster and the crowdsourcer might have access to the original data (the items). Such access could serve as side information in the JSCC problem. While side information at the encoder alone may not be particularly beneficial, its availability at both the encoder and decoder—or even just at the decoder—could significantly enhance performance. Incorporating side information into the model would make it more realistic and compelling.  
3. In Sec. 4.2, the authors comment on the curves in Fig. 2, stating that the lower bounds for kIC improve as k and q increase. I suspect the authors mean that the lower bound decreases as k and q grow, which implies better code performance. However, this does not necessarily mean that the lower bound itself "improves," as there is no corresponding upper bound for comparison.  
Edited following the authors' response: The application of joint source-channel coding to model crowdsourcing is intriguing. However, as another reviewer has noted, a nonasymptotic characterization of the fundamental limits of crowdsourcing would be more practical. The authors are encouraged to consult recent results by Kostina and Verdu on nonasymptotic converses for JSCC:
