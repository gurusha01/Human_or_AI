This paper investigates the tractability of two fundamental operations on arithmetic circuits (ACs)—multiplication and summing-out—and introduces a novel perspective on Probabilistic Sentential Decision Diagrams (PSDDs) as a subclass of ACs. The authors demonstrate that PSDDs support a polytime multiplication operator, unlike other AC representations, making them suitable for a broader range of applications. However, PSDDs do not support a polytime summing-out operator, which limits their utility for certain inference tasks. The paper also proposes a simple yet effective compilation algorithm for probabilistic graphical models using PSDD multiplication, bypassing intermediate logical representations like Sentential Decision Diagrams (SDDs) or d-DNNFs. The empirical results show that PSDDs often yield smaller representations compared to other AC-based approaches, highlighting their efficiency in certain scenarios.
Strengths:
1. Technical Contribution: The paper provides a rigorous theoretical analysis of PSDDs, proving their tractability for multiplication and their limitations for summing-out. This is a significant contribution to the study of tractable probabilistic representations.
2. Novelty: The introduction of PSDD multiplication as a polytime operation is a notable advancement, particularly given the intractability of this operation in other AC classes. The proposed compilation algorithm is also novel and demonstrates practical utility.
3. Empirical Validation: The experiments are well-designed and demonstrate the advantages of PSDDs over existing methods, particularly in terms of size and efficiency. The benchmarks used (e.g., UAI-14 datasets) are relevant and challenging.
4. Clarity of Theoretical Results: The proofs and theoretical discussions are thorough and well-supported, making the paper accessible to readers familiar with the domain.
Weaknesses:
1. Scope of Evaluation: While the empirical results are promising, the evaluation is limited to specific benchmarks and does not explore broader applications of PSDDs, such as in real-world probabilistic reasoning tasks.
2. Summing-Out Limitation: The inability of PSDDs to support polytime summing-out is a significant drawback, especially for inference algorithms like variable elimination. While the authors acknowledge this limitation, they do not provide alternative strategies to mitigate it.
3. Complexity of Multiplication: Although PSDD multiplication is polytime, the practical scalability of the approach for very large models is not fully explored. The paper could benefit from a discussion of potential bottlenecks in real-world applications.
4. Comparison with Related Work: While the paper references related representations like ADDs, PDGs, and AOMDDs, the comparisons are primarily theoretical. A more comprehensive empirical comparison would strengthen the claims.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper addresses an important problem in probabilistic reasoning and provides a novel solution with theoretical and practical implications.
- The proposed PSDD multiplication operator and compilation algorithm are significant contributions that advance the state of the art.
- The empirical results demonstrate the utility of PSDDs in compiling probabilistic graphical models, with clear advantages over existing methods.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The limitation of PSDDs for summing-out variables restricts their applicability in broader inference tasks.
- The evaluation is somewhat narrow, and the scalability of the approach for large-scale models remains unclear.
- The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with alternative representations in both theoretical and empirical contexts.
Recommendation:
Overall, this paper makes a strong contribution to the field of tractable probabilistic representations. While there are some limitations, the novelty and potential impact of the work outweigh the weaknesses. I recommend acceptance, with minor revisions to address the scope of evaluation and provide a more comprehensive discussion of related work.
