The paper investigates accelerated descent dynamics for constrained convex optimization, presenting a novel framework that generalizes accelerated mirror descent (AMD) through adaptive averaging. The authors leverage a Lyapunov function to derive sufficient conditions for achieving desired convergence rates and propose an adaptive averaging heuristic to optimize these rates. Notably, the paper demonstrates that replicator dynamics, a well-known mirror descent method on the simplex, can be accelerated using this framework. The authors provide theoretical guarantees for their adaptive averaging heuristic in continuous time, show that it preserves quadratic convergence rates in discrete time, and validate its performance through numerical experiments, comparing it to existing heuristics like adaptive restarting.
Strengths:
1. Theoretical Contribution: The paper provides a rigorous analysis of AMD dynamics, offering sufficient conditions for convergence rates using a Lyapunov argument. The introduction of adaptive averaging is a significant theoretical advancement, as it ensures convergence while potentially improving empirical performance.
2. Novelty: The adaptive averaging heuristic is an original contribution, addressing limitations of existing heuristics like gradient and speed restarting. The connection between acceleration and averaging is also well-articulated and extends prior work on continuous-time optimization.
3. Practical Relevance: The numerical experiments demonstrate the practical utility of adaptive averaging, showing its superiority over existing heuristics in certain cases, particularly for strongly convex functions.
4. Clarity of Results: The paper provides clear theoretical guarantees and detailed derivations, ensuring reproducibility. The inclusion of both Lyapunov and energy functions offers complementary perspectives on the dynamics.
5. Broader Impact: The application of accelerated dynamics to replicator equations in evolutionary game theory is a compelling example of the framework's versatility.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity: While the theoretical sections are rigorous, the dense mathematical exposition may be challenging for readers unfamiliar with continuous-time optimization or mirror descent. Simplifying or summarizing key results could improve accessibility.
2. Limited Scope of Experiments: The numerical experiments are insightful but limited to low-dimensional settings (e.g., RÂ³) and specific objective functions. Testing the heuristic on higher-dimensional problems or real-world datasets would strengthen the empirical validation.
3. Comparison with Other Methods: Although adaptive averaging is compared to restarting heuristics, the paper does not benchmark it against other state-of-the-art adaptive methods like Adam or Adagrad in discrete-time settings. This would provide a more comprehensive evaluation.
4. Heuristic Limitations: While adaptive averaging preserves the original convergence rate, it is unclear whether it can achieve faster rates for strongly convex functions. This limits its theoretical appeal compared to other acceleration techniques.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper makes a significant theoretical contribution by generalizing AMD dynamics and introducing adaptive averaging.
- It provides rigorous guarantees for convergence and demonstrates practical improvements over existing heuristics.
- The connection to replicator dynamics and evolutionary game theory broadens the paper's relevance beyond optimization.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The empirical validation is somewhat limited, and the experiments do not fully explore the heuristic's performance in diverse or high-dimensional settings.
- The dense theoretical exposition may limit accessibility for a broader audience.
Recommendation:
Overall, this paper represents a valuable contribution to the field of optimization and accelerated methods. While there are areas for improvement, particularly in empirical validation and clarity, the theoretical insights and practical implications justify its acceptance. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the clarity and experimental scope.
