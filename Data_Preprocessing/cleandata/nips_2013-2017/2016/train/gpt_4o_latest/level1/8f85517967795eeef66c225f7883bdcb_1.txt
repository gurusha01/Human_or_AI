The paper introduces a novel class of probabilistic models termed "cooperative graphical models," which generalize beyond low-treewidth, pairwise, and log-supermodular models to capture richer variable interactions. The authors propose efficient inference algorithms that leverage the polyhedral structure of submodular functions in combination with variational inference techniques. Specifically, they derive both upper and lower bounds on the partition function, with the upper bound optimized via semidefinite programming (SDP) or tree-reweighted belief propagation (TRWBP), and the lower bound refined using belief propagation or mean-field methods. The paper demonstrates the efficacy of these algorithms through experiments on synthetic datasets and a real-world image segmentation task, showing that the proposed methods yield competitive bounds and accurate marginals.
Strengths
1. Technical Novelty: The paper introduces a new family of models that extend the expressive power of existing graphical models while maintaining tractable inference. This is a significant contribution to the field of probabilistic modeling.
2. Rigorous Theoretical Framework: The authors provide a solid theoretical foundation for their methods, including convex optimization formulations, smoothness analysis, and convergence guarantees. The use of submodular polyhedra and variational inference is well-motivated and innovative.
3. Algorithmic Contributions: The proposed inference schemes are practical and scalable, combining classical variational methods with submodular optimization techniques. The use of Frank-Wolfe and projected gradient descent for optimizing the upper bound is particularly noteworthy.
4. Experimental Validation: The experiments are comprehensive, covering both synthetic and real-world datasets. The results convincingly demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of the proposed methods, particularly in challenging settings such as image segmentation.
Weaknesses
1. Clarity: While the paper is technically sound, the dense mathematical exposition may hinder accessibility for readers unfamiliar with submodular functions or variational inference. More intuitive explanations and visual aids could improve clarity.
2. Comparison to Baselines: Although the paper compares its methods to several baselines (e.g., TRWBP, SDP, mean-field), the discussion of why certain methods perform better in specific regimes could be more detailed. For instance, the limitations of SDP in the synthetic experiments are mentioned but not deeply analyzed.
3. Scope of Applicability: The paper focuses on binary models and monotone submodular functions in some cases. It would be helpful to discuss the potential for extending the methods to non-binary or non-monotone settings.
4. Runtime Analysis: While scalability is claimed, a more detailed runtime comparison across methods and datasets would strengthen the argument. For example, the bottleneck in TRWBP updates is mentioned but not quantified.
