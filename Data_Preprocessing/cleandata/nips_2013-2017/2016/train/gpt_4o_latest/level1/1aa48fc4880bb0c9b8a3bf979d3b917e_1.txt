This paper addresses the problem of solving convex-concave saddle-point problems with large-scale separable structures, a common scenario in machine learning. The authors extend stochastic variance reduction methods, such as SVRG and SAGA, to this class of problems, providing the first linearly convergent algorithms for large-scale saddle-point optimization. The key contributions include: (1) a novel convergence analysis using monotone operators, which generalizes the applicability of the proposed algorithms to variational inequalities, (2) insights into two types of separability (function-based and partial derivative-based), (3) the importance of non-uniform sampling for efficiency, and (4) an acceleration framework using a modified "catalyst" method. The paper also demonstrates the practical advantages of these methods through experiments on machine learning tasks with non-separable losses and regularizers.
Strengths:
1. Technical Novelty: The paper extends variance reduction techniques to saddle-point problems, which is a significant step forward. The use of monotone operator theory for convergence analysis is particularly elegant and broadens the scope of the work beyond saddle-point problems.
2. Practical Relevance: The proposed methods address real-world challenges, such as non-separable losses and regularizers, which are common in machine learning. The experiments demonstrate clear improvements over existing methods, particularly for ill-conditioned problems.
3. Comprehensive Analysis: The authors provide detailed theoretical guarantees, including linear convergence rates, and discuss practical considerations like sampling probabilities and computational complexity.
4. Acceleration Framework: The adaptation of the catalyst framework to saddle-point problems is a valuable addition, offering further efficiency gains.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity: While the paper is mathematically rigorous, it is dense and challenging to follow, particularly for readers unfamiliar with monotone operator theory or saddle-point optimization. The presentation could benefit from more intuitive explanations and visual aids.
2. Experimental Scope: The experiments focus on specific machine learning tasks. While these are relevant, additional benchmarks or applications (e.g., game theory or variational inequalities) would strengthen the empirical validation.
3. Strong Assumptions: The algorithms require knowledge of strong convexity-concavity constants, which may not always be available in practice. While the authors acknowledge this and propose future work on adaptivity, it remains a limitation of the current approach.
4. Comparison to Related Work: Although the paper references related methods like SAG, SVRG, and SAGA, a more thorough comparison to recent advances in saddle-point optimization (e.g., primal-dual methods) would provide additional context.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper introduces a novel and impactful extension of variance reduction methods to saddle-point problems, with strong theoretical and practical contributions.
- The proposed methods are well-motivated and address important challenges in machine learning.
- The acceleration framework and use of non-uniform sampling are significant innovations.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The paper's clarity and accessibility could be improved, potentially limiting its impact on a broader audience.
- The experimental evaluation, while promising, could be expanded to include more diverse applications.
Recommendation:
Overall, this paper makes a strong contribution to the field of optimization in machine learning, particularly for saddle-point problems. Despite some limitations in clarity and experimental scope, the novelty and significance of the work warrant acceptance. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to improve clarity and expand the experimental evaluation.
