Review of the Paper
This paper investigates the dynamics of learning algorithms in repeated games, introducing the concept of "Low Approximate Regret" (LAR) and demonstrating its utility in achieving fast convergence to approximate optimality in a variety of game-theoretic settings. The authors extend prior work by Syrgkanis et al. [28] and Lykouris et al. [19], addressing limitations in feedback models, convergence rates, and algorithmic scope. Specifically, the paper shows that LAR algorithms, including simple ones like Hedge, achieve faster convergence under realistic feedback models (realized and bandit feedback) and in dynamic population games. The authors also propose a new bandit algorithm with improved dependence on the number of actions, which is applicable to both cost minimization and utility maximization settings.
The paper builds on prior work in regret minimization and game theory, particularly the RVU property of Syrgkanis et al. [28], by relaxing the feedback requirements and broadening the class of algorithms that achieve fast convergence. The authors also strengthen results by Lykouris et al. [19] in dynamic population games, allowing for higher player churn and simpler algorithms. This work is well-situated within the literature on smooth games and no-regret dynamics, with clear connections to foundational concepts like the price of anarchy [23].
Strengths
1. Technical Contributions: The introduction of the LAR property is a significant conceptual advance, as it unifies and generalizes regret bounds across a broad class of algorithms. The paper demonstrates that LAR is sufficient for fast convergence in smooth games, even under realistic feedback models.
2. Algorithmic Scope: The inclusion of simple algorithms like Hedge and its variants under the LAR framework makes the results broadly applicable. The new bandit algorithm with improved dependence on the number of actions is a notable contribution.
3. Realistic Feedback Models: By focusing on realized feedback rather than expected feedback, the paper addresses a critical limitation of prior work, making the results more practical for real-world applications.
4. Dynamic Games: The extension of results to dynamic population games with higher churn rates and simpler algorithms is a valuable contribution, as it broadens the applicability of the framework.
5. Clarity and Rigor: The paper is well-written and provides detailed proofs, making the results easy to follow. The authors also compare their work to prior results in a systematic and transparent manner.
Weaknesses
1. Experimental Validation: The paper is largely theoretical, and while the results are compelling, the lack of experimental validation limits the ability to assess the practical impact of the proposed algorithms.
2. Complexity of New Bandit Algorithm: While the new bandit algorithm improves on existing methods, its practical implementation and computational overhead are not discussed in sufficient detail.
3. Generality of LAR: Although the LAR property is shown to be ubiquitous, the paper could benefit from a more in-depth discussion of its limitations or scenarios where it might not apply.
4. Comparison to RVU: While the authors highlight the advantages of LAR over RVU, a more detailed empirical or theoretical comparison of the two properties would strengthen the claims.
Arguments for Acceptance
- The paper provides a significant theoretical advance by introducing the LAR property and demonstrating its utility across a wide range of settings.
- It addresses key limitations of prior work, particularly in feedback models and algorithmic scope.
- The results are rigorously derived and well-situated within the existing literature.
Arguments Against Acceptance
- The lack of experimental validation limits the practical impact of the work.
- The computational complexity and scalability of the proposed bandit algorithm are not fully explored.
Recommendation
I recommend acceptance of this paper, as it makes a substantial theoretical contribution to the study of learning dynamics in games and addresses important limitations of prior work. However, the authors are encouraged to include experimental results and discuss the practical implications of their algorithms in future revisions.
