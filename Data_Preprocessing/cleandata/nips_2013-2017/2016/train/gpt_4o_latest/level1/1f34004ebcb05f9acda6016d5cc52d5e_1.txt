This paper addresses the problem of learning Supervised PageRank models by proposing novel gradient-based and gradient-free optimization methods for non-convex loss minimization. The authors provide theoretical convergence guarantees for both methods, a significant improvement over the state-of-the-art gradient-based approach, which lacked such guarantees. The paper also explores the trade-off between computational complexity and accuracy in the two-level optimization framework and demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed methods on a real-world web page ranking task.
Summary and Relation to Prior Work
The paper builds on foundational work in PageRank [18], HITS [11], and their supervised extensions [21], which incorporate node and edge features into ranking models. While prior methods like [21] relied on gradient-based optimization without convergence proofs, this work introduces two new methods: a gradient-based approach with inexact oracle guarantees and a gradient-free method adapted for constrained optimization. The authors leverage the linearly convergent method from [17] to approximate stationary distributions and derivatives, ensuring theoretical rigor. This work is well-aligned with recent advancements in optimization for machine learning, particularly in the context of graph-based ranking models.
Strengths
1. Theoretical Contributions: The paper provides rigorous convergence rate guarantees for both optimization methods, addressing a critical gap in prior work.
2. Algorithmic Innovation: The gradient-free method is particularly notable for avoiding derivative calculations, making it computationally efficient for large-scale problems.
3. Empirical Validation: The proposed methods outperform the state-of-the-art [21] in both ranking quality and computational efficiency, as demonstrated on a real-world dataset from Yandex.
4. Clarity of Results: The experimental results are well-documented, with statistical significance tests supporting the claims of superiority.
5. Relevance: The problem of learning Supervised PageRank models is highly relevant to the broader machine learning and information retrieval communities, particularly for applications in search engines and social networks.
Weaknesses
1. Clarity: While the theoretical sections are thorough, they are dense and may be challenging for readers unfamiliar with advanced optimization techniques. Simplifying or summarizing key results could improve accessibility.
2. Experimental Scope: The experiments focus on a single dataset. While this dataset is large and realistic, additional datasets could strengthen the generalizability of the findings.
3. Practical Implications: The paper could better articulate the practical trade-offs between the gradient-based and gradient-free methods in real-world applications, beyond computational complexity and accuracy.
