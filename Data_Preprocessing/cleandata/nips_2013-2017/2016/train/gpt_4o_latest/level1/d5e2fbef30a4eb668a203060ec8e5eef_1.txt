The paper introduces CMICOT, a novel feature selection method based on sequential forward selection (SFS) and conditional mutual information (CMI). CMICOT addresses the challenge of identifying high-order feature interactions, a limitation in existing SFS-based filters, by formulating a saddle point optimization problem. The authors propose two key innovations: (1) a two-stage greedy approximation to efficiently solve the optimization problem and (2) binary representation of features to mitigate sample complexity issues. The empirical evaluation demonstrates CMICOT's superiority over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in detecting high-order interactions, on both synthetic and real-world datasets using three classifiers (NBC, kNN, AdaBoost).
Strengths:
1. Novelty: The paper introduces a novel scoring mechanism for feature selection that explicitly accounts for high-order feature interactions, filling a significant gap in existing MI-based SFS techniques.
2. Technical Soundness: The proposed two-stage greedy search and binary representation techniques are well-motivated and theoretically justified. The computational complexity of the method is carefully analyzed, showing linear growth with SFS iterations, comparable to state-of-the-art methods.
3. Comprehensive Evaluation: The method is validated on synthetic datasets (where ground truth is known) and 10 real-world datasets, demonstrating its ability to detect high-order interactions and outperforming competitors in most cases.
4. Practical Impact: The binary representation approach significantly reduces sample complexity, making the method applicable to high-dimensional datasets, a common scenario in modern machine learning tasks.
5. Clarity of Results: The experimental results are presented in a detailed and structured manner, with comparisons to a wide range of baseline methods, including interaction-aware and interaction-agnostic filters.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity of Presentation: While the technical content is rich, the paper is dense and could benefit from clearer explanations, especially for non-experts. For example, the intuition behind the saddle point optimization and its connection to feature interactions could be simplified.
2. Limited Classifier Diversity: The evaluation focuses on three classifiers, with NBC showing no significant improvement. Including additional classifiers (e.g., SVMs or deep learning models) could strengthen the generalizability claims.
3. Parameter Sensitivity: The method introduces parameters (e.g., team size `t`), but the paper does not provide a systematic analysis of their impact on performance or guidance for selecting them in practice.
4. Scalability: Although the binary representation reduces sample complexity, the method's scalability to extremely high-dimensional datasets (e.g., those with tens of thousands of features) remains unclear.
5. Comparison to Non-SFS Methods: The paper focuses on SFS-based filters but does not compare CMICOT to non-SFS feature selection methods, which may also capture high-order interactions.
Recommendation:
- Pro Acceptance: The paper addresses an important problem, introduces novel and technically sound methods, and demonstrates strong empirical performance.
- Con Acceptance: The dense presentation and limited exploration of parameter sensitivity and scalability may hinder accessibility and practical adoption.
Final Verdict:
I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to improve clarity and provide additional insights into parameter tuning and scalability. CMICOT is a significant contribution to feature selection research, particularly for high-dimensional datasets requiring awareness of high-order feature interactions.
