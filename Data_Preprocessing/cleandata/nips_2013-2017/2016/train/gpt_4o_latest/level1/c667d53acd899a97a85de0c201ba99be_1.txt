The paper addresses a fundamental problem in computational economics: the design of revenue-maximizing combinatorial auctions (CAs) with a focus on deterministic mechanisms. It provides the first formal sample complexity analysis for a hierarchy of deterministic combinatorial auction classes commonly used in automated mechanism design (AMD). The authors derive tight sample complexity bounds, demonstrating how the empirical revenue of a designed mechanism relates to its expected revenue over an unknown distribution of bidder valuations. The paper also explores the learning-theoretic implications of these results, employing tools like Rademacher complexity and pseudo-dimension to analyze the structure of revenue functions. This work builds on prior research in single-item and single-dimensional auction settings, extending it to the more complex combinatorial domain. It fills a critical gap in AMD by providing theoretical guarantees for the sample efficiency of designing high-revenue auctions.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Originality: The paper tackles an open problem in computational economics, extending the theoretical foundations of AMD. The use of learning theory tools like Rademacher complexity and pseudo-dimension in this context is innovative and bridges the gap between mechanism design and machine learning.
2. Theoretical Contributions: The authors provide tight sample complexity bounds for various auction classes, including affine maximizer auctions (AMAs), mixed bundling auctions (MBAs), and mixed bundling auctions with reserve prices (MBARPs). These results are both practically relevant and theoretically significant.
3. Clarity of Results: The hierarchy of auction classes is well-defined, and the results are presented systematically. The paper clearly distinguishes between general and more structured auction classes, showing how additional structure reduces sample complexity.
4. Broader Impact: The findings have implications beyond AMD, contributing to the understanding of complex hypothesis classes in learning theory. The results are also applicable to any black-box optimization algorithm used in AMD.
Weaknesses:
1. Complexity of Presentation: While the paper is rigorous, the technical details might be challenging for readers unfamiliar with learning theory or mechanism design. The exposition could benefit from more intuitive explanations and examples to make the results accessible to a broader audience.
2. Empirical Validation: The paper focuses entirely on theoretical analysis. While the results are compelling, empirical validation on real-world auction data or simulations would strengthen the practical relevance of the findings.
3. Limited Scope of Auction Classes: The focus on deterministic auctions, while justified, excludes randomized mechanisms, which are known to achieve higher revenues in some settings. A discussion of how the results might extend to randomized auctions would be valuable.
4. Assumptions on Valuations: The paper assumes bounded bidder valuations and specific parameter constraints. While standard in theoretical work, these assumptions may limit the applicability of the results in real-world scenarios.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper addresses a critical and unsolved problem in computational economics.
- It provides rigorous theoretical contributions with significant implications for AMD and learning theory.
- The results are novel, well-supported, and advance the state of the art in auction design.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The lack of empirical validation limits the practical impact of the work.
- The technical presentation may be inaccessible to non-experts.
- The exclusion of randomized mechanisms narrows the scope of the contributions.
Recommendation:
I recommend acceptance of this paper, as it provides a substantial theoretical contribution to the field of automated mechanism design and computational economics. However, the authors are encouraged to address the clarity of exposition and consider empirical validation in future work.
