The paper introduces CMICOT, a novel feature selection method that extends mutual information (MI)-based sequential forward selection (SFS) to account for high-order feature interactions. The authors propose a saddle point optimization framework to identify joint interactions between features, addressing computational and sample complexity challenges through a two-stage greedy approximation and binary feature representation. Empirical validation on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrates the method's superiority over state-of-the-art interaction-aware and interaction-agnostic filters.
Strengths
1. Novelty and Significance: The paper addresses a critical gap in MI-based feature selection by enabling the detection of high-order feature interactions, a limitation of existing methods. This contribution is significant for advancing feature selection in high-dimensional datasets.
2. Technical Soundness: The proposed optimization framework is well-motivated, and the two-stage greedy approximation is a practical solution to computational intractability. The use of binary representatives to mitigate sample complexity is innovative and generalizable to other SFS-based methods.
3. Empirical Validation: The experiments are comprehensive, including synthetic datasets with known interactions and real-world benchmarks. The results convincingly demonstrate CMICOT's ability to detect high-order interactions and its superior performance with classifiers like kNN and AdaBoost.
4. Efficiency: The method achieves linear computational complexity with respect to SFS iterations, making it competitive with existing approaches while offering higher-order interaction awareness.
Weaknesses
1. Clarity: While the technical content is robust, the paper is dense and could benefit from clearer explanations, particularly in the derivation of the scoring function and the role of binary representatives. A simplified example illustrating the saddle point optimization would aid comprehension.
2. Limited Classifier Scope: The method's performance with Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC) is underwhelming, which the authors attribute to NBC's inability to exploit high-order interactions. This limitation should be more explicitly discussed, as it affects the method's general applicability.
3. Parameter Sensitivity: The choice of team size \( t \) is critical to the method's performance, but the paper provides limited guidance on selecting \( t \) for new datasets. A more detailed analysis of parameter sensitivity would enhance usability.
4. Comparisons with Baselines: While CMICOT outperforms existing methods, the paper lacks a detailed discussion of why interaction-aware methods like RelaxMRMR and IWFS fail to match its performance. This would strengthen the argument for CMICOT's advantages.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Improve the clarity of the technical sections by including illustrative examples and visualizations of the optimization process.
2. Provide a more detailed discussion of parameter selection, particularly the impact of \( t \) and \( s \), to guide practitioners.
3. Expand the discussion on the limitations of CMICOT, including its dependence on binary representations and its performance with simpler classifiers like NBC.
4. Include a broader analysis of computational overhead, especially for very large datasets, to better contextualize the method's scalability.
Recommendation
I recommend acceptance with minor revisions. The paper makes a significant contribution to feature selection by addressing high-order interactions, a challenging and underexplored area. While the clarity and practical guidance could be improved, the method's novelty, technical rigor, and empirical validation make it a valuable addition to the field.
