The paper proposes a novel approach for unsupervised learning of exemplar similarities using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The authors address key challenges in exemplar-based learning, such as the imbalance between a single positive sample and many negatives, unreliable relationships between samples, and the limitations of traditional softmax loss. Their method introduces a framework for grouping samples into compact cliques with mutually consistent relations, which are then used to train a CNN. This iterative process alternates between updating similarities and refining the CNN, ultimately learning a unified representation for all samples. The approach demonstrates competitive performance on tasks such as posture analysis, pose estimation, and object classification.
Strengths:
1. Novelty: The paper introduces a unique optimization-based method to overcome the challenges of exemplar-based learning in CNNs. The use of compact cliques and iterative refinement of similarities is innovative and well-motivated.
2. Empirical Validation: The method is rigorously evaluated on three datasets (Olympic Sports, Leeds Sports, and PASCAL VOC 2007), showing significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in unsupervised similarity learning.
3. Practical Relevance: The approach eliminates the need for costly manual annotations, making it highly applicable for large-scale datasets where supervised labeling is infeasible.
4. Clarity of Results: The paper provides detailed quantitative and qualitative evaluations, including ROC curves, similarity matrices, and visualizations of nearest neighbors, which effectively demonstrate the benefits of the proposed method.
5. Reproducibility: The inclusion of a GitHub link for the project enhances the reproducibility of the work.
Weaknesses:
1. Limited Theoretical Analysis: While the empirical results are strong, the theoretical justification for some design choices, such as the specific optimization formulation and parameter settings, could be elaborated further.
2. Computational Complexity: The optimization problem for selecting batches of cliques is NP-hard, and while the authors employ a relaxation technique, the computational cost of this step is not thoroughly discussed.
3. Generalization: The method is primarily evaluated on visual similarity tasks. Its applicability to other domains or modalities (e.g., text or audio) is not explored, which limits its broader impact.
4. Comparison with Supervised Methods: While the paper focuses on unsupervised learning, a more detailed comparison with supervised methods could provide additional context for the performance gains.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:
Pros:
- The paper addresses an important problem in unsupervised learning with a novel and well-executed approach.

Recommendation:
Overall, this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of unsupervised similarity learning and is well-suited for presentation at NIPS. The innovative approach, strong empirical results, and practical relevance outweigh the minor weaknesses. I recommend acceptance, with suggestions to include a more detailed discussion of computational costs and theoretical underpinnings in the final version.
