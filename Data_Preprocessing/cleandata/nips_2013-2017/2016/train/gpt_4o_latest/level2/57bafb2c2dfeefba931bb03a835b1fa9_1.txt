The paper investigates the problem of exact recovery in the heterogeneous Stochastic Block Model (SBM), extending prior work by addressing more general configurations, including variable community sizes, connectivity probabilities, and a growing number of communities. The authors propose semidefinite programming (SDP) and a modified maximum likelihood estimator as recovery methods, providing theoretical guarantees and bounds for their performance. They also explore tradeoffs among SBM parameters, identify new recoverable configurations, and extend their results to partially observed graphs. The paper contributes to understanding the statistical and computational limits of recovery in heterogeneous SBM.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Scope: The paper addresses the heterogeneous SBM in its full generality, which is a significant extension over prior works that focus on more restrictive cases (e.g., homogeneous SBM or fixed community sizes). The inclusion of configurations with very small communities (e.g., sizes as small as \(O(\sqrt{\log n})\)) is a notable advancement.
2. Theoretical Contributions: The authors provide rigorous recovery guarantees using SDP and maximum likelihood estimators. Theorems 1-4 are well-motivated and supported by detailed proofs, offering both upper and lower bounds for recoverability.
3. Practical Insights: The exploration of parameter tradeoffs (e.g., community size, connectivity probabilities) and examples of recoverable configurations (e.g., small or weak communities) are valuable for practitioners. The results challenge prior assumptions, such as the log \(n\) threshold for community size.
4. Extension to Partial Observations: Adapting the recovery methods to partially observed graphs enhances the paper's applicability to real-world scenarios, such as incomplete network data.
5. Clarity of Results: The paper introduces the concept of "relative density" as a key parameter for recovery, which simplifies the interpretation of results and provides a unified framework for analyzing heterogeneous SBM.
Weaknesses:
1. Experimental Validation: The paper lacks empirical validation of the proposed methods. While the theoretical results are strong, numerical experiments on synthetic or real-world networks would strengthen the paper by demonstrating practical feasibility and robustness.
2. Clarity and Accessibility: The paper is mathematically dense, which may limit its accessibility to a broader audience. Simplifying some technical sections or providing more intuitive explanations (e.g., for Theorems 1-4) could improve readability.
3. Comparison with Prior Work: While the paper references prior works, it could benefit from a more explicit comparison of theoretical guarantees and computational performance with existing methods, such as the "peeling" strategy or other SDP-based approaches.
4. Open Problems: While the authors acknowledge open questions (e.g., phase transitions, overlapping communities), the discussion could be expanded to outline concrete next steps or potential approaches to address these gaps.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper makes a significant theoretical contribution to the study of heterogeneous SBM, pushing the boundaries of what is known about exact recovery in complex network models.
- The results are novel and impactful, particularly the ability to recover very small or weak communities and the identification of new recoverable configurations.
- The extension to partial observations and the use of SDP for efficient recovery are practically relevant and align with the interests of the NIPS community.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The lack of experimental validation limits the paper's practical impact and leaves open questions about the real-world applicability of the proposed methods.
- The mathematical density and limited accessibility may hinder understanding for a broader audience, including practitioners.
Recommendation:
I recommend acceptance with minor revisions. The paper provides valuable theoretical insights and advances the state of the art in community detection for heterogeneous SBM. However, the authors should consider adding experimental results and improving the clarity of their presentation to maximize the paper's impact.
