The paper addresses the critical problem of revenue-maximizing combinatorial auctions (CAs) in computational economics, focusing on deterministic auction classes. The authors present a novel sample complexity analysis for automated mechanism design (AMD), providing tight bounds on the number of samples required to ensure empirical revenue approximates expected revenue. This work bridges a significant gap in AMD by formalizing the relationship between sample-based performance and underlying distributional expectations. The paper also extends learning theory by analyzing complex hypothesis functions defined through multi-stage combinatorial optimization, diverging from traditional machine learning contexts.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Contribution: The paper provides the first comprehensive sample complexity analysis for deterministic CA classes, a crucial advancement in AMD. The use of Rademacher complexity and pseudo-dimension to derive bounds is innovative and demonstrates a deep understanding of both mechanism design and learning theory.
2. Theoretical Rigor: The results are mathematically rigorous, with clear derivations of upper and lower bounds for various auction classes. The distinction between AMA, VVCA, Î»-auctions, MBAs, and MBARPs is well-articulated, and the hierarchical organization of these classes is insightful.
3. Practical Relevance: By addressing the sample complexity of widely-used auction families, the work has direct implications for practitioners designing auctions in real-world settings, such as spectrum auctions or procurement systems.
4. Learning Theory Contribution: The paper pushes the boundaries of learning theory by analyzing hypothesis classes with multi-stage optimization procedures, offering insights that may generalize to other complex function classes.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity: While the technical content is robust, the paper is dense and challenging to follow, particularly for readers unfamiliar with advanced mechanism design or learning theory. Simplifying the exposition or providing more intuitive explanations of key results would enhance accessibility.
2. Experimental Validation: The paper lacks empirical demonstrations to complement the theoretical results. Simulations or real-world case studies could validate the practical applicability of the sample complexity bounds.
3. Limited Discussion of Limitations: The authors briefly mention the computational challenges of finding optimal auctions but do not explore the practical feasibility of their approach in large-scale settings. A deeper discussion of these limitations would strengthen the paper.
4. Comparison to Related Work: Although the related work section is thorough, the paper could better contextualize its contributions by explicitly contrasting its results with prior sample complexity analyses in simpler auction settings.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper addresses a fundamental open problem in computational economics, offering significant theoretical contributions.
- The results are broadly applicable to AMD algorithms, making the work relevant to both researchers and practitioners.
- The extension of learning theory to complex combinatorial settings is a valuable interdisciplinary contribution.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The lack of empirical validation limits the immediate practical impact of the work.
- The dense presentation may hinder comprehension for a broader audience, reducing its accessibility.
Recommendation:
I recommend acceptance with minor revisions. The paper makes a substantial theoretical contribution to automated mechanism design and learning theory. However, the authors should consider adding empirical validation and improving the clarity of the presentation to maximize the paper's impact.
