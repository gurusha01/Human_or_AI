This paper introduces a novel approach to exploration in non-tabular reinforcement learning by proposing the concept of pseudo-counts derived from density models. The authors aim to bridge the gap between count-based exploration methods, which are effective in tabular settings, and intrinsic motivation approaches, which generalize better to complex environments. The proposed method is applied to challenging Atari 2600 games, demonstrating significant improvements in exploration, particularly in notoriously difficult games like Montezuma's Revenge.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Contribution: The paper presents a compelling innovation by connecting pseudo-counts to intrinsic motivation and information gain. This unification is a significant theoretical contribution that advances our understanding of exploration in reinforcement learning.
2. Practical Impact: The application of pseudo-counts to Atari 2600 games is impressive, particularly the breakthrough performance on Montezuma's Revenge. This demonstrates the practical utility of the approach in environments where traditional exploration methods fail.
3. Theoretical Rigor: The authors provide a solid theoretical foundation for pseudo-counts, including their relationship to prediction gain and information gain. The asymptotic analysis further strengthens the validity of the approach.
4. Empirical Results: The experiments are well-designed and demonstrate the effectiveness of the method across multiple settings, including both Q-learning (Double DQN) and actor-critic (A3C) frameworks. The comparison to baseline methods is thorough and convincing.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity: While the theoretical sections are rigorous, they are dense and may be difficult for non-expert readers to follow. Simplifying or summarizing key equations and results could improve accessibility.
2. Limited Scope of Density Models: The paper primarily uses a simplified CTS model for density estimation. While this choice is justified for computational efficiency, it may limit the generalizability of the results to more complex environments or state representations.
3. Exploration of Limitations: The paper does not sufficiently discuss potential limitations of pseudo-counts, such as their dependence on the quality of the density model or their applicability to continuous state spaces.
4. Comparison to Related Work: While the paper cites related work on intrinsic motivation and exploration, a more detailed empirical comparison to recent methods (e.g., variational approaches) would strengthen its claims of superiority.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:
- Pro: The paper addresses a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning, provides a novel and theoretically grounded solution, and demonstrates strong empirical results.
- Con: The theoretical exposition is dense, and the reliance on a specific density model may limit the generalizability of the approach.
Recommendation: Accept with minor revisions. The paper makes a significant contribution to the field of reinforcement learning, particularly in the area of exploration. Addressing the clarity of the theoretical sections and providing a more detailed discussion of limitations would further enhance its impact.
