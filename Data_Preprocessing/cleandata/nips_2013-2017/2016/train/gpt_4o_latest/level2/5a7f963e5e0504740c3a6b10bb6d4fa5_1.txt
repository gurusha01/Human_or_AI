The paper investigates the tractability of arithmetic circuit (AC) operations, focusing on the recently proposed Probabilistic Sentential Decision Diagram (PSDD). The authors demonstrate that PSDDs support a polynomial-time multiplication operator, unlike other AC classes, making them suitable for broader applications. They propose a simple compilation algorithm for probabilistic graphical models using PSDD multiplication and empirically validate its utility. However, the paper also shows that summing-out variables in PSDDs is computationally intractable. The work contributes to the field by advancing the understanding of tractable representations for probabilistic reasoning and learning.
Strengths:
1. Novelty: The paper addresses a significant gap in the literature by exploring the tractability of fundamental operations on PSDDs, a relatively new representation. The introduction of a polynomial-time multiplication operator is a notable contribution, as it expands the applicability of PSDDs in probabilistic reasoning.
2. Theoretical Rigor: The claims are well-supported by formal proofs and complexity-theoretic arguments. The authors clearly articulate the limitations of existing AC classes and position PSDDs as a promising alternative.
3. Practical Implications: The proposed compilation algorithm for probabilistic graphical models is simple yet effective, as evidenced by the experimental results. The empirical evaluation demonstrates that PSDDs often yield smaller representations compared to other AC-based approaches.
4. Clarity: The paper is well-organized, with a logical progression from theoretical foundations to practical applications. Definitions and theorems are clearly stated, and the inclusion of examples (e.g., permutations) aids comprehension.
Weaknesses:
1. Limited Scope of Empirical Evaluation: While the experiments are compelling, the benchmarks are primarily drawn from the UAI-14 Inference Competition. A broader range of datasets or real-world applications would strengthen the empirical claims.
2. Intractability of Summing-Out: The inability to perform summing-out in polynomial time limits the utility of PSDDs for certain inference algorithms, such as variable elimination. While the authors acknowledge this limitation, they do not propose alternative strategies to address it.
3. Comparison with Related Work: Although the paper references related representations like ADDs and PDGs, the comparisons are primarily qualitative. Quantitative evaluations against these alternatives would provide a more comprehensive assessment of PSDDs' advantages and limitations.
4. Reproducibility: The paper lacks sufficient implementation details for the proposed compilation algorithm, particularly regarding the construction of decision vtrees and the handling of large-scale models.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper makes a clear theoretical contribution by identifying a tractable operation (multiplication) for PSDDs, which has practical implications for probabilistic reasoning.
- The empirical results, while limited in scope, demonstrate the potential of PSDDs to produce compact representations, advancing the state of the art in probabilistic graphical model compilation.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The intractability of summing-out variables is a significant limitation, and the paper does not sufficiently address how this impacts the broader applicability of PSDDs.
- The empirical evaluation could be more comprehensive, and the lack of quantitative comparisons with related representations weakens the practical claims.
Recommendation:
I recommend acceptance with minor revisions. The paper is a strong theoretical contribution with practical relevance, but it would benefit from a more extensive empirical evaluation and clearer implementation details. Addressing these issues would enhance the paper's impact and utility for the community.
