The paper proposed a sequential forward selection style feature selection method which can identify high-order feature interactions. The authors also proposed binary representatives of features which makes their feature selection approach scalable. Empirical comparison is provided to support its superior performance. [Technical quality] The experimental methods are appropriate, but more empirical experiments can be added. Also I expect more analysis over the experiments. [Novelty/originality] The methodology contained in this paper is incremental. [Potential impact or usefulness] The potential impact of the work is not particular influential, but considering high-order interaction in feature selection is an important research question. [Clarity and presentation] I think the overall presentation of the paper is ok, but the notations can be misleading in some places. Although the authors states in Footnote 2 that I(f:g,h):=I(f;(g,h)), but I feel this abbreviation can lead to misunderstanding in many places. For example, in Section 3.1, it is much better to use I(c;{f,H}) rather than I(c;f,H). Also in their footnote 2, F={fi}{i=1}^{n} should be F=\cup{i=1}^{n}{fi}. The authors did a great job summarizing related work, but the following highly related work is missing. High-dimensional structured feature screening using binary Markov random fields. by Liu et al 2012 [Qualitative assessment] Rewriting the paper, especially improving the notations can be quite helpful. Adding more experiments is a good idea since the current empirical experiments are not intensive. I also wonder whether the authors can further explore whether submodularity can be used to understand their approach's theoretical behavior.
