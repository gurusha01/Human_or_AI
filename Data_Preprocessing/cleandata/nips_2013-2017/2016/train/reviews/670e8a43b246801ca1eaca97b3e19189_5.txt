The paper proposes two models for microclustering. Usual tools for model-based clustering rely on latent (allocation) variables, such as implied by the Dirichlet (or related) process mixture models, and they lead to linear growth of cluster sizes. Here, sublinear cluster size growth is obtained (not theoretically but empirically by simulation) by dropping a "consistence in distribution" assumption. The paper is very interesting, well written, and fits nicely into a conference like NIPS as it introduces novel methodology (model & algorithm) to tackle important applications (entity resolution). I would be interested to see some more insight/discussion on the microclustering property, or pointer to ongoing research about it, either in the text or in Appendix B. For instance, the log-log plot of Fig 2 in Appendix B suggests a power law decay of MN/N with an exponent around 0.8. I feel it would be interesting to comment about that. BTW, both plots in Fig 2 are identical (ie same Monte Carlo error), they should be updated. Also, correct caption "top/bottom". Minor comments: - correct subscript N in eqn (3) as well as line 85 - page 4, footnote 3: shouldn't the partitions CN be ordered for zeta to be well defined? of course it is just a matter of notation, but I would say that they should be denoted eg ({1, 3, 4}, {2, 5}, {6}) instead of {{1, 3, 4}, {2, 5}, {6}} - lines 81 & 151: use consistent notation for partition space, for instance \mathcal{C}N - line 287, add that K = |CN| - after line 298: use the same Gamma parameters than those introduced in main text line 100 - line 303, displayed eqn: correct c \in C_N
