The authors propose a new method for partitioning a given graph. The related optimization problem parallels the classical Normalized Cut optimization in terms of its underlying notion of cluster. They show how to cast this problem as a convex maximization program, which leads to an exact continuous relaxation of the discrete problem. With this formulation they develop a monotonic algorithm for solving the optimiziation problem via a sequence of linear programs, and introduce a randomized version of this strategy that leads to a simple algorithm. The authors carry out an experimental evaluation of the proposed method showing its performance in terms of cluster purity on a variety of real world data sets. The paper is well clearly written and well organized. The problem formalisation is interesting and, as far as I know, novel. The comparison with the classical Normalized Cut is meaningful, although I would have liked to see some additional analysis examples considering an input a bit more significant/complex than a collection of isolated vertices, which might appear a "pathological input case". The usefulness of this partitioning method is anyway quite clear as well as its superior stability properties and performance. The possibility to cast the original minimization problem as a convex maximazation program is very interesting and it plays a crucial role in solving the original problem. The experiment evaluation of this method is carried out in a careful way and it is able to show very good agorithmic perfomance in terms of cluster purity on a variety of real world data sets. The results seem to me significant and the used methodology seems rigorous enough. My overall evaluation is positive.
