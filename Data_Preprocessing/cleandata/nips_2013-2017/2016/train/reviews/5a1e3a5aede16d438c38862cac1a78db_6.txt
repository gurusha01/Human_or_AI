Given noisy linear observations of an underlying model, authors considered an \ell1 norm minimization problem subject to data fidelity constraints given as \ell\alpha norms of the error. Support recovery guarantees for such an optimization problem are given. While in some parts the proofs are presented for special cases of \ell1 and \ell\infty constraints, the authors provide insights on results for any \ell\alpha constraint for \alpha\geq 1. The presentation of the paper is excellent. Figure 2 provides a nice intuition into the behavior of \ellalpha constraints. A suggestion: it would be interesting to see the plots of Figure 2 when 1/alpha is plotted against k. I suspect we will then observe a symmetric behavior around alpha=2. 1/alpha seems like a natural choice for understanding the behavior of \ellalpha norms. In the numerical experiments, it would be nice to comment on how the choice of x0 (equal nonzero values in absolute value) affects the results. Minor typos: - line 118: "is often coined" to "is coined as" or "is often referred to as" - it would be nice to describe the names of the two equations (FO) in the beginning of section 2 inside the text. - line 139: "r" should not be in boldface. - line 186: first sentence can be reworded. - The spacing for Figure captions can be improved.
