This work proposes to use PSDDs instead of factor and model counting based representations. It is shown that multiplication can be performed efficiently which leads to an efficient algorithm to represent the AC that represents the distribution of a PGM, which is a product of factors. This work offers an interesting and useful new approach to inference in probabilistic models. The work is explained clearly and in sufficient in detail. Although the experiments show progress I am not entirely sure how big of an impact this method would have (in contrast with being another heuristic/approach to represent compact ACs that often show large variance of performance on different problems). But looking at other work that reduced auxiliary variables when performing knowledge compilation for PGMs also has shown the benefits of having less variables, I am inclined to believe this can have a large impact. Detailed comments: - Alg 1, line 12+13: multiply returns a tuple, should "P,c1" and "S,c2" and the cache calls in the line 15 can be replaced with c1 and c2. - Sec 4, theorem 4: I miss the intuition (or ref) to really understand this theorem. - Sec 4, line 212+213: "the product AC". Should this be 'resulting' AC? Minor: - Sec 3, line 156: Fix citation format.
