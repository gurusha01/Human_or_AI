This paper proves that EM algorithm converges to the global minimum when applied to mean-estimation of mixture-of-Gaussian distributions. The result is important and a great contribution to our understanding of EM. I regret starting this review too late to have enough time to read through the proofs; I will read it carefully over the next couple of days. Also, the result is, to the best of my knowledge, quite novel. I can't yet comment on the proof, but it looks involved and nontrivial. The result is beautiful as are the writing and the presentation. This paper is a pleasure to read.
