The paper studies the problem of selecting a small number of rows and reweightings of them so as the approximate the sum of squared distances of the original point set to any k-dimensional affine space. The authors show O(k^2/eps^2) rows can be chosen deterministically. The base case is showing it for k = 0, and the method seems something like a derandomization of Cheybshev's inequality. This paper makes some pretty critical mistakes regarding previous work. For one, they cite [8], but they should in fact be citing Cohen et al. "Dimensionality Reduction for k-Means Clustering and Low Rank Approximation" This is not just a typo - the authors go on to state a result of [8] about operator norm rather than the result of the Cohen et al. paper - namely, the Cohen et al. paper achieves O(k/eps^2) rescaled columns deterministically for exactly the same problem considered in this submission - see part 5 of Lemma 11 and section 7.3 based on BSS. This is much stronger than the O(k^2/eps^2) rescaled columns achieved in the submission. This directly contradicts their sentence "Our main result is the first algorithm for computing an (k,eps)-coreset C of size independent of both n and d". The authors also say later [8,7] minimize the 2-norm - [8] is the wrong reference again! Use the Cohen et al. paper above. The authors also don't compare their work to the result in Theorem 8 here: http://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.07263v1.pdf I'm also not entirely convinced about their comparison to [7], that is, it's not clear to me [7] couldn't be made deterministic and hold for rank-k approximation using similar techniques. Although the above are the negative points, I do like that the paper does deterministic sampling without BSS, which could be, as the authors show in the experiments, more practical than BSS. This was the most interesting part for me, even though it gets a worse k^2/eps^2 bound. Because of the deterministic argument without BSS, I think the paper can be accepted, provided a more proper comparison is made to the above work and that the paper focuses more on this practical aspect.
