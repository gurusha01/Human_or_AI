This paper studies the parameter estimation problem of generalized linear models when the number of observations n is much larger than the number of predictors p. An algorithm is proposed to estimate parameters based on an observation that GLM parameters are approximately proportional to the solution of OLS. This paper studies the parameter estimation problem of generalized linear models when the number of observations n is much larger than the number of predictors p. An algorithm is proposed to estimate parameters based on an observation that GLM parameters are approximately proportional to the solution of OLS. The paper is well-structured and well-written. The derivations look correct to me. The authors also demonstrated through experiments that the proposed algorithm outperforms the standard methods by a large margin. It is a solid paper and therefore I recommend the acceptance.
