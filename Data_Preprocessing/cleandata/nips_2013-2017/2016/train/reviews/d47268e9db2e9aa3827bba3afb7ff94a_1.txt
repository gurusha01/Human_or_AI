The authors argue that quantum computing can (a) speed up perceptron training significantly and (b) can improve on performance bounds. I find this paper difficult to comprehend. This also applies to the motivation and conclusions drawn from this work. It is argued, for instance, that quantum computing can speed up standard perceptron training significantly. I cannot follow the authors in that that this would render the perceptron a "quantum perceptron" or even may "lead to a deeper understanding of ... our ability to learn".
