The paper is concerned with what the authors call churn, and proposes to regularize classifiers in a specific way to reduce it. This could be a novel, interesting idea with the potential to generate new research directions. It is difficult for me to judge. The idea that "churn" is undesirable is reasonable, and the regularization idea seems an appropriate way to prevent excessive churn. The theoretical results do not appear to tell us much about how to choose alpha and epsilon in practice. I do not understand why the authors call the method in Section 2.2 a Markov chain Monte Carlo instead of just a Markov chain. The results are good.
