This manuscript derives a dimensionality reduction method. To get there, it shows a margin-based duality between SVMs and boosting. This manuscript derives a dimensionality reduction method. To get there, it shows a margin-based duality between SVMs and boosting. The proposed discriminant based LADDER algorithm is analyzed correctly: the goal is to learn an as low dimensional as possible discriminant space. The experiments are limited, but the discussion is relevant on the sign domain. The authors should run a spell checker; there are a few minor typos.
