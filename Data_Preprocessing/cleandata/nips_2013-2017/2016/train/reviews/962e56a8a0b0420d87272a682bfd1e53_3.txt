This paper mainly focuses on understanding whether it is possible to decompose the given observed rating matrix into user's true preference of items and the contribution by the recommendation system (RS). With strong model assumption, this paper proposes a singular value decomposition metric to recover user's true preferences from any instant rating matrix. Moreover, it also proposes a way to evaluate the influence of the RS on each user-item rating pair. Generally I think this is a solid work to tackle a challenging and novel task. Understanding and quantify the feedback loop has not been studied by too many, and this work is a pioneer in this direction. The assumptions made in this work are not perfectly reasonable, but I can understand they are to some extend necessary to derive a theoretical solution. Same happens to the experiments. It is really hard to evaluate this work since the ground truth RS are hard to obtain. I feel the authors have tried their best to indirectly evaluate the model. The only concern lies in its practical impact. It is not clear what is the main usage of RS. For instance, it would have been more convincing if the authors can show that RS can be used to improve the rating prediction task.
