The paper presents a copula-based family of probabilistic models for data with mixed discrete and continuous variables. a curse of dimensionality problem is avoided limiting the structure of the interactions of the discrete variables. The usefulness of the models is shown on simulated LFP and spike data from a simulated neuronal network. It is shown that model likelihood estimates and mutual information estimates are greatly affected by choice of model when comparing the mixed copula models versus independent-variables models. The paper is well written though the description of C-vine copulas is very hard to understand without the supplementary material and references. The simulations end experiment on simulated neuronal data are well thought out and convincing of the usefulness of the method. I did not understand the construction if C-vine copulas. The supplementary was a bit helpful but not enough for me. The combination of discrete and continuous variables seems very straight-forward. As a paper that addresses all the issues that need be solved for using such models with mixed neural data, I find it quite important and a significant advance. (Though my personal feeling is that until a full length journal paper is published, it will only find an audience within a select group who are already familiar with all the C-vine-related modelling and have an interest in modelling mixed data).
