In this paper, the authors present the first lower bounds giving a limit on the precision attainable by any algorithm for several variants of regression, as well as for classification with the hinge loss, in the condition of limited attribution observation. The demonstration of these theorems is integrated. But the authors did not give any experiments to verify these conclusions, and only prove them reasonable in theory.
