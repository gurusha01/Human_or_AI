This paper uses the recent bidirectioanl Monte Carlo to evaluate MCMC-based posterior inference methods. The authors analyze lower bounds of KL-divergence between the true posterior and the approximate distribution. The method is integrated into WebPPL and Stan. Overall, this is a nice paper. The authors use a recent art, i.e., bidirectioanl Monte Carlo, to analyze the MCMC-based posterior inference. This is a hot problem and the idea is interesing. I recommend to accept this paper.
