This work makes use of
the spectral structures of the matrix Khatri-Rao product, designs an efficient access to its statistical leverage scores, so that samples the rows of the KRP in a nearly-optimal manner. The experimental results demonstrated the performance of the proposed method. This work is an extension of leverage scores computing from matrix to tensor data. My concerns are as follows. 1. It is not clear how to get the size of sampling rows (\alpha r^2 \log^2n) in L294 . 2. There is no caption for Table 1 in P.8. 3. Is there any reasonable explanation why the performance of SPALS becomes worse with the increasing of the sampling size in Table (a) at nsr =0.1 ? 4. In introduction, the authors mention that the proposed method could be easily applied on other tensor related applications such as SGD or HOSVD, but there is no experiments supporting this point. 5. Grammar error: In Sec.7, "Its worth noting that â€¦"
