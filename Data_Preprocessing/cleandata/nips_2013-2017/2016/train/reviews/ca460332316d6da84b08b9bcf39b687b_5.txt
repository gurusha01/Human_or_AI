This paper presents a clustering method. Compared with normalized cut, the proposed model uses a multiplicative cut-based objective function to find a more balanced graph partition. Theoretical proof is provided on the validity of the model. How to get balanced partition is an interesting and important problem in clustering. However, this paper does not provide necessary comparison with previous efforts on balanced partitions, such as [1]. Moreover, presentation of the paper is not clear. In my opinion, the introduction section should be enriched and restructured. For now, readers might get confused in Section 1 before they proceed to the following sections. Some suggestions on revising the paper: 1. I'd suggest the authors add comparison with previous works on balanced partitions; 2. The introduction section seems not clear to me. I think necessary background is needed before proposing Eq. (1); 3. Some derivations lack explanation, e.g., how to get Eq. (3) and (10)? 4. Maybe I missed it, but what do the three rows of numbers mean in Fig. 2? 5. What does the percentage value mean in Table 2? [1] Ding, Chris HQ, Xiaofeng He, Hongyuan Zha, Ming Gu, and Horst D. Simon.
