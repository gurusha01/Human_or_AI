This paper proposed a new low rank tensor CP decomposition method, called sparse alternating least squares (SPALS) method. SPALS accelerates the classical ALS algorithms by sampling. Furthermore, the authors provide some useful properties for leverage scores of the matrix Khatri-Rao product. The experimental results validate the algorithm is effective and efficient. I have some comments as follow. 1. The theoretical analysis of this paper focuses on approximating the solution of problem (1), which is the main step of ALS. Is there any analysis which connects the sampling method to the global convergence behavior of ALS? 2. I have some questions about the experiments. a) How to choose the initial value of parameters? Is it sensitive to the results? b) What is the stop criterion in practice? c) Why the results in Table 1b not include the sketching based method? Thanks!
