This paper applies Richardson-Romberg extrapolation (RRE) to recent "big-data MCMC" methods, with a focus on Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD). RRE is a standard numerical integration tool that has recently seen some nice applications to numerical stochastic differential equations (SDEs); one of the nice features of this paper is that it provides a link between the MCMC literature and the SDE literature, which may be beneficial for both communities. The authors introduce a new SGLD-RRE method, develop some theoretical results on the convergence of the new algorithm (along with arguments for when SGLD-RRE improves on vanilla SGLD), and show some numerical results. They obtain impressive improvements on toy numerical examples, and modest but consistent improvements in large-scale examples. Overall it's a solid paper, clearly written. As I said above, this is a solid paper, with interesting links between two somewhat disconnected fields; interesting theoretical results; and good empirical performance of the novel proposed algorithm. The paper is very clear and easy to read and seems technically sound. The method ends up being a fairly straightforward application of RRE to SGLD, which is computationally convenient. I believe practitioners will use these methods, though the methods will not revolutionize current practice. Minor comments: I found Fig 1a slightly misleading - this is not the empirical estimated posterior distribution here, but rather a gaussian with the empirical posterior mean and variance plugged in. This should be clarified / emphasized a bit more for the unwary reader. Fig 2a â€“ it would be helpful to add a bit of discussion about why the bias is not necessarily decreasing as the stepsize decreases; this is a bit counter-intuitive.
