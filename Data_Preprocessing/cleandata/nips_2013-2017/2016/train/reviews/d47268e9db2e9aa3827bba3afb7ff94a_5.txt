The authors propose a perceptron model learning strategy using quantum computing that provides significant training speedups. Besides the actual contribution on the line of the perceptron model, the authors show how re-thinking learning strategies from a quantum computing point of view may obtain better results rather to trying to transfer the traditional learning procedure to a quantum paradigm. Major corrections:  My major concern is related to the assumption that training observations have unit norm. The main contribution of this work relies on the training speedup by using quantum computing. However, Theorems 1, 2 and 3 and Lemma 2 assume that input vectors have unit length. This is a major assumption from a machine learning point of view and will only hold for per-observation normalization schemes. For instance, in a one-dimensional setting, this approach only allows two observations (-1 and 1). Does this assumption affect your conclusions? Would you obtain the same results in other scenarios?.  The encoding explanation presented in lines 133-134 should be improved. I didn't understand the final representation [0,0,0,0,0,1]. * Some phrases are unclear (e.g. lines 115-116, while-but). Please verify grammar and spelling. Minor corrections: Line 83: algorthm -> algorithm. Line 95: quatum -> quantum
