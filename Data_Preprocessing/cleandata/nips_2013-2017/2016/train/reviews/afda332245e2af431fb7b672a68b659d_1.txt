Count based exploration bonus is incorporated in several RL algorithms. When the state space is large, generalization over neighboring states is required to get a meaningful count measure. This paper proposes a transformation from density estimation to a count measure. The transformation is simple and local, and the resulting pseudo-count enjoys several attractive properties. The approach is demonstrated by adding exploration to some Atari2600 games. I find the proposed scheme to be both elegant and effective. The presentation is quite clear. Adding some details on the density estimation scheme used in the application should be useful.
