This paper introduces the notion of a Product Cut in a graph. The Product Cut objective for graph clustering is argued to be more natural and stable than existing objectives. The paper proposes an algorithm for finding partitions with a good product cut. The experiments show that the algorithm generates better clusters than existing methods. The motivation for product cut makes sense to me, and the paper is well-written. I did not verify all of the details of the proofs and the algorithm for approximately maximizing the product cut. The experimental results for the cluster purity are promising, showing that PCut performs favorably. The experiments on running time (Table 2) should be better explained. The experimental set up is not defined. What is the machine used and what language are the algorithms implemented in? There is also no discussion on why PCut performs faster than NMFR and no comparison in terms of running time against the other methods. Other comments: Is the problem NP-hard like many existing objective functions? It would be helpful to have some discussion of computational complexity (even in the conclusion if it has not been worked out yet). Caption of Figure 1a: C should be in red? Lines 111-115: Are you restricting the set of vertices in B that are connected to C to be of size n0? Then each vertex in C will connect to u0k0 vertices in that set of n0 vertices? If this is the construction it should be stated that u0k0 <= n_0. Line 119: It seems that the denominator of the conductance should be min(vol(A), vol(A^C)). Line 146: What program is being executed? Line 152: What is Table 2.1? It should probably be Figure 2. Line 209: close -> closed
