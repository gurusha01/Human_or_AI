The authors propose a practical algorithm for near-isometric embedding of manifold data. By leveraging from previous theoretical work, they develop an optimization problem that minimizes the difference between the Riemannian metric estimate of the embedded data and that of the given ambient data. Qualitative and quantitative experiments show that the proposed method achieves better performance than previous non-linear dimensionality reduction algorithms. I like the overall approach of estimating the local Riemannian metric for achieving near isometric embedding of manifold data. Since the optimization criterion is non-convex, it would be nice to include a detailed discussion on - how initial embedding effects the final result - since the solution is iterative (gradient descent), quantitative analysis of how much slower is this approach compared to the standard eigendecomposition approaches. Minor comments: - I would recommend the authors to discuss the 'NuMax' algorithm in related work (citation: "NuMax: a convex approach for learning near-isometric linear embeddings" by Hedge et al.) - I dont quite understand what the authors meant by "relaxation" in the title. Consider changing it. - There are minor typos in lines 77, 82, and a possible square missing in the integral in Eq. 4.
