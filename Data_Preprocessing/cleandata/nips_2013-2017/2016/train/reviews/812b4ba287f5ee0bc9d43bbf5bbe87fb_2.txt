This paper proposes a novel tree based reinforcement learning approach to sequentially propose the object bounding boxes in a deep Q learning network framework. Empirically, this leads to competitive region proposal results (recall @ nboxes, recall @ iou) and state of the art object detection results (mAP) on PASCAL07 test set. Interesting paper applying reinforcement learning to object proposals. One thing I noticed from the recall plots (Figure 5 e and f) is that the authors didn't evaluate the performance beyond 1500 proposals. So it's hard to compare apples-to-apples with other baseline proposal methods how the recall compares beyond that 1500 number. For example, other baselines such as selective search, edge boxes, bing show recall close to 1.0 at around 4000 boxes with iou threshold of 0.5. However, the proposed method seems to saturate quite early on (upon eye-balling to extrapolat on my own) and seems unlikely to have high recall beyond the 1500 number authors evaluated. Regardless of the results, it'd make the paper scientifically more solid if the authors report the results beyond 1500 boxes.
