This paper introduced a new objective function for restricted Boltzmann machine by replacing KL divergence with smoothed Wasserstien distance, resulting in a generative model suitable for problems where the use of metric is important. The paper provided theoretical proof for the derivation of the gradient for the new objective function, quantitative comparisons for analyzing the characteristics of the smoothed Wasserstein distance, and applications in data completion and desnoising to demonstrate the usefulness of this new objective function. Generally speaking, this paper is well written in respect of language expression and internal logic structure. This is paper provided solid prove, well designed experiments and potential application scenarios. The description of the idea is easy to understand and the motivation is clearly demonstrated, i.e. the KL divergence is not good enough to act as a metric for problems where performance is measured in terms of distance. However, the comparison of the results only conducted among the kernal density estimation, standard RBM and Waserstein RBM, where the previous two both use non-distance metrics. It would be interesting to include the results of Euclidean distance and Hamming distance for comparison.
