The authors propose an algorithm to embed a set of points in a low dimensional space. The algorithm creates an initial embedding and gradually improves it by minimizing a loss function. The proposed algorithm was experimentally evaluated on some tasks and it showed promising results. The paper is very well-written and there are no obvious flaws. The authors clearly present the research questions they seek to answer as well as their contributions. The advance seems to be incremental. Specifically, the proposed algorithm is based on an existing estimator of the Laplace-Beltrami operator and an existing estimator of the push-forward metric. The results obtained by the proposed approach with regards to the state-of-the-art embedding algorithms are clearly presented. The authors have not made clear how to set the embedding dimension and intrinsic dimension parameters.
