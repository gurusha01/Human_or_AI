The authors provide results of exact recovery in the stochastic block model for general regimes (of number of clusters and their sizes). The paper provides recovery guarantees for new (and quite general) regimes of the Stochastic Block Model. While the results are very general, they seem to be up to constants, which I believe is an important drawback. One issue is that there has been so much recent work on the Stochastic Block Model that it is very difficult to know exactly what is the state of the art (as it changes extremely rapidly) and very difficult to cite all relevant references (and indeed there are many missing, but this is not the author's fault as it would impossible to include all) and so it is very difficult for me to identify exactly what are the contributions of this paper. One thing worth mentioning is that what the authors call ``partial observations'' appears in the literature as ``Censored Block Model''.
