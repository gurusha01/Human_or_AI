Starting with some simple similarity measure, the paper proposes to improve the quality of similarities though an iterative process. In each iteration they first create the cliques (small similar groups) of samples and then identify good training batches by solving an optimization problem. Then using these training batches a CNN is trained. The resulting similarities are mainly tested on human pose similarity where is shows competitive results. They also included a similarity test on PASCAL VOC dataset. Even though the technical parts (the formulations) are reasonable, the introduction of the problem and the steps are not too clear. It would be great if the authors can provide a clear big picture for the problem and then take each step individually and explain in detail. The method appears a bit ad-hoc in the sense that it has many components but the effect of each component is not evaluated individually. The selection of each component could be better motivated through comparing it with some (simpler) alternatives. For instance, it would be helpful to see random batch assignments (or some simpler method) versus the proposed batch assignment on at least one of the tasks. Experimental validation shows some promising results on unsupervised pose similarity learning.
