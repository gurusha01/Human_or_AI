This paper provides a tensor-decomposition-based methodology for unsupervised risk estimation based on 3-view assumption. The result is then used to develop a semi-supervised learning algorithm. This paper attempts to tackle and interesting and important problem of risk estimation in the absence of labeled data. I think some ideas are interesting (thoug perhaps not very novel ;see below). Overall, at this point this paper is borderline and decision will be based on the rebuttal and discussion. Question/comments: - The idea is based on making a 3-view assumption and then using 3 separate pieces as experts and look for a consensus for this experts. This sort of ideas have been explored before: Estimating Accuracy from Unlabeled Data: A Bayesian Approach. ICML 2016 and references in that paper. It would make sense to compare with that line of work. - Another line of work that is related is "discrepancy"-based approaches of Ben-David et al. and Mohri et al. for domain adaptation. Note that these do not require stringent 3-view assumptions and give data-dependent guarantees (unlike results presented in this paper). - Can 3-view assumption be tested somehow? - How realistic is this assumptions? It seems that (at least for log reg) this is kind of equivalent to Naive Bayes, which almost never holds... - How robust are the result if 3-view assumption fails? Can we quantify this somehow? - Experiments are a little underwhelming. It would be nice to see more results than just one dataset. Also, I would to see robustness of this explored. In practice, it seems that we will never know that 3-view assumption holds, so it is crucial to see how robust this methodology is. - There is a whole section on different structures but no experiments with those so again it would be nice to see those results as well. Also experiments with different losses since this aspect of the paper is heavily emphasized.
