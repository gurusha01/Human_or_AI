In this paper, a coreset based method is proposed for feature selection (dimensionality reduction) for very large scale sparse matrices. An efficient algorithm is exploited to compute the coreset with theoretical analysis on the bounds of size and running time. Experimental results illustrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed methods.

Experimental results illustrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed methods. The paper is well written and organized. However, some types should be mentioned. For example, In Definition 1, the constrain on w_i should be consistent.
