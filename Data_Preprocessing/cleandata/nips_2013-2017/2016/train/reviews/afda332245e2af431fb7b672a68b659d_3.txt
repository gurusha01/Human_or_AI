This paper proposes a new "exploration bonus" approach based on the notion of "pseudo count". It demonstrates several desirable properties of pseudo count in two computer games: FREEWAY and PITFALL (Section 4); analyzes the asymptotic relationship between pseudo count and count (Section 5); discusses the connection to intrinsic motivation and information gain (Section 6); and shows some experiment results of using pseudo count for exploration (Section 7). This paper is very interesting in general. To the best of my knowledge, the notion of "pseudo count", how to use this notion for exploration, and its connection to information gain, are novel. The experiment results in Section 4 and 7 are convincing. Overall, I think this paper has met the standard of NIPS poster, though the theoretical part of the paper is a little bit weak. My major concern of the paper is that it is not well-written in general. In particular, the transitions between sections are not very smooth. Moreover, the title of the paper indicates that this paper will focus on the relationships between pseudo count and intrinsic motivation (information gain). However, when reading the paper, I feel that this is only the focus of Section 6. Other sections seem to have different (even unrelated) foci. Please polish the final version of the paper. Minor comments: 1) figures in Figure 1 and 2 are too small. 2) what is the difference between Cn(x,a) in Section 2.1 and R^+n(x,a) in Equation 5? I think they are the same (up to a factor of \beta), right?
