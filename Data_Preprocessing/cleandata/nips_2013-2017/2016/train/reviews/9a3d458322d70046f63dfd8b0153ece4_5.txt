This paper address the problem of safe policy, whose worst case is guaranteed by a baseline policy. Contrary to the previous approaches which rely on overly conservative formulation, the proposed approach helps finding better policy while guarantee the better discounted return over the baseline policy. As the proposed approach is computationally intractable, the authors proposed a reasonable approximation. The approximation method is theoretically and empirically analysed. This is the solid work addressing the limitation of existing work and propose a better approach. Even though the realized method is the approximation of the ideal approach, this paper justify the necessity of the approximation, and empirically shows good performance over other possible approaches. The authors also derive the performance bound of various approach for learning safe policy, but the comparison among derived bounds are less described.
