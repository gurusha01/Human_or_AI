This paper investigates a special class of neural networks, where the author succeed to show that it has only one stationary point. The author introduce a fast method converging to the unique fixed-point that is the global minimum of the cost function. The paper investigates an interesting problem of showing a relatively complex model with wisely chosen constraints can have only one stationary point. Apart from convexity (or its generalizations like geodesic convexity), the common practice for showing uniqueness of the stationary point is through using fixed-point theory; the approach that is used in this paper. The author construct a contractive map, that its fixed-point is the unique minimizer of the cost function. One drawback of the proposed method is dependence of the convergence proof on the boundedness of spectral radius of some non-trivial matrix. As authors mention, that is the reason why they did not try networks with larger number of hidden units. Another problem with the method is many parameters that should be tuned that makes the use of the procedure rather unintuitive. Furthermore, for each choice of the parameters the spectral condition should be verified. In the experimental results, the authors tried about 150,000 different combination of possible parameters values and chose the best of them based on cross-validation accuracy. Their method, however, could outperform linear-SVM for only 2 out of 7 datasets. This result questions, the real power of the neural network they are investigating.
