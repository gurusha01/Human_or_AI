The authors study repeated games where players use regret minimizing algorithms for choosing their actions, generalizing some recent work in significant ways. In particular, they require only "realized feedback" as opposed to the expectation over actions of other players -- a much more realistic setting. A few nice extensions and observations about bandit feedback and dynamic population games are also presented. This was a very nice paper that was well written, the problem clearly motivated, and improvements on prior work (SAL15 and LST16) are conceptually significant, despite the fact that the technical aspects seem rather similar. In particular, the requirement of "realized feedback" instead of "expected feedback" is significant as it brings the problem into a much more realistic setting. I would have liked to see some experimental comparison with SAL15 / LST16 -- it is not yet clear to me if lacking this assumption has an effect in practice. In particular, if I do have access to expected feedback, should I use it?  Thanks for your response to this in the rebuttal. Please do add your empirical results in the final version of the paper.  Overall a nice piece of work which would be of interest to game theorists.
