The authors tackle an interesting problem: studying how recommender system actually influence the consumer. They assume that the observed rating matrix is made of user true feeling and RS influence. Introducing sequence in the modeling, they consider the observation matrix as a fix matrix (user true feeling) and successive influences associated to a basic RS relying on item similarities. Finally they try to identify items that are affected by the RS. Then, they propose a metric to quantify RS effects and compare the results on different datasets (corresponding to real world website with ou without RS). The authors carry out some experiments on synthetic datasets to set the hyper-parameters of the method. This work is original and tackle a critical issue: measuring the efficiency of RS (persuasive force). Even if the measure explain the persuasive force to give better/lower ratings and not the real feelings of the users, this work is very interesting. Regarding the scores, there seems to be a correlation with the item rating density (rating/items) (for films, alcohol and food)... Maybe there is a small bias in the procedure. The result on TV shows vs Indian films is amazing. Do you perform further analysis on the average rating in each case and on the consensus in the rating? The idea would be: if every one like an item, then no effect is associated to the RS. == typo l55 ans => and author should use a decent font for the references
