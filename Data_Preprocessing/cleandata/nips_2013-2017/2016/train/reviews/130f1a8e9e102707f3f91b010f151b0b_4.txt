The paper proposes under-complete dictionary learning with combined Sobolev/L1 regularization to find functional components in fMRI data. The proposed approach seems interesting. The somewhat original contribution is to use dictionary learning with combined Sobolev/L1 regularization for encouraging smoothness and sparsity of the components. But the results of the new approach seem not very improved from the simpler methods, or at least, the improvement is insufficiently explained. Also, the manuscript appears quite rushed, for example there are still draft comments (line 146) and it is a quite tedious, sometimes even confusing read.
