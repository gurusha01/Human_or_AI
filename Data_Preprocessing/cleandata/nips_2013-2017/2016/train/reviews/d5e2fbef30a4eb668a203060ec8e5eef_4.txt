The paper introduces a feature selection algorithm, which claims the following contributions: 1) apply a two stage greedy search algorithm to MI. 2) utilization of binary representation of features They name their method as CMICOT. In comparison with various practical experiments, CMICOT demonstrates better performance than different related methods. Several problems in this paper: 1) line 27, what is SBS based filters? 2) what's the y-axis of figure 1? Since this is the only experiment figure demonstrated in this paper, lacking of y axis makes me difficult in understanding the effectiveness of this work. Sometimes, these figures may represent a significant difference of 10, while it can also be negligible, such as 0.00001.
