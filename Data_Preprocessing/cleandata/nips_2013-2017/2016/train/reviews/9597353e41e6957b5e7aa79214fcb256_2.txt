A nice contribution to the semi-supervised clustering literature. A compelling model, especially from the learning theory perspective. This paper proposes and analyzes and new clustering model. Basically, in addition to receiving a clustering instance and a distance function, the algorithm can ask for "same cluster" queries, which ask an oracle whether two data-points belong to the same cluster or not. This is a novel model because previously, algorithms have had access to the distance function or to a query oracle, but not typically both. This allows for some interesting results in a "semi-supervised" model of clustering. The main result is the introduction of a margin property, which has a parameter, which makes the clustering instance easier (in other words the assumption stronger). For k-means, there is a sharp threshold in the value of this parameter. The algorithm is fairly straightforward -- with a sampling and a binary search phase. From my understanding, because of the relationship between this notion and center proximity and careful transfer of lower bounds, this paper proves that there are regimes in which the problem is NP hard without queries, but easy with this additional assumption . My one worry about this model is that the instances where the property is likely to be most helpful (over the unsupervised case) may precisely be the exact instances where it's hardest for the user to tell what clustering they want in the end. However, I still like the direction of this model and the learning-theory contribution of this paper.
