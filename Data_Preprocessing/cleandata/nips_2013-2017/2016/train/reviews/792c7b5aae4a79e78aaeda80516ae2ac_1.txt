In two particular cases of mixtures of Gaussians distributions, the authors characterize the limits of a population EM algorithm in terms of the starting points. Then, they prove that the sample-based EM algorithm has the same asymptotic properties as the population EM with same starting points. The focus of this work is the performance of the EM algorithm for two very specific models (mixture of two Gaussian distributions). The results are interesting and all cases are covered, hence, the authors provide a complete description of the performance of the EM in that setup. My only negative remark is that I believe that the proofs are unreasonably long, given that the paper focuses on a very specific model. However, mixtures of even two Gaussian components are not fully understood yet, so I am favorable for acceptance of this work at NIPS.
