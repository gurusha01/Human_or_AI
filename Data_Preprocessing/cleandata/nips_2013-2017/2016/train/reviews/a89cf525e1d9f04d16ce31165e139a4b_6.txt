The information bottleneck method seeks to extract the maximum information from variable X about variable Y while minimizing the superfluous information. The practical application of the method is hindered by the computational demands of analyzing high-dimensional or non-Gaussian data. The paper proposes an alternative objective that provides a lower bound on the information bottleneck objective while being more tractable. The paper provides an algorithm based on this objective and demonstrates its application in two examples. Finally, they provide a kernel version of the method and apply it to an occlusion task The paper provides a clear description of its method. The detailed analysis of the simple case, the analysis of the effect of an variation, and the application to a task provide the reader with an understanding of the performance and potential applications of the method. The figures are clear and their captions allow the reader to get a basic understanding of what they intend to show without needing to search for the relevant sections of the text. I expect that people will be able to put this method to productive use.
