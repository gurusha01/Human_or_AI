This work considers the problem of minimizing convex-concave saddle problem and extend the recent variance reduction methods for solving it. The convergence analysis of the proposed methods are provided. The authors shows that the methods can be easily accelerated by using the extension of the catalyst framework. Extension to the monotone operator and numerical result are also provided. The strong convex assumptions on both primal and dual problem is every strong. It should be only primal problem or dual problem is strongly convex. More numerical example should be added.
