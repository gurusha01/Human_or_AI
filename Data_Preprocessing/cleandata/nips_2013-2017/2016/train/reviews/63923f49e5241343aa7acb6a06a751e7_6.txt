The article presents an extension of the results of fast learning rates to unbounded losses with a heavy tailed distribution. First, the authors present the initial conditions. Then, they verify these initial conditions. Finally, they show that fast learning rates for heavy-tailed losses can be obtained for the assumed conditions In formula, not all used variables are defined (consider general audience). Some variable values are chosen without any explanation or argument. There are few repetations in the text.
