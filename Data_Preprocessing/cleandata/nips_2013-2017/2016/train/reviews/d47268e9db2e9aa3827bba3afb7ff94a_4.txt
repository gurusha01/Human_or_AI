The paper applies quantum computation to perceptron learning in fundamental ways and obtained improved complexity (from O(N) to O(sqrt(N))) and error bounds from (O(1/gamma^2) to O(1/gamma)). Both of these improvements are inspired by Grover's search/amplitude amplification, which informally searches through N unsorted elements in only O(sqrt(N)) time. Applying quantum methods to machine learning is a very interesting problem, and the results obtained in this paper is nice. Just like Grover's search differs funcamentally from classical search algorithms, the authors try to use quantum computation in a fundamental way, instead of replacing one subroutine with another quantum one while staying within the classical framework.
