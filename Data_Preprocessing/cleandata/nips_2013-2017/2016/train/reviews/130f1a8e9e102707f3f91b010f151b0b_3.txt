The authors extend dictionary learning models to incorporate a sobolev prior. This is an interesting problem, but it is hard to judge the impact or improvement of this newly proposed algorithm. The main results figure relies on visually comparing the clarity/consistency of identified blobs on the brain, but this is not clear to an untrained eye. Also, in my experience with this type of decomposition, just as important as the algorithm (if not more) is the data. By incorporating penalties for smoothness and spatial consistency, it isn't that surprising that you get smoother blobs. Perhaps this is more useful to isolate a region with little data, but with the vast amount of data accessible with the human connectome project this doesn't seem to be the issue. I was hoping that this paper would do more to consolidate the differences of brain regions across subjects, and perhaps to use inter-subject differences/consistency as validation of the performance. Validation presented here seems very subjective and it is not clear the benefit.
