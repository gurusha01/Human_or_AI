This paper analyzes support recovery of sparse vectors using an L1 regularizer and non-smooth fidelity terms like L0 or sup. They analyze support stability in terms of the dual certificate to small amounts of noise in these models. To my best knowledge this is the first rigorous analysis of support stability using L0 and L\infty losses. I believe the contribution therefore is significant, although the main result is presented in terms of dual certificates which in my opinion diminishes the clarity. For example, when is the injectivity condition satisfied? Is this obvious in general? In addition, it is a bit hard to deduce from the main result how close the estimated support J is to the actual support I. In other words, for a given noise level and even perhaps given vector magnitudes, how much larger can J be than I? The experiments seem to attempt to address this question more clearly, but again I would also like to see how (support of) the actual minimizer x_\tau compares with (the support of) the true signal. I think a reformulation of the main result and experiments might make for much clearer presentation. In summary, I find the contribution to be strong but that it is presented in a manner that makes the parameters of interest obscure. Either the authors should comment why the extended support itself is of interest, or rephrase the results to address the actual recovered support.
