This paper extends Koopman spectral analysis to reproducing kernels. Method is evaulated on simulated and real data. This is a very well written paper. I would have liked to see two additional aspects to this paper, the first being a comparison to non-RKHS Koopman spectral analysis in the simulations. The second (and this could be explored in simulations as well) would be a discussion/exploration of choice of kernels, and how that could affect results.
