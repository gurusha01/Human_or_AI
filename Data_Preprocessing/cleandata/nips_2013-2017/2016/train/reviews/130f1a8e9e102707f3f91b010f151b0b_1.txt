This paper proposes a large-scale online dictionary learning framework to find interesting brain regions. This paper proposes a large-scale online dictionary learning framework to find interesting brain regions. The topic itself is very interesting. However, no theoretical analysis is provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Moreover, the authors are not so serious for writing the paper. It seems that the authors did not read the draft carefully before the submission. For example, a comment like "146 XXX: I don't understand the switch between V and v." is still in the paper.
