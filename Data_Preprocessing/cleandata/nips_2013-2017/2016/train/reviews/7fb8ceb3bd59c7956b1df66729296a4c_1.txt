The paper studies the conditions, under which the critical points of a certain regularised problem (with a quaternary term in the regularisation) coincide with optima of the matrix completion problem. This is the best paper I have reviewed this year. It provides a clear exposition of an important result, linking it to relevant recent work. I would be curious if the results extended to some ensemble with uniformly distributed entries (e.g., http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.2467). The paper is very closely related to a recent work: http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.08101 but considering the submission deadline coincided with it, I doubt there can be an issue. It should like to cite it, though. Other than that, I have only trivial comments: -- F in Frobenious should be capitalised -- "our attention" (l. 229) -- "nice properties that ensure" needs no "s" (l. 251)
