This paper addresses the computation of PCA for extremely large sparse matrices. In particular, the authors use coresets, which are a weighted subset of rows of the data matrix. This paper shows how to compute a coreset that is independent of the dimensions of the data matrix. Moreover, they apply the algorithm to the very large Wikipedia document-term matrix, which is an impressive demonstration. The paper is well written, and the motivation is both clear and compelling. Moreover, the concept of coresets and their application to a very challenging problem (the wikipedia dataset) is impressive. Overall, I enjoyed reading this paper and it made me think.
