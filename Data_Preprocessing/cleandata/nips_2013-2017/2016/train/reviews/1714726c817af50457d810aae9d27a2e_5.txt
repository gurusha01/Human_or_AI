The paper studies accelerated descent dynamics for constrained convex optimization. By using Lyapunov function, the authors are able to achieve desired convergence rate. An adaptive averaging heuristic is designed to speed up the convergence rate of Lyapunov. Results show that the adaptive averaging performs equally well or even better than adaptive restarting. I have little knowledge in this field. However, the idea that using the adaptive averaging to achieve a desired faster convergence rate for constrained convex optimization seems interesting and promising.
