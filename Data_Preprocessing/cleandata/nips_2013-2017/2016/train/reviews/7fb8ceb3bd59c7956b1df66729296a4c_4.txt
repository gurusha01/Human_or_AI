This paper proves that the commonly used non-convex objective function for matrix completion has no spurious local minima. Hence, gradient descent approaches can achieve global optimal. This result seems to be quite strong. The theoretical analysis is rigorous. I believe it may lead to an important step in matrix completion field.
