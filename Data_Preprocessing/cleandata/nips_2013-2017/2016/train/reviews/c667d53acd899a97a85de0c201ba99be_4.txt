Considers sample complexity of automated mechanism design for revenue: Given a bunch of samples of bidders' valuations over bundles of items, choose an allocation and payment rule to be used on a new sample of bidders, such that expected revenue is approximately maximized. Considers classes of VCG-like mechanisms which I believe are widely used/considered. This boils the problem down to selecting weights on each bidder and allocation (an exponentially large space). I like the paper and results. I was not sure how to interpret the bounds sometimes, as they can be complicated or involve, for instance, the H constants which I am not sure how to interpret. So a bit of guidance would help, for instance, if the main takeaway of Section 3.1 is "it's exponential", maybe say that directly. But overall the message is clear. One question I am left with is how to understand the role of uniform convergence in the negative results. How strong of a negative result is it to say that convergence over all auctions in the class requires so many samples? A bit more discussion about this, and obstacles to some stronger goal (e.g. sample complexity of finding an approximately optimal auction), would be interesting.
