This paper consider a trading model where a seller faces a sequence of buyers, with uncertain "patience". Given that the seller does not know when the buyers will buy the product, the seller will update the optimal price after every period. This papers provide algorithm for adjusting price dynamically and achieves a sharp lower bound on the seller's regret level. Two comments: 1. While considering the seller's feedback at any day, the paper assumes that the seller has no knowledge about the buyers' patience. It seems reasonable to assume that the seller has a prior of the buyers' patience and this prior will be updated after seeing the buyers' "not buy" choice. 2. Maybe I miss some parts, but it is not clear for me why buyers' behavior is an optimal response for the seller's algorithm. I think the paper should justify this point since it is considering the strategic interactions between buyers and the seller. So the paper should give a description of "equilibrium" under the algorithm.
