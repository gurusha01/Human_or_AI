This paper focuses on the dictionary learning in the application of brain regions learning. Concretely, the authors propose a large-scale online dictionary learning framework with an additional Sobolev regularization for the structure. This paper focuses on the dictionary learning in the application of brain regions learning. Concretely, the authors propose a large-scale online dictionary learning framework with an additional Sobolev regularization for the structure. My major comments are as follows. 1) As far as I am concerned, this paper merely extends the online dictionary learning (J Mairal, JMLR2010) with an additional Sobolev regularization term. Thus I think the novelty is fairly weak and fails to cohere with the NIPS standard. 2) In order to impose structure constraint on the learned dictionary, this paper utilizes Sobolev regularization. However, the detailed definition of "structure" is not very clear. If the structure means the sparseness, why the sparseness of dictionary itself would bring significant improvement in your problems? All in all, the motivation of the usage of Sobolev is not clear. 3) I wonder whether there is a mistake in Eq.(1); it should be [V^1,V^2,â€¦,V^r]^T. 4) More statement and analysis of the construction of Eq.(2) is needed. For example, why is the l2 norm imposed on the codes instead of l1 norm in (J Mairal, JMLR2010)? 5) What is the line 146? 6) The language of this paper needs to be refined. I have found many typos in it.
