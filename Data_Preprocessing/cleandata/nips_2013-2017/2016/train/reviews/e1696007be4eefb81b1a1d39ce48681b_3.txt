This paper exploits a simple proportionality relationship between ordinary least squares (OLE) problems and Generalized Linear models (GLMs). By solving OLE first, followed by estimation of the constant of proportionality, the paper comes up with faster GLM solvers. The theoretical part of the paper proves that under reasonable assumptions, such a procedure will estimate the GLM parameters accurately in the n much bigger than p setting. Interesting paper - the reduction of GLM to OLE is striking. For what class of regularizers (section 3.1) does the proportionality relationship continue to hold? What classes of link functions are particularly favorable to this reduction? Section 5: Speedup results are unsurprising. It is clear that an OLE approach + single parameter estimation of the proportionality constant would be faster than iterative optimization of the GLM objective function. More interesting to the reviewer is the question of how far this idea can be pushed beyond the exact equivalence of Proposition 1. In Figure 2, one would expect the SLS solution to be slightly worse than the GLM solution. But this is consistently not the case, which is quite striking. Does it imply that on these datasets and regime for samplesize "n", the error (Eqn 10, Eqn 14) would be very smallish?
