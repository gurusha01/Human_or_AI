The paper presented a new algorithm for solving contextual semibandit problems, that used an oracle, and presented proofs about the regret of the algorithm, as well as results comparing this algorithm against others on two data sets for search. The contextual semibandits problem could be much better explained, it wasn't immediately clear on first reading, and required rereading and mapping the formal definitions to the examples. The problems tackled in this paper are very important, difficult, and have broad applications and relevance. In particular, tackling the case where the weights from the action list to the reward are unknown. The paper is a compelling combination of tackling a novel problem, comprehensive theoretical analysis, and convincing application to a practical data set. The authors were honestly and informatively even handed about outlining the insights as well as limitations of their proposed algorithm and results.
