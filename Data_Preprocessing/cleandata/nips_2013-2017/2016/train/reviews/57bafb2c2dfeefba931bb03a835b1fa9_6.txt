The paper is well written and with some novel results on community detection for the case of the so-called "heterogeneous SBM". Strong Points: 1) The results are novel to the best of my knowledge and to a regime (heterogeneous) that no significant prior work exists. Weak Points: 1) The optimization problems used are not that novel. The obtained results seem to be an "analysis artifact" only due to stronger matrix concentration results used by the authors than in pre-existing literature. 2) The topic is not that novel, meaning that a lot of work has been published on it the last decade. 3) The proof techniques used are very standard. Overall, I liked reading this paper and I think that the heterogeneous regime may worth more investigation. Based on the submitted file, which the visible one, I would like to see numerical demonstration of the theoretically derived results. Moreover, I think that the paper might fit well for a poster presentation since the topic is hot and the explored regime allows for more investigation.
