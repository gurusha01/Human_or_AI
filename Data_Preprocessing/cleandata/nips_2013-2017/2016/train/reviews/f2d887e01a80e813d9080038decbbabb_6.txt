The paper suggest the method of moments as a tool to estimate the error of a classifier in an unsupervised manner. The paper makes an assumption that the classifier can be decomposed into three conditionally independent parameters. This is indeed a strong generative assumption nevertheless the authors are able to prove a strong result. The authors show how this can be exploited in a semisupervised task inorder to exploit unlabeled data and few labeled examples to enhance performance. The result of the papers are interesting and exploits interesting and non-trivial tools of method of moments and tensor decomposition. The exploitation of tensor decomposition within semi-supervised setting is interesting and does seem to lead to significant improvement. The assumptions made are indeed strong and it is not clear how one can verify it in practice. Nevertheless the paper does give an interesting method to perform classification, worthy of future research.
