Problem studied - The paper studies the following model of onilne pricing with patient buyers. In this model there is a seller with unlimited inventory and buyers arrive at each time step. The buyers are patient and willing to wait and each buyer i is willing to wait \tai_i\leq \tau steps. The seller posts a price for the next \tau steps and each buyer will pick the time that is cheapest in its waiting time. The goal for the seller is to maximize revenue. The paper gives an algorithm with regret \tau^{1/3}n^{1/3}T^{2/3} (where n is the number of possible prices that can be posted) and gives a lower bound of \tau^{1/3}T^{2/3}. Contributions of the paper. - The model studied in this paper is very interesting and there has been a long line of work on posted pricing for selling items. Unfortunately they do not address the fact that buyers can choose to wait to get a lower price. This paper addresses this by making a reasonable assumption of upper bound on how long each buyer is willing to wait. - The algorithm is fairly natural. It doesn't immediately follow from previous literature and requires the seller to post same price for time steps a bit longer than \tau to get correct estimates for probability of sale at a given price. - The lower bound is non-trivial and is from a reduction to bandits with switching costs. Nice paper. The only way this paper can be strengthened is by getting matching upper and lower bounds with respect to number of arms.
