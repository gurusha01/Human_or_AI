The authors provide a global analysis of expectation maximization for mixtures of two Gaussians, where both Gaussians have the same covariance matrix and the same weight in the mixture. First, global results in the population version is established, showing how EM would behave if the algorithm had access to the true underlying distributions. Next, based on the population analysis, the authors show the behavior of sample based EM is similar to that of population EM, using consistency type arguments. I have a question regarding to why did the authors only provide a consistency-type result for the finite sample case? What are the reasons preventing the authors' analysis from being able to give finite sample global results for EM?
