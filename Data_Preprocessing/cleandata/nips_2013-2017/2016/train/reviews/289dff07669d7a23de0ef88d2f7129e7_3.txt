This paper considers Cholesky covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy with both rank-1 and rank-\mu update for triangular Cholesky factor (in sequence of rank-1 update). This paper proofed, under the convergence assumption of the covariance, that the modified cumulative step-size adaptation does not make significant change of the algorithm behavior. The paper presents experiments on algorithm performances. 1. This paper considers the Cholesky CMA-ES. It extends the update for triangular Cholesky factor using both rank-1 and rank-\mu update. Yet, I don't think its contribution is significant, considering the work of Krause et al. 2015 which uses rank-1 update to triangular Cholesky factor. This paper presents a straightforward generalization of this procedure to rank-\mu update in a sequences of rank-1 updates. 2. Generally, the convergence of covariance $Ct$ in CMA-ES is proofed by theoretical analysis (Beyer, ECJ, 2014), although it is not based on the exact formulae of CMA-ES. This may improve the confidence of Lemma1. 3. There are some other problems. 3.1. In equation (1), the \sigma in denominator should be \sigmat. The same problem occurs in the footnote 2 on page 3. 3.2. In line 94, 'which can by be motivated by principles from ...' , the world 'by' should be deleted.
