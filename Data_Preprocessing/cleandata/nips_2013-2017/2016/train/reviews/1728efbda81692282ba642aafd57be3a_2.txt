The paper proposed a spectral method for the analysis of nonlinear dynamical systems. The so-called Koopman operator is an operator representation of function composition. In this case, the Koopman operator decomposition is applied to the forward nonlinear dynamics of the system, x(t+2) = f(f(x(t))). Given collected trajectories from the system, then one can perform some kind of eigen-decomposition of the operator using similar idea from kernel PCA and subspace analysis. Last the method is applied to embedding and recognition of dynamical systems, and the author show that the method performs well. To an audience who is familiar with kernel methods, the new things in the paper is that the composition of functions can be represented as a linear operator and some interesting decomposition can be applied to function compositions. Dynamical system is a particular composition of functions, and a good application of this. Since the algorithm, dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), has been proposed already in dynamical system literature, the novelty of the paper seems to be limited to kernelize it. There are other methods for recognizing dynamical system, such as recurrent neural works, and for detection changes. In a sense the applications in the paper is not very compelling to demonstrate why the method is good and unique.
