This paper describes an approach to prediction with structured latent variable models (also applies to structured auto-encoders) that achieves convexity and tractability under one reasonable assumption (polar operator tractability) and one relaxation (having to do with rank in an SDP formulation). The approach here is novel, technically deep and (apparently) sound, on a problem lots of smart people have thought about. The approach likely suffers scalability difficulties, due to the reduction to SDP, but overall this is a novel approach to a hard problem and I can imagine this generating substantial follow-on work. The paper is also remarkably clear, especially considering how technical it is in parts. One weakness of the writing is that it is not always clear what is a novel idea and what is an application of known ideas; I think part of this is the writing style. This could be easily clarified. There is one part that is a bit confusing, in this regard. The paper claims the only relaxation is the rank relaxation, but I don't think this is accurate. There is also the relaxation in Eq 5 where \Omega(Ux) is upper-bounded by max_y y'Ux, justified by a max-margin principle. This is fine, but if the goal is probabilistic models, it's not clear to me that this is entirely justified.
