The authors present an approach to dimensionality reduction for multi-class learning using a duality between SVMs and boosting. In particular, SVMs fix a feature transformation and learn the weights to separate the classes with decision boundary, while boosting fixes the codewords and learns the transformation. Based on this duality, a LADDER algorithm that iteratively updates both the codewords and the transformation in an efficient manner is developed. Several experiments were conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The paper is well written and easy to follow. My major concern of this paper is about the experiment part. For the hashing and retrieval part, the author did not compare their methods with some state-of-the-arts, e.g. SmartHash[1], FastHash[2], ShECC[3], OSH[4], and the one presented in [5], which they failed to beat.

The authors could at least try to integrate their method into a state-of-the-art approach to show if it will improve the performance. [6] Cimpoi, Mircea, Subhransu Maji, and Andrea Vedaldi.
