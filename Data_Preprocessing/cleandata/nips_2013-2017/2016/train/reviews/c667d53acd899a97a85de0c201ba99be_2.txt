This paper is a nice application of learning theory to mechanism design for combinatorial auctions. In particular, given a class of strategy-proof mechanisms, the paper answers the question of how well the revenue-optimal mechanism on a set of bids/values sampled from a distribution generalizes to the true distribution. The authors provide results for at five general classes of mechanisms (as well as a result for approximations). For the most general classes (affine maximizer auctions, virtual valuations, lambda-auctions), they state exponential lower bounds for uniform convergence. However, they are able to show that mixed bundling auctions have polylogarithmic pseudo-dimension in the number of bidders and items. Given the importance of combinatorial auctions, it is surprising that few sample complexity results exist in the literature. Notably, it appears that the recent work of Morgenstern and Roughgarden does not apply to the settings considered here. Although I did not check the proofs in full, the main ideas behind the pseudo-dimension constructions are well-presented and informative. Overall, I think the problem studied is important and potentially very impactful.
