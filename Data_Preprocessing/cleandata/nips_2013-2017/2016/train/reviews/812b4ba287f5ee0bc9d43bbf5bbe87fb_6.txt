This paper describes a Q-learning combined with deep learning approach to object detection and localization. In particular this paper introduces a tree-based reinforcement learning that sequentially allows to determine which region of the image is the best candidate to represent an object bounding box. The verification is done on VOC2007/2012 and the results are competitive with others state of art detectors. The paper presents an interesting improvement to the usual RL. Several points could be clarified however: - the desired number of proposal is a parameter. While it was experimentally determined from testing it would be interesting to formulate the problem of finding of proposals in a more formal manner - is there any changes between agent tree-RL while searching for different objects?
