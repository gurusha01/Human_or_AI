This paper derives a spectral analysis of the Koopman (composition) operator in RKHSs and presents a modal decomposition algorithm to perform the spectral analysis. The authors also discuss a robustifying method and perform several numerical experiments to demonstrate the usefulness of their approach. The overall framework is an extension of "dynamical mode decomposition" using the kernel trick. Strength of the paper: The paper is very well written and organized. The authors present clearly the different theoretical concepts used in the derivation of the method, which seems very interesting to me. Moreover, it is technically solid. There is no deep comparison with state-of-the-art approaches but numerical experiments illustrate correctly the usefulness of the method. It is sufficient in my view. However, there are some disturbing points explained below. Major flaws: As for me, the major flaw of this paper is Section 3.1 and particularly Equation (7) as well as the proof of Theorem 1, that I do not fully understand. On one hand, Equation (7) is similar to Equation (2), so what is the purpose of it ? On the other hand, Equation (7) does not seem consistent to me since KH is a linear operator from H to itself and \phi is definitely not in H (this is a function from M to H). Can the authors explain this point in more details ? This gives me some doubts concerning the proof Lines 144-157. In addition, what does "by applying the operator KH to both sides" mean (Line 149) ? Since both sides are scalar numbers, then KH : H \to H does not apply. The assumptions in Theorem 1 look strong (and not very explicit). Could the authors explain these assumptions ? Moreover, additional assumptions appear in the proof of the theorem. Why ? Can they hold easily ? Typos: - Line 55: the the - Line 153: \kappaj / \lambdaj instead of \kappai / \lambda_i
