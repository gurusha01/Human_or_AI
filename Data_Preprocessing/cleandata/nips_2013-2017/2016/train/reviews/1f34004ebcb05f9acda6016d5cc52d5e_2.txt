This paper addresses formulate the Supervised PageRank models as a constrained non-convex optimization problem by incorporating properties of nodes and edges. The authors propose two approaches to solve the optimization problem. The first one is a gradient-free method with inexact zero-order oracle. The second one is a gradient-based method with inexact first-order oracle. My major complaint is that none of the experiment results are in the main text, which makes the paper incomplete. Detailed comments. 1. The authors put experiment results in the supplement, which makes the main text incomplete. 2. Convexity is assumed in Theorem 1, while the function in (2.4) is non-convex. How to choose the set $\Phi$ to guarantee the convexity of the objective function? 3. Theorem 3 provides a bound for $MK(xK - x{K+1})$. Could this bound ensure that the sequence $xk$ converges to a stationary point? 4. By Figure 1 in the supplement, GFNM converges slowly. The authors may also want to report the efficiency of the algorithms.
