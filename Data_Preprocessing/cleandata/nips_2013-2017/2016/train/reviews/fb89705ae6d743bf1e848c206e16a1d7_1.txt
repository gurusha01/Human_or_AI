The authors present a vine copula model, which is suitable for high dimensional data including mixed observation types (continuous and discrete). The given model can be fit to data and sampling-based estimates can be used to compute information theoretic quantities on the data. This method appears to be both tractable and of interest to those wishing to model data from complex datasets that include distinct types of observations, such as neuron spike counts and continuous calcium signals. A general concern for this type of model for neuroscientific applications is that external variables, such as a visual stimulus, are not explicitly included. Is it complicated or intractable to place external variables like a visual stimulus or motor output into the model? Additionally, while the model can handle different forms of observations, it may be very difficult to figure out how to format data for this type of models: continuous calcium signals have a significantly lower sampling rate than intracellular voltage signals.
