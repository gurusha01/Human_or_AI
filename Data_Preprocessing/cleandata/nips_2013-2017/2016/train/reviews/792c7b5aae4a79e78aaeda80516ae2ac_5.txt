This article analyses Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm on balanced mixtures of two Gaussians with known variance. The means are estimated. The questions of the rate of convergence and the accuracy of EM are addressed. The main tool is the analysis of Population EM. EM and Population EM stationary points are characterized. The results are well presented and sufficiently commented. This paper has a practical impact since it considers the difference between the theory of the maximum likelihood estimate and its computation using EM. The focus is on asymptotic limits and is complementary to the literature. Remarks : - An other natural perspective would be to consider the estimation of both the means and the variances, and then a mixture of more than two Gaussians. - A world could have been said on the robustness of EM to model misspecification : what happens if the data are drawn from one Gaussian for example?
