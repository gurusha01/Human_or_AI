A new regularization for matrix factorization is introduced to impose sparsity and smoothness. Although the existence of the solution is not shown, the algorithm of obtaining a solution is presented. It is demonstrated experimentally that that the result is superior to the stat-of-the-art approach. Introduction of a new reqularizer in the optimization problem is a strong side of the paper. The results of the experiments show the potential of the approach. However as the author(s) states the problem is non-convex. The existence of the solution is not shown. The algorithm is solely backed up by experiments. Another issue is that the written needs improvement, say line 146. RE: after rebuttal I am satisfied with the reply on the conference of the algorithm. I am willing to change my rate on Clarity and presentation from 2 to 3.
