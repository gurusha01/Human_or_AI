The paper provides exact recoverability bounds for finding communities in heterogeneous stochastic block models. The paper uses semi-definite program (SDP) relaxations and maximum likelihood methods to give algorithms and then prove the existence of recovery of communities above certain thresholds for such algorithms. The paper also sufficient conditions for failure of exact recovery below the threshold. The paper provides a series of results regarding the recovery of communities for heterogeneous stochastic block models. The theoretical justification for the results are also provided in the supplement. The paper provides quite explicit conditions for recovery of communities for both SDP relaxation algorithm and maximum likelihood algorithm. The paper also gives sufficient condition for failure of exact recovery for heterogeneous block models. The paper provides several nice examples for the recovery cases too. But, it would have been good if some simulation studies were made, specifically for the block models arising from the parameter space in between the recovery thresholds and sufficient condition for non-exact recovery. The part on the missing edges seem to be a bit tangential to the flow of the paper and it seems it can be addressed in a separate paper. The paper provides very nice theoretical results regarding heterogeneous block models. The results on SDP relaxation algorithms can become highly useful for practitioners too. The SDP relaxation algorithms for community detection are becoming quite popular recently but they are still notoriously slow. It would have been good to know, if any experiments were done with the convex relaxations and what size graphs were considered for the experiments. The paper is also quite well-written and the main points of the paper has been quite lucidly made.
