This paper studies a class of ODEs with a generalized averaging scheme. Sufficient conditions on the dual learning rate and the weights are given to achieve a desired convergence rate using a Lyapunov argument. Moreover, the author(s) use(s) an adaptive averaging heuristic to speed up the decrease of the Lyapunov function. Both theoretical guarantees and numerical comparison are provided. The is a long line of works aiming to empirically speed up the convergence of accelerated methods. This paper makes a crucial observation via ODEs that adaptively averaging the weights along the solution trajectories can also achieve the speedup. I found this new method very interesting.
