This paper propose to solve the domain adaptation problem under the setting that the label of data in the target domain are unknown. To solve this problem, the proposed solution alternative do the transduction and adaptation. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution. I have several concerns about the work. Firstly, for the Structured Consistency term, it only enforces the instances with different labels have small similarity, it may result that instances with the same label also have small similarity, which is not desirable for the classification on the target domain. How can the proposed solution avoid this? Secondly, the setting of hyper-parameters. the lambda in equation 1 should greatly affects the performance of the proposed solution. Please shows the performance of the propose solution with respect to different lambda. Please also show the effect of alpha. Thirdly, since the proposed solution do the transduction and adaptation alternatively. Usually how many iterations are needed? It seems for each iteration, we need to learn the DNNs, if there are N iterations, then we need to learn the DNN N times. Therefore the whole framework should be very time consuming. Please report the training time of different methods.
