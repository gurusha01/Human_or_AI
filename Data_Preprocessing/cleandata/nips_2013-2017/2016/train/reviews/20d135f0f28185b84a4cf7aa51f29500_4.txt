The author formulate a stochastic gradient descent method with Multiple choice learning. The author claim the advantages of proposed framework in multiple tasks such as classification, segmentation and captioning. 1. This paper show the sMCL method is kind of incremental in novelty. The motivation behind MCL is clear, but can not be considered as the contribution of this work. This work is an NN version of [8] with some adjustments. 2. The paper is not well written. The technical part of this work (sec 3) task only 1 page. What is the difference of proposed framework comparing with alternative training, which has been widely adopted when multiple tasks are trained together. 3. The author conduct experiments on many computer vision tasks, such as classification, image segmentation and captioning. However, the experiments lack strong baselines and the improvement in performance is small. To prove the efficiency of your frame work, the author should perform experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012 to compare with more strong baselines.
