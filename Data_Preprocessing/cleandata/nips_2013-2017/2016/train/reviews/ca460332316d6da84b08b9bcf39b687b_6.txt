The paper under review proposed a new measurement for multi-way graph partitioning problems, i.e., the product cut, and further proposed an algorithm for the product cut problem. The authors claimed that the proposed algorithm performs significantly better than existing algorithms. The problem proposed in the paper is very interesting, discusses some interesting insides about clustering, which is new to the best of my knowledge. The overall presentation is very good, and is easy for a non-expert to follow. Detailed comments: - The runtime analysis of the algorithm is missing. A lemma summarising the algorithm's runtime and performance is necessary. Also, on Line 235 you stated that your algorithm typically runs significantly faster than other algorithms. Is this statement based on experimental observation? I think more rigorous analysis is needed for such claim. - You used the parameter Purity to measure the performance of algorithms. Some discussion about why you use this parameter is necessary. Also, the meaning of this parameter is not clear to me. Does it relate to the number of misclassified nodes? If this is the case, why the algorithm outputting high value of the purity value gives a better guarantee? - Line 224: There is a typo: "By and large"
