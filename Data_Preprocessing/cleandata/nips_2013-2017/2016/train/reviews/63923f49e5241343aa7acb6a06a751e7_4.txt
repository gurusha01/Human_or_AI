The paper is beyond my expertise for evaluation. The paper is beyond my expertise for evaluation. The only interesting part is the application to fast k-means clustering. There is a provable guarantee for faster learning rates. Unfortunately there are no experimental results. It is hard to know the theorem is really useful in practice. Especially, how do we verify the assumption in Theorem 4.1?
