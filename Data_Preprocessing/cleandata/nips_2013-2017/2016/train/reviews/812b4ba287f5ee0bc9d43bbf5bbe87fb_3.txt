The authors propose a reinforcement learning approach for speeding up the search object scales and locations. When proposing new objects, it relies on a tree-structured search scheme that scales (down) or translates the search window in each step. In this it is somewhat motivated by visual attention models. The approach overall speeds up and improves the proposal generation and leads to state-of-the-art results at reduced computational costs when implemented together with standard object detectors. The paper presents a small interesting idea that is well presented and analyzed. I like the idea of following a formal representation of a visual attention model in the proposal generation, rather than a brute force dense CNN-based classification. I also consider the deep Q learning optimization approach to be interesting. Overall, this study may be of interest to NIPS attendees.
