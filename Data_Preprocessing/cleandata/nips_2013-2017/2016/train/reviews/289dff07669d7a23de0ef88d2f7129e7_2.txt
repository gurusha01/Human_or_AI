This paper adopts the Cholesky decomposition instead of the eigen-decomposition to reduce the time and storage complexity of the CMA-ES. Generally speaking, this paper is clearly written. The proposed method seems reasonable and the experimental results (especially the speedup rates) are quite promising. I think the proposed method may become a new standard version of CMA-ES in the future. Although this paper can be meaningful, the originality is limited because I think this work is a trivial extension of the previous work: A More Efficient Rank-one Covariance Matrix Update for Evolution Strategies. The methods are basically identical. Please correct me if I am wrong. Besides, some very important contents are strangely missing. 1) You should show whether your algorithm is equivalent to formula (2). I understand the space is limited and it has been proven in the previous work, but this is still essential for this paper. 2) You claim that the computational complexity is O(\mu d^2), which is exactly the same as CMA-ES-Ref. Please discuss in detail (maybe using the '\Theta' notation instead of the 'O') why your algorithm is faster. 3) You claim that the error in the path is small and decrease over time, which is contrary to Hansen's claim. Since your theoretical analysis is not deterministic, experiments should be conducted to validate your claim. Comparing only the final performance is not sufficient. Some smaller comments: 1) Please check your notations carefully. For example, wk in Algorithm 2 should be \alphak, n in Table 1 should be d. 2) 'F' should be 'f' in line 185. As such, I think this paper is not qualified for NIPS in its current form.
