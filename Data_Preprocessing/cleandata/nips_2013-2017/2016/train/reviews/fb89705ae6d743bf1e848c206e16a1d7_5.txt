In this paper, the authors suggested a theoretical framework, which is based on vine copulas, to characterize stochastic models with mixed (continuous and discrete) variables. They demonstrated how such a framework can be used to generate samples, to calculate probability densities and to infer parameters based on empirical observed samples. Further, this method was used to analyze simulated neuronal dynamics in order to extract information jointly encoded by local field potentials (the continuous variables) and the spiking activities (the discrete variables). By extending vine copulas to deal with mixed variables, this paper presents a potentially useful method to analyze local field potentials and spiking activities jointly. Technical quality: Overall it seems all right to me. However, a few things could be further improved. In figure 2, it would be informative to show the results of the best fitting mixed vine based model (besides the ground true model). In figure 3, it seems that a classifier based on the independent model would do much better. Why? Did the vine-based models introduce spurious information or it is simply because with limited sample size the parameters of more complex models cannot be estimated accurately? Novelty: It is a novel approach, obtained through relatively straightforward extension of previously introduced ones. Potential usefulness: I have two concerns: 1. How feasible to infer parameters accurately for high dimensional systems? 2. The somewhat controversial results shown in Fig.3 B. If an independent model can work better in terms of extracting information, how useful the current method would be for practical application, e.g., brain-machine interface? Clarity of the presentation: It might be helpful to explain more clearly why it is important to combine LFP and spikes, i.e., what extra information it can provide beyond the conventional method?
