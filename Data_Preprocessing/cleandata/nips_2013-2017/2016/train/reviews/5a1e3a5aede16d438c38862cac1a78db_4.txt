This papers provides support recovery guarantees of sparse regression problem when data term is a l_p norm with p = {1,2+\infty}. The guarantees are derived from the constrained formulation. This paper arises a very interesting question. It is dealt seriously with rigorous theoretical developments and adapted experiments.
