The paper considers the problem of setting reserve prices to buyers that participate only for tau rounds and who decide to buy only if the minimum price over the rounds they stay playing is below their reserve.  After reading the author's rebuttal I have changed my opinion of this problem and I acknowledge that the main contributions of the authors come not from the upper bound but from the lower bound proved in the paper. The abstract of the paper needs a lot of improvement. The authors should also put front and center the fact that this can be viewed as a policy regret problem.
