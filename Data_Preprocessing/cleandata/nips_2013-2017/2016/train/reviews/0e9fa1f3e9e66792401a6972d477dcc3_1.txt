This paper proposes using bidirectional Monte Carlo to estimate the J-S divergence between an MCMC sampler and the target distribution of interest, with a particular eye towards debugging and evaluating MCMC implementations in PPLs. I like the idea of using BDMC to diagnose failures of a sampler to converge—this idea seems potentially quite useful since existing MCMC diagnostics are indeed problematic. Two very relevant references are [1,2], which also test the ability of MCMC samplers by running them on data sampled from the prior. Section 3.1: I found this derivation very hard to follow. For one thing, q(.) is used before it's defined. From context, it seems that it represents the marginal distribution of the AIS sampler after T steps, but that should be made explicit. Things are slightly clearer if one reads the supplement, but the reader shouldn't need to read the supplement to understand the main text. In general, it would be nice to have a clear statement of how to apply the method from start to finish somewhere—the reader has to piece this together a bit. Minor notes: It's a little cluttered to break the unobserved variables into z and theta, when in a general setting like this there is no difference between z and theta---they always appear together, so why not eliminate z or theta?
