This paper suggests a method for learning SVMs for dimensionality reduction. In abstraction, abbreviation LADDER should be explained (for example, Large Margin Discriminant Dimensionality Reduction (LADDER). In line 38, than -> that. Several math notations are wrong. In my review, the term 'predictor' is very confusing. Authors should explain the term 'predictor' (e.g. strong learner or weak learner). In equation 7, what is l and c_l?In line 178, I think the notation dY is wrong. In line 179, explanation for small letter 'm' is missing. What is f(x) in line 89? Is it real-valued function? Also, this paper needs to explain why the proposed algorithm correctly works in view of optimization.
