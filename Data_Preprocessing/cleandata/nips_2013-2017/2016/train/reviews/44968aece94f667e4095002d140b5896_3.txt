The authors analyze a type of repeated posted-price auction with patient buyers. They assume a seller producing an unlimited supply of some homogenous good. The seller encounters a sequence of T buyers, each with private valuation vt for the good. The novelty of this work is to assume that the buyers are patient, that they will wait taut time steps, accepting the best price in the window t,t+1,...,t+taut. In order to make this behavior optimal for the buyer, it is assumed that the seller announces the price at time t+tau on time step t, where tau is an upper bound on taut. Thus, a buyer's decision to accept/reject a price at time t has no influence on any of the prices in t,t+1,...,t+tau. A simple application of EXP3 over Epochs of length T^{1/3}, during which the buyer announces the same price, gives a regret rate of O(tau^{1/3} T^{2/3}) with respect to the best fixed price in hindsight. More interesting is the lower bound demonstrating that the T^{2/3} term cannot be improved. The model introduced by the authors is attractive and worth analyzing, primarily for its simplicity; it is a reasonable model of strategic behavior that nevertheless admits a simple characterization of the buyer's optimal behavior. The upper bound is straight-forward and unsurprising. However, the lower bound is non-trivial and involves a reduction from general MAB with switching costs => impatient sellers with switching costs => patient sellers (without switching costs). I found the connection to MAB with switching costs to be surprising and interesting. One downside to this paper is that there are a number of clarity issues with the document, as well as typos and grammar errors. An incomplete list typos, etc., is included below. Several typos in the abstract! 145-146: " (there is a slight gain, by the increase probability of sell, but it does suffices to offset the loss)" 179: Capitalization: this we do again The arguments to the beta function are switched in Lemma 4 compared to elsewhere in the paper. Appendix A, line 335: chi is not defined where it is first used 220: "The idea of construction is as follows" 225: "Algorithm A' receive price" 239: "therefore" One suggestion for improvement: the body of section 4.1 describes the main ideas behind Lemma 4, not Theorem 3. The statement of Theorem 3 should be moved closer to the construction of A' in my opinion.
