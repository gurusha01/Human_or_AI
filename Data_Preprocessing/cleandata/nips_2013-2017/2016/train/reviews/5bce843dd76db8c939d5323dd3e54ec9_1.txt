The paper enhances LSTM with a "time gate". The time gate is controlled only by time and by learned parameters. Each LSTM cell has a different time gate. When the time gate is closed, the cell is not updated. I like that the paper tries something new. Technical quality: 1) The proposed formulation of the time gate is not necessary optimal. It may be better to make the time gate a continuous function of the time. E.g., the continuous time gate can be a piece-wise linear function with values: alpha, 1, alpha, 0, alpha, 1, ... 2) It would be nice to run the model on a speech recognition benchmark. Novelty: It is nice that the paper considers processing of asynchronous events. Impact: The work is inspiring. People can propose improvements. The results show significant improvements on the tried tasks. Clarity: It is not clear whether the twenty-fold reduction in run time compute cost is just theoretical or measured on a hardware.
