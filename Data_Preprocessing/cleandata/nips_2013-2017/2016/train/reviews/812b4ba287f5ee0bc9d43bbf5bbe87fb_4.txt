The paper presents an object proposal algorithms which exploits reinforcement learning modeled as a MDP and a novel tree-structured search scheme that allows discovery of multiple objects in a single pass based on two seemingly well defined actions; translation and scale search. Combined with detection procedures, the proposed algorithm not only presents the improvement for the object proposal task but also shows effectiveness in the object detection task. The basic idea of using a tree-structured search scheme with multiple policies to allow the discovery of multiple objects in a single pass is clever, straightforward and make sense. The approach is technically sound and novel, although the basic MDP model (e.g., 13 actions) seem to be derived from a previous work and be extended. The experiments are well set up proving the efficacy of the proposed method, however, I would like to see the detection case results of either only VGG or Resnet is used in a baseline and the proposed algorithm. I also have an impression that authors state that the detection is better than state-of-the-arts because of their object proposal, however, the mAP reported in the paper (~%76) is somewhat lower than the currently existing best detection performances reported in the literature. Overall, the paper is very well written and may have an impact.
