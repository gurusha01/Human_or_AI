An extension to the word mover's distance which uses supervision to learn weights on the distance. The paper features a very extensive experimental evaluation. I am happy to see that someone picked up the approach of word mover's distance and used discriminative training to learn a domain-specific metric. The method is sound, well explained, with just the right information. The experiments are very extensive on several classification data sets and a wide variety of baseline methods and features. The suggested method outperforms all by a large margin. This is a solid paper that I would very much like to see presented at NIPS.
