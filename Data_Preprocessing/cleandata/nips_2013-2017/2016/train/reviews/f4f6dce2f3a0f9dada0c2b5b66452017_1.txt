This work explores the connection between sampling-based regression and low-rank tensor factorization, and presents a new method that relies on a simple bound on the leverage scores of the KRP matrix. The algorithm and theory are all based on well-known results in sampling-based matrix approximation, and the analysis is quite straightforward, hence the main novelty is in putting the pieces together. That said, the work is technically solid and the end result in practice does appear to be an improvement over the current state of the art (albeit a somewhat incremental one). The paper has several typos / grammatical mistakes / awkwardly constructed sentences, but the ideas themselves are presented well. Theorem 3.2 and 3.3: This is a nice observation, though also fairly simple results. line 174: "The estimation is tight" seems a bit misleading. I would instead say the estimation is tight up to a constant factor R. The table between lines 295 and 296 is not defined (though from context it is clear that it is table 1). Also, in (a) of this table, it's also not immediately clear that "sketch" corresponds to the method in [37]
