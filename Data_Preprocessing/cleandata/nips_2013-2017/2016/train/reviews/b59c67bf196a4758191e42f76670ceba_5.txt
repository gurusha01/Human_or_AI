This paper proposed a new deep model for unsupervised domain adaptation. The proposed method replaces softmax layer and loss function with specifically designed domain adaptive objective. The objective jointly models transduction and adaptation. By optimizing the objective, the proposed method achieves state of the art on digit and office benchmark dataset. A new deep learning approach for unsupervised domain adaptation is proposed in this paper. The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on digit and office benchmark dataset. The paper is clear and well organized. Though the contribution looks incremental, the experimental performance is promising. 1. Does the alternating solver converge? How stable is the algorithm, and how stable are the results? Could you get the same result every time? 2. line 166, I cannot understand why (3) is convex when feature functions are convex. The feature function is in the minus part of (3) 3. The related work seems insufficient to me. The most recent related work mentioned is [10], which is from ICML 2015. [5][19][32] are compared in experiments without explanation. I think they also need to be discussed in related work section. 4. The writing could be improved, especially in introduction and related work. Many sentences are broken by reference in the related work section.
