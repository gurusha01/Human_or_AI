This paper considers the Burer-Monteiro factorization approach to the matrix completion problem. This paper shows that this formulation, albeit non-convex, has no bad local minimum. In fact, all spurious stationary points are shown to be strict saddle, so many optimization algorithms can escape from them and converge to the desired solution. These results are shown by analyzing the geometry of the objective function outside the strongly convex region using concentration inequalities. This is solid paper on a timely topic. Several recent works show local convergence of the non-convex factorization approach to matrix completion, and this paper strengthens these results to prove global convergence. Different from several concurrent results along this line, the proof in this paper requires several new ingredients to handle the incoherence issues and the effect of the regularizer. The proof looks solid and the presentation is clear. A minor comment: The first inequality in eq. (3.9) does not seem to hold uniformly over B. For example, if x = e_1 / sqrt(d), then x is in B, the the LHS of (3.9) is p||x||^3 as Omega will miss the only non-zero entry of xx^T with high probability, but the RHS of the first inequality of (3.9) is p epsilon ||x||^3. The issue seems to be that Theorem D.2 doesn't apply to all x in B, but only to those whose infinity norm is 1/sqrt(d) smaller than its Frobenius norm. I believe this bug is easily fixable though, as Lemma 3.4 guarantees that all x of interest has Frobenius norm larger than 1/4 and hence much larger than its infinity norm, and Theorem D.2 can indeed be applied.
