Authors propose CMICOT, a filter-based feature selection method that is able to discover interactions between more than 3 features -- which is a common bottleneck in the higher orders able to be captured. Submission reads very cleanly and the authors build their argument for the proposed approach well placing it clearly with respect to the general challenges of the domain and existing literature. Formalization of the approaches are provided. However, this work is a little light in evaluation. Although a number of datasets are presented performance is aggregated to the point identifying how (i.e., magnitude of outperformance) and why (underlying reasons for the benefits) are unclear. Additional results seen in the appendix but the material presented within the page limit is, in of its self, lacking. Figure 1 in particular does not have a y-axis to interpret the relative performance gaps.
