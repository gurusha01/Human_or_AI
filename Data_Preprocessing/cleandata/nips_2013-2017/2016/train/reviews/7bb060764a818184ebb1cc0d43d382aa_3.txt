This paper introduces a new sampling model for dropout, where different features/neurons are subjected to different multinomial distributions. The paper introduces improvements to standard dropout that might be useful in practice. I particularly find Figure 2, section 5.1 and figure 3 interesting in terms of results/benchmarks.
