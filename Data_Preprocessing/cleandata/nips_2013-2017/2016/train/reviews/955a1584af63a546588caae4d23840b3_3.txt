The paper presents some lower bounds on the ability to learn when only part of the attributes of each sample is visible to the learner. The scenario that the paper investigated had bee explored previously and the paper explain why the results presented does not contradict known results. Finally the paper present a general generic algorithm and show an upper bound on the error achieved. Solid paper, provide important results in a clear and precise way. Good review of prior knowledge in this field. I do believe however that the authors can better explain at least for the first lower bound ( general cost function) why do things go wrong. It seems to me that in most cases learning is achievable, however not in all cases. Better describing why the learning process fails can give researches much needed insight which in my view is much more valuable then the precise mathematical lower limit.
