The authors analyze the sample complexity of learning approximately optimal auctions from among well-studied combinatorial auction classes. The authors analyze what is the relation of the best in sample mechanism in the class with the revenue of this mechanism on the actual distribution of player's values. The authors heavily use the toolbox of Rademacher complexities and Rademacher calculus, combined with more combinatorial approaches, such as the the VC dimension, in order to bound the Rademacher complexity of the revenue objective from among well-studied classes of combinatorial auctions. The results are technically interesting both from a learning theoretic point of view, as they analyze quite complex functions classes and manage to bound their complexity, as well as from a mechanism design point of view, as they introduce the Rademacher complexity machinery to mechanism desing. For this reason, I recommend acceptance.
