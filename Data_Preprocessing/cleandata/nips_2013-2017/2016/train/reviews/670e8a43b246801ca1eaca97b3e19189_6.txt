The paper considers clustering task with models that yield clusters whose size grow sublinearly (instead of linear) with the total number of data points. The authors define the microclustering property to address this requirement and propose two new models (the NBNB model and the NBD model) that exhibit this property. The microclustering property defined in this paper provides a way to characterize models that require clusters whose sizes grow sublinearly, including entity resolution. The paper propose NBNB and NBD model that exhibit this property and compare their performance using real datasets. Besides lacking of theoretical justification, the paper overall may have large impact for further research on clustering models.
