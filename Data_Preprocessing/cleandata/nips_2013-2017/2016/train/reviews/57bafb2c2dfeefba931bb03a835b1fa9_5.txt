The authors study the problem of recovering communities under the stochastic block model and show that semidefinite programming can recover communities with different characteristics (e.g. smaller) than previous analyses. I enjoyed reading this paper:  Paper is well organized and easy to follow.  The possibility of recovering communities smaller than sqrt(log n) based on convex optimization is an appealing theoretical result.  The paper abounds with examples that make the theoretical results easier to interpret. Table 1 is very helpful to identify the theorem that is applicable on different regimes. Theorem 1 (and 2) assures that under some regularity conditions \hat{Y} and Y^ coincide. However, \hat{Y} may can be continuous and Y^* is a binary matrix. Isn't there projection or thresholding step at the end of problem? It is not clear under which set the maximizationof (2.4) is carried out, please specify.
