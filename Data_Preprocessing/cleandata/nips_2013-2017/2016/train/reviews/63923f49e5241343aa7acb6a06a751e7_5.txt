This paper studies the fast learning rates when the losses may be unbounded and have a distribution with heavy tails. The authors introduce two new conditions: the first is the multi-scale Bernstein's condition, and the second is the integrability of the envelope function. The learning rate faster than O(n^(-1/2)) is derived. A learning rate is obtained for unbounded and heavy-tailed losses by introducing two new conditions. This result extends some exsiting studies and links with some previous conclusions. For clarity, the authors may explain the importance of heavy-tailed losses. An example of heavy-tailed loss would also be helpful. Typo: Assumption 2.1, There exist -> There exists
