The paper summarizes previoulsy published results on bidirectional Monte Carlo and reports on its application using two probabilstic programming languages. There seem to be no original ideas in this paper, which describes the implementation of known techniques in WebPPL and Stan languages. Perhaps an MCMC workshop might be a more appropriate venue for this work.
