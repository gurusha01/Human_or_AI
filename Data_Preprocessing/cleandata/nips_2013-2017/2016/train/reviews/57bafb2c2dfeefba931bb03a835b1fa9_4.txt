This paper discussed the conditions of recoverability of the heterogenous stochastic block model under more general settings, where there is no restriction on the number and sizes of communities or how they grow with the number of nodes, as well as on the connectivity probabilities inside or across communities. The author(s) provided results from both statistical and computational aspects of recoverability. The examples in the paper offered a better understanding of the abstract theorems. The author(s) also identified some parameter configurations that can be efficiently recoverable by semidefinite programs. This can provide some guidance in practice of the usage of semidefinite programming. The problem and results are clearly stated, easy to follow. 1. Section 2.3 Partial Observations. The authors assumed that "the entries of the A (adjacency matrix) has been observed independently". Would this assumption be too strong in practice? It might be better if the authors could add some discussion about how the conclusions would change if this assumption was violated. 2. In Table 1, Ex. 1 and Ex. 2 have the same importance, but different recoverability by Thm. 1 and Thm. 2. It would be better if the authors could list the differences of these two example in the table as well.
