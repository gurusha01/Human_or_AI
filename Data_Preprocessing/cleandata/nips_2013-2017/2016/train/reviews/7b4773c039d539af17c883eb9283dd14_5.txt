This paper proposes a new algorithm called TrailBlazer for Monte-Carlo Planning. The authors provide the sample complexity of their algorithm. Their results include the case when there are infinite number of states. This is a good paper with novel contribution. It propose a novel algorithm called TrailBlazer with good sampling complexity. The algorithm is also computational efficient. Instead of keeping an upper bound and lower bound of the value function, this paper creatively uses two parameters to control the error, one parameter for variance and another parameter for bias. Based on their algorithm, the authors prove the sample complexity. The claim that their framework has a polynomial sample complexity when there are infinite states is interesting. Also, their algorithm do need to visit all the policies. By this method, the algorithm becomes computationally efficient. To sum, the paper is solid and of good quality. Typos and suggestions: l.196 Grammar mistakes l.214 and l.205 The notation (\epsilon, m) is not consistent l.220 "and an a term" l.242 Need more explanation on why it behaves just like Monte-Carlo sampling.
