The paper provides the sample complexity analysis of automated mechanism design which is used for searching of high-revenue combinatorial auction in an auction class. The main results are uniform convergence bounds of revenue for a hierarchical of auction classes, which state that exponential sample complexity are not avoidable for general AMA auctions, VVCA auctions and \lambda auctions, meanwhile polynomial sample complexity can be achieved for MBARP and MBA auctions. The core technique involved is bounding the complexity of different auction classes, with Rademacher complexity or pseudo dimension. + This paper explores an interesting new research area for learning theory. Based on traditional technique for sample complexity analysis, the results reveals new insights on the structure of auction class hierarchy. The paper is well-written so that the content is easy to follow. - The quantity "U" appeared in bounds are not explained in the paper.
