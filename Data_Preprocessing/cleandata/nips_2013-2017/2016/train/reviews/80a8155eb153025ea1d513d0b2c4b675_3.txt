The authors analyzed the robustness and consistency of the algorithm robust k-means. They showed that two outliers are enough to breakdown this algorithm. However, if the data are well-structured, it remains robust to outliers. Furthermore, they proved that even when robust k-means involves a non-convex penalty function, its consistency property remains valid. The problems studied in this manuscript is interesting and important. The analysis is sound. The only question is that Chapter 5 seems irrelevant to the rest of the paper. The analysis of the experimental results is also missing. If simulation is of interest, the reviewer would suggest conduct some experiments which reflect the results obtained previously about robustness and consistency.
