In this paper, the authors aim to deconvolve the feedback loops in a recommender system. The authors propose an observation model with many assumptions, analyze it, and show that the deconvolution is possible. - The practical usage/goal of this paper is not clear to me. Is the goal to understand to the effectiveness of a given recommender system? I suggest the authors to clarify the problem they try to solve and the practical impact of the problem. - Is there a way to improve recommendation performance if Rtrue is obtained? - Is the fact that most ratings are missing in Robs modeled in the paper? Note that R_{true} should be a dense matrix with ratings (every user has a rating for each item, but it might not be revealed)
