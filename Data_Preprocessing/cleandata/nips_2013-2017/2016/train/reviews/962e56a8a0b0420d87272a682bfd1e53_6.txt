The goal of this work is to recover true ratings of intrinsic user preferences from the observed ratings. So sufficient assumptions are stated to deconvolve the feedback loops. This work furthermore develop a metric to unravel the influence of RS on the entire user-item rating matrix. 1. This work focuses only on the user-item rating matrix. So the item-item ( or user-user ) similiarities is the key to recover the true ratings. However, many real datasets include the temporal information, side information, contextual information, etc. It is more intresting and useful problem on how to recover the true ratings on these datasets. 2. There are too many materials stated in the supplementary file which destories the completeness of this work to some extent. 3. In line 55, "ans" should be "and"? 4. In line 148, "standard normal" should be "normal"?
