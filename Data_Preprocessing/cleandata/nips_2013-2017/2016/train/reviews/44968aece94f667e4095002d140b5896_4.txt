A seller of an infinite set of identical items can post prices over time as T bidders arrive, wait, possibly obtain an item, and leave. The seller would like low regret compared to the best posted price in hindsight despite adversarially chosen bidders who are strategic about when to purchase in the window that they are present. Restricts to seller strategies that post prices \tau days in advance, where \tau is the longest bidder window; otherwise, complex game-theoretic knots arise. Proves T^(2/3) upper and lower bounds on regret, using a no-regret algorithm that posts fixed prices for T^(1/3) steps at a time. I like the model and ideas presented and think the paper does a good job addressing them. There are some presentation problems such as typos and especially the abstract, but these should not be hard to fix. The results also do mainly rely on reducing to previous results. On the positive side, the model seems very interesting. The most intriguing result, which I think you should emphasize more, is that as soon as bidder patience goes from 0 to 1, optimal regret goes from sqrt(T) to T^(2/3). And indeed your proof reduces down to this case for whatever the bidder patience started at. (By the way, the main text should mention that the proof for general \tau is in the appendix, since only \tau=1 is shown and I think that is not mentioned, or else I missed it.) The ideas for the upper and lower bound are also nice in my opinion. I also thought the discussion section was very helpful. ------------- After discussion and author response: My review and opinion stay about the same.
