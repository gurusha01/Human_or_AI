The paper models the problem of labeling data from crowdsourcing. Each worker is modeled as a noisy channel (two types of channels are considered: symmetric memoryless channel without feedback and spammer/hammer channel model). The problem then becomes a coding problem for the channel considered and the authors study. The budget used is then mapped on the rate of the code for the analysis. The paper considers distortion vs. budget tradeoffs and also studies a basic coding scheme (termed k-incidence coding) which corresponds to requiring the crowdsourced tasks to be that of labeling a subset of k items at a time. I found the paper fairly interesting, but as it falls outside of my area of expertise don't have any detailed comments on it.
