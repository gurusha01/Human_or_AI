The authors consider a variant of k-means called the robust k-means. They investigate its theoretical properties, in particular its robustness and consistency. They show that two outliers are enough to breakdown this clustering procedure. However, if the data is ''well-structured'' in the way defined by the authors, then this algorithm can recover the cluster structure in spite of the outliers. They also show the asymptotic properties of the modified robust k-means method. The paper has a very good technical level nad is written in an interesting fashion (I didn't see any grammar errors). The problems raised in the paper are clearly stated. The authors show the weakness of existing robust k-means method but they also show how to fix this problem. The paper contains intersting theoretical results.
