This paper develops a neural network approach paste on a conditional maximum mean discrepancy criterion. the proposed technique is evaluated font standard small benchmark tasks for discriminative and generative capabilities. Overall this is an interesting extension for the sub-area of deep learning research focused on building generative models. The paper text is reasonably clear although, like most papers in this area, the math can be a bit difficult to follow at times. The tasks used in experiments are somewhat small but not entirely unreasonable when compared against other recent work in this area. As the algorithm for training the model involves some computationally expensive steps I would ask for some comments in the experiment section on how long the model takes to train compared with existing approaches like DSN. The paper would be much stronger if reference code were made available for the experiments. From the model section a practitioner may have difficulty reproducing the exact models evaluated.
