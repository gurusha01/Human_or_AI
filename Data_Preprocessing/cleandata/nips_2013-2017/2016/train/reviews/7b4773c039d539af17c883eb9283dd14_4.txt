The paper presents an algorithm to handle MDPs with a finite or infinite number of transitions from state-action to next states to return an estimate of the optimal value function at any state while minimizing the number of calls to the generative model, i.e., the sample complexity. The major issue I have with this paper is that no experimental results on simulation domains or real applications have been reported. Althouth this is a theory paper, in my view, such results are required and should be reported to demonstrate the practicability and effiectiveness of the proposed algorithm, especially the authors themselve also claim that one of their main contributions is that their approach is easy to implement and computationally efficient. The text would benefit from further proof-reading. There are a number of typos: -Line 58: 1->[1] -Line 107: finite and infinite -> finite or infinite -Line 111: is be related->is related -Line 174: the concept of "opened" should be explained as it is the first time that it appears in the paper -Line 220: an a term -> a term -Line 355: using and approach->using an approach Figure 3 should be explained.
