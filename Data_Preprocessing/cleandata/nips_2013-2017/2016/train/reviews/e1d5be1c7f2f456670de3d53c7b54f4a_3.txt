This paper considers the contextual combinatorial semi-bandit problems, and proposes learning algorithms based on supervised learning oracles for both (1) the case with known weights and (2) the case with unknown weights. Regret bounds are developed for both cases (Theorem 1 and 2), and preliminary experiment results are demonstrated (Section 6). This paper is very interesting in general, and I believe that it has met the standard of NIPS poster. In particular, to the best of my knowledge, this is the first paper considering contextual combinatorial semi-bandits with unknown weights. However, I think some parts of the paper can still be improved, and will appreciate it if the authors polish the final version of the paper accordingly: 1) In Theorem 2: the O(T^{2/3}) regret bound is somewhat unsatisfactory since I am expecting an O(T^{1/2}) regret bound. If the authors believe that the O(T^{2/3}) regret bound is intrinsic, please discuss. If the authors believe that it is due to unsatisfactory analysis, please also discuss (i.e. which step of the analysis leads to this non-tight regret bound). 2) Algorithm 2 is hard to digest. Please rewrite the motivation and explanation of the algorithm. 3) There is a recent paper on contextual combinatorial semi-bandit, which is directly relevant. The authors might cite it. @article{wen2014efficient, title={Efficient learning in large-scale combinatorial semi-bandits}, author={Wen, Zheng and Kveton, Branislav and Ashkan, Azin}, journal={http://jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v37/wen15.html}, year={2014} }
