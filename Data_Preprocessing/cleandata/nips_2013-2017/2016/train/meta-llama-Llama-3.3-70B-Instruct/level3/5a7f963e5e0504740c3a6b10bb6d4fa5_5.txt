This paper presents a collection of results on the tractability of arithmetic circuits, specifically focusing on the multiplication and summing-out operations. The authors introduce a subclass of arithmetic circuits called Probabilistic Sentential Decision Diagrams (PSDDs) and show that they support a polytime multiplication operator, making them suitable for a broader class of applications. The paper also provides a new method for compiling probabilistic graphical models into PSDDs, which is compared to existing methods.
The main strengths of the paper are the introduction of PSDDs and the development of a polytime multiplication operator for them. The authors also provide a clear and well-organized presentation of the results, making it easy to follow the paper. The experimental evaluation of the compilation algorithm for PSDDs is also a strong point, demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach.
However, there are some weaknesses in the paper. The algorithm for multiplying PSDDs is not well-described, with unclear lines in the middle of the algorithm, and lacks mention in the supplementary material. The comparison with other models in the literature is also concerning, as the newly defined method's performance seems to significantly depend on the choice of network. Additionally, the paper lacks discussion on the compilation time, which does not appear to have improved with the new method. The writing quality is also poor, with repeated mistakes and reference errors.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets some of the criteria, such as being well-organized and providing a clear presentation of the results. However, it falls short in other areas, such as the lack of discussion on the compilation time and the poor writing quality.
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The introduction of PSDDs and the development of a polytime multiplication operator for them is a significant contribution to the field.
* The experimental evaluation of the compilation algorithm for PSDDs demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach.
* The paper provides a clear and well-organized presentation of the results.
Arguments con acceptance:
* The algorithm for multiplying PSDDs is not well-described and lacks mention in the supplementary material.
* The comparison with other models in the literature is concerning, as the newly defined method's performance seems to significantly depend on the choice of network.
