This paper proposes a novel approach to designing revenue-maximizing combinatorial auctions using automated mechanism design. The authors provide a sample complexity analysis for the standard hierarchy of deterministic combinatorial auction classes, which is a significant contribution to the field of computational economics. The paper's main strength lies in its ability to provide tight sample complexity bounds for various auction classes, including affine maximizer auctions, virtual valuation combinatorial auctions, and mixed bundling auctions.
The authors' use of Rademacher complexity and pseudo-dimension to derive sample complexity bounds is a notable aspect of the paper. The proof of Theorem 2, which bounds the Rademacher complexity of the class of AMA revenue functions, is particularly impressive. The authors' ability to decompose the revenue functions into smaller, easier-to-analyze components is a key insight that allows them to derive meaningful bounds.
However, the paper's value is somewhat diminished by the existence of similar formulations, such as LASSO and sparse autoencoder. The authors could have provided more insights and comparisons to justify the benefits of their approach. Additionally, the choice of output in the information bottleneck method is unclear, and the difference between this method and conventional sparse coding needs to be further clarified.
The experiments presented in the paper are somewhat limited, and the authors could have provided more quantitative comparisons to existing methods. The paper would be stronger with more detailed comparisons to existing methods, such as sparse autoencoder, and more complex experiments to demonstrate the method's capabilities.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the authors have made a significant contribution to the field of computational economics. However, there are some areas that require further clarification and improvement.
