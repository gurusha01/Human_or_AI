This paper proposes a novel extension of the encoder-decoder framework, called the review network, which enhances the existing encoder-decoder model by performing multiple review steps with attention on the encoder hidden states. The review network outputs a set of thought vectors that capture global properties of the input, which are then used by the decoder to generate the output. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of the review network on two tasks: image captioning and source code captioning, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the MSCOCO benchmark dataset.
The paper is well-organized and clearly written, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments and understand the proposed methodology. The introduction provides a good background on the encoder-decoder framework and its limitations, motivating the need for the review network. The related work section provides a comprehensive overview of existing approaches, highlighting the differences between the proposed review network and other architectures.
The technical contributions of the paper are significant, and the authors provide a thorough explanation of the review network architecture, including the attentive input reviewer and attentive output reviewer variants. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the review network in improving over conventional encoder-decoders, and the authors provide a detailed analysis of the results, including visualizations of the attention weights and thought vectors.
However, there are some areas that require further clarification and improvement. For example, the authors could provide more details on the hyperparameter tuning process, particularly the choice of the number of review steps (Tr) and the weighting factor (Î»). Additionally, the authors could discuss the computational complexity of the review network and its potential applications to other tasks beyond image captioning and source code captioning.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of natural language processing and computer vision, and the proposed review network has the potential to improve the performance of encoder-decoder models on a wide range of tasks. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the proposed methodology and experimental results.
