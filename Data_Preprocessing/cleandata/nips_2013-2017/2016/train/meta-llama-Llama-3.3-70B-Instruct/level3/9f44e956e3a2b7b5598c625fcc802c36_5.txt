This paper introduces a novel approach to reduce memory consumption in the backpropagation through time (BPTT) algorithm for training recurrent neural networks (RNNs). The authors propose a dynamic programming approach to balance the trade-off between caching intermediate results and recomputation, allowing the algorithm to fit within almost any user-defined memory budget. The paper is well-structured and clearly written, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments.
The strengths of the paper include its technical soundness, clarity, and significance. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the problem and propose a well-motivated solution. The use of dynamic programming to find an optimal memory usage policy is a key contribution of the paper. The authors also provide a detailed comparison with existing methods, including Chen's âˆšt algorithm, and demonstrate the advantages of their approach.
However, there are some weaknesses in the paper. The authors could provide more details on how the slow weights are trained, and a detailed figure of the computational graph would help clarify the automatic differentiation and backpropagation of gradients. Additionally, it is unclear whether gradients are backpropagated through fast weights, which are functions of past hidden activities and slow weights, or if these variables are considered constant when computing gradients.
In terms of originality, the paper proposes a novel combination of familiar techniques, including dynamic programming and backpropagation through time. The authors also establish links with previous work on memory mechanisms and attention mechanisms, making the paper a significant contribution to the field.
The significance of the paper lies in its ability to provide a flexible and efficient solution to the memory consumption problem in RNNs. The authors demonstrate that their approach can save up to 95% of memory usage while using only one-third more time per iteration than the standard BPTT algorithm. This makes the paper a valuable contribution to the field, with potential applications in a wide range of areas, including speech recognition, sequence generation, and reinforcement learning.
