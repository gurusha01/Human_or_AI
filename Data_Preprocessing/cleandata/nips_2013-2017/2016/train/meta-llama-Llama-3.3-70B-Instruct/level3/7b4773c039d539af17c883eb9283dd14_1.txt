This paper introduces a new Monte Carlo-based planning algorithm called TrailBlazer, which aims to find the optimal value function with minimal calls to the generative model. The algorithm provides theoretical guarantees, including PAC consistency and upper bounds on the number of calls to the generative model for both finite and infinite state spaces. TrailBlazer alternates between Avg and Max nodes, using a Monte Carlo estimator to compute average values and eliminating low-value children with high probability.
The paper improves upon previous worst-case upper bounds for finite state spaces with stochastic dynamics and provides new results for infinite state spaces. The introduction of TrailBlazer is a significant contribution to the field, as it has the potential to be applied to various planning problems.
The strengths of the paper include its thorough theoretical analysis and the provision of theoretical guarantees. The algorithm's ability to alternate between Avg and Max nodes and eliminate low-value children with high probability is also a notable strength. However, the paper could be improved by providing more intuition on why TrailBlazer works better than other algorithms. Additionally, the algorithm's limitations, such as not exploiting regularities in the value function and only providing guarantees in expectation for certain cases, should be further discussed.
There are also some minor issues with the paper, such as typos and unclear explanations in certain sections, including the explanation of separate bias and variance in Section 3.1. Nevertheless, the paper is well-written and provides a clear overview of the algorithm and its theoretical guarantees.
Arguments for acceptance include the paper's significant contribution to the field, its thorough theoretical analysis, and its potential for application to various planning problems. Arguments against acceptance include the need for more intuition on why TrailBlazer works better than other algorithms and the algorithm's limitations. Overall, the paper is a strong contribution to the field and deserves consideration for acceptance.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis. The paper is also well-organized and clearly written, making it easy to follow. The originality of the paper lies in the introduction of the TrailBlazer algorithm and its theoretical guarantees. The significance of the paper is high, as it has the potential to be applied to various planning problems and improve upon existing algorithms.
In conclusion, the paper is a strong contribution to the field, and its strengths outweigh its weaknesses. With some revisions to address the minor issues and provide more intuition on why TrailBlazer works better than other algorithms, the paper has the potential to be a highly influential work in the field of planning and decision-making.
