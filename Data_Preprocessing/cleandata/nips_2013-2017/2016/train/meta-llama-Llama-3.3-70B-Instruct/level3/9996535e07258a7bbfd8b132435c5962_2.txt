This paper proposes a novel sequence-to-sequence architecture, called the review network, which extends the traditional encoder-decoder framework. The review network performs multiple review steps with attention on the encoder hidden states, outputting a set of thought vectors that capture global information in the input. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of the review network on image captioning and source code captioning tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the MSCOCO benchmark.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the review network architecture and its components. The experiments are thorough, and the results are impressive, showing consistent improvement over conventional encoder-decoders. The use of discriminative supervision is an interesting idea, and the authors demonstrate its effectiveness in improving the performance of the review network.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to provide a generic framework that can be applied to various tasks, including image captioning and source code captioning. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the review network's performance, including visualizations of the attention weights and thought vectors.
However, there are some weaknesses in the paper. The authors do not provide a clear explanation of the importance of the T_r factor, which is set to 8 in the COCO experiment. Additionally, the experiments on COCO do not reflect the most recent results available on the MSCOCO website, which show better performance on most metrics. The authors also do not provide a discussion on the comparison between attentive input reviewer and attentive output reviewer, including when to use each and their relative performance.
Despite these weaknesses, the paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the review network architecture and its components. The experiments are thorough, and the results are impressive, showing consistent improvement over conventional encoder-decoders. The use of discriminative supervision is an interesting idea, and the authors demonstrate its effectiveness in improving the performance of the review network.
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel and generic framework that can be applied to various tasks.
* The experiments are thorough, and the results are impressive, showing consistent improvement over conventional encoder-decoders.
* The use of discriminative supervision is an interesting idea, and the authors demonstrate its effectiveness in improving the performance of the review network.
Arguments con acceptance:
* The authors do not provide a clear explanation of the importance of the T_r factor.
* The experiments on COCO do not reflect the most recent results available on the MSCOCO website.
* The authors do not provide a discussion on the comparison between attentive input reviewer and attentive output reviewer.
Overall, I recommend accepting the paper, as it provides a novel and generic framework that can be applied to various tasks, and the experiments are thorough and impressive. However, the authors should address the weaknesses mentioned above in the final version of the paper.
