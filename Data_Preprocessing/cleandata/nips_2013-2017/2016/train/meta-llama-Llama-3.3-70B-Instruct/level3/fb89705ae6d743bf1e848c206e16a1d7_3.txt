This paper introduces a novel approach to handling mixed discrete and continuous variables in probabilistic models, leveraging copula-based models to avoid the curse of dimensionality. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through simulations on neuronal network data, showcasing significant improvements in likelihood and mutual information estimates. The paper is well-written, although the description of C-vine copulas may benefit from additional clarification or supplementary materials.
The combination of discrete and continuous variables is a crucial aspect of this work, and the authors make a significant advance in addressing issues related to using such models with mixed neural data. The paper's impact may be limited to a select audience familiar with C-vine modeling until a full-length journal paper is published, expanding its reach beyond the current niche.
