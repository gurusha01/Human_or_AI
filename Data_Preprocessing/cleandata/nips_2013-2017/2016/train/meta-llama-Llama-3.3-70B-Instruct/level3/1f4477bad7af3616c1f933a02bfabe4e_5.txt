This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm for estimating parameters of Gaussian mixture models. The authors provide a global analysis of EM, characterizing the stationary points and dynamics of the algorithm in the large sample limit. They also establish statistical consistency of the EM algorithm for these models, showing that it can compute statistically consistent parameter estimates without requiring specific initialization methods.
The paper is well-written and clearly organized, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments and results. The mathematical derivations are rigorous and instructive, although some parts, such as the transition from first to second derivatives in Theorems 3 and 4, could be clarified further.
The authors' contributions are significant, as they provide a detailed understanding of the EM algorithm's behavior for Gaussian mixture models. The results have important implications for the use of EM in practice, as they show that the algorithm can be reliable and efficient for estimating parameters in these models.
The paper also raises interesting questions about the behavior of EM in more general settings, such as when the dimensionality of the data grows with the sample size. The authors' conjecture that their results still hold in this setting is intriguing and worthy of further investigation.
