This paper presents a novel approach to deconvolve feedback loops in recommender systems, allowing for the recovery of true user preferences without the influence of the recommender system. The authors propose a set of assumptions that enable the creation of a tractable model of a recommender system, which is then used to develop an algorithm for deconvolving feedback loops. The algorithm is based on the singular value decomposition of the observed ratings matrix and is able to recover the true ratings matrix up to a scaling constant.
The paper is well-structured and clearly written, with a thorough explanation of the assumptions and the algorithm. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the results on synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of their approach. The paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to identify items that are highly influenced by the recommender system, which is a crucial aspect of understanding the impact of feedback loops. The authors propose a metric to assess the extent of recommender system effects on the final ratings matrix, which is shown to be effective in distinguishing datasets with and without recommender systems.
However, there are some areas that could be improved. The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the limitations of the assumptions and the potential impact on the results. Additionally, the authors could provide more insights into the interpretation of the results, particularly in the context of real-world recommender systems.
In terms of originality, the paper presents a novel approach to deconvolving feedback loops in recommender systems, which is a significant contribution to the field. The paper also provides a unique perspective on the problem, highlighting the importance of understanding the impact of feedback loops on user preferences.
The significance of the paper lies in its ability to provide insights into the behavior of recommender systems and the impact of feedback loops on user preferences. The paper has the potential to influence the development of more effective recommender systems that take into account the biases introduced by feedback loops.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, as it presents a significant contribution to the field of recommender systems and provides valuable insights into the impact of feedback loops on user preferences. However, I would suggest that the authors address the limitations of the assumptions and provide more insights into the interpretation of the results.
