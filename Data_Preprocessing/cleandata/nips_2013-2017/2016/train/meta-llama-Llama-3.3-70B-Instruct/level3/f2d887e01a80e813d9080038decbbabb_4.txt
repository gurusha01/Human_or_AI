This paper presents a theoretical analysis of the robustness and consistency properties of a variant of the classical quadratic k-means algorithm, called robust k-means (RKM). The authors provide a detailed description of the optimality conditions for the associated minimization problem and show that RKM shares the computational simplicity of quadratic k-means, making it a "computationally cheap" candidate for robust nearest neighbor clustering.
The paper's main contribution is the consideration of continuous losses, rather than 0/1-loss, and the proposal of a method of moments approach to keep computations tractable, using tensor decomposition methods. The authors also provide a thorough analysis of the breakdown properties of RKM, showing that two outliers in a dataset are enough to breakdown some centers, but that the algorithm can recover the underlying cluster structure in spite of outliers if the dataset is "well-structured".
The paper's strengths include its thorough analysis of the optimality conditions and breakdown properties of RKM, as well as its consideration of continuous losses and method of moments approach. The authors also provide a clear and well-organized presentation of their results, making the paper easy to follow.
However, the paper could benefit from better motivation of the assumptions, particularly with a real-world application example in the introduction, to help illustrate the relevance and importance of the approach. Additionally, the authors could provide more discussion on the relationship between RKM and other robust clustering algorithms, such as trimmed k-means, and how RKM compares to these algorithms in terms of robustness and consistency.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of robust clustering, and its results have important implications for the development of robust and efficient clustering algorithms. The paper's clarity, organization, and thorough analysis make it a strong candidate for publication.
