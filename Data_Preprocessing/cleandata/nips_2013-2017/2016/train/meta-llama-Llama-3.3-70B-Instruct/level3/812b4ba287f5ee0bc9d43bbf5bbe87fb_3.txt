This paper proposes a novel approach to inference in discrete probabilistic models by exploiting the submodularity of a specific class of models, referred to as cooperative graphical models. The authors develop a convex variational inference framework that optimizes rigorous bounds on the partition function, leveraging ideas from classical variational inference in graphical models. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise overview of the related work, notation, and background.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a new and interesting class of models that capture variable interactions more expressively than existing models.
* The development of a convex variational inference framework that optimizes rigorous bounds on the partition function.
* The use of submodularity to derive efficient inference techniques, which is a novel and interesting approach.
* The experimental evaluation of the proposed methods on synthetic and real-world examples, which demonstrates their scalability, efficacy, and quality.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The assumption of submodularity of the function f, which may not always hold in practice.
* The use of approximations and relaxations, which may lead to suboptimal results in some cases.
* The lack of a direct comparison with existing state-of-the-art methods for inference in discrete probabilistic models.

Arguments con acceptance:
* The assumption of submodularity of the function f may not always hold in practice.
* The use of approximations and relaxations may lead to suboptimal results in some cases.
* The lack of a direct comparison with existing state-of-the-art methods for inference in discrete probabilistic models may make it difficult to assess the significance of the proposed approach.
Overall, I believe that the paper is a good scientific contribution to the field, and I would recommend acceptance. However, I would like to see the authors address the weaknesses mentioned above, particularly the assumption of submodularity and the lack of a direct comparison with existing state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, the authors may want to consider providing more details on the experimental evaluation, such as the specific datasets used and the metrics employed to evaluate the performance of the proposed methods.
