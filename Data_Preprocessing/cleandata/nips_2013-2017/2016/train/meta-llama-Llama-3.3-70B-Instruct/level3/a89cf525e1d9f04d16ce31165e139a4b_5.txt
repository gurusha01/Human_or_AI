This paper proposes a novel approach to the design of revenue-maximizing combinatorial auctions, a fundamental problem in computational economics. The authors provide the first sample complexity analysis for the standard hierarchy of deterministic combinatorial auction classes used in automated mechanism design. The paper's main contribution is the derivation of tight sample complexity bounds for various auction classes, including Affine Maximizer Auctions (AMAs), Virtual Valuation Combinatorial Auctions (VVCAs), Î»-auctions, Mixed Bundling Auctions (MBAs), and Mixed Bundling Auctions with Reserve Prices (MBARPs).
The paper's strengths include its thorough analysis of the sample complexity of various auction classes, its use of learning theory tools such as Rademacher complexity and pseudo-dimension, and its provision of tight bounds for the sample complexity of uniform convergence over the auction classes. The authors also demonstrate the applicability of their results to any algorithm that determines the optimal auction over a sample, making their work relevant to automated mechanism design.
However, the paper could be improved in several ways. Firstly, the authors assume that the bidders' valuations are drawn from an underlying distribution, which may not always be the case in practice. It would be interesting to see how the results generalize to more realistic settings. Secondly, the paper focuses on deterministic combinatorial auctions, and it would be useful to explore the sample complexity of randomized auctions as well. Finally, the authors could provide more intuition on why the sample complexity bounds for the different auction classes vary, and how these bounds relate to the underlying structure of the auctions.
In terms of clarity, the paper is well-organized and easy to follow, with clear explanations of the auction classes and the learning theory tools used. However, some of the proofs and technical details are relegated to the supplementary materials, which may make it difficult for non-experts to fully appreciate the results.
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of computational economics and mechanism design, and its results have important implications for the design of revenue-maximizing combinatorial auctions. The authors' use of learning theory tools and their derivation of tight sample complexity bounds make the paper a valuable addition to the literature.
