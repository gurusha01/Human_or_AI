This paper proposes a novel approach to reduce memory consumption of the backpropagation through time (BPTT) algorithm when training recurrent neural networks (RNNs). The authors introduce a dynamic programming approach to balance the trade-off between caching of intermediate results and recomputation, allowing the algorithm to fit within almost any user-set memory budget while minimizing computational cost.
The paper is well-written and clearly explains the proposed approach, including the mathematical formulations and algorithms. The authors also provide a thorough analysis of the computational cost and memory usage of their approach, comparing it to existing methods such as Chen's √t algorithm.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to provide a fine-grained control over memory usage, allowing the algorithm to adapt to different memory budgets and sequence lengths. The authors also demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through numerical experiments, showing that it can save significant amounts of memory while maintaining computational performance.
However, there are some areas that require clarification and further investigation. For example, the authors mention that their approach is "largely architecture agnostic," but it would be helpful to see more experiments on different RNN architectures to confirm this claim. Additionally, the authors compare their approach to Chen's √t algorithm, but it would be interesting to see comparisons with other memory-saving strategies, such as the key-value memory approach proposed by Facebook.
Furthermore, the paper could benefit from more discussion on the biological plausibility of the proposed approach and its potential limitations. For instance, the authors assume that the memory budget is known in advance, but in practice, this may not always be the case. The authors also mention that their approach can be used for sequences of length up to 1000, but it would be helpful to see more experiments on longer sequences to demonstrate the scalability of their approach.
In terms of originality, the paper proposes a novel approach to reducing memory consumption in RNNs, which is a significant contribution to the field. The authors also provide a thorough analysis of the computational cost and memory usage of their approach, which is a valuable addition to the existing literature.
Overall, this paper is well-written and proposes a novel approach to reducing memory consumption in RNNs. While there are some areas that require clarification and further investigation, the paper is a significant contribution to the field and has the potential to impact the development of more efficient RNN training algorithms.
