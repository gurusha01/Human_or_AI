This paper proposes a novel approach to unsupervised risk estimation, which is the problem of estimating a model's test error from unlabeled data. The authors assume that the data has a 3-view structure, where each view is conditionally independent of the others given the label. This assumption allows them to derive a set of moment equations that can be used to estimate the risk.
The paper's main contribution is a theorem that shows how to estimate the risk using these moment equations. The theorem provides a bound on the number of samples required to estimate the risk to a certain accuracy, which depends on the number of classes, the dimension of the parameter space, and other problem-specific quantities.
The authors also provide several extensions to their basic framework, including an extension to conditional random fields and an extension to exponential losses. They also show how to use their risk estimation procedure to perform unsupervised learning, given a seed model that can distinguish between classes in expectation.
The paper is well-written and clearly explains the technical details of the approach. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the theoretical properties of their method and demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments on a modified version of the MNIST dataset.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to handle mis-specified models and zero train-test overlap, which is a common problem in domain adaptation and semi-supervised learning. The authors' approach is also able to provide a contract that guarantees the test error is close to the estimated test error, which is an important property for building reliable machine learning systems.
However, the paper also has some limitations. The 3-view assumption is quite restrictive and may not hold in many real-world applications. The authors acknowledge this limitation and suggest that future work could explore ways to relax this assumption.
Overall, I would rate this paper as a strong accept. The paper makes a significant contribution to the field of unsupervised risk estimation and provides a thorough analysis of the theoretical properties of the approach. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the method, and the paper is well-written and easy to follow.
