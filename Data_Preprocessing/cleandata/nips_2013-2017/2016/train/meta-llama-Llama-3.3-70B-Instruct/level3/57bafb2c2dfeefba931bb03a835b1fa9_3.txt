This paper proposes an extension of the stochastic block model to heterogeneous communities with varying sizes and connectivity, developing recovery conditions for convex relaxation and maximum likelihood estimates. The results are interesting, but the paper lacks explanation for key conditions in the main theorems, such as Theorem 1, and fails to discuss the gap between upper and lower bounds.
The paper would benefit from numerical experiments to illustrate the practical relevance of the theoretical predictions, particularly for convex relaxation approaches. Additionally, clarification is needed on several points, including the notion of "relative density", the interpretation of sufficient recovery conditions, and the statistical loss due to modifying the maximum likelihood estimate.
The paper also raises questions about the tightness of the lower bounds in Theorem 4 and the possibility of obtaining tight pre-constants. Furthermore, comments on the practical relevance of the theoretical predictions would be helpful. Some minor errors, such as unclear expressions, were noted and rephrasing is suggested for better readability.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, but the claims could be better supported by theoretical analysis or experimental results. The paper is well-organized, but some sections could be improved for clarity. The originality of the paper is high, as it proposes a novel approach to extending stochastic block models. However, the significance of the results could be better demonstrated with more numerical experiments and discussions on the practical implications.
The paper meets the criteria for a good scientific contribution, but could be improved with more attention to clarity, numerical experiments, and discussion of practical relevance. A list of arguments pro and con acceptance could include:
Pros:
- Novel approach to extending stochastic block models
- Technically sound and well-organized
- High originality
Cons:
- Lack of explanation for key conditions in main theorems
- No discussion of gap between upper and lower bounds
- Need for numerical experiments to demonstrate practical relevance
- Minor errors and unclear expressions
Overall, the paper has the potential to be a good scientific contribution, but requires revisions to address the noted weaknesses and improve clarity and practical relevance.
