This paper presents a novel approach to learning deep feature embeddings by introducing a Position-Dependent Deep Metric (PDDM) unit. The PDDM unit learns a local-adaptive similarity metric that can be used to select high-quality hard samples in a local neighborhood, guiding the deep embedding learning in an online and robust manner. The authors propose a double-header hinge loss function that jointly optimizes the similarity metric and feature embedding, providing effective supervision in two domains.
The paper is well-written, and the results are impressive, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed method in challenging image retrieval tasks and its potential in generalizing to new classes in large and open set scenarios. The use of a local-adaptive similarity metric is a key innovation, allowing the method to cope with complex feature variations and heterogeneous feature distributions.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The introduction of a novel PDDM unit that learns a local-adaptive similarity metric, which is a significant improvement over traditional global metrics.
* The proposal of a double-header hinge loss function that jointly optimizes the similarity metric and feature embedding, providing effective supervision in two domains.
* The demonstration of the method's efficacy in challenging image retrieval tasks and its potential in generalizing to new classes in large and open set scenarios.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The complexity of the proposed method, which may make it difficult to implement and optimize in practice.
* The reliance on a large number of hyperparameters, which may require significant tuning to achieve optimal results.
* The lack of comparison with other state-of-the-art methods in certain experiments, which may make it difficult to fully assess the method's performance.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of deep learning and computer vision, and the proposed method has the potential to be widely adopted in various applications. However, further research is needed to fully explore the method's capabilities and limitations.
