This paper explores the use of information theory to analyze the fundamental performance limits of crowdsourcing systems. The authors model crowdsourcing as a human-in-the-loop computation problem, where a taskmaster breaks down a project into small tasks and assigns them to workers with imperfect skill levels. The paper investigates the impact of varying the strength of entropy regularization on the crowdsourcing objective, with interesting results shown in the analysis of k-ary incidence coding.
The paper is technically sound, with well-supported claims and a clear explanation of the theoretical framework. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the crowdsourcing problem, including the modeling of workers as noisy channels and the use of joint source-channel coding to optimize the query and inference schemes. The paper also presents numerical results, which provide a useful benchmark for evaluating the performance of different coding schemes.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to provide a unified framework for analyzing crowdsourcing systems, which can be applied to a variety of tasks and scenarios. The authors also raise important questions about the design of optimized crowdsourcing systems, including the trade-offs between cost, reliability, and worker skill levels.
However, there are some limitations to the paper. One of the main limitations is the assumption that the workers' skill levels are unknown or perfectly known, which may not always be the case in practice. Additionally, the paper focuses primarily on the theoretical analysis of crowdsourcing systems, without providing much empirical evidence to support the claims.
In terms of originality, the paper presents a novel approach to analyzing crowdsourcing systems, which combines information theory and coding theory to provide a unified framework for optimizing crowdsourcing systems. The paper also introduces a new coding scheme, k-ary incidence coding, which provides an error correction capability for crowdsourcing systems.
The significance of the paper lies in its ability to provide a theoretical foundation for understanding the fundamental limits of crowdsourcing systems. The paper's results have important implications for the design of optimized crowdsourcing systems, including the selection of workers, the assignment of tasks, and the pricing of queries.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, as it presents a well-written and technically sound analysis of crowdsourcing systems, with important implications for the design of optimized systems. However, I would suggest that the authors provide more empirical evidence to support their claims and consider more realistic assumptions about worker skill levels.
