This paper proposes a novel deep learning architecture that combines ideas from deep adaptation networks, residual networks, and entropy minimization to achieve unsupervised adaptation. The proposed architecture, LADDER, jointly learns the mapping and linear classifiers in an efficient manner, resulting in a principled approach that outperforms state-of-the-art methods.
The paper is well-written and easy to read, providing a clear explanation of the proposed method and its relation to previous work. The authors demonstrate a good understanding of the existing literature and provide a thorough analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of their approach.
One of the key strengths of the paper is the use of residual learning with entropy minimization, which is a new and effective approach. However, it is not entirely clear whether this is a brand new model or an incremental work over existing methods. The authors could provide more discussion on the novelty of their approach and how it differs from previous work.
The experimental results show improvements over state-of-the-art methods, but there are some discrepancies in the results that need to be addressed. For example, the accuracy values for the same method are different in different tables. The authors should clarify these discrepancies and provide a more detailed analysis of the results.
Another weakness of the paper is the lack of a clear explanation of the difference between the use of MK-MMD in the proposed method and in reference 5. The authors should provide more discussion on why their approach is better and how it improves upon previous work.
Overall, the paper proposes a novel and effective approach to unsupervised adaptation, but there are some areas that need improvement. With some revisions to address the weaknesses mentioned above, this paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field.
