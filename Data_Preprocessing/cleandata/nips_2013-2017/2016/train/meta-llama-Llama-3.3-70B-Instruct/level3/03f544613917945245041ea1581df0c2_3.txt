This paper proposes a novel framework for semi-supervised active clustering (SSAC) using same-cluster queries, which can be viewed as a natural way for a clustering mechanism to gain domain knowledge. The authors introduce a notion of clusterability, called the γ-margin property, and provide an efficient algorithm for clustering with queries that succeeds under the assumption that the input satisfies the γ-margin condition for γ > 1. The algorithm makes O(k log n + k^2 log k) same-cluster queries to the oracle and runs in O(kn log n) time.
The paper also provides a lower bound on the number of queries needed to make NP-hard problems feasibly solvable, showing that at least Ω(log k + log n) queries are needed. The authors demonstrate that access to a limited number of query answers allows efficient successful clustering under conditions that render the problem NP-hard without the help of such a query mechanism.
The strengths of the paper include its novelty, clarity, and significance. The proposed framework and algorithm are well-motivated and easy to understand, and the theoretical analysis is rigorous and well-presented. The paper also raises interesting questions about the applicability of the technique to other clustering methods and the potential for extensions to more complex query types.
However, there are some weaknesses and potential areas for improvement. The paper assumes that the oracle conforms to a center-based clustering with a notion of margin, which may not always be the case in practice. Additionally, the algorithm's performance may degrade if the oracle's answers are noisy or inconsistent. The paper could also benefit from more experimental evaluations to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in practice.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication, as it presents a significant contribution to the field of clustering and semi-supervised learning. The paper is well-written, and the authors have made a clear and compelling case for the importance and novelty of their work.
