This paper presents a novel approach to learning deep feature embeddings by introducing a Position-Dependent Deep Metric (PDDM) unit. The PDDM unit learns a local-adaptive similarity metric that can be used to select high-quality hard samples in a local neighborhood, guiding the deep embedding learning in an online and robust manner. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on two challenging image retrieval datasets, CUB-200-2011 and CARS196, and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art deep embedding methods.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their approach. The introduction provides a good overview of the problem and the motivation behind the proposed approach. The related work section is comprehensive and provides a good context for the proposed approach. The methodology section is well-structured, and the authors provide a detailed explanation of the PDDM unit and the double-header hinge loss function.
The experimental results are impressive, and the authors demonstrate the efficacy of their approach on image retrieval tasks. The results show that the proposed approach achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, including those that use hand-crafted features and distance metrics. The authors also demonstrate the generalization ability of their approach on transfer learning and zero-shot learning tasks.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposed PDDM unit is a novel and effective approach to learning local-adaptive similarity metrics.
* The double-header hinge loss function is well-designed and effective in optimizing the similarity metric and feature embedding.
* The experimental results are impressive and demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach on image retrieval tasks.
* The approach has the potential to generalize to other tasks, such as transfer learning and zero-shot learning.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the PDDM unit and its properties.
* The authors could provide more insights into the choice of hyperparameters and their impact on the performance of the approach.
* The paper could benefit from a more comprehensive comparison with other state-of-the-art methods, including those that use different distance metrics and loss functions.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the proposed approach is novel and effective. The experimental results are impressive, and the approach has the potential to generalize to other tasks. I would recommend accepting this paper for publication.
