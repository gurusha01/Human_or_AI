This paper explores the problem of fast learning rates for heavy-tailed losses in the context of empirical risk minimization. The authors introduce two new conditions, the multi-scale Bernstein's condition and the integrability of the envelope function, which enable the derivation of fast learning rates for unbounded losses. The paper provides a thorough analysis of the conditions and their implications, and demonstrates the applicability of the results to the problem of k-means clustering with heavy-tailed source distributions.
The paper is well-written and clearly organized, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments. The introduction provides a clear motivation for the problem and a concise overview of the main contributions. The technical sections are detailed and well-structured, with each section building on the previous one to provide a comprehensive analysis of the problem.
The authors' use of the multi-scale Bernstein's condition is a key innovation of the paper, as it allows for the derivation of fast learning rates for unbounded losses. The condition is carefully motivated and its implications are thoroughly explored. The authors also provide a clear path to verify the condition in practice, which makes the result more applicable to real-world problems.
The application of the results to k-means clustering with heavy-tailed source distributions is a significant contribution of the paper. The authors demonstrate that the convergence rate of k-means clustering can be arbitrarily close to O(1/n) under proper settings, which is a significant improvement over previous results.
The paper also provides a thorough discussion of related work and compares the results to existing literature. The authors highlight the strengths and weaknesses of their approach and provide a clear direction for future research.
Overall, the paper is a significant contribution to the field of machine learning and provides a thorough analysis of the problem of fast learning rates for heavy-tailed losses. The results are well-motivated, carefully derived, and thoroughly analyzed, making the paper a valuable resource for researchers in the field.
