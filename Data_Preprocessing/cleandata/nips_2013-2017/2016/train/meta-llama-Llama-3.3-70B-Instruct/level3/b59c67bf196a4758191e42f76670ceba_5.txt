This paper proposes a new deep model for unsupervised domain adaptation, replacing the softmax layer and loss function with a domain adaptive objective. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on digit and office benchmark datasets. However, the convergence, stability, and reproducibility of the proposed method are questionable, with concerns about the alternating solver's ability to consistently produce the same results.
The paper's related work section is insufficient, with outdated references and a lack of discussion on compared methods. The writing quality is also criticized, particularly in the introduction and related work sections, with broken sentences and excessive use of references disrupting the flow.
Regarding the technical aspects, the convexity of equation (3) is an issue when feature functions are convex, specifically with the feature function being in the minus part of the equation. The paper's analysis of the robustness and consistency properties of the proposed method is thorough, but the results are disappointing, showing that the method breaks down with just two outliers in the dataset.
The paper's strengths include its ability to ignore samples with distance from their closest center larger than a certain threshold, and its consistency properties, which are similar to those of quadratic k-means. The method is also computationally simple, making it a "computationally cheap" candidate for robust nearest neighbor clustering.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper proposes a new and interesting approach to unsupervised domain adaptation
* The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets
* The analysis of the robustness and consistency properties is thorough and well-done
Arguments against acceptance:
* The convergence, stability, and reproducibility of the proposed method are questionable
* The related work section is insufficient and outdated
* The writing quality is poor, with broken sentences and excessive use of references
* The method breaks down with just two outliers in the dataset, which is a significant limitation.
Overall, while the paper has some strengths, its limitations and weaknesses outweigh its contributions, making it a borderline paper. With significant revisions to address the concerns mentioned above, the paper could be considered for acceptance. 
Quality: 6
The paper is technically sound, but the analysis of the robustness and consistency properties is limited, and the results are disappointing. The method is also not well-motivated, and the related work section is insufficient.
Clarity: 5
The writing quality is poor, with broken sentences and excessive use of references disrupting the flow. The paper could benefit from a thorough editing to improve its clarity and readability.
Originality: 7
The paper proposes a new and interesting approach to unsupervised domain adaptation, which is a significant contribution to the field.
Significance: 6
The paper's results are significant, but the method's limitations and weaknesses reduce its impact. The paper could have a greater impact if the authors addressed the concerns mentioned above and provided more convincing results.
