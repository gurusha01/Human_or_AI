This paper introduces a novel feature selection approach called CMICOT, which is based on the sequential forward selection (SFS) strategy and leverages conditional mutual information to identify high-order feature interactions. The authors propose a two-stage greedy search for sub-optimal complementary and opposing teams, which enables the method to efficiently approximate the optimal score. Additionally, they introduce a binary representation technique to mitigate the sample complexity issue associated with high-dimensional mutual information calculations.
The paper is well-structured, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the proposed method, including its theoretical foundations and algorithmic details. The experimental evaluation is comprehensive, with comparisons to various state-of-the-art feature selection methods on multiple benchmark datasets. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of CMICOT in identifying high-order feature interactions and its superiority over other methods in terms of classification performance.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel feature selection approach that can handle high-order feature interactions, which is a challenging problem in feature selection.
* The introduction of a two-stage greedy search algorithm that enables efficient approximation of the optimal score.
* The use of binary representation to mitigate the sample complexity issue, which is a common problem in mutual information-based feature selection methods.
* The comprehensive experimental evaluation, which demonstrates the effectiveness of CMICOT on various benchmark datasets.
However, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement:
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the time complexity of the proposed algorithm, particularly in comparison to other feature selection methods.
* The authors could provide more insights into the choice of the team size parameter t, which seems to be a critical hyperparameter in the method.
* Some of the figures and tables could be improved for better readability and clarity.
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the limitations of the proposed method and potential avenues for future research.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of feature selection, and the proposed method has the potential to be useful in a wide range of applications. With some revisions to address the weaknesses and areas for improvement, the paper could be even stronger.
