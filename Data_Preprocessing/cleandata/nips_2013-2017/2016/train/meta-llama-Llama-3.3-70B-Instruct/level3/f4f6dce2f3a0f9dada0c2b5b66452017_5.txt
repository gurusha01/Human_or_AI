This paper proposes a novel feature selection approach, CMICOT, which is an extension of filter methods with sequential forward selection (SFS) based on conditional mutual information (MI). The key contribution of the paper is the introduction of a saddle point (max-min) optimization problem to build a scoring function that can identify joint interactions between multiple features. The authors address two practical issues with the proposed score: computational complexity and sample complexity, by introducing a two-stage greedy search and binary representatives of features.
The paper is well-structured, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the proposed method and its components. The experimental evaluation is extensive, and the results show that CMICOT outperforms other state-of-the-art feature selection methods, including interaction-aware filters, on several benchmark datasets.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel feature selection approach that can identify high-order feature interactions, which is a challenging task in feature selection.
* The introduction of a two-stage greedy search and binary representatives of features, which makes the proposed method efficient and effective in practice.
* The extensive experimental evaluation, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method on several benchmark datasets.
However, there are some weaknesses and concerns:
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion on the theoretical justification of the proposed method, particularly the saddle point optimization problem and the use of binary representatives.
* The authors could provide more insights into the choice of the team size parameter t and its impact on the performance of the proposed method.
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with other feature selection methods, including wrapper and embedded methods, to demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed approach.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the proposed method shows promising results. However, some additional discussions and analyses are needed to further strengthen the paper.
