This paper presents a novel approach to estimating a model's test error from unlabeled data, leveraging the method of moments and a 3-views assumption. The authors demonstrate that their approach can be applied to a wide range of losses, including the log and exponential loss, and can be extended to structured output settings such as conditional random fields.
The paper is well-written, with solid proofs and a clear explanation of the technical machinery behind the method of moments. The authors also provide a detailed discussion of the related work and the significance of their contributions.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to estimate the risk without making any assumptions about the optimal predictor or the distribution of the data. This makes the approach particularly useful in situations where the data distribution is unknown or complex.
However, the 3-views assumption is a concern, as it may be unrealistic for mono-view learning and requires further discussion on relaxation or handling cases where it doesn't hold. The assumption is stronger than co-training's assumption, and it is unclear how well the approach will perform in practice when this assumption is violated.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, and originality. The authors provide a clear and concise summary of the main ideas and relate them to previous work at NIPS and elsewhere. The paper is well-organized, and the authors provide enough information for the expert reader to reproduce the results.
The significance of the paper is also high, as it addresses a difficult problem in machine learning and provides a novel solution that can be applied to a wide range of settings. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through experiments on a modified version of the MNIST dataset.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, but with the suggestion that the authors provide further discussion on the limitations of the 3-views assumption and potential ways to relax or handle cases where it doesn't hold.
