This paper explores the tractability of arithmetic circuits, specifically the Probabilistic Sentential Decision Diagram (PSDD), in representing probability distributions and supporting polytime operations. The authors demonstrate that PSDDs admit a polytime multiplication operator, making them suitable for a broader class of applications, while they do not support a polytime summing-out operation. The paper provides a clear and well-organized presentation of the main ideas, relating them to previous work in the field.
The strengths of the paper include its technical soundness, clarity, and significance. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the properties of PSDDs, including their ability to represent probability distributions and support polytime multiplication. The paper also presents an application of PSDD multiplication to compiling probabilistic graphical models, demonstrating its effectiveness in practice. The experimental results show that PSDDs can be more efficient than other arithmetic circuit representations, such as decomposable and deterministic ACs.
The weaknesses of the paper are minor. One potential issue is the need to correct citations on several lines, as noted by the reviewer. Additionally, some readers may find the notation and terminology used in the paper to be dense and require careful attention.
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of probabilistic graphical models and arithmetic circuits. The results presented in the paper have the potential to impact several research communities, including those working on probabilistic reasoning, learning, and inference. The paper is well-written, technically impressive, and provides a clear and concise presentation of the main ideas.
