This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of computational economics, specifically in the area of mechanism design for combinatorial auctions. The authors provide a comprehensive analysis of the sample complexity of uniform convergence for various classes of deterministic combinatorial auctions, including affine maximizer auctions, virtual valuation combinatorial auctions, and mixed bundling auctions.
The paper's main strength lies in its ability to bridge the gap between learning theory and mechanism design, providing a deep understanding of the structure of revenue function classes and their implications on sample complexity. The authors' use of Rademacher complexity and pseudo-dimension to derive sample complexity bounds is a notable aspect of the paper, as it allows for a more nuanced understanding of the relationships between auction parameters and revenue.
The results presented in the paper are impressive, with tight sample complexity bounds provided for various auction classes. The authors' finding that mixed bundling auctions have a pseudo-dimension of 2 is particularly noteworthy, as it suggests that these auctions can be learned with a relatively small number of samples. The extension of these results to mixed bundling auctions with reserve prices is also a significant contribution.
One potential weakness of the paper is the assumption of a fixed distribution over bidders' valuations. In practice, this distribution may be unknown or changing over time, which could impact the accuracy of the sample complexity bounds. However, the authors do provide some discussion of how their results could be extended to more general settings.
Overall, the paper is well-written, clearly organized, and provides a significant contribution to the field of mechanism design. The authors' use of learning theory tools to analyze the sample complexity of combinatorial auctions is a novel and important approach, and their results have the potential to inform the design of more efficient and effective auctions in practice.
