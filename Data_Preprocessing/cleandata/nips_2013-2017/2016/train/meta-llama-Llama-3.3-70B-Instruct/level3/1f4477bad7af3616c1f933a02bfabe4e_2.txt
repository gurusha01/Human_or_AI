This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm for estimating parameters of Gaussian mixture models. The authors provide a global analysis of EM, characterizing the stationary points and dynamics of the algorithm in the large sample limit. They also establish statistical consistency of the EM algorithm for specific models, including mixtures of two Gaussians.
The paper's main contributions include a new characterization of the stationary points and dynamics of EM, as well as a proof of convergence for the sequence of iterates for Population EM. The authors also show that the fixed points of Sample-based EM converge to the fixed points of Population EM, and provide a connection between the fixed points of Population EM and the stationary points of the expected log-likelihood.
The paper is well-written and clearly organized, with a thorough introduction to the background and related work. The authors provide a detailed analysis of the EM algorithm, including proofs of the main theorems and corollaries. The paper also includes a discussion of the implications of the results and potential directions for future work.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to provide a global analysis of EM, which is a significant improvement over previous work that only established local convergence results. The authors also provide a clear and concise explanation of the technical details, making the paper accessible to a wide range of readers.
However, there are some limitations to the paper. The analysis is restricted to specific models, including mixtures of two Gaussians, and it is not clear how the results generalize to more complex models. Additionally, the paper assumes a large sample limit, which may not be realistic in many practical applications.
