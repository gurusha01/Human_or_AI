This paper introduces a novel feature selection approach, CMICOT, which is an evolution of filter methods with sequential forward selection (SFS) based on conditional mutual information (MI). The method addresses the limitation of existing MI-based SFS techniques, which can only account for interactions between up to three features. CMICOT fills this gap by introducing a saddle point (max-min) optimization problem to build a scoring function that can identify joint interactions between multiple features.
The paper is well-structured, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the proposed method, including the optimization problem, the greedy approximation, and the binary representation technique. The experimental evaluation is thorough, with comparisons to state-of-the-art filters and classification models on 10 publicly available benchmark datasets.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposed method, CMICOT, is a significant improvement over existing MI-based SFS techniques, as it can identify high-order feature interactions.
* The authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of the method, including the optimization problem and the greedy approximation.
* The experimental evaluation is thorough and well-designed, with comparisons to state-of-the-art filters and classification models.
However, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement:
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the related work, including a comparison of the proposed method with other feature selection techniques.
* Some of the notation and terminology used in the paper may be unfamiliar to non-experts, and a more detailed explanation or definition would be helpful.
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed method and its scalability to large datasets.
* Some of the figures and tables could be improved for better clarity and readability.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of feature selection, and the proposed method, CMICOT, has the potential to be a valuable tool for identifying high-order feature interactions. With some revisions to address the weaknesses and areas for improvement, the paper could be even stronger.
