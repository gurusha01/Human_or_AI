This paper proposes a robust k-means clustering algorithm, which is a variation of the classical quadratic k-means. The authors provide a theoretical analysis of the robustness and consistency properties of this algorithm, known as robust k-means (RKM). The paper demonstrates that RKM can be used to detect outliers and robustly cluster data, even in the presence of contamination.
The strengths of this paper include its thorough analysis of the optimality conditions for RKM, as well as its examination of the breakdown point and consistency properties of the algorithm. The authors also provide a detailed comparison with trimmed k-means, another robust clustering algorithm, and show that RKM performs similarly in practice.
However, there are some weaknesses to the paper. The analysis of the breakdown point is limited to a specific type of contamination, and it is not clear how the algorithm would perform under other types of contamination. Additionally, the authors assume that the data is "well-structured", which may not always be the case in practice.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper provides a thorough analysis of the robustness and consistency properties of RKM.
* The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of RKM in detecting outliers and robustly clustering data.
* The comparison with trimmed k-means is useful and provides insight into the performance of RKM in practice.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The analysis of the breakdown point is limited to a specific type of contamination.
* The authors assume that the data is "well-structured", which may not always be the case in practice.
* The paper could benefit from more extensive experimental evaluation, including comparisons with other robust clustering algorithms.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, as it provides a valuable contribution to the field of robust clustering. However, the authors should be encouraged to address the limitations of their analysis and provide more extensive experimental evaluation in future work.
Quality: 8/10
The paper is well-written and provides a clear analysis of the robustness and consistency properties of RKM. However, the analysis of the breakdown point is limited, and the authors could provide more extensive experimental evaluation.
Clarity: 9/10
The paper is well-organized and easy to follow. The authors provide clear explanations of the algorithm and its properties.
Originality: 8/10
The paper proposes a new robust clustering algorithm and provides a thorough analysis of its properties. However, the idea of using a proximal map to detect outliers is not entirely new.
Significance: 8/10
The paper provides a valuable contribution to the field of robust clustering, and the results are likely to be of interest to researchers and practitioners in the field. However, the limitations of the analysis and the lack of extensive experimental evaluation reduce the significance of the paper.
