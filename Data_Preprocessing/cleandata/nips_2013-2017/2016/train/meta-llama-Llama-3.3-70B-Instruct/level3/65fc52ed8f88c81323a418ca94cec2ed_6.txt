This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) by introducing full-capacity unitary RNNs (uRNNs) that optimize their recurrence matrix over all unitary matrices. The authors address the limitations of previous unitary parameterizations, which restricted the capacity of the unitary recurrence matrix. The proposed approach allows for direct optimization of a full-capacity unitary matrix, leading to improved performance on various tasks, including system identification, long-term memorization, speech prediction, and image classification.
The paper is well-structured, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the background and motivation of the work. The theoretical argument presented in Section 3 is sound and provides a useful framework for understanding the limitations of restricted-capacity unitary matrices. The experimental results in Sections 5.1-5.3 demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed full-capacity uRNNs, which outperform restricted-capacity uRNNs and LSTMs on several tasks.
The strengths of the paper include:
* A clear and well-motivated introduction to the problem of vanishing and exploding gradients in RNNs
* A sound theoretical argument for the limitations of restricted-capacity unitary matrices
* Effective experimental demonstrations of the proposed full-capacity uRNNs on various tasks
* A well-organized and easy-to-follow presentation
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The presentation could be improved by providing more intuitive explanations of the mathematical concepts, such as the Stiefel manifold and the Cayley transformation
* The authors could provide more discussion on the potential trade-offs between hidden state dimension and capacity of unitary parameterizations
* Some of the experimental results, such as the pixel-by-pixel MNIST task, could be further analyzed to provide more insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed approach
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of RNNs and provides a useful framework for understanding the limitations of restricted-capacity unitary matrices. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed full-capacity uRNNs, and the paper is well-organized and easy to follow.
