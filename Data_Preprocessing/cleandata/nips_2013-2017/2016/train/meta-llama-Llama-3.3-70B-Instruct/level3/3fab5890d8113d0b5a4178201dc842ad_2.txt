This paper proposes a novel neural network architecture called Sparse Access Memory (SAM), which addresses the scalability issues of traditional memory-augmented neural networks. The authors introduce a sparse read and write scheme that enables efficient training with large memories, achieving significant speedups and memory reductions. The paper presents a thorough evaluation of SAM on various tasks, including synthetic and real-world datasets, and demonstrates its ability to learn with comparable efficiency to dense models.
The main strengths of the paper are:
* The introduction of a novel sparse access memory scheme that allows for efficient training with large memories.
* The demonstration of significant speedups and memory reductions compared to traditional memory-augmented neural networks.
* The thorough evaluation of SAM on various tasks, including synthetic and real-world datasets.
However, the paper also has some weaknesses:
* The technical strength of the paper is limited, as the concepts of efficient backpropagation and approximation of nearest neighbors using sparse access memory are relatively straightforward.
* The paper lacks a clear comparison to other state-of-the-art models, making it difficult to assess the significance of the results.
* The evaluation of SAM on real-world datasets is limited to a single task, and more extensive evaluations are needed to demonstrate its generalizability.
Overall, while the paper presents an interesting and novel approach to scalable memory architectures, its technical shortcomings and limited evaluation make it difficult to recommend for acceptance. The authors should consider addressing these limitations in future work, including a more thorough comparison to other state-of-the-art models and a more extensive evaluation on real-world datasets.
