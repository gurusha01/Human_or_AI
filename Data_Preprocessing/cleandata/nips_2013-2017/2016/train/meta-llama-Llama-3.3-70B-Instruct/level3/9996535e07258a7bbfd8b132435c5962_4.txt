This paper proposes a novel framework for semi-supervised active clustering (SSAC) that leverages same-cluster queries to gain domain knowledge and improve clustering performance. The authors introduce a notion of clusterability, called the γ-margin property, which characterizes the separability of clusters. They provide an efficient algorithm for clustering with queries, which succeeds under the assumption that the input satisfies the γ-margin condition for γ > 1. The algorithm makes O(k log n + k^2 log k) same-cluster queries to the oracle and runs in O(kn log n) time.
The paper also presents a lower bound on the number of queries needed to overcome the NP-hardness of k-means clustering, showing that at least Ω(log k + log n) queries are required. The authors demonstrate that their algorithm can efficiently solve k-means clustering problems that are NP-hard without the help of queries, under certain conditions on the margin parameter.
The strengths of this paper include:
* The introduction of a novel framework for SSAC that combines the benefits of interactive clustering and semi-supervised learning.
* The development of an efficient algorithm for clustering with queries, which achieves good performance under certain conditions on the margin parameter.
* The provision of a lower bound on the number of queries needed to overcome the NP-hardness of k-means clustering.
However, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement:
* The paper assumes that the oracle conforms to a center-based clustering with a notion of margin, which may not always be the case in practice.
* The algorithm's performance may degrade if the oracle's answers are noisy or inconsistent.
* The paper could benefit from more extensive experimental evaluations to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and algorithm in real-world scenarios.
Overall, this paper presents a significant contribution to the field of clustering and semi-supervised learning, and its results have important implications for the development of more efficient and effective clustering algorithms.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper introduces a novel and interesting framework for SSAC that addresses the challenges of clustering and semi-supervised learning.
* The algorithm proposed in the paper achieves good performance under certain conditions on the margin parameter, and the lower bound provided helps to understand the limitations of the approach.
* The paper is well-written and clearly presents the technical contributions and results.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The paper's assumptions about the oracle and the margin parameter may not always hold in practice, which could limit the applicability of the proposed framework and algorithm.
* The experimental evaluations are limited, and more extensive experiments are needed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in real-world scenarios.
* The paper could benefit from more discussion and analysis of the implications of the results and the potential applications of the proposed framework and algorithm.
