This paper proposes a novel feature selection approach called CMICOT, which is based on the sequential forward selection (SFS) strategy and is able to identify high-order feature interactions. The authors introduce a new scoring function that takes into account the interactions between features and uses a two-stage greedy search to find the optimal complementary and opposing teams. The approach also utilizes binary representatives of features to mitigate the issue of high-dimensional mutual information calculations.
The paper is well-written and clearly explains the proposed approach. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the related work and highlight the limitations of existing feature selection methods. The experimental evaluation is extensive and demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach on various benchmark datasets.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel feature selection approach that can identify high-order feature interactions
* The use of a two-stage greedy search to find the optimal complementary and opposing teams
* The utilization of binary representatives of features to mitigate the issue of high-dimensional mutual information calculations
* The extensive experimental evaluation on various benchmark datasets
However, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement:
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed theoretical analysis of the proposed approach, including a proof of convergence and a discussion of the computational complexity
* The authors could provide more insight into the choice of the team size parameter t and its effect on the performance of the approach
* The experimental evaluation could be more comprehensive, including a comparison with other state-of-the-art feature selection methods and a discussion of the results in terms of statistical significance
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of feature selection and has the potential to be a valuable tool for identifying high-order feature interactions in various applications.
