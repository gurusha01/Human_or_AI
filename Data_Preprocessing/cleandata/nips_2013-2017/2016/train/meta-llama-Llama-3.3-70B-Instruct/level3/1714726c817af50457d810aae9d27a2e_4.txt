This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of machine learning, specifically in the context of learning with heavy-tailed losses. The authors introduce a new condition, the multi-scale Bernstein's condition, which enables the derivation of fast learning rates for unbounded losses. The paper provides a thorough analysis of the condition and its implications, including a clear path to verify the assumption in practice.
The paper is well-organized, and the authors provide a detailed introduction to the problem, including a review of previous work in the area. The mathematical framework is clearly presented, and the authors provide a comprehensive analysis of the multi-scale Bernstein's condition, including its relationship to the standard Bernstein's condition.
The paper's main contribution is the derivation of fast learning rates for heavy-tailed losses under the multi-scale Bernstein's condition. The authors provide a detailed proof of the main theorem, which shows that the learning rate can be arbitrarily close to O(n^{-1}) under certain conditions. The paper also provides a comparison to related work, including a discussion of the differences between the multi-scale Bernstein's condition and the standard Bernstein's condition.
The application of the results to k-means clustering with heavy-tailed source distributions is also noteworthy. The authors provide a detailed analysis of the problem and show that the convergence rate of k-means clustering can be arbitrarily close to O(1/n) under certain conditions.
