This paper presents a novel approach to improving the efficiency of the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) algorithm, a popular derivative-free optimization method. The authors propose replacing the traditional matrix square root update with a triangular Cholesky factorization, resulting in a significant reduction in computational complexity and memory requirements. The new algorithm, dubbed Cholesky-CMA-ES, is shown to achieve asymptotically optimal time complexity of O(Âµd2) for the covariance update and optimal memory complexity.
The paper is well-organized and easy to follow, with clear explanations of the theoretical background and the proposed modifications to the CMA-ES algorithm. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the properties of the update rule and demonstrate the effectiveness of the Cholesky-CMA-ES through extensive experiments on various benchmark functions. The results show that the Cholesky-CMA-ES requires the same number of function evaluations as the standard CMA-ES but significantly reduces the wall-clock time, especially for high-dimensional problems.
The strengths of the paper include its clear and concise presentation, thorough theoretical analysis, and comprehensive experimental evaluation. The authors also provide a detailed discussion of the advantages and limitations of their approach, including the potential risks of using low-dimensional approximations for very large problems.
However, there are some potential weaknesses and areas for improvement. One concern is the introduction of an error in the norm of the step-size adaptation due to the replacement of the matrix square root with the Cholesky factor. While the authors provide theoretical arguments for why this error is small and decreases over time, further analysis or experiments may be necessary to fully understand the impact of this approximation. Additionally, the authors could provide more discussion on the potential applications and implications of their work, particularly in the context of large-scale optimization problems.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of derivative-free optimization and demonstrates the potential of the Cholesky-CMA-ES algorithm for improving the efficiency of CMA-ES. The authors' thorough analysis and experimental evaluation provide strong evidence for the effectiveness of their approach, and their discussion of the advantages and limitations of their work provides a clear understanding of the potential implications and applications of their research.
