This paper proposes a novel approach to learning deep feature embeddings by introducing a Position-Dependent Deep Metric (PDDM) unit. The PDDM unit learns a local-adaptive similarity metric that can be used to select high-quality hard samples in a local neighborhood, which in turn guides the deep embedding learning. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on image retrieval tasks and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their approach. The technical quality of the paper is high, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of their method. The experiments are well-designed, and the results are impressive.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to address the limitations of existing deep embedding methods, which often rely on a global Euclidean distance metric. The PDDM unit provides a more flexible and adaptive way of measuring similarity, which is particularly useful in heterogeneous feature spaces. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the benefits of their approach, including its ability to improve convergence and generalization.
The paper also has some weaknesses. One of the limitations is that the PDDM unit requires a significant amount of computational resources, which may make it difficult to scale to large datasets. Additionally, the authors could provide more analysis on the sensitivity of their approach to hyperparameters and the choice of network architecture.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper. The authors provide a novel and effective approach to learning deep feature embeddings, and the paper is well-written and technically sound. The results are impressive, and the approach has the potential to be widely applicable in computer vision and other fields.
