This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of probabilistic graphical models, introducing a novel approach to compiling these models into arithmetic circuits using Probabilistic Sentential Decision Diagrams (PSDDs). The authors demonstrate that PSDDs support a polytime multiplication operator, making them suitable for a broader class of applications. The paper is well-structured, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the background and motivation for their work.
The strengths of the paper include the introduction of a new and efficient method for compiling probabilistic graphical models into PSDDs, which has the potential to improve the scalability of exact inference algorithms. The authors also provide a thorough analysis of the tractability of multiplication and summing-out operators for arithmetic circuits, which is a fundamental problem in the field. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, showing that PSDDs can be compiled more efficiently than other arithmetic circuits in many cases.
However, there are some weaknesses in the paper. The notation and terminology used in the paper may be unfamiliar to some readers, and the authors could have provided more explanations and examples to help clarify the concepts. Additionally, the paper could benefit from more discussion on the limitations and potential extensions of the proposed approach. The authors also mention that the summing-out operation is intractable for PSDDs, but they do not provide a detailed analysis of the implications of this result.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, originality, and significance. The paper is technically sound, and the authors provide a clear and well-organized presentation of their work. The approach is novel and has the potential to make a significant impact in the field. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide sufficient information for the reader to understand the results.
