This paper proposes a new algorithm for online pricing with strategic buyers, where each buyer has a window of time in which they would like to purchase an item. The algorithm achieves a regret bound of O(T2/3) with respect to the best fixed price in hindsight, and the authors also provide a matching lower bound of Ω(T2/3). The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with sound experimental results.
The strengths of the paper include the introduction of a new model of strategic buyers, which circumvents complicated dynamics between buyers by forcing the seller to post prices for the entire window of time in advance. The algorithm proposed is based on the EXP3 algorithm, which is a well-known algorithm for online learning. The authors also provide a thorough analysis of the algorithm, including a proof of the regret bound and a discussion of the lower bound.
One weakness of the paper is that it does not provide a clear discussion of the running time of the proposed algorithm, which is an important consideration in practice. The authors should provide numbers on the running time of the proposed algorithm and those of other algorithms, such as Boosting and SVMs, for comparison.
Another minor comment is that there are inconsistencies in notation, such as the use of ⟨ and ⟩ versus < and > for dot products, and the use of argmin versus argmax. These inconsistencies should be corrected to improve the clarity of the paper.
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of online pricing with strategic buyers, and the results are interesting and well-presented. The authors have done a good job of motivating the problem, proposing a new algorithm, and analyzing its performance.
