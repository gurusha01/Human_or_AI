This paper proposes a novel approach to manifold learning, introducing a Riemannian Relaxation (RR) algorithm that optimizes a loss function based on the push-forward Riemannian metric. The algorithm aims to find an embedding that preserves the geometry of the original manifold, and the authors demonstrate its effectiveness in various experiments.
The paper's main strengths lie in its originality and significance. The proposed approach departs from existing non-linear embedding algorithms, and the use of the push-forward Riemannian metric as a loss function is a novel and natural way to measure distortion from isometry. The algorithm's ability to preserve geometric properties, such as lengths, angles, and volumes, is a significant contribution to the field.
However, the paper also has some weaknesses. The presentation is unclear in some sections, and the introduction could be enriched and restructured to prevent reader confusion. Additionally, the paper lacks necessary comparisons with previous efforts on balanced partitions, such as the min-max cut algorithm for graph partitioning and data clustering. The authors should provide more explanations and clarifications, including derivations for certain equations and descriptions for figures and tables.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of their work. The paper is well-organized, but some sections could be improved for better clarity.
The originality of the paper is high, as it proposes a new approach to manifold learning and introduces a novel loss function. The significance of the paper is also high, as it addresses a difficult problem in a better way than previous research and advances the state of the art in a demonstrable way.
In conclusion, this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of manifold learning, and its strengths outweigh its weaknesses. With some revisions to address the clarity and comparison issues, this paper has the potential to be a valuable addition to the NIPS conference.
