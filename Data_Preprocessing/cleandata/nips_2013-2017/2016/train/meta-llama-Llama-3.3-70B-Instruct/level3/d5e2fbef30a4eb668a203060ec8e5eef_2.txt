This paper proposes a novel feature selection approach, CMICOT, which is an extension of filter methods with sequential forward selection (SFS) based on conditional mutual information (MI). The algorithm approximates high-order mutual information by decomposing categorical variables into binary variables and searching over two sets to find the best complementary subset. The approach is interesting, particularly when approximating the Conditional Mutual Information (CMI), and the interplay between the max and min steps is noteworthy.
The use of binary representations increases the search space, allowing the algorithm to identify interesting interactions, but also increases computational complexity. Unlike competitor techniques, which can be optimized with memoization, CMICOT's computational complexity is higher due to the binary representation. However, the authors argue that this increase in complexity is mitigated by the ability to identify high-order feature interactions.
The experimental study lacks details, such as specific parameters used in k-NN and Adaboost, and the notation in the supplementary material is unclear in some places. Additionally, the proof of proposition 3 is unclear, and calculating joint entropy has a complexity of O(N + |X|), not O(Nm). Separating results for different datasets could help understand the impact of the binary approximation on performance.
To further evaluate the effectiveness of CMICOT, it would be beneficial to run other algorithms on binary expanded versions of the datasets to compare performance and understand the effect of the binary approximation on the results. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed approach.
Overall, the paper presents a novel approach to feature selection, and the experimental results show promising performance. However, further clarification and experimentation are needed to fully understand the benefits and limitations of CMICOT.
