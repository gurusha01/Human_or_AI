This paper proposes a novel approach to dropout, a widely used technique for preventing overfitting in deep neural networks. The authors introduce a multinomial dropout, where features or neurons are sampled according to a multinomial distribution with different probabilities for different features or neurons. The paper provides a thorough analysis of the risk bound for stochastic optimization with multinomial dropout and establishes that a distribution-dependent dropout leads to a smaller expected risk and faster convergence.
The paper's strengths include its rigorous theoretical analysis, which provides a clear understanding of the benefits of the proposed approach. The authors also provide an efficient algorithm for computing the sampling probabilities, making the approach practical for deep learning. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed dropouts, showing significant improvements in convergence speed and testing error compared to the standard dropout.
However, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement. The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with other related work, such as batch normalization, to provide a clearer understanding of the advantages and limitations of the proposed approach. Additionally, the authors could provide more insights into the choice of hyperparameters, such as the value of k, and how they affect the performance of the proposed dropouts.
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of deep learning, providing a novel approach to dropout that has the potential to improve the performance of neural networks. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their approach and results.
