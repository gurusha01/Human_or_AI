This paper presents a significant contribution to the understanding of the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, a widely used method for estimating parameters of statistical models. The authors provide a global analysis of EM for specific models, namely mixtures of two Gaussians, and prove that the algorithm converges to the global minimum for mean-estimation of these distributions.
The paper is well-written and beautifully presented, making it a pleasure to read. The proofs are involved and non-trivial, demonstrating a deep understanding of the underlying mathematics. The authors' use of the Population EM framework, which idealizes the execution of EM in the infinite sample limit, is a clever technique that allows them to fully characterize the limit points of the sequence of parameters.
The main results of the paper are impressive, including the proof of convergence for the sequence of iterates for Population EM and the characterization of the stationary points and dynamics of EM in both models. The authors also establish statistical consistency for the actual sequence of parameters produced by EM, which is a significant contribution to the field.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to provide a global analysis of EM, which is a significant improvement over previous works that only established convergence to stationary points. The authors' results have important implications for the use of EM in practice, as they provide a better understanding of the algorithm's behavior and limitations.
The paper is also well-situated in the context of previous work on EM and Gaussian mixture models. The authors provide a thorough review of the relevant literature and clearly explain how their results relate to and improve upon existing work.
In terms of the conference guidelines, this paper meets all of the criteria for a good scientific paper. It is technically sound, with well-supported claims and a clear presentation of the results. The paper is also well-organized and easy to follow, making it accessible to a wide range of readers. The authors are careful and honest in their evaluation of the work, acknowledging the limitations of their results and providing a clear discussion of the implications and potential extensions of their work.
Overall, I highly recommend this paper for acceptance at the conference. The results are novel and important, and the paper is well-written and clearly presented. The authors' contributions to the understanding of EM and Gaussian mixture models are significant, and their work has the potential to make a lasting impact in the field.
