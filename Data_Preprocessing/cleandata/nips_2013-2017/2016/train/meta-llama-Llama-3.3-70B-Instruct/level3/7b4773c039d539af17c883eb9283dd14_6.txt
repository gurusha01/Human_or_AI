I must inform the area chair that, unfortunately, I lack the necessary background knowledge in the research field of this submission to provide a meaningful and informed review. Despite my best efforts, I am unable to fully understand and appreciate the technical details and contributions presented in the paper.
However, I can attempt to provide a general overview of the paper's content. The paper appears to study the support recovery guarantees of underdetermined sparse regression using the `1-norm as a regularizer and a non-smooth loss function for data fidelity. The authors focus on the cases of `1 and `âˆž losses and provide a sharp analysis for the polyhedral cases that allows one to control the deviation of the support of the vector to recover from the true support.
The paper is well-structured and provides a clear introduction to the problem, followed by a detailed presentation of the theoretical results and numerical experiments. The authors also provide a thorough discussion of the related work and the limitations of their analysis.
In terms of the conference guidelines, I will attempt to evaluate the paper based on the four criteria: Quality, Clarity, Originality, and Significance. However, please note that my evaluation may not be as thorough or informed as a reviewer with expertise in the field.
* Quality: The paper appears to be technically sound, and the authors provide a clear and detailed presentation of their results. However, I am unable to fully evaluate the technical correctness of the paper.
* Clarity: The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear introduction to the problem and a detailed presentation of their results. The notation and terminology are also clearly defined.
* Originality: The paper appears to provide a novel contribution to the field, as the authors study the support recovery guarantees of underdetermined sparse regression using non-smooth loss functions.
* Significance: The paper's results appear to be significant, as they provide a sharp analysis for the polyhedral cases and demonstrate the usefulness of their theory through numerical experiments.
In conclusion, while I am unable to provide a fully informed review, the paper appears to be well-written and provides a clear presentation of the authors' results. However, I must emphasize that my evaluation is limited by my lack of expertise in the field, and I recommend that the area chair seek additional reviews from experts in the field to ensure a thorough and informed evaluation of the paper.
