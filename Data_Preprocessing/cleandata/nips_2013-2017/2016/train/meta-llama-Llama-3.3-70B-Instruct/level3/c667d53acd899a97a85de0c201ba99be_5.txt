This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the sample complexity of automated mechanism design for searching high-revenue combinatorial auctions in various auction classes. The authors derive uniform convergence bounds of revenue for hierarchical auction classes, showing exponential and polynomial sample complexity for different auction types. The core technique used involves bounding the complexity of auction classes using Rademacher complexity or pseudo-dimension.
The paper is well-written and easy to follow, making it accessible to readers with a background in machine learning and mechanism design. The authors provide a clear introduction to the problem of designing revenue-maximizing combinatorial auctions and motivate the need for sample complexity analysis. The paper is organized in a logical manner, with each section building on the previous one to provide a cohesive narrative.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to provide tight sample complexity bounds for various auction classes, including affine maximizer auctions (AMAs), virtual valuation combinatorial auctions (VVCAs), and mixed bundling auctions (MBAs). The authors also provide lower bounds for some of these classes, which helps to establish the optimality of their results. The use of Rademacher complexity and pseudo-dimension to bound the complexity of auction classes is a key contribution of the paper.
However, there are some areas where the paper could be improved. For example, the authors do not provide a clear explanation for the quantity "U" that appears in the bounds. This could be clarified with a brief discussion or a reference to a previous work that defines this quantity. Additionally, some of the proofs and technical details are relegated to the supplementary materials, which may make it difficult for readers to follow the paper without accessing the additional resources.
In terms of originality, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of mechanism design and learning theory. The authors tackle a challenging problem and provide novel results that advance our understanding of the sample complexity of automated mechanism design. The paper also explores a new research area for learning theory, offering new insights into the structure of auction class hierarchies.
The significance of the paper lies in its ability to provide a foundation for the design of high-revenue combinatorial auctions. The results have important implications for practitioners and researchers in the field of mechanism design, as they provide a way to quantify the number of samples needed to guarantee good performance. The paper also opens up new avenues for research in learning theory, particularly in the area of sample complexity analysis for complex function classes.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication. The paper makes a significant contribution to the field, and the results are well-motivated and clearly presented. With some minor revisions to address the issues mentioned above, the paper has the potential to be a seminal work in the area of mechanism design and learning theory.
