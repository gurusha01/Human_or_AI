This paper proposes a novel feature selection approach, CMICOT, which is an extension of filter methods with sequential forward selection (SFS) based on conditional mutual information (MI). The authors introduce a saddle point optimization problem to build a scoring function that identifies joint interactions between multiple features, addressing the limitation of existing MI-based SFS techniques that can only account for low-order dependencies.
The paper is well-structured, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the proposed method, including the optimization problem, the greedy approximation, and the binary representation technique. The experimental evaluation is thorough, with comparisons to state-of-the-art filters on 10 benchmark datasets.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposed method, CMICOT, is able to identify high-order feature interactions, which is a significant improvement over existing methods.
* The authors provide a theoretical analysis of the optimization problem and the greedy approximation, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.
* The experimental evaluation is comprehensive, with comparisons to multiple state-of-the-art filters and classification models.
However, there are some weaknesses:
* The presentation could be improved, with clearer definitions of symbols and notation.
* Some typos and formatting issues are present throughout the paper.
* The authors could provide more discussion on the computational complexity of the proposed method and its scalability to large datasets.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of feature selection, and the proposed method, CMICOT, has the potential to improve the performance of classification models by identifying high-order feature interactions.
