This paper introduces a novel approach to learning Supervised PageRank models, which can account for features of nodes and edges in a graph. The authors propose two optimization methods, a gradient-free and a gradient-based method, to solve the non-convex loss-minimization problem. The key contribution of the work is to provide theoretical guarantees on the convergence rate of both methods, which outperform the state-of-the-art gradient-based method in experiments.
The paper is well-structured, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the problem, the proposed methods, and the experimental results. The use of Lemmas 1 and 2 to control the accuracy of the inexact oracle is a nice touch, and the application of the methods to the web page ranking problem is a good demonstration of the practical usefulness of the approach.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of two novel optimization methods, which provide theoretical guarantees on the convergence rate.
* The application of the methods to a real-world problem, such as web page ranking.
* The experimental results, which demonstrate the outperformance of the proposed methods compared to the state-of-the-art method.
However, there are some weaknesses:
* The paper assumes that the set Φ is a small vicinity of the local minimum ϕ∗, which might not always be the case in practice.
* The choice of the hyperparameters, such as the Lipschitz constant L and the accuracy ε, might require careful tuning in practice.
* The computational complexity of the methods might be high, especially for large-scale problems.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the proposed methods are a significant contribution to the field of optimization. The experimental results demonstrate the practical usefulness of the approach, and the theoretical guarantees provide a solid foundation for the methods.
