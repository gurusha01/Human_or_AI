This paper proposes a novel approach to 3D object generation using a generative deep network trained with an adversarial signal from a discriminative deep network, extending GANs to 3D object synthesis. The authors introduce VAE-VAN, an extension of VAE-GANs to 3D, which uses an encoder network to encode a 2D image into a latent representation and a generative network to reconstruct a 3D object model. The proposed models are able to synthesize 3D objects that look better than the state of the art, both qualitatively and quantitatively.
The paper's main contribution lies in extending existing techniques from 2D image generation to 3D object generation. While the techniques themselves are not significantly novel, the application to 3D object synthesis is a notable advancement. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through experiments that show improved performance over existing methods.
However, there are some questions regarding experimental details, such as the training of different VANs for different object categories, the use of discriminators for representation extraction, and the testing of models on novel test images. Further analysis is required to understand what each neuron in the discriminator responds to, as some neurons appear to be activated by the same object part. Additionally, more experimental details are needed for easy reproducibility.
The paper is well-written and clearly organized, making it easy to follow. The authors provide sufficient background information and relate their work to previous research in the field. The results are impressive, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of their approach.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of their work. The paper is a complete piece of work, and the authors provide sufficient information for the expert reader to reproduce their results.
The originality of the paper lies in its application of existing techniques to 3D object synthesis. While the techniques themselves are not new, the authors demonstrate a novel combination of familiar techniques to achieve state-of-the-art results. The paper is significant, as it addresses a difficult problem in a better way than previous research and advances the state of the art in a demonstrable way.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, as it makes a significant contribution to the field of 3D object generation and provides a thorough analysis of the approach. However, I would suggest that the authors provide more experimental details and further analysis to address the questions raised above.
