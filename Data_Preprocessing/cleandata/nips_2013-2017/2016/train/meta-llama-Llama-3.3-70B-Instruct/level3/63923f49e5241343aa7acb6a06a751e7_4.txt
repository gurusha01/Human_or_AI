This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of probabilistic graphical models, focusing on the tractability of arithmetic circuits (ACs) and their applications. The authors investigate the multiplication and summing-out operations on ACs, showing that both are intractable for deterministic and decomposable ACs. However, they introduce a subclass of ACs, called Probabilistic Sentential Decision Diagrams (PSDDs), which support a polytime multiplication operator. This property makes PSDDs suitable for a broader range of applications, including compiling probabilistic graphical models.
The paper's content is beyond my expertise to fully evaluate, but the application to fast k-means clustering is the most interesting aspect. The authors provide a provable guarantee for faster learning rates, which is a significant theoretical contribution. However, the lack of experimental results makes it difficult to assess the practical usefulness of the theorem. I question the practical verifiability of the assumptions in Theorem 4.1, particularly how to verify them in real-world scenarios.
The paper is well-organized, and the authors provide a clear introduction to the background and related work. The technical sections are detailed, and the proofs are available in the appendix. The authors also provide an empirical evaluation of their compilation algorithm, which shows promising results.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The introduction of PSDDs as a subclass of ACs with a polytime multiplication operator
* The provision of a provable guarantee for faster learning rates
* The empirical evaluation of the compilation algorithm
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The lack of experimental results to assess the practical usefulness of the theorem
* The potential difficulty in verifying the assumptions in Theorem 4.1 in real-world scenarios
* The limited evaluation of the compilation algorithm, which only considers Markov networks
Overall, I believe that this paper makes a significant contribution to the field, and the results are important for both practitioners and researchers. The paper advances the state of the art in a demonstrable way, providing a new approach to compiling probabilistic graphical models. However, further experimental evaluation and investigation into the practical applicability of the results are necessary to fully assess the impact of this work.
