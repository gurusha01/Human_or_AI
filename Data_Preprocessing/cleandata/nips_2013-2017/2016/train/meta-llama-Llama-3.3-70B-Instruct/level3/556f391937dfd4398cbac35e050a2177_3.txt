This paper proposes a novel approach to deep embedding learning, introducing a Position-Dependent Deep Metric (PDDM) unit and a double-header hinge loss function. The PDDM unit learns a similarity metric adaptive to local feature structure, addressing the limitations of global Euclidean metrics. The double-header hinge loss utilizes hard quadruplet mining to discriminate target similarity distributions, leading to faster convergence and better feature embedding.
The paper is well-motivated, with a clear explanation of the need for a locally adaptive similarity metric to select genuinely hard samples and guide deep embedding learning. The network and loss function are well-designed, with technical details and hyper-parameters provided for repeatability. The experiment results show promising improvements over previous methods, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed approach in image retrieval tasks and its potential for generalization to new classes in transfer learning and zero-shot learning scenarios.
The strengths of the paper include its novel approach to deep embedding learning, its ability to adapt to local feature structure, and its improved performance over previous methods. The weaknesses of the paper include the potential complexity of the PDDM unit and the need for careful hyper-parameter tuning.
