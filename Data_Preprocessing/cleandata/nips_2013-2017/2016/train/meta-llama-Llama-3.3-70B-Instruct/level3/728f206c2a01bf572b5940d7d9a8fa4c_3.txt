This paper proposes a novel approach to modeling and analyzing crowdsourcing systems using an information-theoretic framework. The authors aim to identify the ultimate fidelity that can be achieved by any form of query from the crowd and any decoding algorithm with a given budget. The paper presents a communication system model for crowdsourcing, where the crowd is modeled by a set of parallel noisy channels, and the query scheme and inference are represented by a joint source-channel coding scheme.
The paper's main strengths lie in its originality and significance. The proposed framework provides a new perspective on crowdsourcing, and the authors' use of information-theoretic tools to analyze the system's performance is innovative. The paper also provides a thorough analysis of the system's performance, including the derivation of fundamental limits on the crowdsourcing rate.
However, the paper has some weaknesses. The experiments were conducted on unusually small datasets, and the results showed improvement only in terms of Wasserstein-like measures of performance. This raises concerns about the method's suitability for minibatch-training and its scalability to larger datasets. Additionally, the paper lacks clarity on certain equations and concepts, such as equation 4 and the definition of alpha*, which need more explanatory text and clarification.
The method's scaling properties, both in terms of the number of samples and problem dimensionality, are also unclear and need to be discussed. The clustering results may be due to the entropy regularizer rather than the Wasserstein distance itself, and the shrinkage property of the method may be undesirable, especially in higher-dimensional problems.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, but the claims are not well-supported by theoretical analysis or experimental results. The paper is not a complete piece of work, as it raises more questions than it answers. The authors are careful about evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of the work, but the paper could benefit from more discussion on the limitations of the approach.
The clarity of the paper is also a concern. The writing is not always clear, and some equations and concepts are not well-explained. The paper could benefit from more explanatory text and clarification on certain points.
The originality of the paper is one of its strongest aspects. The proposed framework is novel, and the authors' use of information-theoretic tools to analyze the system's performance is innovative. The paper also provides a thorough analysis of the system's performance, including the derivation of fundamental limits on the crowdsourcing rate.
The significance of the paper lies in its potential to provide a new perspective on crowdsourcing and to improve our understanding of the system's performance. The paper's results have implications for the design of crowdsourcing systems and could lead to the development of more efficient and effective systems.
In conclusion, the paper has both strengths and weaknesses. While it proposes a novel approach to modeling and analyzing crowdsourcing systems, it lacks clarity and has some concerns regarding its scalability and suitability for minibatch-training. The paper's originality and significance are its strongest aspects, but it needs more work to fully develop its ideas and to provide a more complete and clear presentation of its results.
