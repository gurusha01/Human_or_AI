This paper proposes a novel approach for unsupervised learning of similarities between large numbers of exemplars using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The method addresses the challenges of single positive exemplar setup, imbalance between exemplar and negatives, and inconsistent labels within SGD batches. The authors formulate an optimization problem to extract batches of samples with mutually consistent relations, which are then used to train a CNN. The approach is evaluated on three different datasets, including Olympic Sports, Leeds Sports, and PASCAL VOC 2007, and demonstrates competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.
The paper is well-organized and clearly written, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments and methodology. The introduction provides a thorough overview of the background and motivation, while the approach section delves into the technical details of the proposed method. The experimental evaluation is comprehensive, covering various datasets and comparison to other methods.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposed approach is novel and addresses a significant challenge in unsupervised learning of similarities.
* The optimization problem formulation is well-motivated and effectively addresses the issues of single positive exemplar setup and inconsistent labels.
* The experimental evaluation is thorough and demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach on various datasets.
However, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement:
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the optimization problem and its solution, including the choice of hyperparameters and the convergence properties of the algorithm.
* The comparison to other methods could be more comprehensive, including a discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.
* The paper could provide more insights into the learned representations and similarities, including visualizations and analysis of the learned features.
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of unsupervised learning of similarities and demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach. With some revisions to address the areas for improvement, the paper has the potential to be a strong contribution to the NIPS conference.
