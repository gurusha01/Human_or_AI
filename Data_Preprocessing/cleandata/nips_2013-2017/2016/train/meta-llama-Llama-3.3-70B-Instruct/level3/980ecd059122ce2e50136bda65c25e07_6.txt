This paper proposes a novel approach to measuring the robustness of neural networks by encoding the network as a set of constraints and solving a linear programming problem. The authors introduce two new statistics, adversarial frequency and adversarial severity, to formalize the notion of robustness. The paper also presents an algorithm, ALP, to approximate the pointwise robustness of a neural network.
The paper has several strengths. Firstly, the proposed approach provides a more accurate estimate of robustness compared to existing algorithms. The experimental results show that ALP outperforms the baseline algorithm, L-BFGS-B, in estimating the adversarial frequency and severity. Secondly, the paper highlights the importance of using impartial measures to compare robustness, as the baseline neural net is shown to overfit to the adversarial examples found by the baseline algorithm.
However, the paper also has some weaknesses. The proposed algorithm, ALP, is still biased due to its process of removing disjunction constraints, which may lead to an overestimation of robustness. Additionally, the paper lacks clarity in some sections, with poorly formulated symbols and equations, making it difficult to follow. For example, the dimensionality of x* and the meaning of (.)_i are not clearly explained.
Furthermore, the paper contains several errors and inconsistencies. For instance, there is a potential mistake in an equation, and a variable is not defined. These errors and inconsistencies may affect the validity of the results and the overall quality of the paper.
To improve the paper, the authors could consider exploring a stochastic version of the algorithm, which could help address the bias issue by randomly choosing between disjunctions. Additionally, the authors should carefully review the paper to ensure that all symbols and equations are clearly defined and formulated, and that all errors and inconsistencies are corrected.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets some of the criteria. The paper proposes a novel approach to measuring robustness, which is a significant contribution to the field. The experimental results are also well-presented and provide strong evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. However, the paper could be improved in terms of clarity and organization, and the authors should ensure that all errors and inconsistencies are corrected before submission.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, but with revisions to address the issues mentioned above. The paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field, but it requires careful revision to ensure that it meets the high standards of the conference.
