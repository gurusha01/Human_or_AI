This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of automated mechanism design, providing the first sample complexity analysis for the standard hierarchy of deterministic combinatorial auction classes. The authors derive tight sample complexity bounds for various auction classes, including Affine Maximizer Auctions (AMAs), Virtual Valuation Combinatorial Auctions (VVCAs), Î»-auctions, Mixed Bundling Auctions (MBAs), and Mixed Bundling Auctions with Reserve Prices (MBARPs).
The paper's strengths include its thorough analysis of the sample complexity of uniform convergence over different auction classes, providing both upper and lower bounds. The authors also demonstrate the applicability of their results to any algorithm that determines the optimal auction over a sample, making their work relevant to a wide range of automated mechanism design algorithms.
One potential weakness of the paper is the assumption that the bidders' valuations are drawn from an underlying distribution, which may not always be the case in practice. Additionally, the paper focuses on deterministic combinatorial auctions, which may not be the most realistic or effective approach in all scenarios.
The paper is well-written, with clear explanations of the auction classes and the sample complexity analysis. The authors provide a detailed overview of related work, highlighting the significance of their contributions. The paper's organization is logical, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments and understand the implications of their results.
In terms of originality, the paper presents a novel combination of techniques from learning theory and mechanism design, providing new insights into the sample complexity of combinatorial auctions. The authors' use of Rademacher complexity and pseudo-dimension to derive sample complexity bounds is particularly noteworthy.
The significance of the paper lies in its ability to provide a foundation for automated mechanism design, allowing researchers and practitioners to better understand the performance of different auction classes and design more effective mechanisms. The paper's results have important implications for a wide range of applications, including wireless spectrum license auctions and sourcing auctions.
