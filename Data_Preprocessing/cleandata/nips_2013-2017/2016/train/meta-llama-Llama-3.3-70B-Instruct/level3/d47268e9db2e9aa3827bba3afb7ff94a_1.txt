This paper proposes a novel discriminant dimensionality reduction algorithm, Large Margin Discriminant Dimensionality Reduction (LADDER), which jointly learns the mapping and linear classifiers in an efficient manner. The authors establish a duality between boosting and SVM, showing that both methods maximize the margin using a combination of mapping and linear classification. The paper is well-organized, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the proposed algorithm and its relation to previous work.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposed LADDER algorithm is novel and has the potential to improve the state of the art in dimensionality reduction and classification tasks.
* The authors provide a thorough analysis of the relationship between boosting and SVM, which is interesting and insightful.
* The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in various tasks, such as hashing and image/scene classification.
However, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement:
* The paper is quite long and dense, making it challenging to follow at times. Some sections, such as the related work section, could be condensed or reorganized for better clarity.
* The authors could provide more intuition and explanation for the choice of the exponential loss function in the LADDER algorithm.
* While the experimental results are promising, it would be beneficial to include more comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods and provide a more detailed analysis of the results.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets most of the criteria:
* Quality: The paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results.
* Clarity: The paper is well-organized, but some sections could be improved for better clarity.
* Originality: The proposed LADDER algorithm is novel and original.
* Significance: The paper addresses an important problem in machine learning and has the potential to impact the field.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, but with some revisions to address the areas mentioned above.
