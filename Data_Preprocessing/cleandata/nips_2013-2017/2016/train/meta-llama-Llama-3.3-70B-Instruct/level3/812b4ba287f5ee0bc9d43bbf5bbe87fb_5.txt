This paper proposes a novel approach to capture interdependencies among objects in images using a tree-structured traversing scheme, referred to as Tree-RL. The authors claim that their method can efficiently discover multiple objects in an image. The experimental section compares the proposed algorithm with single path search, other object proposal algorithms, and object detection frameworks with and without the proposed object proposals.
The paper has some strengths, such as the introduction of a new approach to object detection and the comparison with other state-of-the-art methods. However, there are several weaknesses that need to be addressed. Firstly, the paper lacks time measurement or complexity analysis to support its claim of computational efficiency. This is a significant omission, as it is essential to evaluate the practicality of the proposed method. Additionally, the qualitative results are limited, and it would be beneficial to include comparisons with other object proposals and cases with one or more than two main objects in images.
The motivations and justifications for the chosen tree structure and actions are unclear, and the paper could benefit from exploring alternative variations and strategies. Furthermore, the technical contribution of the paper is marginal compared to existing work, with similarities in the definition of actions, states, rewards, and optimization methods. To improve the paper, the authors should provide clearer comparisons with other algorithms and more qualitative and quantitative results.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper partially meets the criteria for quality, clarity, originality, and significance. The paper is technically sound, but the claims are not well-supported by theoretical analysis or experimental results. The writing is clear, but the organization could be improved. The approach is novel, but the paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of related work and a clearer explanation of the contributions. The results are significant, but the paper could be improved by including more comprehensive experiments and evaluations.
