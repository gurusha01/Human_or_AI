This paper presents a novel approach to modeling and analyzing crowdsourcing systems using an information-theoretic framework. The authors introduce a communication system model for crowdsourcing, where the crowd is represented by a set of parallel noisy channels, and the taskmaster and crowdsourcer are modeled as an encoder and decoder, respectively. The paper focuses on the design of optimized crowdsourcing systems, with the goal of achieving a certain fidelity with a given budget.
The paper makes several key contributions. First, it establishes the fundamental performance limits of crowdsourcing using information-theoretic bounds. The authors derive two theorems that provide the minimum number of queries per item required to achieve a certain fidelity, one for the case where the worker skill levels are unknown and another for the case where they are known. These bounds serve as a benchmark for evaluating the performance of different crowdsourcing systems.
Second, the paper introduces a new query scheme called k-ary incidence coding (kIC), which poses a query as a set of k items and asks the workers to identify those with the same label. The authors analyze the performance of kIC with a spammer-hammer worker pool and derive a lower bound on the performance of kIC. They also provide numerical results to illustrate the performance of kIC and compare it to the information-theoretic bounds.
The paper is well-written and clear, with a good balance of theoretical analysis and numerical results. The authors provide a thorough review of related work and clearly explain the contributions of their paper. The use of information-theoretic bounds to analyze crowdsourcing systems is a novel and useful approach, and the introduction of kIC as a new query scheme is a significant contribution to the field.
However, there are some areas where the paper could be improved. For example, the authors could provide more details on the experimental runtime and complexity of the steps involved in implementing kIC. Additionally, the paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the trade-offs between different query schemes and the impact of worker skill levels on the performance of crowdsourcing systems.
Overall, this paper makes a useful contribution to the field of crowdsourcing and information theory, and the results have the potential to be applied to a wide range of crowdsourcing applications. The paper is well-suited for presentation at NIPS, and I would recommend acceptance.
