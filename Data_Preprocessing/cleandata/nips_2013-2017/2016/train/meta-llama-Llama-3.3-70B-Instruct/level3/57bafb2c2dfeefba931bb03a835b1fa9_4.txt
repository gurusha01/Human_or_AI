This paper presents a significant improvement to the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES), a popular derivative-free optimization algorithm. The authors propose the Cholesky-CMA-ES, which replaces the traditional matrix square root update with a triangular Cholesky factorization, reducing the time complexity from O(d^3) to O(Î¼d^2) and the memory complexity to optimal. The modification is theoretically justified, and empirical results demonstrate a substantial increase in optimization speed, particularly for high-dimensional problems, without compromising the algorithm's performance in terms of objective function evaluations.
The paper is well-structured, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the CMA-ES and its limitations. The proposed Cholesky-CMA-ES is thoroughly explained, and the theoretical justification for the modification is sound. The experimental evaluation is comprehensive, comparing the Cholesky-CMA-ES to other CMA-ES variants on various benchmark functions and demonstrating its superiority in terms of wall-clock time.
The strengths of the paper include its clear presentation, thorough theoretical analysis, and convincing empirical evaluation. The authors also provide a detailed discussion of the advantages and limitations of their approach, including the potential risks of low-dimensional approximations for very large problems.
One potential weakness of the paper is the lack of comparison to other optimization algorithms beyond CMA-ES variants. While the authors demonstrate the superiority of the Cholesky-CMA-ES within the CMA-ES family, it would be interesting to see how it compares to other popular optimization algorithms, such as gradient-based methods or other derivative-free algorithms.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, originality, and significance. The paper is technically sound, well-written, and easy to follow. The proposed Cholesky-CMA-ES is a novel contribution that advances the state of the art in derivative-free optimization. The results are significant, demonstrating a substantial improvement in optimization speed for high-dimensional problems.
