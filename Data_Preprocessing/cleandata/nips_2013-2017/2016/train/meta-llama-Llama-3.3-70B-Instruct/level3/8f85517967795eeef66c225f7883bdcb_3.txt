This paper introduces a new class of probabilistic models called cooperative graphical models, which extend traditional pairwise graphical models by incorporating higher-order interactions between variables through an additional submodular function. The authors provide a clear and concise formulation of these models and demonstrate how to combine traditional variational inference methods with submodular functions to compute bounds for the partition function.
The paper's strengths include the development of efficient optimization algorithms to obtain lower and upper variational bounds for the partition function, as well as well-illustrated solutions to intermediate optimization problems. The experimental results show the effectiveness and efficiency of the optimization approaches, although the novelty of the work is limited compared to existing research. The paper also provides a good review of related work, including variational inference methods and log-supermodular models.
However, there are some weaknesses to the paper. The optimization algorithms, while efficient, are more expensive than traditional pairwise models, and the authors do not report runtimes, making it difficult to compare the performance of the cooperative model to traditional models. Additionally, more experiments are needed to demonstrate the advantage of the extra submodular term in the cooperative graphical models.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of the work. The paper is clearly written, well-organized, and provides enough information for an expert reader to reproduce the results.
The originality of the paper is limited, as it builds on existing work on variational inference and submodular functions. However, the combination of these techniques to develop cooperative graphical models is novel, and the paper provides a significant contribution to the field.
The significance of the paper lies in its potential to provide a more expressive and powerful framework for modeling complex interactions between variables. The cooperative graphical models have the potential to be used in a wide range of applications, including computer vision, natural language processing, and recommender systems.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper introduces a new class of probabilistic models that can capture higher-order interactions between variables.
* The authors provide efficient optimization algorithms to compute bounds for the partition function.
* The experimental results show the effectiveness and efficiency of the optimization approaches.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The novelty of the work is limited compared to existing research.
* The optimization algorithms are more expensive than traditional pairwise models.
* More experiments are needed to demonstrate the advantage of the extra submodular term.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, as it provides a significant contribution to the field of probabilistic graphical models and has the potential to be used in a wide range of applications. However, the authors should be encouraged to provide more experiments and report runtimes to compare the performance of the cooperative model to traditional models.
