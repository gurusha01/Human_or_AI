This paper proposes a dynamic programming solution for optimal memory allocation when training Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), enabling efficient handling of long sequences with limited memory. The dynamic programming formulation is a significant improvement over existing methods, including Chen et al's fixed square root of t and fixed recursive schedule. 
The paper's main idea is to use a triangular Cholesky factorization instead of the square root in the standard CMA-ES, which reduces the runtime complexity of the algorithm with no significant change in the number of objective function evaluations. The authors provide a theoretical justification for the convergence of the new algorithm and demonstrate its empirical performance using various benchmark functions.
The strengths of the paper include its technical soundness, clarity, and originality. The authors provide a clear and well-organized presentation of their ideas, and the paper is easy to follow. The use of a triangular Cholesky factorization is a novel combination of familiar techniques, and the authors adequately reference related work.
However, there are some weaknesses to the paper. The distinction between hidden states and internal states is unclear and may benefit from being moved to the appendix, as the results only differ by a constant factor. Additionally, the paper lacks application of the proposed methods to real problems, making it unclear if the ability to train on longer sequences improves RNN performance. The paper also has minor issues, including incorrect formatting and a missing discussion on the case when memory is "somewhat limited" as opposed to "scarce".
Arguments pro acceptance include:
* The paper proposes a significant improvement over existing methods for optimal memory allocation in RNNs.
