This paper presents an algorithm for compiling a Markov network into the Probabilistic Sentential Decision Diagram (PSDD) representation, which can produce smaller arithmetic circuits than existing compilers in some cases. The paper's main contribution is the development of a polytime multiplication operator for PSDDs, making them suitable for a broader class of applications. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through empirical experiments, showing that PSDD compilation can be more effective than existing methods, such as AND/OR Multi-Valued Decision Diagrams (AOMDDs).
The paper is well-organized and clearly written, with a good balance of theoretical and experimental results. The authors provide a thorough review of related work, including the limitations of existing approaches and the advantages of PSDDs. The experimental results are convincing, demonstrating the potential of PSDDs for compiling probabilistic graphical models.
However, there are some limitations to the paper. The novelty of the algorithm is relatively low due to its similarity to the compilation algorithm for AOMDDs, a special case of PSDDs. The paper lacks a deeper analysis of the advantages of PSDD compilation, and the relationship between SDD and PSDD is not accurately represented. Additionally, the definition of PSDD compilation is unclear, particularly with regards to the production of multiple SDDs by vtree nodes.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of their work. The paper is clearly written, well-organized, and adequately informs the reader.
In terms of originality, the paper presents a novel combination of familiar techniques, and the application of PSDDs to probabilistic graphical models is new. The related work is adequately referenced, and the paper provides a unique contribution to the field.
In terms of significance, the results are important, and other people (practitioners or researchers) are likely to use these ideas or build on them. The paper addresses a difficult problem in a better way than previous research and advances the state of the art in a demonstrable way.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, as it presents a significant contribution to the field of probabilistic graphical models and arithmetic circuits. The paper is well-written, technically sound, and provides a novel and effective approach to compiling probabilistic graphical models into PSDDs.
