This paper introduces a novel convex formulation for two-layer conditional models with latent structured representations. The proposed model is based on a bi-level optimization problem, where the inner-level optimization is relaxed using the first-order optimality conditions. The resulting convex formulation is achieved through a semi-definite programming (SDP) relaxation, which allows for efficient optimization.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of the proposed model and its optimization. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which outperforms local training and other state-of-the-art methods on two prediction problems with latent structure.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposed model is novel and addresses a long-standing problem in machine learning, which is the lack of convex formulations for two-layer conditional models with latent structured representations.
* The paper provides a clear and detailed explanation of the proposed model and its optimization, making it easy to follow and understand.
* The experimental results are thorough and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes that the support set Y is bounded and admits an efficient polar operator, which may not be the case in all applications.
* The paper does not provide a theoretical guarantee for the quality of the relaxation, which may be a concern for some readers.
* The optimization algorithm used to solve the convex formulation is not thoroughly explained, which may make it difficult for readers to implement the method.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the proposed model is novel and effective. The experimental results demonstrate the potential of the proposed method, and the paper provides a clear and detailed explanation of the proposed model and its optimization.
