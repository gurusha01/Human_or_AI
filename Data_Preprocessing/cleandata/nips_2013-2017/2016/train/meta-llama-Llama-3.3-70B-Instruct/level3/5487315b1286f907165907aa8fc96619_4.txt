This paper presents a novel technique for bi-level modeling with a discrete latent layer, which is applicable to various problems in NLP, such as transliteration. The authors propose a convex relaxation of the two-layer conditional model, which captures latent structure and estimates model parameters jointly and optimally. The approach relaxes the discrete latent variables into continuous variables and uses duality properties to obtain a semi-definite programming (SDP) formulation that can be convexified and solved efficiently.
The paper's approach seems reasonable, but it can benefit from better exposition of technical derivations, particularly in the section where the convex relaxation is introduced. The reviewer raises questions about certain claims, including the handling of quadratic functions and the introduction of relaxations, specifically the relaxation of the latent variable 'y' from discrete to continuous space.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis. However, the paper could be improved by providing more experimental results and comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods. The clarity of the paper is good, but some sections require careful reading to understand the technical details.
The originality of the paper is high, as it presents a novel approach to bi-level modeling with discrete latent layers. The paper adequately references related work and provides a clear explanation of how the proposed approach differs from previous contributions. The significance of the paper is also high, as it addresses a difficult problem in machine learning and provides a promising solution.
The strengths of the paper include:
* A novel approach to bi-level modeling with discrete latent layers
* A convex relaxation of the two-layer conditional model
* Theoretical analysis and experimental results to support the claims
