This paper presents a theoretical analysis of the robustness and consistency properties of a variant of the classical quadratic k-means algorithm, called robust k-means (RKM). The authors provide a detailed description of the optimality conditions for the associated minimization problem and show that RKM shares the computational simplicity of quadratic k-means, making it a "computationally cheap" candidate for robust nearest neighbor clustering.
The paper's main strengths lie in its thorough analysis of the breakdown properties of RKM and its ability to ignore the influence of outliers when grouping inliers in well-structured datasets. The authors also provide a comparison with trimmed k-means, showing that both algorithms perform similarly in practice.
However, the paper also has some weaknesses. The authors show that RKM cannot be robust against any type of contamination and any type of datasets, which may limit its applicability in certain scenarios. Additionally, the analysis of the consistency properties of RKM is based on a specific class of proximal maps, which may not be representative of all possible cases.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The writing is clear, and the organization is well-structured, making it easy to follow. The authors also provide a thorough review of related work, which helps to situate their contributions in the context of existing research.
The originality of the paper lies in its novel analysis of the robustness and consistency properties of RKM, as well as its comparison with trimmed k-means. The authors also provide a detailed description of the optimality conditions for the associated minimization problem, which is a significant contribution to the field.
The significance of the paper lies in its potential to advance the state of the art in robust clustering algorithms. The authors' analysis of the breakdown properties of RKM and its ability to ignore the influence of outliers in well-structured datasets makes it a promising candidate for applications where robustness is crucial.
