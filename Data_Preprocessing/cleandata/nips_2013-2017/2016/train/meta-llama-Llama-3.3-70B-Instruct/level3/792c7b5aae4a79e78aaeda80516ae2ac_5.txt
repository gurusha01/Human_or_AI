This paper introduces a novel feature selection approach, CMICOT, which is an evolution of filter methods with sequential forward selection (SFS) based on conditional mutual information (MI). The authors propose a saddle point (max-min) optimization problem to build a scoring function that identifies joint interactions between multiple features, addressing the limitation of existing MI-based SFS techniques that can only account for low-order dependencies.
The paper is well-organized, and the results are well-presented and commented. The authors provide a clear explanation of the proposed method, including the optimization problem, the greedy approximation, and the binary representation of features. The experimental evaluation is thorough, comparing CMICOT with state-of-the-art filters on 10 publicly available benchmark datasets.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel feature selection method that can identify high-order feature interactions, which is a significant improvement over existing methods.
* The use of a greedy approximation and binary representation of features, which makes the method efficient and effective in practice.
* The thorough experimental evaluation, which demonstrates the superiority of CMICOT over state-of-the-art filters.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The complexity of the proposed method, which may make it difficult to understand and implement for some readers.
* The reliance on the choice of parameters, such as the team size t, which may require careful tuning for optimal performance.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the proposed method is a significant contribution to the field of feature selection. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of CMICOT in identifying high-order feature interactions, which is a challenging task in feature selection.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel feature selection method that addresses a significant limitation of existing methods.
* The experimental evaluation is thorough and demonstrates the superiority of CMICOT over state-of-the-art filters.
* The paper is well-organized, and the results are well-presented and commented.
Arguments against acceptance:
