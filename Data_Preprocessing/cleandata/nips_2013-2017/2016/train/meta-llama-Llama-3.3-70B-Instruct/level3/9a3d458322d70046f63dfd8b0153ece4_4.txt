This paper proposes a new formulation for robust optimization that combines policy and transition model considerations into a single expression, allowing for policy improvement despite uncertainties in transition probabilities. The new formulation jointly evaluates the proposed and baseline policies under a shared minimized model, unlike the original formulation which uses separate optimistic and pessimistic models.
The paper's main strengths lie in its ability to provide a more efficient and effective approach to robust optimization. The new formulation does not require waiting for the proposed policy to provably improve on the baseline policy's optimistic performance, making it more efficient. Additionally, the authors provide a detailed analysis of the mathematical properties of the new formulation and an effective algorithm for its optimization.
However, the paper also has some weaknesses. The assumption of known transition probabilities for actions consistent with the baseline policy is questioned, particularly in the energy market example, where it may not be realistic. Furthermore, the authors prove that the new formulation is NP-hard and focus on promising approximations, which may come with additional optimization costs.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The paper is clearly written, well-organized, and adequately informs the reader. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of the work.
The paper's originality lies in its novel combination of policy and transition model considerations into a single expression. The approach is new and differs from previous contributions in the field. The related work is adequately referenced, and the authors clearly explain how their work differs from previous research.
The significance of the paper lies in its potential to improve the state of the art in robust optimization. The results are important, and other people, both practitioners and researchers, are likely to use these ideas or build on them. The paper addresses a difficult problem in a better way than previous research and provides a unique theoretical or pragmatic approach.
