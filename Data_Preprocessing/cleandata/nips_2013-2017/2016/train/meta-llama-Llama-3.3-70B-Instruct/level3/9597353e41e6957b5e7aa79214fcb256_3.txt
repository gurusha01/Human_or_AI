This paper introduces a novel framework for semi-supervised active clustering (SSAC) with same-cluster queries, which allows a clustering algorithm to interact with a domain expert to gain domain knowledge. The authors study the query and computational complexity of clustering in this framework, focusing on center-based clustering in Euclidean spaces with a notion of margin, referred to as the γ-margin property. The paper presents two main results: an efficient algorithm for clustering nice inputs with O(k^2 log(k) + k log(n)) oracle queries, and a lower bound proving that no poly-time algorithm can cluster a √3.4-margin instance with log(n) oracle calls.
The paper takes a fresh view on an interesting line of works, with results of major significance to the field. The proposed algorithm is efficient and scalable, making it suitable for large-scale clustering tasks. The lower bound result highlights the fundamental limits of clustering algorithms, even with access to oracle queries. The authors also introduce a new notion of niceness, the γ-margin property, which is related to previous notions of clusterability, such as center proximity.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their results. The technical proofs are sound, and the authors provide a detailed analysis of the algorithm's performance. The paper also discusses related work and provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of research in clustering.
However, there are some minor issues with the presentation. The notation could be improved, and some of the technical details could be clarified. Additionally, the authors could provide more insight into the practical implications of their results and how they can be applied to real-world clustering tasks.
Overall, I recommend accepting this paper for presentation at the conference. The results are significant, and the paper provides a valuable contribution to the field of clustering. The authors have done a great job in presenting their work, and with some minor revisions, the paper can be even stronger.
Some potential follow-up questions for the authors include:
* How does the algorithm perform in practice, and are there any plans to evaluate it on real-world datasets?
* Can the authors provide more insight into the relationship between the γ-margin property and other notions of clusterability?
* Are there any plans to extend the framework to other types of clustering algorithms or to handle more complex query types?
Minor comments and suggestions for improvement:
* Consider adding more examples or illustrations to help explain the technical concepts.
* Provide more detail on the experimental evaluation of the algorithm, if applicable.
* Consider adding a section on future work or open problems in the area.
* Minor notation and formatting issues should be addressed to improve the overall readability of the paper.
