This paper explores a novel model of strategic buyers with a window of time in which they would like to purchase an item. The authors propose an online algorithm that achieves a regret bound of O(T2/3) in an adversarial setting, where both buyer valuation and window size are selected adversarially. The paper also provides a matching lower bound of Î©(T2/3), demonstrating that the regret bound is tight.
The paper's main strength lies in its ability to model complex buyer behavior and provide a rigorous analysis of the algorithm's performance. The authors' use of a reduction from a multi-armed bandit problem with switching costs to establish the lower bound is particularly noteworthy. The paper's writing is clear, and the organization is logical, making it easy to follow.
However, there are some areas where the paper could be improved. The notation and mathematical formulations could be more precise, and some specific errors and inconsistencies were pointed out. Additionally, the paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with existing approaches, such as Schapire's, to provide a clearer understanding of the contributions.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, originality, and significance.
