This paper proposes a novel approach to unitary recurrent neural networks (uRNNs) by optimizing the recurrence matrix over all unitary matrices, leading to significantly improved performance over uRNNs that use a restricted-capacity recurrence matrix. The authors provide a theoretical argument to determine if a unitary parameterization has restricted capacity and show that a recently proposed unitary parameterization has restricted capacity for hidden state dimension greater than 7. They also propose a method for stochastic gradient descent for training the unitary recurrence matrix, which constrains the gradient to lie on the differentiable manifold of unitary matrices.
The paper is well-written and clearly organized, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments and contributions. The experimental results on synthetic and natural data tasks, including system identification, long-term memorization, frame-to-frame prediction of speech spectra, and pixel-by-pixel classification of handwritten digits, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed full-capacity uRNNs. The results show that full-capacity uRNNs generally achieve equivalent or superior performance compared to both LSTMs and the original restricted-capacity uRNNs.
The strengths of the paper include its clear and concise presentation, thorough experimental evaluation, and significant contributions to the field of uRNNs. The authors provide a detailed analysis of the limitations of restricted-capacity parameterizations and propose a novel method for optimizing full-capacity unitary matrices. The paper also highlights the importance of considering the capacity of unitary parameterizations and the potential trade-off between hidden state dimension and capacity.
However, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement. The paper assumes a significant amount of background knowledge in uRNNs and related topics, which may make it difficult for readers without prior experience to fully understand the contributions. Additionally, the paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the implications of the results and the potential applications of full-capacity uRNNs.
