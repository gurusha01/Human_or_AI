This paper proposes two oracle-based algorithms, VCEE and EELS, for the contextual semibandit problem, which is a variant of the bandit problem where the learner receives additional feedback about each individual item in a composite action. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the algorithms, including regret bounds and experimental evaluations.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem and the proposed algorithms. The technical sections are also well-organized and easy to follow. The authors provide a detailed analysis of the algorithms, including proofs of the regret bounds, which demonstrates a strong technical understanding of the subject.
The experimental evaluation is also thorough and well-designed. The authors compare their algorithms to several baselines, including a semibandit version of LINUCB, and demonstrate the effectiveness of their approaches. The results show that VCEE outperforms the baselines in most cases, especially when using a rich policy class.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of two novel algorithms, VCEE and EELS, which achieve state-of-the-art regret bounds for the contextual semibandit problem.
* A thorough analysis of the algorithms, including proofs of the regret bounds.
* A well-designed experimental evaluation that demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The assumption that the weight vector w? is known or can be learned efficiently, which may not always be the case in practice.
* The use of a supervised learning oracle, which may not always be available or efficient to implement.
* The lack of a clear comparison to other state-of-the-art algorithms for the contextual semibandit problem.
Overall, the paper is well-written and provides a significant contribution to the field of bandit learning. The proposed algorithms, VCEE and EELS, achieve state-of-the-art regret bounds and demonstrate effectiveness in experimental evaluations. However, the assumptions and limitations of the algorithms should be carefully considered in practice.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper proposes novel algorithms that achieve state-of-the-art regret bounds for the contextual semibandit problem.
* The analysis is thorough and well-organized, demonstrating a strong technical understanding of the subject.
