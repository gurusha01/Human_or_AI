This paper presents a novel model of strategic buyers in a repeated posted-price auction setting, where buyers have a window of time in which they would like to purchase an item. The authors analyze the problem of minimizing the regret of the seller with respect to the best fixed price in hindsight. The key contribution of the paper is the introduction of patient buyers who will wait for a certain time to accept the best price, making their behavior optimal by announcing prices in advance.
The paper provides a simple and attractive model that allows for a characterization of the buyer's optimal behavior. The authors propose an algorithm that achieves a regret rate of O(τ^{1/3} T^{2/3}) with respect to the best fixed price in hindsight, where τ is the maximum patience of the buyers and T is the number of time steps. They also provide a matching lower bound of Ω(τ^{1/3} T^{2/3}), demonstrating that the T^{2/3} term cannot be improved.
The connection to Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) with switching costs is surprising and interesting, involving a reduction from general MAB with switching costs to patient sellers without switching costs. The paper provides a thorough analysis of the algorithm and the lower bound, and the authors discuss the implications of their results and potential future directions.
However, the paper has some clarity issues, typos, and grammar errors that need to be addressed. The writing could be improved to make the paper more readable and easier to follow. Additionally, some of the notation and definitions could be more clearly explained.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of online learning and mechanism design, and the results have important implications for the design of posted-price auctions in settings where buyers are strategic and patient. The paper is well-structured, and the authors provide a clear and concise overview of the main results and contributions.
