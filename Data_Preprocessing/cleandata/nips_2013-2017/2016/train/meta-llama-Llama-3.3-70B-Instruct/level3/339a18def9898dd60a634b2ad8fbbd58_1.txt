This paper presents a novel approach to modeling and analyzing crowdsourcing systems using an information-theoretic framework. The authors represent each worker as a noisy channel and consider two types of channel models: symmetric memoryless and spammer/hammer. They transform the problem of labeling data from crowdsourcing into a coding problem, allowing for the study of distortion vs. budget tradeoffs. The paper introduces a basic coding scheme called k-incidence coding, which involves requiring crowdsourced tasks to label a subset of k items at a time.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem of crowdsourcing and its challenges. The modeling of workers as noisy channels is a clever idea, and the use of information-theoretic tools to analyze the system is sound. The introduction of k-incidence coding is a significant contribution, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of its performance.
The paper's strengths include its originality, technical soundness, and clarity of presentation. The authors provide a thorough review of previous work in the area and clearly explain how their approach differs from existing methods. The use of information-theoretic tools to analyze the system is a significant strength, as it provides a rigorous and quantitative framework for understanding the tradeoffs between distortion and budget.
One potential weakness of the paper is that the analysis is largely theoretical, and it is not clear how well the results will translate to practice. The authors provide some numerical results, but these are limited to a specific scenario, and it is not clear how robust the results are to changes in the parameters of the system. Additionally, the paper assumes that the workers' skill levels are unknown, which may not always be the case in practice.
In terms of significance, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of crowdsourcing by providing a rigorous and quantitative framework for understanding the tradeoffs between distortion and budget. The introduction of k-incidence coding is a significant innovation, and the analysis of its performance provides valuable insights into the design of crowdsourcing systems.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication. The paper is well-written, technically sound, and makes a significant contribution to the field. While there are some potential weaknesses, these are minor and do not detract from the overall quality of the paper.
