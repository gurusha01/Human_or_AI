This paper proposes a novel approach to estimating the coefficients of generalized linear models (GLMs) in the large-scale setting where the number of observations is much larger than the number of predictors. The authors show that the GLM coefficients are approximately proportional to the corresponding ordinary least squares (OLS) coefficients, and design an algorithm that achieves the same accuracy as the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) with a significantly reduced computational cost.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, related work, and their contributions. The proposed algorithm, called Scaled Least Squares (SLS), is simple and efficient, and the authors provide theoretical guarantees for its performance. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of SLS over other optimization algorithms, including Newton-Raphson, Newton-Stein, BFGS, LBFGS, gradient descent, and accelerated gradient descent.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel and efficient algorithm for estimating GLM coefficients in large-scale settings.
* The provision of theoretical guarantees for the performance of the algorithm.
* The demonstration of the superiority of the algorithm over other optimization algorithms through extensive numerical experiments.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The assumption of random design, which may not always hold in practice.
* The lack of comparison with other state-of-the-art algorithms for GLM estimation.
* The limited discussion of the potential applications and implications of the proposed algorithm.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the proposed algorithm has the potential to be a significant contribution to the field of machine learning and statistics. However, further research is needed to fully explore the potential of the algorithm and to address the limitations of the paper.
