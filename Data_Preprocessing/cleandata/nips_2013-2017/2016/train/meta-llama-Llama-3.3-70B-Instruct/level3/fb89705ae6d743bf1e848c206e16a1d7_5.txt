This paper proposes a novel approach to contextual semibandits, a problem that arises in various applications such as personalized search and recommendation systems. The authors develop two oracle-based algorithms, VCEE and EELS, for the cases where the weights are known and unknown, respectively. The technical quality of the paper is generally good, with a clear and well-organized presentation.
The strengths of the paper include the development of efficient algorithms with near-optimal regret bounds, which outperform existing approaches in experiments. The authors also provide a thorough analysis of the algorithms, including proofs of the regret bounds and discussions of the trade-offs between exploration and exploitation.
However, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement. The paper could benefit from more discussion on the importance of combining local field potentials and spikes, and the extra information it provides beyond conventional methods. Additionally, the authors could provide more results, such as showing the best fitting mixed vine-based model and explaining the performance of the independent model.
The approach is novel, but its potential usefulness is concerned due to feasibility issues in high-dimensional systems and controversial results. The authors should address these concerns and provide more evidence for the practical applicability of their approach.
