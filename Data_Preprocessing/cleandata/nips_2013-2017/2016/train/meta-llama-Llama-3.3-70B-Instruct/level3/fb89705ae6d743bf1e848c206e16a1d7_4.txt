This paper presents a method for constructing a joint model by iteratively combining bivariate copula models to describe the dependency structure of discrete and continuous random variables. The proposed method is verified through simulations of mixture signals of count and continuous data and applied to neural activity and stimulus conditions data, demonstrating the influence of dependency modeling on mutual information.
The method is considered practical and scalable for a larger number of neurons and LFPs, but may neglect higher-order dependency among signals, which could be addressed through comparison with other models like Gaussian copula. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed method, it would be beneficial to compare the performance of the vine copula model with a Gaussian copula model.
The results highlight the need for further discussion on the implications, particularly regarding the reduction of mutual information and potential redundant coding of stimulus conditions by count and LFP signals. The paper demonstrates the advantage of oracle-based approaches over both parametric approaches and naive exploration, making it a valuable contribution to the field.
