This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of computational economics, specifically in the area of automated mechanism design for combinatorial auctions. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the sample complexity of uniform convergence for various classes of deterministic combinatorial auctions, which is a crucial question in the study of mechanism design.
The paper is well-written, with a clear and comprehensive description of the concepts and methods used. The authors demonstrate a deep understanding of the underlying theory and provide a detailed analysis of the sample complexity bounds for different auction classes. The use of Rademacher complexity and pseudo-dimension to derive these bounds is a notable strength of the paper.
One of the key strengths of the paper is its ability to relate the performance of mechanisms in the search space over input samples to their expectation over the underlying, unknown distribution. This is a significant contribution to the field, as it provides a foundation for understanding how to design high-revenue combinatorial auctions in practice.
The paper also raises important questions about the complexity of designing optimal auctions, particularly in the context of multi-item auctions. The authors' analysis of the sample complexity bounds for different auction classes provides valuable insights into the trade-offs between the expressiveness of the auction class and the sample complexity required to achieve good performance.
Some potential areas for improvement include providing more context about the neuroscientific aspects of the research and relating the results to standard sparse coding approaches. Additionally, the paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the implications of the results for practice, particularly in terms of how the sample complexity bounds can be used to inform the design of real-world auctions.
Overall, the paper is a significant contribution to the field of computational economics and mechanism design. The authors' thorough analysis and clear presentation make the paper a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners alike.
