This paper presents two fundamental results on the population likelihood function of Gaussian mixture models with M â‰¥ 3 components. The first result shows that the population likelihood function has bad local maxima, even in the special case of equally-weighted mixtures of well-separated and spherical Gaussians. The second result demonstrates that the EM algorithm, as well as its first-order variant, with random initialization, converges to a bad critical point with high probability.
The paper is well-structured and clearly written, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments. The introduction provides a thorough background on Gaussian mixture models and the EM algorithm, and the problem setup is clearly defined. The main results are presented in a logical and coherent manner, with each section building on the previous one.
The strengths of the paper include its thorough analysis of the population likelihood function and the EM algorithm, as well as its clear and concise presentation. The authors provide a detailed proof of their results, which adds to the paper's credibility. The paper also raises important questions about the behavior of the EM algorithm and its variants, which are widely used in practice.
However, there are some weaknesses to the paper. One potential issue is that the results are limited to the population setting, and it is not clear how they generalize to finite samples. Additionally, the paper assumes that the mixture components are equally weighted and spherical, which may not always be the case in practice. The authors also do not provide any numerical experiments to illustrate their results, which would have been helpful in understanding the practical implications of their findings.
In terms of originality, the paper presents a new and interesting result on the population likelihood function of Gaussian mixture models. The authors' analysis of the EM algorithm and its variants is also novel and contributes to our understanding of these widely used algorithms. However, the paper builds on existing work in the field, and the authors acknowledge the contributions of previous researchers.
The significance of the paper lies in its implications for the use of the EM algorithm and its variants in practice. The authors' results suggest that careful initialization is required for these algorithms to converge to good solutions, even in seemingly benign problem instances. This has important implications for the development of new algorithms and initialization schemes, and highlights the need for further research in this area.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication, as it presents a thorough and well-written analysis of the population likelihood function of Gaussian mixture models and the EM algorithm. The paper's results are novel and significant, and contribute to our understanding of these widely used algorithms.
