This paper introduces a novel approach to analyzing nonlinear dynamical systems using the Koopman operator in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, resulting in efficiency gains in both synthetic and real data analysis problems. The contribution is well-motivated and experimentally validated, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method in various tasks, including system identification, long-term memorization, and speech prediction.
However, the paper could benefit from a clearer discussion of the differences between this work and existing research, such as the paper by Williams et al. Additionally, the lack of relevant references in the field of nonlinear dynamical system analysis with kernels is notable, including papers by L. Ralaivola and F. d'Alche Buc, Tuia et al, and others.
The performance of the Koopman operator in stochastic settings, which are more realistic, needs to be discussed and experimented with, as the current work mainly focuses on deterministic systems. Furthermore, the assumption of nonlinear pointwise relations in multidimensional time series and the causal assumption inherent in the setting need to be elaborated upon and discussed.
The experimental settings, while convincing, are not ambitious enough, and more comprehensive experiments, such as comparisons to state-of-the-art online change detection with kernels, are expected to support the development. The paper is well-written and clear, but minor typos, such as incorrect indices and punctuation, need to be corrected.
The strengths of the paper include its novel approach, thorough experimental validation, and potential impact on the field of nonlinear dynamical system analysis. However, the weaknesses, such as the lack of comparison to existing work and limited experimental settings, need to be addressed to further strengthen the paper.
