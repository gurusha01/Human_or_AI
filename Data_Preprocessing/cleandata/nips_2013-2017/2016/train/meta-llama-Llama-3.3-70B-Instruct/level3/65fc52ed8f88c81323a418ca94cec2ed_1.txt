This paper proposes a novel approach to unsupervised learning of similarities between large numbers of exemplars using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The authors address the issue of imbalanced training data by introducing a new training paradigm and loss function that combines CNN architecture with clustering algorithms. The approach is demonstrated on three standard datasets: Olympic images, Pose estimation, and the Pascal object recognition dataset, showing promising results.
The paper's strengths include its ability to learn fine-grained similarity structures, particularly in the context of posture analysis, and its competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches. The authors also provide a thorough experimental evaluation, including comparisons with other methods and an analysis of the learned similarity structures.
However, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement. The paper could benefit from additional analysis, such as reporting figures for different values of k, to further demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach. Additionally, there are some minor issues with the paper, including inconsistent initialization of features, unclear wording, and grammar/spelling errors that need to be addressed.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, originality, and significance. The approach is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The paper is clearly written, and the organization is logical and easy to follow. The approach is novel and differs from previous contributions, and the related work is adequately referenced.
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel approach to unsupervised learning of similarities between large numbers of exemplars using CNNs.
* The approach shows promising results on three standard datasets.
* The paper provides a thorough experimental evaluation, including comparisons with other methods and an analysis of the learned similarity structures.
Arguments con acceptance:
* The paper could benefit from additional analysis, such as reporting figures for different values of k.
* There are some minor issues with the paper, including inconsistent initialization of features, unclear wording, and grammar/spelling errors.
* The approach may not be widely applicable to other domains or tasks, and further evaluation is needed to demonstrate its generalizability.
Overall, I recommend accepting the paper, as it makes a significant contribution to the field of computer vision and provides a novel approach to unsupervised learning of similarities between large numbers of exemplars using CNNs. However, the authors should address the minor issues and provide additional analysis to further demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.
