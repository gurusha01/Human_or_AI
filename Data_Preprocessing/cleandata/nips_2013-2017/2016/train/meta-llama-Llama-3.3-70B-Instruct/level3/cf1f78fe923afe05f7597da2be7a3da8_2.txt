This paper proposes a novel manifold learning technique, called Riemannian Relaxation (RR), which embeds data in a low-dimensional space on a submanifold of the embedding space through gradient-based optimization. The key idea is to measure the distortion from isometry of any embedding using an estimate of the push-forward Riemannian metric into Euclidean space. The algorithm optimizes this distortion loss iteratively by projected gradient descent.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of the proposed method, including its theoretical foundations and computational aspects. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of RR in recovering the underlying geometry of the data, even in the presence of noise, and its ability to outperform other popular manifold learning algorithms, such as Isomap and Laplacian Eigenmaps.
However, there are some limitations and unclear aspects of the paper. The authors propose to use the intrinsic dimension d and the embedding dimension s as inputs, but it is not clear how to choose these parameters in practice. The authors suggest using the smallest d for which the loss is not too large, but this is not a well-defined criterion. Additionally, the paper lacks concrete examples of real-world problems that can be solved using this technique, and the practical applications of RR are not clearly demonstrated.
The paper also raises some questions about the novelty and significance of the proposed approach. The idea of using the push-forward Riemannian metric to measure distortion is not new, and similar approaches have been proposed in the past. The authors claim that their method is more effective and efficient than existing algorithms, but a more thorough comparison with other methods is needed to support this claim.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of the proposed method. The experiments are well-designed, and the results are convincing. However, the paper could benefit from more discussion on the limitations and potential extensions of the proposed approach.
In terms of clarity, the paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of the proposed method. The notation is consistent, and the figures and tables are well-organized and easy to understand.
In terms of originality, the paper proposes a novel approach to manifold learning, but the idea of using the push-forward Riemannian metric to measure distortion is not new. The authors claim that their method is more effective and efficient than existing algorithms, but a more thorough comparison with other methods is needed to support this claim.
In terms of significance, the paper demonstrates the effectiveness of RR in recovering the underlying geometry of the data, but the practical applications of this technique are not clearly demonstrated. The authors suggest that RR can be used for dimensionality reduction, data visualization, and clustering, but more concrete examples of real-world problems that can be solved using this technique are needed to support this claim.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of the proposed method. However, the paper could benefit from more discussion on the limitations and potential extensions of the proposed approach, as well as more concrete examples of real-world problems that can be solved using this technique.
