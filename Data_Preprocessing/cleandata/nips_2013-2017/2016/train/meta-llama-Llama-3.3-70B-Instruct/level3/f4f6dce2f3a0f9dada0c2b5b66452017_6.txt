This paper introduces a novel feature selection approach, CMICOT, which is an evolution of filter methods with sequential forward selection (SFS) based on conditional mutual information (MI). The proposed method addresses the limitation of existing MI-based SFS techniques, which can only account for low-order dependencies between features. CMICOT uses a two-stage greedy search and binary representatives of features to efficiently identify high-order feature interactions.
The paper is well-structured and clearly written, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments. The introduction provides a thorough background on feature selection methods and motivates the need for a new approach that can handle high-order dependencies. The proposed method is carefully explained, and the authors provide a detailed analysis of its computational complexity.
The experimental evaluation is extensive and well-designed, covering both synthetic and real-world datasets. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of CMICOT in identifying high-order feature interactions and its superiority over existing state-of-the-art methods. The authors also provide a thorough comparison with other interaction-aware filters, such as RelaxMRMR, IWFS, and RCDFS.
One of the strengths of the paper is its clarity and organization. The authors provide a clear overview of the proposed method, its components, and its advantages. The paper is also well-illustrated with figures and tables that help to support the authors' claims.
However, there are some areas that could be improved. For example, the paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the limitations of the proposed method and potential avenues for future research. Additionally, some of the notation and terminology used in the paper may be unfamiliar to readers without a strong background in information theory and feature selection.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets most of the criteria. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear summary of the main ideas and their relation to previous work. The paper also discusses the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed method and provides a thorough evaluation of its performance.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication. The proposed method is novel and effective, and the paper provides a thorough and well-organized presentation of the research. With some minor revisions to address the areas mentioned above, the paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of feature selection and machine learning.
