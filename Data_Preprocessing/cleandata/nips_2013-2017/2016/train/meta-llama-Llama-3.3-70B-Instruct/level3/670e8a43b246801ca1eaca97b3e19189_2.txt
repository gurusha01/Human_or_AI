This paper proposes a novel approach to online dictionary learning for brain imaging data, which incorporates a Laplacian penalty to impose spatial structure on the dictionary atoms. The resulting model, called Smooth-SODL, is shown to extract structured and denoised dictionaries that better capture inter-subject variability in small, medium, and large-scale regimes alike, compared to state-of-the-art models.
The paper has several strengths. Firstly, it addresses an important problem in neuroimaging, where defining regions of interest (ROIs) is a crucial step in statistical analysis. The proposed approach provides a principled way to define ROIs based on the variability of statistical maps across the population. Secondly, the paper proposes a novel and efficient algorithm for online dictionary learning, which adapts the online-learning dictionary-learning framework to incorporate spatial structure. The algorithm is shown to be scalable and efficient, with a running time that is only a factor of 2 or 3 slower than the vanilla dictionary-learning algorithm.
The paper also has some weaknesses. Firstly, the experimental evaluation is limited to a single dataset, and it would be beneficial to see the results replicated on other datasets. Secondly, the paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the relationship between the proposed model and existing approaches, such as clustering and PCA/ICA-based methods. Finally, the paper could be improved by providing more context and discussion of related work, particularly in the area of neuroimaging and brain connectivity analysis.
In terms of quality, the paper is well-written and clearly presented, with a good balance of technical detail and intuitive explanation. The claims made in the paper are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. However, the paper could benefit from more careful proofreading, as there are some minor errors in notation and formatting.
In terms of clarity, the paper is generally well-organized and easy to follow, with clear headings and concise paragraphs. However, some of the technical details, such as the derivation of the algorithm and the analysis of the Laplacian penalty, may be challenging for non-experts to follow.
In terms of originality, the paper proposes a novel approach to online dictionary learning, which incorporates a Laplacian penalty to impose spatial structure on the dictionary atoms. The paper also provides a detailed analysis of the relationship between the proposed model and existing approaches, and demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach through experimental evaluation.
In terms of significance, the paper addresses an important problem in neuroimaging, and provides a principled way to define ROIs based on the variability of statistical maps across the population. The proposed approach has the potential to improve the accuracy and interpretability of brain connectivity analysis, and could have significant implications for our understanding of brain function and behavior.
