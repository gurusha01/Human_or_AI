This paper proposes a novel approach to modeling and analyzing crowdsourcing systems using an information-theoretic framework. The authors aim to identify the ultimate fidelity that can be achieved by any form of query from the crowd and any decoding algorithm with a given budget. The paper presents a communication system model for crowdsourcing, where the crowd is modeled by a set of parallel noisy channels, and the query scheme and inference are represented by a joint source-channel coding scheme.
The paper's main contributions include the derivation of information-theoretic bounds on the minimum number of queries per item required to achieve a target fidelity, as well as the analysis of a specific query scheme called k-ary incidence coding. The authors also provide numerical results and compare them to the information-theoretic bounds.
However, I have several concerns regarding the paper. Firstly, the consistency of the Wasserstein training is questionable due to the shrinkage of the Gaussian example in section 4.3. This raises concerns about the statistical consistency of the proposed method. Additionally, the use of KL regularization in section 3 may weaken the "purity" of the smoothed Wasserstein objective function, potentially causing the clumping effect observed in the experiments.
The experiments in section 4 produce "compact and contiguous regions" that are less diverse than the data, which reinforces my concern about the consistency of the proposed method. I am also skeptical about the authors' attempt to spin the weaknesses of the method into strengths regarding data completion or denoising.
The title of the paper overclaims, as it only discusses training restricted Boltzmann machines, and the paper could be improved with clearer technical explanations and additional supplementary materials. Furthermore, the convergence rate of the proposed method is slow, with a rate of O(n^-1/(D+1)) for D dimensions, which raises concerns about the practicality of the method.
Overall, while the paper presents an interesting approach to modeling and analyzing crowdsourcing systems, it has several weaknesses that need to be addressed. The authors should provide more rigorous theoretical analysis and experimental results to support their claims, and clarify the limitations and potential applications of their method.
