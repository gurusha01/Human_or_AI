This paper presents a theoretical analysis of the support recovery guarantees of underdetermined sparse regression using the `1-norm as a regularizer and a non-smooth loss function for data fidelity. The authors focus on the cases of `1 and `∞ losses and provide a sharp condition that ensures the stability of the support of the vector to recover. The paper also includes numerical simulations to illustrate the theoretical findings on a compressed sensing scenario.
The strengths of the paper include its novel proof strategy, which addresses the difficulties arising from non-smoothness, and its ability to provide sharp theoretical guarantees for stable support recovery under small enough noise. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the relationship between the support stability and the choice of loss function, which is an important contribution to the field.
However, there are some weaknesses in the paper. Firstly, the paper lacks experimental results on simulation domains or real applications to demonstrate the algorithm's practicability and effectiveness. This makes it difficult to assess the impact of the proposed method in real-world scenarios. Secondly, the paper requires further proof-reading to correct numerous typos and grammatical errors throughout the text, which can make it difficult to follow. Finally, some concepts, such as "opened" and Figure 3, need to be explained and clarified for better understanding.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis. However, the lack of experimental results and the need for further proof-reading detract from the overall quality of the paper. In terms of clarity, the paper is well-organized, but some sections are dense and require careful reading. The authors provide enough information for the expert reader to reproduce the results, but some concepts could be explained more clearly.
In terms of originality, the paper presents a novel combination of familiar techniques and provides a new perspective on the problem of support recovery guarantees. The authors extend the existing theory from the smooth `2 case to the non-smooth cases of `1 and `∞ losses, which is a significant contribution to the field. In terms of significance, the paper addresses a difficult problem in a better way than previous research and provides unique insights into the relationship between the support stability and the choice of loss function.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, but with revisions to address the weaknesses mentioned above. The authors should provide experimental results on simulation domains or real applications, proof-read the paper carefully to correct errors, and clarify some concepts for better understanding. With these revisions, the paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of sparse regression and support recovery guarantees.
