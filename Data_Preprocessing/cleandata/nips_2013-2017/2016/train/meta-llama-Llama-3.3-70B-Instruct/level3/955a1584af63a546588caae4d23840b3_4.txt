This paper proposes a novel approach to learning deep feature embeddings by introducing a Position-Dependent Deep Metric (PDDM) unit. The PDDM unit learns a local-adaptive similarity metric that can be used to select high-quality hard samples in a local neighborhood, which in turn guides the deep embedding learning in an online and robust manner. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on two challenging image retrieval datasets, CUB-200-2011 and CARS196, and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art deep embedding methods.
The paper is well-written and provides a clear explanation of the proposed approach. The authors also provide a thorough analysis of the related work and demonstrate the advantages of their approach over existing methods. The experimental results are impressive, and the authors provide a detailed analysis of the results, including the benefits of using the PDDM unit and the double-header hinge loss.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to learn a local-adaptive similarity metric that can adapt to the heterogeneous feature distribution in the embedding space. This is a significant improvement over existing methods that rely on a global Euclidean metric, which can be suboptimal in the presence of complex feature variations.
However, there are some areas where the paper could be improved. For example, the authors could provide more details on the implementation of the PDDM unit and the double-header hinge loss. Additionally, the authors could provide more analysis on the robustness of the results and the sensitivity of the approach to hyperparameters.
