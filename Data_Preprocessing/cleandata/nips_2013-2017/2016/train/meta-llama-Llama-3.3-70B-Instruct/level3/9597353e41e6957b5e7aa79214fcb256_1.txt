This paper proposes a framework for semi-supervised active clustering (SSAC) where the learner interacts with a domain expert to answer pairwise same-cluster queries. The authors study the query and computational complexity of clustering in this framework, providing a tradeoff between query complexity and computational efficiency. The main contributions include a probabilistic polynomial-time algorithm for clustering with queries under a margin assumption and NP-hardness results for minimizing k-means cost without queries or with weaker margin conditions.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the problem formulation, algorithm, and theoretical results. The introduction provides a good background on the challenges of clustering and the need for semi-supervised approaches. The related work section is comprehensive, discussing various supervision methods in clustering and the computational complexity of clustering tasks.
The algorithm proposed in the paper is efficient, making O(k^2 log k + k log n) same-cluster queries and running in O(kn log n) time. The authors also provide a lower bound on the number of queries needed to solve the problem, showing that at least Î©(log k + log n) queries are required.
The paper's strengths include its novel approach to semi-supervised clustering, its efficient algorithm, and its thorough theoretical analysis. The authors also provide a clear discussion of the implications of their results and potential future directions.
However, there are some potential weaknesses and areas for improvement. The margin assumption, while reasonable, may not always hold in practice. The authors could explore more robust algorithms that can handle violations of this assumption. Additionally, the paper could benefit from more experimental evaluations to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in real-world scenarios.
Some potential future directions include exploring extensions to the model, such as handling mistakes made by the oracle or using an oracle that is misaligned with the k-means optimum. The authors could also investigate the application of their framework to other clustering algorithms, such as k-medians or hierarchical clustering.
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of clustering and semi-supervised learning. Its thorough theoretical analysis and efficient algorithm make it a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the field.
