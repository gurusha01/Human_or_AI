This paper proposes a robust k-means algorithm (RKM) that uses a Moreau envelope to incorporate outlier detection into the traditional k-means clustering framework. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the robustness and consistency properties of RKM, including its breakdown point and convergence rates. The paper also compares RKM to trimmed k-means (TKM) and shows that they share similar performance on synthetic data.
The strengths of the paper include its rigorous theoretical analysis, which provides valuable insights into the behavior of RKM under different scenarios. The authors also demonstrate the effectiveness of RKM on synthetic data, which suggests its potential for real-world applications. Additionally, the comparison to TKM provides a useful benchmark for evaluating the performance of RKM.
However, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement. One issue is that the paper assumes a specific form for the proximal map, which may not be applicable in all cases. The authors also note that RKM may not be robust against all types of contamination, which limits its applicability. Furthermore, the convergence rates of RKM are not explicitly stated, which makes it difficult to compare its performance to other algorithms.
To improve the paper, the authors could provide more details on the convergence rates of RKM and explore more general forms for the proximal map. They could also investigate the performance of RKM on real-world data and compare it to other robust clustering algorithms. Additionally, the authors could consider addressing the issue of outliers in the initial stage of the algorithm, which may affect its overall performance.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, and originality. The authors provide a clear and well-organized presentation of their work, and the paper is well-written and easy to follow. The paper also makes a significant contribution to the field of robust clustering, which is a topic of interest to the NIPS community.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper provides a rigorous theoretical analysis of RKM, which is a significant contribution to the field of robust clustering.
* The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of RKM on synthetic data, which suggests its potential for real-world applications.
* The comparison to TKM provides a useful benchmark for evaluating the performance of RKM.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The paper assumes a specific form for the proximal map, which may not be applicable in all cases.
* RKM may not be robust against all types of contamination, which limits its applicability.
* The convergence rates of RKM are not explicitly stated, which makes it difficult to compare its performance to other algorithms.
Overall, I would recommend accepting the paper, but with some revisions to address the issues mentioned above. The authors should provide more details on the convergence rates of RKM and explore more general forms for the proximal map. They should also investigate the performance of RKM on real-world data and compare it to other robust clustering algorithms.
