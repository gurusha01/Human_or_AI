This paper proposes a novel idea of conditional generative moment-matching networks (CGMMN) that learn a conditional distribution given some input variables based on a conditional maximum mean discrepancy (CMMD) criterion. The idea of preventing excessive "churn" is reasonable and the proposed regularization method seems appropriate. The paper is well-written and provides a clear explanation of the proposed method, including the theoretical background and experimental results.
The strengths of the paper include the novelty of the proposed idea, the clarity of the explanation, and the competitiveness of the results in various tasks, including predictive modeling, contextual generation, and Bayesian dark knowledge. The paper also provides a good overview of the related work and clearly explains how the proposed method differs from previous contributions.
However, there are some weaknesses in the paper. The theoretical results lack practical guidance on choosing parameters alpha and epsilon, which could be a limitation for practitioners. Additionally, the method in Section 2.2 is mislabeled as Markov chain Monte Carlo when it should be referred to as just a Markov chain.
Here is a list of arguments pro and con acceptance:
Pros:
* The paper proposes a novel idea that has the potential to generate new research directions.
* The results presented in the paper are good and noteworthy.
* The paper is well-written and provides a clear explanation of the proposed method.
Cons:
* The theoretical results lack practical guidance on choosing parameters alpha and epsilon.
* The method in Section 2.2 is mislabeled as Markov chain Monte Carlo.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper as it provides a novel and interesting contribution to the field of deep generative models. However, the authors should be asked to address the weaknesses mentioned above, particularly providing more practical guidance on choosing parameters alpha and epsilon.
