This paper presents a modification to the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) algorithm, a popular derivative-free optimization method. The authors propose replacing the matrix square root in the CMA-ES with a triangular Cholesky factor, leading to a new algorithm called Cholesky-CMA-ES. This change reduces the time complexity of the covariance update from O(d^3) to O(μd^2), where μ is the number of updates and d is the dimensionality of the search space.
The paper provides a thorough analysis of the Cholesky-CMA-ES, including a theoretical justification for the convergence of the algorithm and empirical results demonstrating its performance on various benchmark functions. The authors show that the Cholesky-CMA-ES requires the same number of function evaluations as the standard CMA-ES but significantly reduces the wall-clock time, especially for high-dimensional problems.
The strengths of the paper include its clear and well-organized presentation, thorough analysis, and empirical evaluation. The authors provide a detailed explanation of the CMA-ES algorithm and its modification, making it easy to follow for readers familiar with the topic. The empirical results are convincing, demonstrating the superiority of the Cholesky-CMA-ES over other CMA-ES variants.
However, there are some weaknesses to consider. The paper assumes a significant amount of background knowledge in optimization and linear algebra, which might make it challenging for readers without this expertise to fully appreciate the contributions. Additionally, the authors could have provided more discussion on the limitations of the Cholesky-CMA-ES, such as its scalability to extremely high-dimensional problems or its performance on non-convex functions.
