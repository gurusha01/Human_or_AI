This paper introduces a novel method for compiling arithmetic circuits for graphical models by multiplying Probabilistic Sentential Decision Diagrams (PSDDs), providing a simplified and efficient approach. The authors demonstrate that PSDDs support a polytime multiplication operator, making them suitable for a broader class of applications. The paper also shows that PSDDs do not support a polytime summing-out operation, which is a limitation of this approach.
The strengths of this paper include its clear and well-organized presentation, as well as its thorough evaluation of the proposed method. The authors provide a detailed analysis of the time and space complexity of their algorithm, and they demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments on various benchmarks. The paper also provides a good overview of related work in the field, highlighting the advantages and limitations of different approaches.
One potential weakness of the paper is that the title may not accurately reflect its content. A more descriptive title, such as "Efficient AC Compilation of Graphical Models via PSDD Multiplication," might better convey the focus of the paper. Additionally, the reviewer questions the naming of PSDDs, suggesting that they may be algebraic generalizations of Sentential Decision Diagrams (SDDs), and proposes the term Algebraic Sentential Decision Diagrams (ASDDs) as a more general terminology.
The reviewer also seeks clarification on whether decomposability and determinism are required for efficient inference in the size of an arithmetic circuit, and whether there are cases where inference is less tractable without these properties. Furthermore, the implementation of the cache in Algorithm 1 is unclear, and the reviewer asks for an explanation of how it is implemented, particularly whether it is based on recursive caching of subcircuits.
In terms of originality, the paper presents a novel approach to compiling arithmetic circuits for graphical models, and the use of PSDDs is a significant contribution to the field. The paper also provides a thorough analysis of the time and space complexity of the proposed algorithm, which is an important aspect of evaluating its effectiveness.
The significance of this paper lies in its potential to improve the efficiency of probabilistic inference in graphical models. The proposed method has the potential to be used in a wide range of applications, including computer vision, natural language processing, and decision-making under uncertainty.
Overall, this paper is well-written, well-organized, and provides a significant contribution to the field of probabilistic graphical models. The proposed method has the potential to improve the efficiency of probabilistic inference, and the paper provides a thorough analysis of its time and space complexity.
