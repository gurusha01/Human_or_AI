This paper proposes a novel discriminant dimensionality reduction algorithm, Large Margin Discriminant Dimensionality Reduction (LADDER), which jointly learns the mapping and linear classifiers in an efficient manner. The method is based on a duality between boosting and Support Vector Machines (SVM), where both methods maximize the margin using a combination of mapping and linear classification. The authors argue that the intermediate mapping, i.e., the boosting predictor, preserves the discriminant aspects of the data and can be used as a dimensionality reduction operator.
The paper is well-written, and the method is well-explained. The authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the background and related work, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The use of boosting and SVM as a basis for the method is innovative, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of the duality between the two methods.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel discriminant dimensionality reduction algorithm that jointly learns the mapping and linear classifiers.
* The use of a duality between boosting and SVM as a basis for the method.
* The provision of a clear and concise introduction to the background and related work.
* The demonstration of the effectiveness of the proposed method through experimental results.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The method's novelty is somewhat questionable, as the idea of using boosting and SVM for dimensionality reduction is not entirely new.
* The authors could provide more details on the implementation of the method, such as the choice of hyperparameters and the computational complexity.
* The experimental results could be more comprehensive, including comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods and an analysis of the sensitivity of the method to different parameters.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the proposed method is innovative and effective. However, the authors could address some of the weaknesses mentioned above to make the paper more comprehensive and convincing.
