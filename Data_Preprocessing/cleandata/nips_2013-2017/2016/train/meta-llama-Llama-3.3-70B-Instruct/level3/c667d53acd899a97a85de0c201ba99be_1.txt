This paper explores the sample complexity of automated mechanism design for maximizing revenue in combinatorial auctions, providing upper bounds for various auction classes. The authors study a hierarchy of deterministic combinatorial auction (CA) families, including VCG-based mechanisms, and examine specific auction classes such as AMA, VVCA, lambda-auction, MBARPs, and MBA. The paper provides negative results for AMA, VVCA, and lambda-auction, including exponential upper bounds on Rademacher complexity and sample complexity, as well as exponential lower bounds for lambda-auction and VVCA.
In contrast, the authors provide positive results for the less general models MBARPs and MBA, including polynomial upper bounds on sample complexity and pseudo-dimension for MBA with 2 bidders and generalized results for n bidders. The paper builds upon previous work on "learning simple auctions" and provides more general results for broader classes of auctions.
The strengths of this paper include its thorough analysis of the sample complexity of various auction classes, its provision of both upper and lower bounds, and its consideration of the learning theoretic implications of its results. The authors also provide a clear and well-organized presentation of their work, making it easy to follow and understand.
However, one potential weakness of the paper is that the results may not be exciting enough for publication in NIPS, as the conference tends to favor papers with more significant and innovative contributions. Additionally, the paper's focus on theoretical analysis may limit its appeal to practitioners who are more interested in applied work.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper provides a thorough and well-organized analysis of the sample complexity of various auction classes.
* The authors provide both upper and lower bounds, giving a complete picture of the sample complexity of each auction class.
* The paper considers the learning theoretic implications of its results, making it of interest to the broader machine learning community.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The results may not be significant or innovative enough for publication in NIPS.
* The paper's focus on theoretical analysis may limit its appeal to practitioners.
* The paper may not provide enough new insights or contributions to the field of automated mechanism design.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication in NIPS, as it provides a thorough and well-organized analysis of the sample complexity of various auction classes and considers the learning theoretic implications of its results. However, the authors may need to revise their paper to address the potential weaknesses mentioned above and to make their results more exciting and innovative.
