This paper proposes a novel approach to manifold learning, introducing a new measure of distortion from isometry, called the Riemannian Relaxation (RR) algorithm. The algorithm optimizes the push-forward Riemannian metric of the embedding, which directly measures the deviation from isometry. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through various experiments, including comparisons with existing embedding algorithms.
The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with a clear introduction to the problem and a thorough explanation of the proposed algorithm. The authors provide a detailed analysis of the properties of the distortion loss and its relation to the push-forward Riemannian metric. The experimental evaluation is comprehensive, including a range of datasets and comparisons with other algorithms.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to handle embeddings with s > d dimensions, which is a significant improvement over existing algorithms that only work for s = d. The authors also provide a clear explanation of how to choose the intrinsic dimension d and the embedding dimension s, which is a crucial aspect of manifold learning.
However, there are some areas that require further clarification and improvement. The runtime analysis of the proposed algorithm is missing, and the authors should provide a detailed lemma to summarize its runtime and performance. Additionally, the claim that the algorithm runs significantly faster than others needs more rigorous analysis and experimental evidence to support it.
The use of the parameter Purity to measure algorithm performance needs further discussion and clarification on its meaning and relation to misclassified nodes. Furthermore, the authors should correct the typo on Line 224, which reads "By and large".
In terms of originality, the paper proposes a novel approach to manifold learning, which is a significant contribution to the field. The authors provide a clear explanation of how their approach differs from previous contributions and adequately reference related work.
The significance of the paper lies in its ability to provide a new and effective way to measure distortion from isometry, which is a fundamental problem in manifold learning. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through various experiments, which shows the potential of their algorithm to be used in a wide range of applications.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the proposed algorithm is a significant contribution to the field of manifold learning. With some minor revisions to address the areas mentioned above, the paper has the potential to be a strong candidate for acceptance.
