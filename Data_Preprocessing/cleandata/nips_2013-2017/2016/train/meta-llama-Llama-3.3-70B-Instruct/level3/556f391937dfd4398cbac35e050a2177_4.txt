This paper proposes a novel approach to domain adaptation in deep networks, which enables the joint learning of adaptive classifiers and transferable features from labeled data in the source domain and unlabeled data in the target domain. The authors introduce a Residual Transfer Network (RTN) that relaxes the shared-classifier assumption made by previous methods and assumes that the source classifier and target classifier differ by a residual function. The RTN approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on standard domain adaptation benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in learning adaptive classifiers and transferable features.
The paper is well-written, with clear logic and well-designed figures that demonstrate the promising results of the RTN approach in image retrieval and transfer learning tasks. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the effectiveness of their approach, including ablation studies and comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods. The use of tensor product to fuse features of multiple layers and the introduction of a residual transfer module to bridge the source classifier and target classifier are notable contributions of this work.
However, there are some areas that require further clarification and improvement. For example, the authors could provide a more formalized description of comparative methods to emphasize the improvement and advantage of the proposed method. Additionally, more analysis is needed to understand the effectiveness of concatenating feature difference vector and feature mean vector in the PDDM unit. The end-to-end training architecture, particularly the hard quadruplet mining process during the forward pass, requires further clarification. Furthermore, the authors should justify whether the number of samples used for training is sufficient, especially for fine-tuning the CNN part and training the fully-connected layers of the PDDM unit.
Overall, this paper presents a significant contribution to the field of domain adaptation, and with some revisions to address the aforementioned concerns, it has the potential to be a strong candidate for acceptance. The strengths of the paper include its novel approach to domain adaptation, its well-designed experiments, and its thorough analysis of the results. The weaknesses include the need for further clarification on some aspects of the methodology and the potential for improvement in the presentation and analysis of the results.
