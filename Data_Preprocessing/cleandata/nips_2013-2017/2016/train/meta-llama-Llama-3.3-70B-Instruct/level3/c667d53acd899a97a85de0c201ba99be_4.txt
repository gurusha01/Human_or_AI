This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the sample complexity of automated mechanism design for revenue maximization in combinatorial auctions. The authors provide tight sample complexity bounds for various classes of auctions, including affine maximizer auctions (AMAs), virtual valuation combinatorial auctions (VVCAs), λ-auctions, mixed bundling auctions (MBAs), and mixed bundling auctions with reserve prices (MBARPs).
The paper's main contribution is the derivation of uniform convergence sample complexity bounds for these auction classes, which is a fundamental problem in automated mechanism design. The authors use Rademacher complexity and pseudo-dimension to analyze the sample complexity of these classes, providing both upper and lower bounds. The results show that more structured classes, such as MBAs and MBARPs, require drastically fewer samples to learn over than more general classes like AMAs and VVCAs.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem and the relevant background material. The technical sections are also well-organized, and the proofs are thorough and easy to follow. The authors also provide a detailed discussion of related work, highlighting the significance of their contributions.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to provide a unified framework for analyzing the sample complexity of various auction classes. The authors' use of Rademacher complexity and pseudo-dimension provides a powerful tool for analyzing the sample complexity of these classes, and their results have important implications for the design of automated mechanism design algorithms.
However, the paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the implications of the results for practice. While the authors provide some intuition about the significance of their results, it would be helpful to have a more concrete discussion of how these results can be used to inform the design of automated mechanism design algorithms.
Additionally, the paper raises an interesting question about the role of uniform convergence in the negative results. The authors show that uniform convergence is necessary for the sample complexity bounds to hold, but it is not clear how this relates to the underlying distribution over bidder valuations. Further exploration of this question could provide additional insights into the nature of automated mechanism design.
Overall, the paper is a significant contribution to the field of automated mechanism design, and its results have important implications for the design of algorithms for revenue maximization in combinatorial auctions. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem and the relevant background material.
