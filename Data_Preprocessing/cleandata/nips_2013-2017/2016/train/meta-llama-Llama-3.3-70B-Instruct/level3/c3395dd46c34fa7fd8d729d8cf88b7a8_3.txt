This paper proposes two new optimization methods, a gradient-free method and a gradient-based method, for solving a non-convex loss-minimization problem in the context of learning a web-page ranking algorithm. The problem is formulated as a Supervised PageRank model, which takes into account features of nodes and edges in a graph. The authors provide theoretical guarantees on the convergence rate and complexity bounds for both methods.
The paper is well-structured and clearly written, with a comprehensive discussion of prior and related work. The authors provide a detailed description of the proposed methods, including the gradient-free method with inexact zero-order oracle and the adaptive gradient method with inexact first-order oracle. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, outperforming the state-of-the-art gradient-based method on a web page ranking problem.
One of the strengths of the paper is the thorough analysis of the proposed methods, including the convergence rate and complexity bounds. The authors also provide a detailed discussion of the trade-off between the accuracy of the lower-level algorithm and the computational complexity of the two-level algorithm. The experimental results are also well-presented, with a clear comparison of the proposed methods with the state-of-the-art method.
However, there are some areas that could be improved. The notation used in the paper could be clarified, with a clear distinction between bold and non-bold letters for different variables. Additionally, some of the examples, such as the grid navigation example, could be further elaborated to help readers understand the scenario and analysis.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, originality, and significance. The paper is technically sound, with well-supported claims and a clear presentation of the results. The writing is clear and well-organized, making it easy to follow. The proposed methods are novel and contribute to the field of optimization and machine learning. The results are significant, with potential practical impact on the development of web-page ranking algorithms.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication, with some minor revisions to address the areas mentioned above. The paper makes a significant contribution to the field and has the potential to impact the development of web-page ranking algorithms.
