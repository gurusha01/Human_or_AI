This paper proposes a novel approach to learning deep feature embeddings, called Position-Dependent Deep Metric (PDDM), which adapts to the local feature structure in a heterogeneous space. The authors argue that the traditional global Euclidean distance metric is suboptimal for hard sample mining, and propose a learnable similarity metric that incorporates the absolute feature position. The PDDM unit is designed to be pluggable to any convolutional neural network (CNN) and can be trained end-to-end.
The paper makes a solid contribution to the problem of learning with missing attributes, and the proposed approach has several strengths. Firstly, the PDDM unit is able to learn a locally adaptive metric that is more effective in selecting genuinely hard samples for deep embedding learning. Secondly, the double-header hinge loss function is designed to separate the similarity distributions of positive and negative pairs, which leads to a more robust and efficient optimization process. Thirdly, the joint optimization of the metric and embedding losses enables the model to learn a more discriminative feature embedding.
The experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach in image retrieval tasks, with significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods. The authors also show that the learned feature embedding generalizes well to new classes in transfer learning and zero-shot learning scenarios.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of the proposed approach. The related work section is comprehensive, and the authors provide a thorough discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of existing methods.
