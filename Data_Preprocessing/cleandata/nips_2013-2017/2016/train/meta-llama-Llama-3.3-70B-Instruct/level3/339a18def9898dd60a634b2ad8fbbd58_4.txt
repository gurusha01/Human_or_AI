This paper presents a novel approach to modeling and analyzing crowdsourcing systems using an information theoretic framework. The authors map the crowdsourcing system to a joint source-channel coding problem, where the taskmaster's queries are the channel inputs and the workers' responses are the channel outputs. The goal is to identify the ultimate fidelity that can be achieved by any form of query from the crowd and any decoding algorithm with a given budget.
The paper defines the total number of queries presented to workers as the budget of the crowdsourcing system and studies the trade-off between budget and fidelity. A lower bound on the budget for a desirable fidelity level is obtained from standard results in information theory literature, which is independent of the schemes used by the taskmaster and crowdsourcer.
The authors analyze the performance of a specific scheme, k-ary incidence coding, and compare it with the obtained information theoretic lower bound for a specific channel model. The results show that the k-ary incidence coding scheme can achieve better performance than the lower bound, especially for larger values of k.
However, the reviewer finds the parallel between the rate-distortion framework and crowdsourcing system interesting, but questions the realism of the model, particularly in assuming all workers receive the same number of queries regardless of skill level. The reviewer also raises concerns about the channel models used to account for worker unreliability and suggests considering adversarial workers who may intentionally degrade fidelity.
Furthermore, the reviewer critiques the clarity of numerical results, labeling of curves, and notation, and suggests improvements to the presentation and consistency of terminology. The paper could benefit from more detailed explanations of the channel models and the k-ary incidence coding scheme, as well as more comprehensive numerical results to illustrate the performance of the proposed scheme.
Overall, the paper presents a novel and interesting approach to modeling and analyzing crowdsourcing systems, but requires further refinement and clarification to make it more accessible and convincing to the reader. The strengths of the paper include its originality, technical soundness, and potential impact on the field of crowdsourcing. However, the weaknesses include the lack of realism in the model, limited channel models, and unclear presentation.
