This paper proposes a novel approach to unsupervised risk estimation, which enables the estimation of a model's test error from unlabeled data, without assuming that the optimal predictor is the same between train and test, or that the true distribution lies in any parametric family. The authors leverage the method of moments to exploit conditional independencies in the absence of a fully-specified model, allowing them to estimate the risk without explicitly estimating the full loss distribution.
The paper is well-written, clearly presenting the research questions and contributions, with no obvious flaws. The proposed algorithm builds upon existing estimators of the Laplace-Beltrami operator and push-forward metric, comparing favorably to state-of-the-art embedding algorithms. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the algorithm's performance, including a discussion of the sample complexity and runtime.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to handle complex, continuous, and structured losses, including the log loss for conditional random fields. The authors also provide a gradient-based learning algorithm, which enables unsupervised learning and domain adaptation. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, showing that it can estimate the risk and perform unsupervised domain adaptation, even with limited labeled data from the source domain.
However, one limitation of the proposed approach is that it does not provide clear guidance on setting the embedding dimension and intrinsic dimension parameters. Additionally, the three-view assumption, which is central to the framework, may not always hold in practice. The authors acknowledge this limitation and pose open questions regarding the estimation of risk in settings with dependent views or only two independent views.
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of unsupervised learning and domain adaptation, providing a novel and effective approach to risk estimation and learning. The authors' use of the method of moments and conditional independencies is innovative and well-motivated, and the experimental results demonstrate the practical effectiveness of the approach.
