This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm for estimating parameters of statistical models, specifically in the context of Gaussian mixture models. The authors provide a global analysis of EM, characterizing the stationary points and dynamics of the algorithm in the large sample limit. The paper makes significant contributions to the understanding of EM, including a new characterization of the stationary points and dynamics of EM in two simple yet popular Gaussian mixture models.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the background and related work. The technical sections are also well-organized, and the proofs of the main results are provided in the appendix. The authors demonstrate a good understanding of the previous work on EM and provide a thorough analysis of the algorithm's behavior.
The main strengths of the paper are:
* The authors provide a global analysis of EM, which is a significant improvement over previous work that only considered local convergence properties.
* The paper presents a comprehensive characterization of the stationary points and dynamics of EM in two Gaussian mixture models.
* The authors demonstrate the statistical consistency of EM in the large sample limit, which is an important result for the application of EM in practice.
However, there are some limitations to the paper:
* The analysis is limited to Gaussian mixture models, and it is not clear how the results generalize to other latent variable models.
* The paper assumes that the sample size is large, which may not always be the case in practice.
* The authors do not provide a clear comparison with other optimization algorithms, such as gradient ascent, which could be used to maximize the log-likelihood function.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the authors make significant contributions to the understanding of EM. The results are important for the application of EM in practice, and the paper provides a good foundation for future work on the analysis of EM and other optimization algorithms.
