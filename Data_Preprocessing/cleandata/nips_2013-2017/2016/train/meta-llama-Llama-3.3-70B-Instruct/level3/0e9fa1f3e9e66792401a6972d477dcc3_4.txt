This paper presents a novel method, AutoBDMC, for assessing MCMC convergence using the Bidirectional Monte Carlo method to compute stochastic upper and lower bounds for the log marginal likelihood. The method provides a single scalar quantity to assess MCMC convergence behavior by bounding the Jensen-Shannon divergence between the true posterior and the distribution of approximate samples. The authors demonstrate the method's usefulness for model selection and debugging purposes and provide experimental evidence that its analyses on synthetic data are predictive of behavior on real-world data.
The paper is generally well-motivated and readable, but some sections, such as Section 3, are harder to follow due to a lack of motivation and unclear definitions. The paper lacks a clear definition of AutoBDMC, and there are some notational inconsistencies and minor errors, such as inconsistent use of variables and unclear WebPPL code instructions.
The strengths of the paper include its novel approach to assessing MCMC convergence, its ability to provide a single scalar quantity to assess convergence behavior, and its potential for model selection and debugging. The weaknesses of the paper include its lack of clarity in some sections, notational inconsistencies, and minor errors.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper scores well on originality, as it presents a novel method for assessing MCMC convergence. The paper also scores well on significance, as it has the potential to improve the accuracy and reliability of MCMC-based inference methods. However, the paper could be improved in terms of clarity and presentation, particularly in Section 3.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper presents a novel and potentially useful method for assessing MCMC convergence.
* The method has the potential to improve the accuracy and reliability of MCMC-based inference methods.
* The paper provides experimental evidence that its analyses on synthetic data are predictive of behavior on real-world data.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The paper lacks clarity in some sections, particularly Section 3.
* There are notational inconsistencies and minor errors throughout the paper.
* The paper could be improved in terms of presentation and clarity.
Overall, I would recommend accepting the paper, but with revisions to address the issues mentioned above. The paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of MCMC-based inference methods, and with some revisions, it could be even stronger.
