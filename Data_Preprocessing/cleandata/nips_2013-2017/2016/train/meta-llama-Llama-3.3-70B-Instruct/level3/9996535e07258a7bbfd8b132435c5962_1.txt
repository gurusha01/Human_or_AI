This paper proposes a novel extension to the encoder-decoder framework, called the review network, which introduces an intermediate "reviewer" module to predict fact vectors and improve performance in tasks like image captioning. The reviewer module performs multiple review steps with attention on the encoder hidden states, outputting thought vectors that capture global properties in a compact representation. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the review network on two tasks: image captioning and source code captioning, showing consistent improvement over conventional encoder-decoders.
The strength of the paper lies in its interesting idea, experimental evaluation on two tasks, and generalization over normal encoder-decoder approaches. The authors provide a clear and well-organized presentation of their model, including a detailed description of the reviewer module and its variants. The experimental results are thorough, with comparisons to state-of-the-art systems on the MSCOCO evaluation server and a benchmark dataset for source code captioning.
However, there are some weaknesses in the paper. One major concern is the comparison of results on unofficial test sets instead of official leaderboards, such as the COOC leaderboard for image captioning. This makes it difficult to directly compare the results to other state-of-the-art systems. Additionally, the paper lacks human evaluation for caption generation, relying solely on automatic evaluation metrics, which can be misleading. The supervision injection method for the source code caption experiment is not clearly explained in Section 4.2, which needs to be addressed.
Despite these weaknesses, the author's response has addressed some of the concerns, and I recommend accepting the paper with the inclusion of additional results and clarification on certain points. The paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of natural language processing and computer vision, and its ideas and results are likely to be of interest to researchers and practitioners in these areas. Overall, the paper demonstrates a good balance of technical soundness, clarity, originality, and significance, making it a strong candidate for acceptance. 
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide enough information for the expert reader to reproduce the results. The related work is adequately referenced, and the authors clearly explain how their work differs from previous contributions. The paper addresses a difficult problem in a better way than previous research and advances the state of the art in a demonstrable way. 
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The paper is a complete piece of work, and the authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of the work. The clarity of the paper is good, and the organization is well-structured, making it easy to follow. The originality of the paper is high, and the authors propose a novel combination of familiar techniques. The significance of the paper is also high, and the results are important and likely to be used by other researchers and practitioners. 
Overall, I believe that the paper makes a significant contribution to the field and has the potential to be a high-impact publication. With some revisions to address the weaknesses mentioned above, the paper can be even stronger and more convincing.
