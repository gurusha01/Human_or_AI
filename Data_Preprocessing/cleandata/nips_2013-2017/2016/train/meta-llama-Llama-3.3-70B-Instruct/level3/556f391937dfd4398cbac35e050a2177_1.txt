This paper proposes a novel approach to learning deep feature embeddings by introducing a Position-Dependent Deep Metric (PDDM) unit. The PDDM unit adaptively measures local feature similarity in a heterogeneous space, enabling high-quality online hard sample mining to guide the embedding learning. The authors formulate a double-header hinge loss function to optimize both the similarity metric and feature embedding under a large margin criterion.
The paper is well-written, and the proposed approach is novel and interesting. The experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the learned feature embedding in challenging image retrieval tasks and its potential for generalizing to new classes in large and open set scenarios, such as transfer learning and zero-shot learning.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel PDDM unit that adaptively measures local feature similarity, which is valuable for high-quality online hard sample mining.
* The formulation of a double-header hinge loss function that optimizes both the similarity metric and feature embedding under a large margin criterion.
* The demonstration of the efficacy of the learned feature embedding in challenging image retrieval tasks and its potential for generalizing to new classes in large and open set scenarios.
However, there are some weaknesses and questions that need to be addressed:
* The importance of the embedding loss E_e in Equation (4) and the computation of features for hard negative mining are unclear and require further clarification.
* The PDDM score and Quadruplet+PDDM rows in Table 1 raise questions and need to be explained in more detail.
* The paper could benefit from more analysis and discussion on the hyperparameters and their impact on the performance of the proposed approach.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the proposed approach is novel and interesting. With some clarifications and additional analysis, the paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of deep learning and computer vision.
