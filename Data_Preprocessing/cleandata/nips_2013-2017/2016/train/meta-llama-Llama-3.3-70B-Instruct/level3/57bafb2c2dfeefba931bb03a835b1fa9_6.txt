This paper presents a novel approach to community detection in heterogeneous Stochastic Block Models (SBM), a regime with limited prior work. The authors explore new ideas in this area, which is a significant contribution to the field. However, the optimization problems used in the paper are not novel, and the results seem to be largely due to the application of stronger matrix concentration results.
The topic of community detection is not new, with a large amount of work published on it in the last decade, making the paper's contribution somewhat less significant. The proof techniques used in the paper are standard and do not introduce any new or innovative methods, which may be a weakness.
The paper would benefit from numerical demonstrations of the theoretically derived results to support its claims and make it more convincing. The authors provide some experimental results, but more comprehensive experiments would strengthen the paper.
Despite these weaknesses, the paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their approach. The paper may be a good fit for a poster presentation due to its exploration of a hot topic and a regime that allows for further investigation.
