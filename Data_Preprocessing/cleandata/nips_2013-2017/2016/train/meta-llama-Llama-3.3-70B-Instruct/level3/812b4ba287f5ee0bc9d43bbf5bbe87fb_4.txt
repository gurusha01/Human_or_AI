This paper proposes a novel approach to object proposal and detection tasks by utilizing reinforcement learning and a tree-structured search scheme. The algorithm combines detection procedures to improve object proposal and detection tasks, showing effectiveness in both areas. The approach is technically sound and novel, with a clever and straightforward tree-structured search scheme using multiple policies.
The strengths of the paper include its ability to discover multiple objects in a single pass, making it efficient and effective. The experiments are well-set up, proving the efficacy of the proposed method. However, the paper lacks comparison with baseline results using only VGG or Resnet, which would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the approach's performance.
The reported detection performance, with a mAP of ~76%, is lower than current state-of-the-art detection performances in the literature. This raises concerns about the approach's competitiveness with existing methods. Nevertheless, the paper's contributions to the field of object detection and proposal are significant, and its novel approach warrants further exploration.

* The paper proposes a novel and technically sound approach to object proposal and detection tasks.
