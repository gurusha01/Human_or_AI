This paper proposes a novel algorithm, Riemannian Relaxation (RR), for near-isometric embedding of manifold data. The algorithm leverages previous theoretical work and develops an optimization problem to minimize the difference between Riemannian metric estimates. The proposed method achieves better performance than previous non-linear dimensionality reduction algorithms through qualitative and quantitative experiments.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem of manifold learning and the concept of isometric embedding. The proposed algorithm is thoroughly explained, and the authors provide a detailed analysis of its properties and behavior. The experimental evaluation is comprehensive, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in obtaining low distortion embeddings.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel algorithm for near-isometric embedding of manifold data
* The thorough analysis of the algorithm's properties and behavior
* The comprehensive experimental evaluation, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method
* The ability of the algorithm to handle high-dimensional data and preserve geometric properties
However, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement:
* The optimization criterion is non-convex, which may lead to local minima and affect the convergence of the algorithm. A more detailed discussion on the effect of initial embedding on the final result and a quantitative analysis of the approach's speed compared to standard eigendecomposition approaches would be beneficial.
* The authors should discuss the 'NuMax' algorithm in related work and consider changing the title to clarify the meaning of "relaxation".
* There are minor typos and errors, such as those in lines 77, 82, and Eq. 4, which need to be corrected.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of the work.
The clarity of the paper is good, and the organization is well-structured. The authors provide enough information for the expert reader to reproduce the results.
The originality of the paper is high, as the proposed algorithm is novel and departs from existing non-linear embedding algorithms. The related work is adequately referenced, and the authors clearly explain how their work differs from previous contributions.
The significance of the paper is high, as the results are important and can be used by practitioners and researchers in the field of manifold learning and dimensionality reduction. The paper addresses a difficult problem in a better way than previous research and advances the state of the art in a demonstrable way.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, as it makes a significant contribution to the field of manifold learning and dimensionality reduction. However, the authors should address the minor typos and errors and provide a more detailed discussion on the effect of initial embedding on the final result and the quantitative analysis of the approach's speed.
