This paper proposes a novel approach to learning conditional generative models using a conditional maximum mean discrepancy (CMMD) criterion, which extends the concept of maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) to conditional distributions. The authors introduce Conditional Generative Moment-Matching Networks (CGMMN), a deep learning framework that learns a conditional distribution given some input variables. The model is trained using stochastic gradient descent with the gradient calculated by back-propagation.
The paper is well-structured and clearly written, with a good introduction to the background and motivation of the research. The authors provide a thorough explanation of the theoretical foundations of CMMD and its relationship to MMD. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of CGMMN in various tasks, including predictive modeling, contextual generation, and Bayesian dark knowledge.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel and theoretically sound approach to learning conditional generative models
* The demonstration of the effectiveness of CGMMN in various tasks, including predictive modeling and contextual generation
* The provision of a clear and well-structured explanation of the theoretical foundations of CMMD
However, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement:
* The paper could benefit from more detailed comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods, particularly in the context of conditional generative models
* The experimental results are mostly limited to small-scale datasets, and it would be beneficial to demonstrate the scalability of CGMMN to larger datasets
* The paper could provide more insights into the choice of hyperparameters and the sensitivity of the model to different settings
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, and originality. The paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The writing is clear, and the organization is logical and easy to follow. The paper proposes a novel approach to learning conditional generative models, which is a significant contribution to the field.
