This paper proposes a novel approach to studying the support recovery guarantees of underdetermined sparse regression using the `1-norm as a regularizer and a non-smooth loss function for data fidelity. The authors focus on the cases of `1 and `∞ losses, which are expected to lead to significantly different estimation results compared to the usual `2 loss. The paper provides a sharp analysis of the polyhedral cases, allowing for control of the deviation of the support of the estimated vector from the true support when the noise level is not too large and the loss constraint size is tuned proportionally to the noise level.
The paper's main contribution is Theorem 1, which characterizes the stability of the support of the estimated vector in terms of a specific subset of dual certificates. The theorem shows that if the signal-to-noise ratio is large enough and the loss constraint size is chosen in proportion to the noise level, then there is a solution supported exactly in the extended support. The authors also provide numerical simulations to illustrate their theoretical findings on a compressed sensing scenario, demonstrating the usefulness of their theory in predicting the degree of support instability of compressed sensing recovery using `α fidelity.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of their approach and results. The use of dual certificates and the concept of extended support are particularly noteworthy, as they provide a novel and insightful way to analyze the support recovery guarantees of sparse regression. The numerical simulations are also well-designed and provide a useful illustration of the theoretical results.
However, there are some minor errors and areas where more explanation is needed. For example, the comparison to Monte-Carlo sampling could be more detailed, and some of the notation and terminology may be unfamiliar to non-experts. Additionally, the paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the implications of the results and their potential applications in practice.
Overall, the paper is a solid and high-quality contribution to the field of sparse regression and compressed sensing. The authors' use of novel mathematical techniques and their ability to provide a sharp analysis of the polyhedral cases make this paper a valuable addition to the existing literature.
