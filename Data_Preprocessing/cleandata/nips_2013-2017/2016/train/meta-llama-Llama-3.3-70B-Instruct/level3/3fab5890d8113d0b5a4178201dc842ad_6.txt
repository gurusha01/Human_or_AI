This paper presents a novel approach to evaluating the accuracy of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) based posterior inference algorithms using bidirectional Monte Carlo (BDMC) technique. The authors extend the BDMC method to bound the symmetrized KL divergence between the true posterior distribution and the distribution of approximate samples. The proposed technique, called Bounding Divergences with Reverse Annealing (BREAD), is applicable to algorithms that can be viewed as importance sampling over an extended state space, such as annealed importance sampling (AIS) or sequential Monte Carlo (SMC).
The paper is well-structured and easy to follow, with a clear introduction to the background and motivation of the work. The authors provide a detailed description of the BDMC technique and its extension to BREAD, as well as a protocol for using BREAD to diagnose inference quality on real-world data. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of BREAD in evaluating the accuracy of posterior inference algorithms and provide insights into the tradeoffs between different model representations.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposed technique, BREAD, provides a rigorous and general approach to evaluating the accuracy of posterior inference algorithms.
* The authors provide a clear and detailed description of the BDMC technique and its extension to BREAD.
* The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of BREAD in evaluating the accuracy of posterior inference algorithms and provide insights into the tradeoffs between different model representations.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes that the reader is familiar with the BDMC technique and its application to posterior inference, which may limit its accessibility to non-experts.
* The comparison between different model representations is limited to a specific example, and it would be useful to see more extensive comparisons.
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the limitations and potential extensions of the BREAD technique.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of probabilistic inference and provides a useful tool for evaluating the accuracy of posterior inference algorithms. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of BREAD in evaluating the accuracy of posterior inference algorithms and provide insights into the tradeoffs between different model representations.
