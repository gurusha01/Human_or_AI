This paper proposes a novel approach to domain adaptation in deep networks, which enables the joint learning of adaptive classifiers and transferable features from labeled data in the source domain and unlabeled data in the target domain. The authors introduce a Residual Transfer Network (RTN) that relaxes the shared-classifier assumption made by previous methods and assumes that the source classifier and target classifier differ by a small residual function. The RTN approach is well-motivated and technically sound, with a clear and well-organized presentation.
The paper provides a thorough review of related works and experimental results on novel datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The authors evaluate the RTN model against state-of-the-art transfer learning and deep learning methods, showing that it outperforms them on most transfer tasks. The ablation study provides valuable insights into the contributions of different modules of the RTN model.
However, the paper could benefit from more explanation and justification of the motivation behind the formulation, particularly the reweighting of word distribution. Additionally, the contribution of the work may not be significant, as the adoption of linear transformation and reweighting with an NCA objective function is a possible but not groundbreaking extension of WMD.
The paper raises important questions about how the algorithm can find a distance for a new document and how to determine the reweighting factor for a completely new document. The term "semantic difference" is unclear and needs to be explained, as it seems to refer to the label of the document rather than authorship or topic differences.
Overall, the paper is well-written and easy to follow, with a clear presentation of the proposed approach and experimental results. However, it requires more justification and explanation of the motivation behind the formulation and the significance of the contribution.
