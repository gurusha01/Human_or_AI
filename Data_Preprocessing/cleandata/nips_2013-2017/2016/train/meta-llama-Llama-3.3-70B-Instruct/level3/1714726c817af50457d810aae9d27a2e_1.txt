This paper proposes a novel approach to obtaining fast learning rates for heavy-tailed losses in machine learning. The authors introduce two new conditions, the multi-scale Bernstein's condition and the integrability of the envelope function, which enable the derivation of fast learning rates for unbounded losses. The paper provides a thorough analysis of the conditions and their implications, and demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach through an application to k-means clustering with heavy-tailed source distributions.
The strengths of the paper include its originality, technical soundness, and significance. The authors provide a clear and well-structured presentation of their ideas, and the proofs are rigorous and well-explained. The paper also provides a detailed comparison with related work, highlighting the contributions and advantages of the proposed approach.
One potential weakness of the paper is that the conditions introduced may be difficult to verify in practice. However, the authors provide some guidance on how to verify the multi-scale Bernstein's condition, and the application to k-means clustering demonstrates the feasibility of the approach.
Overall, I believe that this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of machine learning, and its results have the potential to impact a wide range of applications. The paper is well-written, and the authors have made a clear effort to make the material accessible to a broad audience.
Here are some specific arguments for and against acceptance:
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel and original approach to obtaining fast learning rates for heavy-tailed losses.
* The analysis is technically sound, and the proofs are rigorous and well-explained.
* The paper provides a detailed comparison with related work, highlighting the contributions and advantages of the proposed approach.
* The application to k-means clustering demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of the approach.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The conditions introduced may be difficult to verify in practice, which could limit the applicability of the results.
* The paper assumes that the loss function satisfies the multi-scale Bernstein's condition, which may not always be the case.
* The analysis is focused on a specific type of loss function, and it is not clear how the results would generalize to other types of losses.
Overall, I believe that the strengths of the paper outweigh its weaknesses, and I recommend acceptance. However, I suggest that the authors provide more guidance on how to verify the conditions in practice, and consider exploring the applicability of the results to other types of losses.
