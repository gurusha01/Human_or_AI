This paper introduces a novel approach to studying the support recovery guarantees of underdetermined sparse regression using the `1-norm as a regularizer and a non-smooth loss function for data fidelity. The authors provide a sharp analysis for the polyhedral cases α ∈ {1,+∞} that allows one to control the deviation of the support of the estimated vector from the true support if the noise level is not too large and the constraint size is chosen proportionally to the noise level.
The paper's main contribution is Theorem 1, which characterizes the stability of the support of the estimated vector in terms of a specific subset of dual certificates. The theorem shows that if the signal-to-noise ratio is large enough and the constraint size is chosen in proportion to the noise level, then there is a solution supported exactly in the extended support. The authors also provide numerical simulations to illustrate their theoretical findings on a compressed sensing scenario.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of their approach and results. The use of dual certificates and the concept of extended support are particularly interesting and provide new insights into the problem of support recovery.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to handle non-smooth loss functions, which is a significant departure from the classical setting where the data loss is smooth. The authors' novel proof strategy is also a notable contribution, as it overcomes the difficulties arising from non-smoothness.
However, there are some limitations to the paper. The results are limited to the case of `α data loss functions, and it is unclear how the approach can be extended to more general non-smooth losses. Additionally, the paper assumes that the noise level is small, and it is unclear how the results would hold in the presence of larger noise.
In terms of originality, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of sparse regression and support recovery. The use of dual certificates and the concept of extended support are new and provide a fresh perspective on the problem. The paper also provides a detailed analysis of the polyhedral cases α ∈ {1,+∞}, which is a significant departure from the classical setting.
The significance of the paper lies in its ability to provide sharp theoretical guarantees for support recovery in the presence of non-smooth loss functions. The results have important implications for a wide range of applications, including compressed sensing, image processing, and machine learning.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of their approach and results. The paper makes a significant contribution to the field of sparse regression and support recovery, and the results have important implications for a wide range of applications.
