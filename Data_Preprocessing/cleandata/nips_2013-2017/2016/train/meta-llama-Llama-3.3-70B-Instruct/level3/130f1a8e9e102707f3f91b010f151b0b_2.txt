This paper proposes a novel online dictionary-learning method, dubbed Smooth-SODL, for characterizing neuroimaging data with structured and sparse components. The method extends a well-established framework by incorporating a Sobolev prior to encourage spatial contiguity of dictionary atoms. The technical quality of the paper is marginally below average, with a clear model definition but unclear demonstration of the empirical advantage of introducing the Sobolev prior.
The paper has notable original contributions in extending a previous framework to encourage spatially structured dictionary atoms, with potential impact on the neuroscience and medical imaging community. However, the presentation of the paper is not well-edited, with confusing descriptions, typos, and inconsistencies in equations and figures. The results section lacks clear criteria and quantitative measurements to demonstrate the improvement of the proposed method over alternative methods.
The paper has potential for other applications, such as image segmentation and regional sensing, but requires further exploration and clarification. The proposed method is compared to state-of-the-art models, including Canonical ICA and sparse online dictionary-learning, and shows promising results in extracting structured and denoised dictionaries that better capture inter-subject variability.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel and original method for characterizing neuroimaging data with structured and sparse components.
* The method has potential impact on the neuroscience and medical imaging community.
* The paper provides a clear model definition and a well-structured optimization framework.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The technical quality of the paper is marginally below average.
* The presentation of the paper is not well-edited, with confusing descriptions and inconsistencies.
* The results section lacks clear criteria and quantitative measurements to demonstrate the improvement of the proposed method.
* The paper requires further exploration and clarification of its potential applications.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper with minor revisions to address the technical quality, presentation, and results section. The paper has potential for significant contributions to the field, but requires further refinement to meet the standards of the conference.
