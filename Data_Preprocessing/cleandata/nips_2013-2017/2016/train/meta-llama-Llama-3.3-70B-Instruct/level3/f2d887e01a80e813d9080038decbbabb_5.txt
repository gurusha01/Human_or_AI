This paper proposes a tensor-decomposition-based methodology for unsupervised risk estimation using a 3-view assumption to develop a semi-supervised learning algorithm. The approach is related to "discrepancy"-based approaches for domain adaptation, which do not require a 3-view assumption and provide data-dependent guarantees. However, the 3-view assumption may not be realistic, especially for logistic regression, where it is equivalent to Naive Bayes, which rarely holds.
The paper's emphasis on different losses and structures lacks experimental support, and including results on these aspects would strengthen the paper. The experimental results are underwhelming, with only one dataset used, and more experiments are needed to demonstrate the methodology's robustness and explore its performance with different structures and losses.
The idea of using a 3-view assumption and consensus of experts has been explored before, and comparison with this line of work is necessary. The paper's approach is novel, but its significance and impact on the field are not clearly demonstrated. The results presented in the paper are not sufficient to support the claims made, and more rigorous evaluation and comparison with existing methods are needed.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, but the claims are not well-supported by theoretical analysis or experimental results. The paper is well-organized and clearly written, but it lacks clarity in some sections, and the notation and terminology used are not always consistent. The originality of the paper is limited, as the idea of using a 3-view assumption and consensus of experts has been explored before. The significance of the paper is not clearly demonstrated, and more work is needed to show the impact of the proposed methodology on the field.
Overall, I would recommend that the authors provide more experimental results, compare their approach with existing methods, and demonstrate the significance and impact of their proposed methodology. The authors should also address the limitations of their approach, including the realism of the 3-view assumption and the lack of experimental support for their claims.
