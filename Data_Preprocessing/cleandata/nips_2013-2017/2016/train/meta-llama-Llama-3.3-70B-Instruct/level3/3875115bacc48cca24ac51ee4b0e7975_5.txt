This paper addresses the problem of unsupervised learning of similarities between large numbers of exemplars using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The authors propose a novel approach that overcomes the limitations of traditional CNN training methods, which require large amounts of labeled data. The key idea is to formulate an optimization problem that generates batches of compact, mutually dissimilar cliques of samples, which are then used to train a CNN.
The paper is well-written and clearly explains the motivation, approach, and experimental evaluation. The authors provide a thorough review of related work and highlight the advantages of their approach over existing methods. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in learning fine-grained similarity structures, particularly in the context of posture analysis and object classification.
The strengths of the paper include:
* A clear and well-motivated problem statement
* A novel and well-explained approach to unsupervised learning of similarities
* Strong experimental results that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method
* A thorough review of related work and clear discussion of the advantages of the proposed approach
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The optimization problem formulation may be complex and difficult to understand for some readers
* The experimental evaluation could be more comprehensive, with additional datasets and comparison to more state-of-the-art methods
* The paper could benefit from more discussion on the potential applications and limitations of the proposed approach
Overall, I believe that this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of computer vision and machine learning, and I would recommend it for acceptance.
