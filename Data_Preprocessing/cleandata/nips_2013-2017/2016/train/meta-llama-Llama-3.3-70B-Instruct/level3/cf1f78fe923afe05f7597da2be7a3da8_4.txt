This paper introduces a novel data embedding method, Riemannian Relaxation (RR), which preserves geometry using a Riemannian metric and provides a gradient descent solution for the non-convex objective. The authors propose a new way to measure the distortion from isometry of any embedding and study its properties. The algorithm optimizes the dual Riemannian metric of the embedding, which directly measures the deviation from isometry.
The paper has several strengths. Firstly, the proposed method is original and differs from existing non-linear embedding algorithms. The use of a Riemannian metric to measure distortion is a novel approach, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of its properties. The algorithm is also computationally competitive with existing methods and can be adapted to various situations.
However, there are several weaknesses in the paper. The authors claim that the Riemannian metric is best for geometry preservation without providing sufficient motivation or intuition for this claim. They also ignore existing methods like t-SNE that use gradient descent. The paper lacks sufficient testing on large datasets to demonstrate the superiority and practicality of their embeddings in terms of runtime and accuracy. The initialization of the algorithm is already very similar to the true shape, and it is unclear how the algorithm would perform without this prior information.
The plots in the paper are poorly drawn and lack important details, such as intervals for MSE and loss, and more points tested for sigma. The formatting of Figure 2 is poor, making it difficult to follow and understand the results. The analysis in Figure 3 is incomplete, as it only shows superficial improvements in data analysis without providing a physics-based analysis to support the claim that the method improves scientific analysis.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, but the claims are not well-supported by theoretical analysis or experimental results. The authors are not careful about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of the work. The paper is not clearly written, and the organization could be improved. The originality of the paper is high, but the significance of the results is not clearly demonstrated.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel and original method for data embedding.
* The use of a Riemannian metric to measure distortion is a new approach.
* The algorithm is computationally competitive with existing methods.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The paper lacks sufficient testing on large datasets.
* The initialization of the algorithm is already very similar to the true shape.
* The plots in the paper are poorly drawn and lack important details.
* The analysis in Figure 3 is incomplete.
* The paper is not clearly written, and the organization could be improved.
Overall, while the paper has some strengths, the weaknesses outweigh them, and I would recommend rejection. However, with significant revisions to address the weaknesses, the paper could be resubmitted and considered for acceptance.
