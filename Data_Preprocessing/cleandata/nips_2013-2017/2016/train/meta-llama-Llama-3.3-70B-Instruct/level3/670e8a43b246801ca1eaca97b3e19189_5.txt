This paper proposes a novel approach to online dictionary learning for brain imaging data, incorporating a Laplacian penalty to impose spatial structure on the dictionary atoms. The resulting model, Smooth-SODL, is shown to extract structured and denoised dictionaries that better capture inter-subject variability in small, medium, and large-scale regimes. The paper is well-written and provides a clear overview of the methodology and experiments.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel approach to online dictionary learning that incorporates spatial structure, which is a significant improvement over existing methods.
* The use of a Laplacian penalty to impose spatial structure, which is a principled and effective way to regularize the dictionary atoms.
* The extensive experiments on a large public dataset, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in extracting structured and denoised dictionaries.
* The comparison with state-of-the-art methods, which shows that the proposed approach outperforms existing methods in terms of interpretability and ability to capture inter-subject variability.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The lack of a clear discussion on the choice of hyperparameters, particularly the regularization parameter γ, which is crucial to the performance of the model.
* The use of a simple grid search for hyperparameter tuning, which may not be sufficient to find the optimal values.
* The limited analysis of the results, particularly in terms of the biological interpretability of the extracted dictionaries.
Overall, the paper is well-written and provides a significant contribution to the field of brain imaging analysis. However, some minor revisions are needed to address the weaknesses mentioned above.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel and effective approach to online dictionary learning for brain imaging data.
* The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in extracting structured and denoised dictionaries.
* The paper provides a clear overview of the methodology and experiments, making it easy to follow and understand.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The lack of a clear discussion on the choice of hyperparameters, particularly the regularization parameter γ.
* The limited analysis of the results, particularly in terms of the biological interpretability of the extracted dictionaries.
Recommendations for revision:
* Provide a clear discussion on the choice of hyperparameters, particularly the regularization parameter γ.
* Use a more thorough hyperparameter tuning method, such as cross-validation.
* Provide a more detailed analysis of the results, particularly in terms of the biological interpretability of the extracted dictionaries.
