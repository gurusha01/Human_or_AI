This paper presents a novel approach to inference in cooperative graphical models, which capture variable interactions more expressively than traditional pairwise or log-supermodular models. The authors derive upper and lower bounds on the partition function of these models by combining submodular optimization techniques with variational inference methods. The resulting algorithms are shown to be effective in obtaining good bounds and marginals for both synthetic and real-world examples.
The paper is well-written and clearly organized, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments. The connections to existing work are well-established, and the authors provide a thorough review of related research in the field. The technical contributions of the paper are significant, and the authors provide a detailed analysis of the optimization problems involved in deriving the bounds.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to provide a unified framework for inference in cooperative graphical models. The authors show that their approach can be used to derive both upper and lower bounds on the partition function, which is a significant improvement over existing methods. The experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithms, and the results are impressive, especially in the context of image segmentation tasks.
However, there are some limitations to the paper. The usefulness of the resulting bounds is unclear, and the authors mainly report pseudomarginals of the upper bound in experiments. Additionally, the upper bounds may be mostly helpful in parameter learning problems, which limits their applicability. Furthermore, the paper could be improved by replacing the marginal polytope form of TRW with a decomposition form to simplify optimization and speed up computation.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of their work. The paper is also well-organized, and the writing is clear and concise.
The originality of the paper is high, as it presents a novel approach to inference in cooperative graphical models. The combination of submodular optimization techniques with variational inference methods is new and significant. The paper also provides a thorough review of related work, which helps to establish its significance and impact.
The significance of the paper is also high, as it addresses a difficult problem in a better way than previous research. The results have the potential to impact the field of computer vision and machine learning, particularly in applications where cooperative graphical models are used. The paper provides a unique theoretical and pragmatic approach to inference in these models, which could lead to significant advances in the field.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, as it presents a significant and original contribution to the field of machine learning and computer vision. The technical quality is high, and the results are impressive. While there are some limitations, the paper provides a thorough analysis of the optimization problems involved and demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed algorithms.
