This paper proposes a novel framework for semi-supervised active clustering (SSAC) using same-cluster queries to interact with a domain expert. The authors introduce a notion of clusterability, called the Î³-margin property, and provide an efficient algorithm for clustering with queries that succeeds under this assumption. They also prove a lower bound on the number of queries needed to make NP-hard problems feasible.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem and their approach. The technical sections are also well-organized, and the proofs are thorough and easy to follow. The authors provide a detailed analysis of the query and computational complexity of their algorithm and demonstrate its practical use through experiments on synthetic and real data.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to balance theoretical and practical contributions. The authors provide a rigorous analysis of the algorithm's performance and also demonstrate its effectiveness in practice. The paper also raises interesting questions about the trade-off between query complexity and computational complexity in clustering tasks.
However, there are some potential limitations to the work. The authors assume that the domain expert conforms to a center-based clustering with a notion of margin, which may not always be the case in practice. Additionally, the algorithm requires a significant number of queries to achieve good performance, which may be impractical in some scenarios.
To improve the paper, the authors could consider providing more details on the implementation setup and the communication cost between the algorithm and the domain expert. They could also explore the use of other types of queries or supervision methods to improve the algorithm's performance. Furthermore, the authors could investigate the application of their framework to other clustering tasks or domains.
In terms of novelty, the paper builds on previous work on clustering with partial supervision and the computational complexity of clustering tasks. While the authors' approach is novel, it is not entirely surprising, given the existing literature on semi-supervised clustering and active learning.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the authors provide a significant contribution to the field of clustering and machine learning. The paper's strengths outweigh its weaknesses, and it has the potential to be a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the field.
