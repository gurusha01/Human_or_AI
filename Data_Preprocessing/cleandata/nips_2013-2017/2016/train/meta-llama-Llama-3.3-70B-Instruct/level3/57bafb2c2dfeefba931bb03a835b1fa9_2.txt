This paper presents a significant improvement to the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES), a popular derivative-free optimization algorithm. The authors propose the Cholesky-CMA-ES, which replaces the traditional matrix square root update with a triangular Cholesky factorization, reducing the time complexity from O(d^3) to O(μd^2), where μ is the number of updates and d is the dimensionality of the search space.
The paper provides a thorough theoretical analysis of the Cholesky-CMA-ES, including a proof that the error introduced by the approximation decreases over time as the algorithm converges. The authors also present empirical results, comparing the Cholesky-CMA-ES to the standard CMA-ES and other variants, demonstrating a significant increase in optimization speed without sacrificing performance.
The strengths of the paper include its clear and well-organized presentation, making it easy to follow and understand the authors' contributions. The theoretical analysis is rigorous and well-supported, providing a solid foundation for the proposed algorithm. The empirical results are also convincing, demonstrating the effectiveness of the Cholesky-CMA-ES in various benchmark functions and dimensions.
However, there are some weaknesses to the paper. The authors could have provided more discussion on the limitations of the Cholesky-CMA-ES, such as its scalability to very high-dimensional problems. Additionally, the paper could have benefited from more detailed comparisons to other optimization algorithms, such as gradient-based methods or other derivative-free algorithms.
Overall, the paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of optimization, providing a faster and more efficient variant of the CMA-ES. The authors' work has the potential to impact various applications, including machine learning, reinforcement learning, and supervised learning.
