This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of automated mechanism design, providing the first sample complexity analysis for the standard hierarchy of deterministic combinatorial auction classes. The authors derive tight sample complexity bounds for various auction classes, including Affine Maximizer Auctions (AMAs), Virtual Valuation Combinatorial Auctions (VVCAs), λ-auctions, Mixed Bundling Auctions (MBAs), and Mixed Bundling Auctions with Reserve Prices (MBARPs).
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem of designing revenue-maximizing combinatorial auctions. The technical sections are rigorous and well-organized, with a clear explanation of the notation and definitions used throughout the paper. The authors also provide a thorough discussion of related work, highlighting the significance of their contributions and the differences between their approach and existing research.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The authors provide a comprehensive analysis of the sample complexity of various auction classes, which is a crucial aspect of automated mechanism design.
* The paper presents novel and non-trivial results, including the derivation of tight sample complexity bounds for AMAs, VVCAs, and λ-auctions.
* The authors demonstrate the applicability of their results to any algorithm that determines the optimal auction over a sample, making their work relevant to a broad range of automated mechanism design approaches.
However, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement:
* The paper assumes a strong background in mechanism design and learning theory, which may make it challenging for readers without expertise in these areas to follow.
* Some of the proofs and technical arguments are lengthy and complex, which may make it difficult for readers to verify the results without significant effort.
* The authors could provide more intuition and discussion about the implications of their results, particularly in terms of the practical applications of their work.
Overall, I believe that this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of automated mechanism design and learning theory. The authors provide a thorough and rigorous analysis of the sample complexity of various auction classes, and their results have important implications for the design of revenue-maximizing combinatorial auctions.
