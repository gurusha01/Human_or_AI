This paper proposes a novel approach to dictionary learning for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, combining Sobolev and L1 regularization to encourage smoothness and sparsity of the components. The method, dubbed Smooth Sparse Online Dictionary-Learning (Smooth-SODL), extends the online dictionary-learning framework of Mairal et al. (2010) and demonstrates promising results in extracting structured and denoised dictionaries that capture inter-subject variability.
The paper's strengths include its original contribution to the field, as the use of combined Sobolev and L1 regularization is a unique approach. The authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of the methodology, including the optimization algorithm and the choice of hyperparameters. The experiments on the Human Connectome Project dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in comparison to state-of-the-art models, such as Canonical ICA and sparse online dictionary-learning.
However, there are some weaknesses to the paper. The results show insufficient improvement over simpler methods, and the improvement is not adequately explained. Additionally, the manuscript appears to be rushed, containing draft comments and being tedious and sometimes confusing to read. The writing could be improved to make the paper more accessible to a broader audience.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper addresses the criteria of quality, clarity, originality, and significance. The methodology is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by experimental results. The paper is clearly written, although some improvements could be made. The approach is original, and the results demonstrate the significance of the contribution to the field.
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel and original approach to dictionary learning for fMRI data.
* The methodology is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by experimental results.
* The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in comparison to state-of-the-art models.
Arguments con acceptance:
* The results show insufficient improvement over simpler methods.
* The manuscript appears to be rushed, containing draft comments and being tedious and sometimes confusing to read.
* The writing could be improved to make the paper more accessible to a broader audience.
Overall, I would recommend accepting the paper, but with revisions to address the weaknesses mentioned above. The authors should provide more detailed explanations of the results, improve the writing, and consider adding more experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
