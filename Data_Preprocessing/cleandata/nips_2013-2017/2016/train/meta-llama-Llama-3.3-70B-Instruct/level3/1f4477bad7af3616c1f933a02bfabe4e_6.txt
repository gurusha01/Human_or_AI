This paper proposes a method to analyze the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm for estimating parameters of statistical models, specifically for mixtures of two Gaussians. The authors provide a global analysis of EM in the large sample limit, characterizing the stationary points and dynamics of the algorithm. The paper presents two models, Model 1 and Model 2, and provides convergence results for the Population EM iterates, as well as consistency results for the Sample-based EM iterates.
The paper is well-structured and easy to follow, with clear explanations of the models and algorithms. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the EM algorithm, including a characterization of the fixed points and the conditions under which each fixed point is reached. The paper also discusses the relationship between the Population EM and the expected log-likelihood, and provides a characterization of the stationary points of the expected log-likelihood.
However, the paper falls short in convincing its practical usefulness. The authors should discuss the expressiveness of their restricted model, its limitations, and contrast it with concurrent approaches to strengthen their argument. Additionally, the experimental results lack clarity on the limitations of the model's applicability and comparison with other methods, including computational resources demanded by the algorithms.
The presentation has room for improvement, particularly in Section 2, with some typos and unclear definitions, such as the loss function and notation. Specific sections, such as Theorem 1, require informal explanation and clarification to improve readability and understanding. The rebuttal provided some necessary clarifications, but these should be added to the paper for better comprehension.
Overall, the paper provides a solid theoretical analysis of the EM algorithm, but could benefit from more discussion on its practical implications and limitations. The authors should address the weaknesses mentioned above to strengthen their argument and improve the overall quality of the paper.
