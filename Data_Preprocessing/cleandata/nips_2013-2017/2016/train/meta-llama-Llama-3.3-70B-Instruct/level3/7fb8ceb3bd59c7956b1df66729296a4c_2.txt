This paper presents a novel approach to deconvolve feedback loops in recommender systems, allowing for the recovery of true user preferences without the influence of the recommender system. The authors propose a set of assumptions that enable the creation of a tractable model of a recommender system, which is then used to develop an algorithm for deconvolving feedback loops. The algorithm is based on the singular value decomposition of the observed ratings matrix and is able to recover the true ratings matrix up to a scaling constant.
The paper is well-written and clearly organized, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments and understand the proposed approach. The use of synthetic and real-world datasets to validate the approach is also a strength of the paper, as it demonstrates the effectiveness of the method in practice.
One of the key strengths of the paper is its ability to provide insights into the extent of recommender system effects on the final ratings matrix. The proposed metric for assessing the influence of a recommender system on a ratings matrix is novel and provides a useful tool for understanding the impact of feedback loops on user preferences.
However, there are some limitations to the approach. The assumptions made by the authors, while reasonable, may not always hold in practice. For example, the assumption that the user mean and item norms are roughly equal may not be true in all cases. Additionally, the approach relies on the availability of a single snapshot of the ratings matrix, which may not always be possible.
In terms of originality, the paper presents a novel approach to deconvolving feedback loops in recommender systems. While there has been previous work on understanding the impact of feedback loops on user preferences, the authors' approach is distinct and provides a new perspective on the problem.
The significance of the paper lies in its ability to provide insights into the extent of recommender system effects on user preferences. The proposed approach has the potential to be used in a variety of applications, including recommender systems, social network analysis, and user behavior modeling.
Overall, I would argue in favor of accepting this paper. The strengths of the paper, including its novelty, clarity, and effectiveness, outweigh its limitations. The paper provides a valuable contribution to the field of recommender systems and has the potential to be of interest to a wide range of researchers and practitioners.
