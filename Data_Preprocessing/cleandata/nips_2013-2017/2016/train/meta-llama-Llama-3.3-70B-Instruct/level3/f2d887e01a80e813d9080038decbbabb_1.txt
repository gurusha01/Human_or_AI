This paper proposes a novel approach to estimate the risk of a model on unlabeled data, leveraging a structural assumption that the underlying generating distribution decomposes into label-independent views. The method shows promise in preliminary experimental results and is well-presented, with an elegant high-level idea of imposing structural assumptions while relying on discriminative models.
The paper's technical content is clearly presented, and the approach is theoretically sound. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the method, including its strengths and weaknesses, and demonstrate its effectiveness in various scenarios, such as covariate shift and semi-supervised learning. The use of tensor decomposition to solve the moment equations is a key insight, allowing the authors to estimate the risk without explicitly modeling the underlying distribution.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to handle complex losses, including the log loss for conditional random fields. The authors also provide a clear and concise explanation of the method, making it easy to follow and understand. The experimental results are convincing, demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach in estimating the risk and performing unsupervised domain adaptation.
However, there are some minor comments and questions that arise from the review. For instance, it would be helpful to clarify the assumptions made in the paper, particularly the 3-view assumption, and provide more intuition behind the method. Additionally, some of the equations and experimental results could be further explained or elaborated upon.
In terms of novelty, the paper's contribution is primarily theoretical, and it is unclear how much of the work is entirely new. The authors draw on existing ideas from domain adaptation and semi-supervised learning, and the use of tensor decomposition is not entirely novel. However, the combination of these ideas and the specific application to unsupervised risk estimation is innovative and noteworthy.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the approach is sound and effective. The authors demonstrate a clear understanding of the problem and provide a thorough analysis of the method. While there are some minor comments and questions, the paper is a strong contribution to the field and has the potential to make a significant impact.
