This paper proposes a novel approach to domain adaptation in deep networks, which enables the joint learning of adaptive classifiers and transferable features from labeled data in the source domain and unlabeled data in the target domain. The authors introduce a Residual Transfer Network (RTN) that relaxes the shared-classifier assumption made by previous methods and assumes that the source classifier and target classifier differ by a small residual function. The RTN approach is based on deep residual learning and bridges the source classifier and target classifier by plugging several layers into deep networks to explicitly learn the residual function.
The paper provides compelling experimental evidence, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on standard domain adaptation benchmarks. The authors also provide a thorough analysis of the results, including visualizations of the predictions and layer responses, which helps to understand the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
The strengths of the paper lie in its simplicity and relatively straightforward idea, which makes it easy to implement and understand. The authors also provide a clear and well-organized presentation of the material, making it easy to follow.
However, there are some areas that require improvement. The paper could benefit from more rigorous mathematical computations and notations, particularly in the derivation of the RTN approach. Additionally, the authors should provide more insights on the importance of the weight vector w in the learned metric and its relevance to the innovation proposed. The paper could also benefit from a more detailed comparison with previous work, such as Cuturi/Avis and Wang et al., to clearly underline the differences and advantages of the proposed approach.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by experimental results. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of the work. The paper is clearly written, well-organized, and provides enough information for the expert reader to reproduce the results.
In terms of originality, the paper proposes a novel approach to domain adaptation, which is a significant contribution to the field. The idea of using residual learning to bridge the source classifier and target classifier is new and innovative. However, the paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the related work and how the proposed approach differs from previous methods.
In terms of significance, the paper addresses a difficult problem in domain adaptation, which is a crucial area of research in machine learning. The proposed approach has the potential to advance the state of the art in domain adaptation and could be useful in a variety of applications.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, as it provides a significant contribution to the field of domain adaptation and has the potential to advance the state of the art. However, the authors should address the minor comments and provide more insights on the importance of the weight vector w and the relevance of the proposed approach to previous work.
