This paper presents an information-theoretic treatment of the crowdsourcing problem, modeling it as a joint source-channel coding (JSCC) problem with a random channel state. The authors establish fundamental limits on the number of queries per item required to achieve a certain level of fidelity, using existing results on the coding rate in the JSCC problem. They also analyze a specific query scheme, k-ary incidence coding (kIC), and provide a lower bound on its error probability under a spammer-hammer channel model.
The paper's strengths include its novel application of information-theoretic principles to the crowdsourcing problem, providing a new perspective on the fundamental limits of crowdsourcing. The analysis of kIC is also a valuable contribution, as it provides insight into the performance of a specific query scheme. The authors' use of existing results on JSCC to establish fundamental limits on crowdsourcing is a clever approach, and their derivation of a lower bound on the error probability of kIC is a significant result.
However, there are some weaknesses to the paper. The model used may be too restrictive, as it assumes that the taskmaster and crowdsourcer do not have access to the original data, which could provide side information for the encoder and decoder. Additionally, the source-channel separation theorem used in the paper may not be directly applicable when the channel has a random state, and the authors should provide a proof or existing reference to support its use. The authors' comment on the improvement of lower bounds for kIC as k and q grow may be misleading, as it actually means the lower bound becomes smaller, indicating potential better performance of the code.
Furthermore, the paper could benefit from a non-asymptotic characterization of the fundamental limits of crowdsourcing, which would be more useful in practice. The authors should consider recent results on non-asymptotic converses for JSCC to provide a more comprehensive analysis. Overall, the paper is well-written and provides a valuable contribution to the field of crowdsourcing, but could be improved with some additional analysis and clarification.
