This paper proposes a novel approach to unitary recurrent neural networks (uRNNs) by optimizing the recurrence matrix over all unitary matrices, leading to significantly improved performance over uRNNs that use a restricted-capacity recurrence matrix. The authors provide a theoretical argument to determine if a unitary parameterization has restricted capacity and show that a recently proposed unitary parameterization has restricted capacity for hidden state dimension greater than 7. They also propose a method for stochastic gradient descent for training the unitary recurrence matrix, which constrains the gradient to lie on the differentiable manifold of unitary matrices.
The paper is well-structured and easy to follow, with clear explanations of the theoretical background and the proposed approach. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the limitations of restricted-capacity parameterizations and demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on several tasks, including synthetic system identification, long-term memorization, frame-to-frame prediction of speech spectra, and pixel-by-pixel classification of handwritten digits.
The strengths of the paper include its clear and concise writing style, the thoroughness of the analysis, and the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The authors also provide a detailed comparison with other approaches, including LSTMs and restricted-capacity uRNNs, and demonstrate the superiority of their approach on several tasks.
However, there are some minor issues with the paper. Some sections, such as Section 4, could be summarized or removed, while others, like Section 6, could be expanded to provide more detail. Additionally, there are some typos and minor errors throughout the paper, such as the potentially linear toy NL case.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, as it provides a significant contribution to the field of unitary recurrent neural networks and demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach on several tasks. The paper is well-written, thorough, and provides a clear and concise explanation of the theoretical background and the proposed approach.
