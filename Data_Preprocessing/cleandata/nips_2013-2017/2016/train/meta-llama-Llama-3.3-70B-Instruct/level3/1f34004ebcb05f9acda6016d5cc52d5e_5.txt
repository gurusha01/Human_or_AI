This paper proposes a novel batch Bayesian optimization algorithm, the parallel knowledge gradient method (q-KG), which is designed to optimize the evaluation of multiple points simultaneously in a parallel computing environment. The authors derive the q-KG method from a decision-theoretical perspective, aiming to minimize the expected incremental value of a measurement. The algorithm is shown to be Bayes-optimal for minimizing the minimum of the predictor of the Gaussian process if only one decision is remaining.
The paper is well-structured, and the authors provide a clear overview of the related work, background on Gaussian processes, and a detailed description of the q-KG algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the q-KG method in both noise-free and noisy settings, outperforming or being competitive with state-of-the-art benchmark algorithms on several synthetic functions and practical machine learning problems.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel batch Bayesian optimization algorithm that addresses the parallel setting, which is a common scenario in many applications.
* The derivation of the q-KG method from a decision-theoretical perspective, providing a solid theoretical foundation for the algorithm.
* The provision of a computationally efficient approach to maximize the q-KG acquisition function, making the algorithm practical for large-scale problems.
* The comprehensive experimental evaluation, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the q-KG method in various settings.
However, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement:
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the q-KG algorithm, particularly in the parallel setting.
* The experimental results, although comprehensive, are mostly focused on synthetic functions and a few practical problems. More experiments on real-world problems and larger datasets would strengthen the paper.
* The authors could provide more insights into the hyperparameter tuning process, as the choice of hyperparameters can significantly impact the performance of the algorithm.
* The paper assumes that the evaluation of the objective function is expensive, but it would be interesting to explore the performance of the q-KG method in scenarios where the evaluation is relatively cheap.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, originality, and significance. The paper is technically sound, well-written, and provides a novel contribution to the field of Bayesian optimization. The experimental results demonstrate the significance of the q-KG method, and the paper provides a clear overview of the related work and background on Gaussian processes.
