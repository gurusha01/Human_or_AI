This paper presents a novel model of strategic buyers with patience, where buyers have a window of time to purchase an item at the lowest price. The seller posts prices in advance for the entire window, and buyers choose the lowest price within their window. The paper proves that the optimal regret rate for the seller is O(T^(2/3)) using a no-regret algorithm, and also establishes a matching lower bound of Ω(T^(2/3)). This result is significant, as it shows that even with a simple pricing mechanism, the seller can achieve sub-linear regret in an adversarial setting.
The paper's strengths include its clear and well-organized presentation, as well as its thorough analysis of the model and its results. The discussion section is particularly helpful in highlighting the implications of the results and suggesting potential avenues for future research. The use of a no-regret algorithm and the reduction to previous results are also notable strengths.
However, the paper has some minor flaws, such as typos and a poorly written abstract. Additionally, the results rely heavily on reducing to previous results, which may limit the paper's originality. Nevertheless, the model and ideas presented are still noteworthy, particularly the finding that optimal regret changes from O(√T) to O(T^(2/3)) when bidder patience increases from 0 to 1.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of their work. The paper is also well-written, although some minor improvements could be made to clarity and organization.
The originality of the paper is moderate, as it builds on existing work in the field. However, the application of no-regret algorithms to the strategic buyers model is novel, and the results provide new insights into the problem. The significance of the paper is high, as it addresses a difficult problem in a better way than previous research and advances the state of the art in a demonstrable way.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, as it makes a worthwhile contribution to the field despite some minor flaws. The paper's strengths, including its clear presentation and thorough analysis, outweigh its weaknesses, and the results are significant and original.
