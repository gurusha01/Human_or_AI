This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of sparse linear regression, providing sharp theoretical guarantees for stable support recovery under small enough noise by `1 minimization with non-smooth loss functions. The authors extend the existing theory from the smooth `2 case to the non-smooth cases of `1 and `∞ losses, which is a challenging problem due to the lack of smoothness of the loss function.
The paper is well-organized, and the authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of their methodology and results. The theoretical analysis is rigorous, and the numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The authors also provide a thorough discussion of the limitations of their analysis and potential future directions.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The authors provide a novel proof strategy to tackle the non-smoothness of the loss function, which is a significant contribution to the field.
* The theoretical guarantees provided are sharp and provide valuable insights into the behavior of the `1 minimization with non-smooth loss functions.
* The numerical experiments are well-designed and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes that the design matrix Φ is randomly drawn from a continuous distribution, which may not always be the case in practice.
* The authors do not provide a comparison with other existing methods for sparse linear regression, which would be useful to assess the performance of their approach.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the authors provide a significant contribution to the field of sparse linear regression. The results are important and have the potential to impact the development of new methods for sparse linear regression.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper provides a novel proof strategy to tackle the non-smoothness of the loss function.
* The theoretical guarantees provided are sharp and provide valuable insights into the behavior of the `1 minimization with non-smooth loss functions.

* The authors do not provide a comparison with other existing methods for sparse linear regression.
Recommendation: Accept with minor revisions. The authors should address the minor points mentioned above, such as providing a comparison with other existing methods and discussing the limitations of their analysis in more detail. Additionally, the authors should clarify some of the notations and definitions used in the paper to make it more accessible to a broader audience.
