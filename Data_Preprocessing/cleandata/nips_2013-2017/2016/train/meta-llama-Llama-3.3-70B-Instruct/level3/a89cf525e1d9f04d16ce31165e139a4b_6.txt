This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of automated mechanism design, providing the first sample complexity analysis for the standard hierarchy of deterministic combinatorial auction classes. The authors derive tight sample complexity bounds for various auction classes, including Affine Maximizer Auctions (AMAs), Virtual Valuation Combinatorial Auctions (VVCAs), Î»-auctions, Mixed Bundling Auctions (MBAs), and Mixed Bundling Auctions with Reserve Prices (MBARPs).
The paper is well-organized, and the authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of the mechanism design problem, the hierarchy of auction classes, and the sample complexity bounds. The use of Rademacher complexity and pseudo-dimension to derive the sample complexity bounds is innovative and demonstrates a deep understanding of the underlying learning theory.
The results are significant, as they provide a foundation for automated mechanism design and have important implications for the design of high-revenue combinatorial auctions. The authors show that more structured classes, such as MBAs and MBARPs, require drastically fewer samples to learn over, which is a promising result for practical applications.
The paper is technically sound, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of the sample complexity bounds, including proofs and sketches of the proofs. The related work section is comprehensive, and the authors provide a clear discussion of the differences between their work and previous research.
