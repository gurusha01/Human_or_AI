This paper proposes a novel approach to modeling and analyzing crowdsourcing systems using an information-theoretic framework. The authors present a communication system model for crowdsourcing, where the crowd is represented by a set of parallel noisy channels, and the taskmaster and crowdsourcer are represented by an encoder and decoder, respectively. The paper derives fundamental performance limits for crowdsourcing systems, including the minimum number of queries per item required to achieve a target fidelity, and presents a new query scheme called k-ary incidence coding.
The paper is well-structured and easy to follow, with clear explanations of the system model, the information-theoretic framework, and the derivation of the performance limits. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the k-ary incidence coding scheme and its performance, including numerical results and comparisons with information-theoretic bounds.
The strengths of the paper include its novel approach to modeling crowdsourcing systems, its clear and concise explanations, and its thorough analysis of the k-ary incidence coding scheme. The paper also provides a good balance between theoretical and practical aspects of crowdsourcing systems.
However, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement. The paper assumes that the workers' skill levels are unknown or perfectly known, which may not be realistic in practice. The authors could consider more realistic scenarios, such as partial knowledge of the workers' skill levels. Additionally, the paper focuses primarily on the k-ary incidence coding scheme, and it would be interesting to see a comparison with other query schemes.
In terms of clarity, the paper is well-written, but some of the notation and terminology may be unfamiliar to non-experts. The authors could provide more explanations and definitions to make the paper more accessible to a broader audience.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of crowdsourcing and information theory, and its results have the potential to impact the design and optimization of crowdsourcing systems. The paper is well-suited for publication in a top-tier conference such as NIPS.
