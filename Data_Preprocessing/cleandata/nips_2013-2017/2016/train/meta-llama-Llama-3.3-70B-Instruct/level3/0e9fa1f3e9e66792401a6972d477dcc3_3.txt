This paper proposes a method for evaluating the quality of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) transition operators using bidirectional Monte Carlo (BDMC), which provides a lower and upper bound on the marginal likelihood. The authors extend the BDMC technique to evaluate MCMC-based posterior inference algorithms and integrate it into two probabilistic programming languages, WebPPL and Stan. The method, called Bounding Divergences with Reverse Annealing (BREAD), upper bounds the Jeffreys divergence between the true posterior distribution and the distribution of approximate samples.
The idea of using BDMC to assess convergence of MCMC operators is beautifully simple and potentially high-impact, particularly in probabilistic programming systems. However, the technical contributions of the paper are somewhat modest and rushed, with clarity issues arising in sections 3.1 and 3.2. The authors could have explored connections between BDMC and Tempered Transitions (TT) more thoroughly, and the lack of attention to the choice of β_t values in BDMC is concerning.
The paper could benefit from improvements in clarity, with ambiguous definitions, inconsistent labels, and unexplained notation making it difficult to follow. The experiments could also be more thorough, with clearer explanations of how β_t is chosen and what AutoBDMC entails. Additionally, increasing the size of axes and tick labels would improve the figures.
Despite these limitations, the paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of probabilistic programming and MCMC methods. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of BREAD in evaluating the accuracy of posterior inference and provide insights into the tradeoffs between different model representations. The method has the potential to be a useful tool for debugging and testing the correctness of probabilistic programming languages.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel method for evaluating MCMC transition operators using BDMC.
* The method has the potential to be high-impact, particularly in probabilistic programming systems.
* The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of BREAD in evaluating the accuracy of posterior inference.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The technical contributions of the paper are somewhat modest and rushed.
* The paper lacks clarity, with ambiguous definitions and inconsistent labels.
* The experiments could be more thorough, and the choice of β_t values in BDMC is not adequately addressed.
Overall, I would recommend acceptance of the paper, but with revisions to address the clarity and technical issues mentioned above.
