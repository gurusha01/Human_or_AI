This paper proposes a novel batch Bayesian optimization algorithm, the parallel knowledge gradient method, which provides the one-step Bayes optimal batch of points to sample. The algorithm uses the Knowledge Gradient framework to estimate expected improvement in objective value and decide on sampling points, with a generalized approach to make decisions on multiple points in batch. The authors develop an algorithm using Monte Carlo and Infinitesimal Perturbation Analysis to estimate gradients and maximize information gain over candidate sampling sets, showing competitive results on test problems.
The paper's main contribution lies in the estimation of the q-KG gradient using an IPA approach, which allows for efficient optimization of the acquisition function. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method on both synthetic test functions and real-world problems, including tuning hyperparameters of machine learning algorithms. The results show that the q-KG algorithm outperforms or is competitive with state-of-the-art benchmark algorithms, especially in the noisy setting.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of their method and its implementation. The experimental results are thorough and demonstrate the effectiveness of the q-KG algorithm in various settings. However, the novelty of the paper is debated, as the main contribution may be seen as an extension of existing work on Knowledge Gradient methods to the batch setting.
The technical quality of the paper is high, with a clear and well-structured presentation of the methodology and results. The authors provide a thorough discussion of related work and demonstrate a good understanding of the existing literature. The paper is well-organized, and the writing is clear and concise.
The significance of the paper lies in its potential to improve the efficiency of Bayesian optimization methods in parallel settings, which is an important problem in many applications. The results demonstrate that the q-KG algorithm can outperform existing methods, especially in the noisy setting, which is a common scenario in many real-world problems.
In terms of originality, the paper proposes a new acquisition function and a novel approach to estimating its gradient, which is a significant contribution to the field. The authors also demonstrate the effectiveness of their method on a range of test problems, which adds to the paper's significance.
