This paper explores the duality between multi-class SVMs and multiclass Adaboost, leveraging this duality to derive a novel dimensionality reduction method. The authors propose a boosting-like framework, LADDER, which allows for multi-class boosting with an arbitrary number of dimensions and achieves improved results in terms of error rate and mAP. The connection between MC-Boost and MV-SVM is highlighted, with a discussion on the differences between the predictor and codewords.
The paper's strengths include its novel approach to dimensionality reduction and its ability to outperform MCBoost by 2% in classification accuracy. However, the paper lacks a detailed comparison with CNNs, particularly in terms of simultaneous learning of features and discriminative projection functions. The experimental evaluation is also not convincing, with a need for more experiments to demonstrate the merits of the proposed method.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, with well-supported claims and a clear explanation of the methodology. The authors are careful in evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of their work. The paper is well-organized and clearly written, making it easy to follow.
The originality of the paper lies in its novel approach to dimensionality reduction and its ability to derive a boosting-like framework from the duality between multi-class SVMs and multiclass Adaboost. The paper adequately references related work and provides a clear discussion of the differences between its approach and previous contributions.
The significance of the paper lies in its potential to improve the state of the art in dimensionality reduction and multiclass classification. The results are important, and other researchers may build upon this work to further improve the field.
