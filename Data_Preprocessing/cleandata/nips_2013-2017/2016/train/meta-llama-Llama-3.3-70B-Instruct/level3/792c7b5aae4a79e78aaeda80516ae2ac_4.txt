This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm for estimating parameters of Gaussian mixture models. The authors focus on two specific models, where the observations are an i.i.d. sample from a mixture of two Gaussians with the same covariance matrix and weight. They establish global results in the population version, describing how EM behaves with access to true underlying distributions, and show that sample-based EM behaves similarly to population EM using consistency-type arguments.
The paper's main contribution is a new characterization of the stationary points and dynamics of EM in both models. The authors prove convergence for the sequence of iterates for Population EM and fully characterize the initial parameter settings that lead to each limit point. They also establish statistical consistency for Sample-based EM, showing that the limits of the Sample-based EM iterates converge in probability to the unknown parameters of interest.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of their results. The analysis is thorough, and the authors address the limitations of their work, including the restriction to consistency-type results for the finite sample case. The paper also provides a good review of related work, highlighting the connections to previous research on EM and Gaussian mixture models.
One potential limitation of the paper is the focus on specific models, which may limit the applicability of the results to more general settings. However, the authors acknowledge this limitation and suggest potential directions for future work, including extending the results to more general Gaussian mixture models and other latent variable models.
