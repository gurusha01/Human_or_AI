This paper proposes a novel approach to unsupervised domain adaptation in deep networks, which enables end-to-end learning of adaptive classifiers and transferable features. The authors introduce a residual transfer network (RTN) that bridges the source classifier and target classifier by a residual function, allowing for more effective domain adaptation. The RTN model is trained using standard back-propagation and outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets.
The paper is well-written and clearly explains the motivation and technical details of the proposed approach. The authors provide a thorough review of related work and highlight the limitations of existing domain adaptation methods. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the RTN model in adapting to different domains and improving classification accuracy.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to address the challenge of classifier mismatch between the source and target domains. The authors propose a residual transfer module that learns the residual function between the source and target classifiers, allowing for more effective adaptation. The use of tensor MMD and entropy minimization principles also helps to improve the adaptation performance.
However, there are some areas that require further clarification and improvement. For example, the notation in Table 2 is unclear, and the authors should provide more information on the average error across datasets. Additionally, the value of lambda and the claim about the method being forgiving for syntactically different but conceptually similar words require more explanation and justification.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of the work. The paper is also well-organized, and the writing is clear and concise.
In terms of originality, the paper proposes a novel approach to domain adaptation that combines feature adaptation and classifier adaptation in a unified framework. The use of residual transfer networks and tensor MMD is a new contribution to the field, and the authors provide a clear explanation of how their approach differs from existing methods.
In terms of significance, the paper addresses a challenging problem in domain adaptation, and the proposed approach has the potential to improve the performance of deep learning models in real-world applications. The authors provide a thorough evaluation of the RTN model on benchmark datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in adapting to different domains.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, as it makes a significant contribution to the field of domain adaptation and provides a novel approach to addressing the challenge of classifier mismatch. However, the authors should address the minor issues mentioned above to improve the clarity and quality of the paper.
