This paper introduces a novel approach to neural memory architectures, called Sparse Access Memory (SAM), which enables efficient training of neural networks with large external memories. The key innovation is the use of sparse read and write operations, which reduces the computational and memory overhead of traditional memory-augmented neural networks (MANNs). The authors demonstrate that SAM achieves significant speedups and memory reductions compared to existing MANNs, such as Neural Turing Machines (NTMs) and Memory Networks, while maintaining comparable performance on a range of tasks.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of the SAM architecture and its components, including the sparse read and write operations, the approximate nearest neighbor index, and the efficient backpropagation through time. The experimental results are thorough and demonstrate the effectiveness of SAM on various tasks, including synthetic and real-world datasets.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to balance theoretical and practical contributions. The authors provide a rigorous analysis of the time and space complexity of SAM, showing that it is asymptotically optimal, while also demonstrating its practical effectiveness through extensive experiments. The paper also provides a clear comparison with existing MANNs, highlighting the advantages and limitations of each approach.
However, there are some potential weaknesses and areas for improvement. One concern is that the sparse approximations used in SAM may not always be effective, particularly in cases where the memory is highly structured or has complex dependencies. The authors acknowledge this limitation and provide some discussion on the potential impact of sparse approximations on learning, but further investigation is needed to fully understand the trade-offs.
Another area for improvement is the evaluation of SAM on more realistic and challenging tasks. While the paper demonstrates the effectiveness of SAM on various tasks, including question answering and one-shot learning, it would be beneficial to evaluate its performance on more complex and real-world tasks, such as natural language processing or computer vision.
In terms of originality, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of neural memory architectures, introducing a novel approach that combines sparse read and write operations with efficient data structures. The paper also provides a thorough review of existing MANNs and their limitations, highlighting the need for more efficient and scalable architectures.
Overall, this paper makes a strong contribution to the field of neural memory architectures, demonstrating the effectiveness of sparse access memory (SAM) in reducing the computational and memory overhead of traditional MANNs. While there are some potential weaknesses and areas for improvement, the paper provides a clear and detailed explanation of the SAM architecture and its components, and demonstrates its practical effectiveness through extensive experiments.
