This paper proposes a novel approach to generating object proposals using a sequential search strategy trained with Q-learning. The method allows the model to predict multiple objects and handle multimodality, making it a significant contribution to the field. The paper's main ideas are well-related to previous work, and the authors provide a clear and concise overview of the background and notation.
The method's two major contributions are taking two actions at each step and bifurcating, and a carefully designed reward signal that provides rewards for improving object localization and discovering new objects. The experimental results demonstrate the method's effectiveness, achieving impressive recall and improving over RPN by about 2 points when plugged into fast R-CNN.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the methodology and experimental results. However, there are some areas that require clarification, such as the ranking of proposals output, which is based on the depth of the tree at which they are discovered. Additionally, it is unclear whether the training encourages the model to discover objects quickly.
To strengthen the experimental section, the authors could compare their method to more proposal methods, such as MCG and DeepMask, and evaluate its performance on COCO to test its generalizability to unseen object categories. Furthermore, evaluating the method's performance under more stringent evaluation metrics, such as higher overlap thresholds, would provide a more comprehensive understanding of its effectiveness.
Overall, the paper presents a novel and effective approach to object proposal generation, and with some clarifications and additional experiments, it has the potential to make a significant impact in the field.
