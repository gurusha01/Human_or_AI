This paper proposes a novel framework for semi-supervised active clustering (SSAC) that utilizes same-cluster queries to interact with a domain expert. The authors introduce a notion of clusterability, called the γ-margin property, and demonstrate that access to a limited number of query answers can turn an otherwise NP-hard clustering problem into a feasible one. The paper presents a probabilistic polynomial-time algorithm for clustering with queries, which succeeds under the assumption that the input satisfies the γ-margin condition for γ > 1. The algorithm makes O(k log n + k^2 log k) same-cluster queries to the oracle and runs in O(kn log n) time.
The paper also provides a lower bound on the number of queries needed to overcome the NP hardness of k-means clustering, showing that at least Ω(log k + log n) queries are required. The authors demonstrate that their algorithm can recover the target clustering with high probability and provide bounds on the time and query complexity of the algorithm.
The strengths of the paper include its novel approach to semi-supervised clustering, its thorough theoretical analysis, and its well-organized presentation. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear explanation of their methodology and results.
However, there are some inconsistencies in the paper, such as a statement about step size and a discrepancy between Algorithm 1 and Equation (5). Additionally, the paper could benefit from more discussion on the practical applications of the proposed framework and the potential limitations of the approach.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, and originality.
