This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of automated mechanism design, providing the first sample complexity analysis for the standard hierarchy of deterministic combinatorial auction classes. The authors derive tight sample complexity bounds for various auction classes, including Affine Maximizer Auctions (AMAs), Virtual Valuation Combinatorial Auctions (VVCAs), Î»-auctions, Mixed Bundling Auctions (MBAs), and Mixed Bundling Auctions with Reserve Prices (MBARPs).
The paper is well-organized, and the authors provide a clear overview of the problem, related work, and their contributions. The technical sections are detailed and thorough, with a focus on the Rademacher complexity and pseudo-dimension of the auction classes. The authors also provide a discussion on the implications of their results and potential future directions.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to provide a unified framework for analyzing the sample complexity of various auction classes. The authors demonstrate that their bounds apply to any algorithm that determines the optimal auction over a sample, making their results widely applicable. The paper also highlights the importance of understanding the structure of the revenue function classes, which is a key challenge in deriving sample complexity bounds.
However, there are some areas where the paper could be improved. For example, the authors could provide more intuition on why the sample complexity bounds for certain auction classes are tighter than others. Additionally, the paper could benefit from more numerical examples or simulations to illustrate the practical implications of the results.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, originality, and significance. The paper is technically sound, well-written, and provides a significant contribution to the field. The authors have also done a good job of relating their work to previous research in the area and highlighting the importance of their results.
