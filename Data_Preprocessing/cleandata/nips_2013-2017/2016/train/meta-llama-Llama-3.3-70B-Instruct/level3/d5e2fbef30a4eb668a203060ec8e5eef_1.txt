This paper introduces a novel feature selection approach called CMICOT, which is an extension of filter methods with sequential forward selection (SFS) based on conditional mutual information (MI). The algorithm is designed to identify high-order feature interactions, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods in terms of classification accuracy. The use of binary representatives to alleviate data and computational cost issues is a key aspect of the approach, although it raises concerns about theoretical justification and potential trade-offs between computational cost and information loss.
The paper provides a thorough analysis of the algorithm's strengths and weaknesses, including its ability to detect high-order feature interactions and its computational efficiency. However, there are some concerns about the experimental setup, including the lack of clarity on whether the results were obtained over a validation/test set or training set, and the poor results for the NBC classifier.
The comparison between different feature selection methods is also incomplete, with relevant information relegated to the appendices and a lack of discussion about the average results reported in the main manuscript. To further evaluate the effectiveness of CMICOT, additional experiments are suggested, including a comparison of CMICOT with and without binary representatives, and a comparison of computational cost with other feature selection methods.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, with well-supported claims and a clear explanation of the algorithm. However, there are some minor errors in terminology and unclear sentences that need to be addressed. The paper is well-organized and provides enough information for the expert reader to reproduce the results.
The originality of the paper lies in its ability to identify high-order feature interactions, which is a novel contribution to the field of feature selection. The paper also provides a unique combination of familiar techniques, including SFS and MI, to address the problem of feature selection.
The significance of the paper is evident in its ability to outperform other state-of-the-art methods in terms of classification accuracy. The results have important implications for practitioners and researchers, as they demonstrate the effectiveness of CMICOT in identifying high-order feature interactions.
Overall, the paper is well-written and provides a significant contribution to the field of feature selection. However, there are some areas that need to be addressed, including the experimental setup, comparison with other methods, and minor errors in terminology and clarity.
