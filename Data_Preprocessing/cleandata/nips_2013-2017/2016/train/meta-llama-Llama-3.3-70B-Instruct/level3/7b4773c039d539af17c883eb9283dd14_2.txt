This paper introduces a new approach to support recovery guarantees for underdetermined sparse regression using the `1-norm as a regularizer and non-smooth loss functions. The authors provide a sharp analysis for the polyhedral cases, specifically `1 and `âˆž losses, which is a significant contribution to the field. The paper combines existing techniques, such as the planning algorithm of Busoniou and Munos and the sampling method of Kearns et al, with additional methods to balance confidence intervals and uncertainties.
The paper's strengths include its clear presentation, thorough analysis, and numerical experiments that illustrate the support stability of compressed sensing recovery using different loss functions. The authors also provide a detailed discussion of the limitations of their analysis and potential extensions to more general non-smooth losses.
However, there are some areas that require improvement. The complexity measures used in the paper are difficult to interpret, and the extension of the algorithm to general MDPs with loops and merging states is unclear and requires further explanation. Additionally, the paper could benefit from more detailed discussions on parameter choices and the introduction of the algorithm's semantics.
In terms of the conference guidelines, this paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, originality, and significance. The paper is technically sound, with well-supported claims and a complete piece of work. The presentation is clear, and the authors provide enough information for an expert reader to reproduce the results. The problems and approaches are new, and the paper provides a novel combination of familiar techniques. The related work is adequately referenced, and the paper advances the state of the art in a demonstrable way.
