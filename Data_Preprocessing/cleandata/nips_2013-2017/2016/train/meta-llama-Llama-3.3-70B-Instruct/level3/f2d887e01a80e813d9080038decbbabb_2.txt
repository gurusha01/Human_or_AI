This paper presents a novel approach to estimating the risk of a classifier or regression function using only unlabeled data, building upon the work of Donmez (2010). The authors assume the existence of at least three conditionally independent "views" of each object, which allows for certain performance guarantees to be derived under additional assumptions. The main contribution of the paper is the development of a method for estimating the risk using the method of moments, which avoids the need for full estimation of the loss distribution.
The paper is well-written and clearly explains the technical details of the approach. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the assumptions required for the method to work and discuss the implications of these assumptions. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in estimating the risk and performing unsupervised domain adaptation.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to handle a large family of losses, including the log and exponential loss, and extend to structured output settings such as conditional random fields. The authors also provide a clear and concise explanation of the technical machinery behind the method of moments, making it accessible to a wide range of readers.
However, the paper's main contribution and improvement over Donmez's 2010 work are not immediately clear, particularly regarding the assumption of conditional independence of views versus predictors. The use of an HMM setting is also considered misleading, as it requires multiple i.i.d. time series, unlike typical HMM applications which involve a single time series.
Despite these concerns, the paper's novelty has been clarified after reading other reviews and gaining a clearer understanding of the paper's contributions. The paper's quality, clarity, and originality are all high, making it a strong candidate for acceptance.
