This paper proposes a novel extension of dictionary learning models by incorporating a Sobolev prior to improve the identification of brain regions from functional images. The authors introduce a multivariate online dictionary-learning method, dubbed Smooth Sparse Online Dictionary-Learning (Smooth-SODL), which combines sparsity and spatial smoothness penalties to extract structured and denoised dictionaries. The method is shown to outperform state-of-the-art models, including Canonical ICA and sparse online dictionary-learning, in terms of explained variance, stability, and interpretability of the extracted dictionaries.
The paper is well-structured, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, related work, and their contributions. The methodology is thoroughly explained, and the experiments are well-designed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The results are presented in a clear and easy-to-understand manner, with visual comparisons of the estimated dictionaries and quantitative metrics to evaluate their performance.
However, there are some concerns regarding the validation method used, which relies heavily on visual comparison of blob clarity and consistency. While the authors provide some quantitative metrics, such as explained variance and stability, the subjective nature of the validation method may raise questions about the robustness of the results. Additionally, the incorporation of penalties for smoothness and spatial consistency may naturally lead to smoother blobs, making the results less surprising and potentially less impactful.
Furthermore, the paper could benefit from a more in-depth exploration of the consolidation of differences between brain regions across subjects and the use of inter-subject differences as validation. The authors mention that their approach can capture inter-subject variability, but a more detailed analysis of this aspect would strengthen the paper.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The writing is clear, and the organization is logical. The originality of the paper lies in the combination of sparsity and spatial smoothness penalties in a dictionary learning framework, which is a novel contribution to the field.
The significance of the paper is evident, as it addresses a crucial problem in neuroimaging, namely, the identification of brain regions from functional images. The proposed approach has the potential to improve our understanding of brain organization and function, and its applications could extend to various fields, including neuroscience, psychology, and medicine.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the authors demonstrate a good understanding of the problem and the related work. While there are some concerns regarding the validation method and the exploration of inter-subject differences, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field and has the potential to impact future research in neuroimaging.
