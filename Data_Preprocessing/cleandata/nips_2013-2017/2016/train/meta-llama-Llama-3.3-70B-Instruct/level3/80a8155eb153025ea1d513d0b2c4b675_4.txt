This paper presents a novel approach to measuring the robustness of neural networks, which is a critical aspect of their reliability and security. The authors propose two statistics, adversarial frequency and adversarial severity, to quantify the robustness of a neural network. They also develop an algorithm, called ALP, to efficiently estimate these statistics. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of ALP through experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, showing that it produces more accurate estimates of robustness compared to existing algorithms.
The strengths of this paper include its novelty in applying techniques from optimization to study the properties of neural networks, its thorough experimental evaluation, and its potential to inspire more work on understanding clustering objectives. The discovery that robust k-means is not robust to outliers in general but can be robust on datasets with structure is important and aligns with recent work on clusterability.
However, the paper's clarity and presentation could be improved, particularly in interpreting results and putting the work in context of related work. The experiment section seems detached from the rest of the paper, and the connection between the proposed metrics and the experimental results could be more clearly explained.
In terms of the conference guidelines, this paper meets the criteria of being a good scientific paper, regardless of its specific area. The paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of their work.
Here is a list of arguments pro and con acceptance:
Pros:
* The paper presents a novel approach to measuring the robustness of neural networks.
* The proposed algorithm, ALP, is shown to be effective in estimating robustness statistics.
* The paper has the potential to inspire more work on understanding clustering objectives.
Cons:
* The paper's clarity and presentation could be improved.
* The experiment section seems detached from the rest of the paper.
* The connection between the proposed metrics and the experimental results could be more clearly explained.
Overall, I recommend accepting this paper, as it presents a significant contribution to the field of neural networks and robustness, and its strengths outweigh its weaknesses.
