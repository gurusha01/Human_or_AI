This paper introduces a novel method, Bounding Divergences with Reverse Annealing (BREAD), for evaluating the accuracy of approximate posterior inference algorithms. The method extends the bidirectional Monte Carlo (BDMC) technique to bound the Jeffreys divergence between the true posterior distribution and the distribution of approximate samples. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of BREAD on several models and datasets, and integrate it into two probabilistic programming languages, WebPPL and Stan.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the methodology and its applications. The technical contributions of the paper are significant, and the authors demonstrate a deep understanding of the underlying concepts. The use of BDMC to bound the Jeffreys divergence is a novel and innovative approach, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of the method's strengths and limitations.
The paper has several strengths, including:
* The introduction of a novel method for evaluating approximate posterior inference algorithms, which has the potential to significantly impact the field of probabilistic programming.
* The demonstration of the method's effectiveness on several models and datasets, which provides strong evidence for its usefulness.
* The integration of the method into two probabilistic programming languages, which makes it accessible to a wide range of users.
However, the paper also has some weaknesses, including:
* The method's reliance on simulated data, which may not always be representative of real-world data.
* The need for exact posterior samples, which can be difficult to obtain in practice.
* The potential for the method to be computationally expensive, particularly for large models and datasets.
Overall, I believe that this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of probabilistic programming, and that the method introduced has the potential to be widely used and impactful. I would recommend accepting the paper for publication, with some minor revisions to address the weaknesses mentioned above.
