This paper proposes a novel framework for semi-supervised active clustering (SSAC) that leverages same-cluster queries to improve the efficiency of clustering algorithms. The authors introduce a new notion of clusterability, called the γ-margin property, which is related to the previously introduced notion of center proximity. They provide a probabilistic polynomial-time algorithm for clustering with queries that succeeds under the assumption that the input satisfies the γ-margin condition for γ > 1. The algorithm makes O(k log n + k^2 log k) same-cluster queries to the oracle and runs in O(kn log n) time.
The paper also provides a lower bound on the number of queries needed to make NP-hard problems feasibly solvable, showing that at least Ω(log k + log n) queries are required. Furthermore, the authors demonstrate that k-means clustering is NP-hard even when the optimal solution satisfies the γ-margin property for γ = √3.4, but becomes efficiently solvable with the help of an oracle.
The strengths of this paper include its novel approach to semi-supervised clustering, its rigorous theoretical analysis, and its potential to improve the efficiency of clustering algorithms in practice. The weaknesses of the paper include the potential limitations of the γ-margin property, which may not always hold in practice, and the need for further experimentation to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
Overall, this paper makes a significant contribution to the semi-supervised clustering literature and has the potential to impact the field of machine learning.
