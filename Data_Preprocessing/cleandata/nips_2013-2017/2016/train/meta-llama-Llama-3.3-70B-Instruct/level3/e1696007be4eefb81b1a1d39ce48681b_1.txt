This paper proposes a novel two-step estimator for Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) that combines a fast OLS estimator with a fast root finder to estimate the constant of proportionality. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through extensive numerical studies on large-scale real and synthetic datasets, showing that it achieves the highest performance compared to several other widely used optimization algorithms.
The paper's main contribution is the development of the Scaled Least Squares (SLS) estimator, which is computationally efficient and achieves the same accuracy as the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) in the large-scale setting. The SLS estimator has a per-iteration cost of O(n), which is cheaper than other batch optimization algorithms by at least a factor of O(p).
The paper's strengths include its well-written and presented main idea, which appears novel and has the potential to make a significant impact in the field. The authors provide a thorough comparison between the proposed algorithm and other existing methods, demonstrating the superiority of the SLS estimator in terms of computational efficiency and accuracy.
However, there are some weaknesses and limitations to the paper. The experiments lack comparison with stochastic optimization methods, such as SVRG, which could have performed better than other competing methods. Additionally, the theorems and propositions in the paper only hold for sub-Gaussian random variables, limiting the results' applicability to data with heavier tails. The algorithm's robustness is also unclear due to the lack of experiments with heavier-tailed data, which could affect its usefulness in practice.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The paper is well-organized, and the writing is clear and concise. The authors provide enough information for the expert reader to reproduce the results.
The originality of the paper is high, as it proposes a new approach to estimating GLM coefficients. The paper adequately references related work and provides a clear explanation of how the proposed method differs from previous contributions.
The significance of the paper is also high, as it addresses a difficult problem in a better way than previous research. The paper provides a unique solution to the problem of estimating GLM coefficients in the large-scale setting, and the results have the potential to be widely used in practice.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, but with some revisions to address the limitations and weaknesses mentioned above. The authors should consider adding experiments with stochastic optimization methods and heavier-tailed data to demonstrate the robustness of the algorithm.
