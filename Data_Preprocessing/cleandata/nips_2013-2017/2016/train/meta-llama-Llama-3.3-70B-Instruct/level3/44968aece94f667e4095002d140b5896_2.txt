This paper presents a novel model of online pricing with patient buyers, where a seller posts a price for a certain time period and buyers choose the cheapest time to buy within their waiting time. The goal of the seller is to maximize revenue, and the paper provides an algorithm with a regret bound of O(τ^{1/3}n^{1/3}T^{2/3}) and a lower bound of Ω(τ^{1/3}T^{2/3}).
The model is interesting and reasonable, as it addresses the issue of buyers waiting for lower prices by assuming an upper bound on the waiting time. The algorithm is natural but non-trivial, requiring the seller to post the same price for a slightly longer period than τ to estimate the probability of sale at a given price. The lower bound is also non-trivial, obtained through a reduction to bandits with switching costs.
The paper is well-written and clearly organized, with a good overview of related work and a clear explanation of the model and algorithm. The analysis of the algorithm and the proof of the lower bound are thorough and convincing.
The strengths of the paper include:
* A novel and interesting model of online pricing with patient buyers
* A non-trivial algorithm with a good regret bound
* A thorough analysis of the algorithm and a convincing proof of the lower bound
* A good overview of related work and a clear explanation of the model and algorithm
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The gap between the upper and lower bounds, which is an interesting open problem
* The assumption of an upper bound on the waiting time, which may not be realistic in all scenarios
* The complexity of the algorithm, which may be difficult to implement in practice
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, as it presents a novel and interesting model of online pricing with patient buyers, a non-trivial algorithm with a good regret bound, and a thorough analysis of the algorithm and a convincing proof of the lower bound.
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The paper presents a novel and interesting model of online pricing with patient buyers
* The algorithm has a good regret bound and is well-analyzed
* The lower bound is convincing and provides a good understanding of the limits of the model
* The paper is well-written and clearly organized
Arguments con acceptance:
* The gap between the upper and lower bounds is an interesting open problem
* The assumption of an upper bound on the waiting time may not be realistic in all scenarios
* The complexity of the algorithm may be difficult to implement in practice
However, the strengths of the paper outweigh the weaknesses, and I believe that it makes a significant contribution to the field of online pricing and should be accepted.
