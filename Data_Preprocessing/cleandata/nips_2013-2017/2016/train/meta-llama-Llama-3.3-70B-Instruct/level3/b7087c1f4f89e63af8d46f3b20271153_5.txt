This paper presents a novel approach for unsupervised learning of similarities between large numbers of exemplars using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The authors address the challenges of exemplar-based learning, including the single positive exemplar setup, imbalance between exemplar and negatives, and inconsistent labels within SGD batches. They propose an optimization problem to extract batches of samples with mutually consistent relations, which are then used to train a CNN. The approach is evaluated on three datasets, including Olympic Sports, Leeds Sports, and PASCAL VOC 2007, and shows competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.
The strengths of the paper include its novelty, as it tackles the challenging problem of unsupervised exemplar-based learning using CNNs. The approach is well-motivated, and the optimization problem is carefully designed to address the challenges of exemplar-based learning. The experimental evaluation is thorough, and the results are impressive, showing significant improvements over existing methods.
However, there are some weaknesses in the paper. The writing is sometimes hard to understand, with numerous typos and unclear explanations of symbols and equations. The paper could benefit from language proofing and clarification of technical terms. Additionally, the comparison with existing algorithms for large-scale data is limited, and the paper could benefit from a more comprehensive discussion of related work.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, as it is technically sound and well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The paper is also original, as it proposes a novel approach for unsupervised exemplar-based learning using CNNs. However, the clarity of the paper could be improved, and the writing could be more polished.
