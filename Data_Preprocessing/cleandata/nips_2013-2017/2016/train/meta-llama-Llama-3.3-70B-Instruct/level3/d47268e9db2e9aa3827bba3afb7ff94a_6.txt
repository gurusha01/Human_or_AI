This paper presents a novel approach to discriminant dimensionality reduction by establishing a duality between boosting and Support Vector Machines (SVM). The authors propose a new algorithm, Large Margin Discriminant Dimensionality Reduction (LADDER), which jointly learns the mapping and linear classifiers in an efficient manner. The key idea is to leverage the duality between boosting and SVM to derive a new family of discriminant dimensionality reduction methods.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, related work, and their proposed approach. The technical content is sound, and the authors provide a detailed analysis of the LADDER algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, showing significant improvements over traditional dimensionality reduction techniques and state-of-the-art hashing methods.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The authors provide a novel and insightful analysis of the duality between boosting and SVM, which leads to a new perspective on discriminant dimensionality reduction.
* The proposed LADDER algorithm is efficient and scalable, making it suitable for large-scale applications.
* The experimental results are thorough and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in various applications, including hashing and scene understanding.
