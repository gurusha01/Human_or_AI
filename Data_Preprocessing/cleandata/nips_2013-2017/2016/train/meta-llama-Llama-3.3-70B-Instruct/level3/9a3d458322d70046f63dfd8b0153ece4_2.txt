This paper proposes a novel optimization problem to improve a baseline policy in a Markov Decision Process (MDP) with known uncertainty about its transitions. The authors aim to maximize the difference in return between the new policy and the baseline under the worst possible model. The problem is shown to be NP-hard, and a heuristic approximation is proposed and validated empirically to address this complexity.
The paper provides a clear presentation of theoretical results, illuminating examples, and interesting comparisons to existing algorithms. The authors demonstrate that their approach can lead to better performance and stability properties compared to standard robust MDP formulations. The use of the same model for both the new policy and the baseline is a less conservative formulation that can be beneficial in certain scenarios.
However, I raise a concern about the lack of theoretical guarantees of safety and performance bounds for Algorithm 1 due to the approximation involved. While the empirical results are promising, it is essential to provide more rigorous analysis to ensure the reliability and trustworthiness of the proposed approach.
To further evaluate the significance of the proposed heuristic modification, I suggest comparing it to a reasonable baseline, such as solving the robust MDP without the safety criterion, to measure its impact. Additionally, minor comments on readability and the presentation of specific propositions could improve the overall clarity of the paper.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of their work. The paper is well-organized, and the writing is clear, making it easy to follow and understand.
The originality of the paper lies in its novel formulation of the optimization problem and the proposed heuristic approximation. The authors provide a unique perspective on robust MDPs and demonstrate the potential benefits of their approach. The related work is adequately referenced, and the authors clearly explain how their work differs from previous contributions.
The significance of the paper is evident in its potential to improve the performance and stability of policies in MDPs with uncertain transitions. The proposed approach could be useful in various applications, such as robotics, finance, and healthcare, where uncertainty and robustness are crucial considerations. Overall, the paper makes a valuable contribution to the field of reinforcement learning and robust MDPs.
