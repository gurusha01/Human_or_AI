This paper discusses the application of bidirectional Monte Carlo using two probabilistic programming languages, WebPPL and Stan. The authors extend the recently introduced bidirectional Monte Carlo technique to evaluate MCMC-based posterior inference algorithms. The method, called Bounding Divergences with Reverse Annealing (BREAD), provides a rigorous, general, and automatic procedure for monitoring the quality of posterior inference.
The paper is well-written and clearly explains the background and methodology of BREAD. The authors provide a detailed analysis of the technique and demonstrate its effectiveness on several models and datasets. The experiments validate the use of BREAD in evaluating the accuracy of posterior inference in realistic settings and explore the tradeoffs between different representations of a matrix factorization model in both WebPPL and Stan.
However, the paper lacks original ideas, as it only implements known techniques without introducing new concepts. The work may be better suited for an MCMC workshop rather than the current conference, as it primarily focuses on evaluating MCMC-based posterior inference algorithms.
The strengths of the paper include its clear explanation of the methodology, thorough analysis, and effective validation of the technique. The authors also demonstrate the potential usefulness of BREAD as a means of testing the correctness of an implementation, as they uncovered a bug in WebPPL during their experimentation.
The weaknesses of the paper include its lack of originality and limited scope. The authors do not provide a significant contribution to the field, as the technique is primarily an application of existing methods. Additionally, the paper may not be of interest to a broad audience, as it is focused on a specific area of research.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, as it is technically sound and well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The paper is also clear and well-organized, making it easy to follow and understand. However, the paper lacks originality, which is a key criterion for the conference. The significance of the paper is also limited, as it does not provide a major breakthrough or contribution to the field.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication, but with some revisions to address the lack of originality and limited scope. The authors should consider expanding the paper to include more innovative ideas or applications of the technique, and provide a clearer explanation of the significance and impact of their work.
