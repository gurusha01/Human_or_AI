This paper proposes a novel batch Bayesian optimization algorithm, called the parallel knowledge gradient (q-KG) method, which is designed to optimize the evaluation of multiple points simultaneously in a parallel setting. The authors provide a thorough introduction to the problem of Bayesian optimization and the need for parallel evaluation, as well as a clear explanation of the q-KG method and its theoretical foundations.
The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with a solid methodological approach and sound experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the q-KG method. The authors provide a detailed comparison with other state-of-the-art batch Bayesian optimization algorithms, including parallel expected improvement (EI) and upper confidence bound (UCB) methods, and show that q-KG outperforms or is competitive with these methods on several synthetic functions and practical machine learning problems.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel and effective batch Bayesian optimization algorithm that can handle parallel evaluation of multiple points.
* A thorough theoretical analysis of the q-KG method, including its derivation and computational implementation.
* A comprehensive experimental evaluation of the q-KG method on several synthetic functions and practical machine learning problems, including comparisons with other state-of-the-art algorithms.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The assumption of a Gaussian process prior, which may not be suitable for all types of functions or problems.
* The lack of theoretical results on error bounds and complexity analysis, which would provide a more complete understanding of the q-KG method's performance.
* Some minor revisions are needed to address typos and provide clarifications on certain notations and definitions.
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of Bayesian optimization and provides a valuable new tool for optimizing the evaluation of multiple points in parallel. The q-KG method has the potential to be widely applicable and to improve the efficiency of many machine learning and optimization algorithms.
