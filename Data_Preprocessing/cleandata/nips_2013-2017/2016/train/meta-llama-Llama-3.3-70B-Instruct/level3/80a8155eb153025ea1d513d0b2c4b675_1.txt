This paper presents a theoretical analysis of the robustness and consistency properties of the robust k-means (RKM) formulation, a variant of the classical quadratic k-means algorithm. The authors investigate the breakdown point of RKM, which measures the minimum fraction of outliers that can cause excessive damage in the estimates of the centers. They show that a single outlier can break down the algorithm if the function flambda is convex, while two outliers can do so if flambda is non-convex. However, under certain structural assumptions, a non-trivial breakdown point can be established.
The paper also generalizes consistency results for convex flambda to non-convex flambda, but the broader appeal and applicability of these results to other methods in machine learning are questionable. The results appear to be very specific to the RKM formulation, which is not a standard method, and may not easily adapt to other techniques.
The presentation and clarity of certain sections, such as section 3.3, are unclear, and the reviewer questions the necessity of recapitulating known literature without presenting a formal theorem. Additionally, the consistency results, specifically Theorem 2, are unclear, and it is uncertain whether it presents an asymptotic convergence result or a non-asymptotic result as mentioned in the abstract.
The simulation results comparing RKM to trimmed k-means are interesting, but the conclusions that can be drawn from them are limited. The results show that both algorithms perform similarly in practice, but it is unclear whether this is due to the specific choice of parameters or the underlying structure of the data.
Overall, the paper provides some interesting insights into the properties of RKM, but its contributions are limited by the specificity of the results to the RKM formulation and the lack of clarity in certain sections. The paper could benefit from further clarification and generalization of the results to make them more applicable to other methods in machine learning.
