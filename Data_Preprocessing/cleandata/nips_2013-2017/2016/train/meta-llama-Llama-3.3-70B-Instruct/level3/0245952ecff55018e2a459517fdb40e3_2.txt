This paper proposes two novel optimization methods, a gradient-free and a gradient-based approach, to solve the non-convex loss-minimization problem of learning Supervised PageRank models. The authors extend the concept of an inexact oracle to handle the challenges of computing the loss function and its derivatives, and provide convergence rate guarantees for both methods.
The paper is well-structured and clearly written, with a thorough introduction to the problem and the proposed methods. The authors provide a detailed analysis of the computational complexity and convergence rates of the algorithms, and demonstrate their effectiveness through experiments on a real-world web page ranking task.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of two novel optimization methods that can handle the non-convex loss-minimization problem of learning Supervised PageRank models.
* The provision of convergence rate guarantees for both methods, which is a significant contribution to the field.
* The thorough analysis of the computational complexity and convergence rates of the algorithms.
* The demonstration of the effectiveness of the proposed methods through experiments on a real-world web page ranking task.
However, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement:
* The paper could benefit from a more intuitive explanation of the formula being optimized and the actual computations performed during the algorithm.
* The authors could provide more insights into the trade-off between the accuracy of the lower-level algorithm and the computational complexity of the two-level algorithm.
* The experimental results could be more comprehensive, with a larger dataset and more comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods.
Overall, the paper is well-written and makes a significant contribution to the field of optimization and machine learning. With some revisions to address the weaknesses and areas for improvement, the paper has the potential to be a strong candidate for acceptance.
