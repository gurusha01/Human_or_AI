This paper proposes a novel framework for semi-supervised active clustering (SSAC) that leverages same-cluster queries to gain domain knowledge and improve clustering performance. The authors introduce a notion of clusterability, called the γ-margin property, which characterizes the ease of clustering a dataset. They provide a probabilistic polynomial-time algorithm for clustering with queries that succeeds under the assumption that the input satisfies the γ-margin condition for γ > 1. The algorithm makes O(k log n + k^2 log k) same-cluster queries to the oracle and runs in O(kn log n) time.
The paper also establishes a lower bound on the number of queries needed to overcome the NP-hardness of k-means clustering, showing that at least Ω(log k + log n) queries are required. The authors demonstrate that access to a limited number of query answers can turn an otherwise NP-hard clustering problem into a feasible one, highlighting an interesting trade-off between query complexity and computational complexity.
The strengths of the paper include its novel framework for SSAC, its thorough analysis of the computational and query complexity of the problem, and its well-structured and easy-to-follow presentation. The authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, a detailed description of their algorithm and its analysis, and a comprehensive discussion of related work.
However, there are some minor concerns and suggestions for improvement. The notation could be more consistent throughout the paper, and some terms could be defined more clearly. Additionally, the authors could provide more intuition and motivation for the γ-margin property and its relationship to other notions of clusterability. The experimental evaluation of the algorithm could be more comprehensive, including comparisons to other clustering algorithms and an analysis of the sensitivity of the algorithm to different parameters.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of clustering and semi-supervised learning, and its results have important implications for the design of efficient and effective clustering algorithms. The authors' work provides a foundation for further research in this area, and their ideas and techniques are likely to influence the development of new clustering algorithms and applications.
