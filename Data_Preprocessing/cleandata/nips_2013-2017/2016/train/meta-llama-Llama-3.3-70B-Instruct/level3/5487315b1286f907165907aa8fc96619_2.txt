This paper proposes a convex training formulation for a two-layer model with latent structure, which only requires tractable MAP inference on p(y|x) and is investigated for its effectiveness. The approach uses Lagrange multipliers and a saddle-point formulation to relax the non-convex problem into a convex semi-definite programming (SDP) formulation. The proposed method is demonstrated on tasks such as transliteration and image inpainting, and is shown to outperform the baselines. However, the experimental evaluation is considered weak, and the technical quality of the paper is sound, but some additional assumptions may be required to ensure efficiency.
The novelty of the approach is considered high, but the potential impact of the paper is hard to assess due to a lack of details on efficiency. The clarity of the paper is lacking in some important aspects, such as the introduction of bound constraints on model parameters. The reviewer raises several questions and concerns, including the tractability of the maximization task in the proposed formulation, the correctness of the replacement of the partition function with an upper bound, and the reason for introducing bound constraints on model parameters.
The reviewer suggests that the authors provide more recent baselines for comparison, comment on the computational complexity of the proposed method, and compare the proposed SDP approach to gradient descent on the objective. The paper's strengths include its ability to handle latent structure in a convex manner, its flexibility in modeling different types of data, and its potential for improving the state-of-the-art in various applications. However, its weaknesses include the lack of a strong experimental evaluation, the need for additional assumptions to ensure efficiency, and the lack of clarity in some aspects of the paper.
Overall, the paper has a good balance of strengths and weaknesses, and the reviewer recommends that the authors address the concerns and questions raised in the review to improve the paper's quality and impact. The arguments for acceptance include the paper's novelty, its potential for improving the state-of-the-art, and its ability to handle latent structure in a convex manner. The arguments against acceptance include the lack of a strong experimental evaluation, the need for additional assumptions to ensure efficiency, and the lack of clarity in some aspects of the paper. 
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, but some additional assumptions may be required to ensure efficiency. The claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis, but the experimental results are limited. The paper is a complete piece of work, but some aspects of the methodology and experimental evaluation could be improved. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of the work.
In terms of clarity, the paper is well-organized, but some aspects of the methodology and experimental evaluation could be improved. The paper adequately informs the reader, but some notation and terminology could be better explained. The paper provides enough information for the expert reader to reproduce the results, but some additional details could be provided to make the paper more accessible to a broader audience.
In terms of originality, the paper proposes a new formulation of two-layer models with latent structure, which is a novel contribution to the field. The approach is a new combination of familiar techniques, and the paper clearly explains how the work differs from previous contributions. The related work is adequately referenced, and the paper provides a clear overview of the current state of the art in the field.
In terms of significance, the paper has the potential to improve the state-of-the-art in various applications, including transliteration and image inpainting. The results are important, and other people are likely to use the ideas or build on them. The paper addresses a difficult problem in a better way than previous research, and it provides a unique theoretical or pragmatic approach to handling latent structure in a convex manner. However, the lack of a strong experimental evaluation and the need for additional assumptions to ensure efficiency limit the paper's significance and impact.
