This paper proposes a novel discriminant dimensionality reduction algorithm, Large Margin Discriminant Dimensionality Reduction (LADDER), which jointly learns the mapping and linear classifiers in an efficient manner. The authors establish a duality between boosting and SVM, and use this to derive the LADDER algorithm. The paper is well-written and clearly explains the concepts and ideas.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a new algorithm, LADDER, which combines the strengths of boosting and SVM to learn a discriminant dimensionality reduction.
* The establishment of a duality between boosting and SVM, which provides a new perspective on these two popular machine learning techniques.
* The experimental results, which demonstrate the effectiveness of LADDER in improving performance on tasks such as hashing and image/scene classification.
However, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement:
* The assumption that training observations have unit norm may not hold for all machine learning scenarios, and the authors should verify if their results would hold in scenarios without this assumption.
* The encoding explanation needs improvement, particularly the final representation [0,0,0,0,0,1], to ensure clarity and understanding.
* The paper could benefit from more detailed comparisons with other related work, such as multiple kernel learning and deep neural networks.
* There are some minor errors in grammar and spelling, such as "algorthm" and "quatum", which should be corrected.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria of quality, clarity, originality, and significance. The paper is technically sound, well-organized, and provides enough information for the expert reader to reproduce the results. The proposal of LADDER is a novel combination of familiar techniques, and the experimental results demonstrate its significance and potential impact on the field.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper proposes a new and effective algorithm for discriminant dimensionality reduction.
* The establishment of a duality between boosting and SVM provides a new perspective on these two popular machine learning techniques.
* The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of LADDER in improving performance on tasks such as hashing and image/scene classification.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The assumption that training observations have unit norm may not hold for all machine learning scenarios.
* The encoding explanation needs improvement, particularly the final representation [0,0,0,0,0,1].
* The paper could benefit from more detailed comparisons with other related work.
Overall, I recommend accepting the paper, but with some revisions to address the weaknesses and areas for improvement mentioned above.
