This paper proposes a novel approach to estimating the coefficients of generalized linear models (GLMs) in the large-scale setting where the number of observations is much larger than the number of predictors. The authors show that the GLM coefficients are approximately proportional to the corresponding ordinary least squares (OLS) coefficients, and design an algorithm that achieves the same accuracy as the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) through iterations that attain up to a cubic convergence rate, with a per-iteration cost of O(n).
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, as well as a thorough review of related work. The proposed algorithm, called Scaled Least Squares (SLS), is simple and efficient, and the authors provide a detailed analysis of its computational properties. The paper also includes a thorough comparison between the proposed algorithm and other existing methods, including Newton-Raphson, Newton-Stein, BFGS, LBFGS, gradient descent, and accelerated gradient descent.
The theoretical results in the paper are sound, and the authors provide a rigorous analysis of the performance of the SLS estimator. Theorem 1 provides a bound on the error of the SLS estimator, and Theorem 2 provides a bound on the convergence rate of the estimator. The authors also provide a detailed discussion of the implications of their results, including the potential for applying similar proportionality relations to other large-scale optimization problems.
The experiments in the paper demonstrate the effectiveness of the SLS algorithm, and show that it outperforms other existing methods in terms of computational efficiency. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the results, and discuss the implications of their findings.
Overall, this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of large-scale optimization, and provides a novel and efficient approach to estimating the coefficients of GLMs. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, as well as a thorough review of related work.
