This paper proposes learning algorithms for contextual combinatorial semi-bandit problems with both known and unknown weights, providing regret bounds for both cases. The paper is well-structured and clearly written, making it easy to follow. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the problem, including a detailed description of the algorithms and their theoretical guarantees.
The paper's main contributions are the development of two algorithms: VCEE for the known weight setting and EELS for the unknown weight setting. VCEE achieves a regret bound of ˜O( p KLT logN), which is the best known bound for computationally efficient procedures. EELS, on the other hand, achieves a regret bound of ˜O(T^{2/3}(K logN)^{1/3} max{B^{1/3}L^{1/2}, BL^{1/6}}), which is the best known bound for this setting.
The experimental evaluation of VCEE on two large-scale learning-to-rank datasets demonstrates its effectiveness in practice. The results show that VCEE outperforms existing alternatives, including ε-GREEDY and LINUCB, especially when using a rich policy class.
One potential improvement for the paper is to provide a tighter regret bound for EELS. The current bound of ˜O(T^{2/3}) could potentially be improved to ˜O(T^{1/2}) with more advanced techniques. Additionally, the authors could consider providing more detailed analysis of the algorithms' computational complexity and scalability.
The paper is well-related to previous work in the field, and the authors provide a thorough discussion of the differences and similarities between their approach and existing methods. The paper also raises interesting questions for future research, such as whether it is possible to achieve ˜O( p KLT logN) regret with structured action spaces and unknown weights.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise presentation of their ideas. The paper's contributions are significant, and the experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in practice.
