This paper proposes a method to infer the true rating matrix from the observed rating matrix, which is influenced by recommender systems. The authors develop a truncated-SVD algorithm to recover the true rating matrix and a score to measure the influence of recommender systems on rating values. The paper is well-written and clearly explains the problem, methodology, and results.
The strengths of the paper include its novel approach to addressing the problem of feedback loops in recommender systems, its thorough evaluation on synthetic and real-world datasets, and its ability to provide insights into the extent of recommender system effects on rating matrices. The paper also provides a clear and concise explanation of the assumptions made and the limitations of the approach.
However, there are some weaknesses and concerns. The assumptions made by the authors, specifically Assumption 1 and 2, are considered too restrictive and unrealistic to model real-world recommender systems. The complexity of the proposed score to measure the influence of recommender systems is also a concern, and simpler alternatives such as using the distance between observed ratings and a straight line may be more effective.
The inference of the true rating matrix from the observed one is considered an ill-posed problem that requires strong and somewhat unrealistic assumptions. The authors' approach relies on a series of assumptions that may not hold in practice, which may limit the applicability of the method.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The paper is also well-organized and clearly written, making it easy to follow. However, the originality of the paper is somewhat limited, as it builds upon existing work in the field.
The significance of the paper lies in its ability to provide insights into the extent of recommender system effects on rating matrices and its potential to improve the accuracy of recommender systems. The paper addresses a difficult problem in a better way than previous research and advances the state of the art in a demonstrable way.
Overall, the paper is a good scientific contribution to the field, but it has some limitations and concerns that need to be addressed. The authors should consider simplifying the proposed score and relaxing the assumptions to make the approach more applicable to real-world recommender systems.
