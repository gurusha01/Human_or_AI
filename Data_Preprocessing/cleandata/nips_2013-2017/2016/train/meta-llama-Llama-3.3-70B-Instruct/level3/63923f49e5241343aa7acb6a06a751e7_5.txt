This paper explores the tractability of two fundamental operations on arithmetic circuits: multiplying two circuits and summing out a variable from a circuit. The authors introduce a new class of tractable arithmetic circuits, called Probabilistic Sentential Decision Diagrams (PSDDs), which support a polytime multiplication operation. This makes PSDDs suitable for a broader class of applications, including compiling probabilistic graphical models. The paper provides a thorough analysis of the properties and limitations of PSDDs, including their ability to represent probability distributions and perform probabilistic queries.
The paper is well-organized and clearly written, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments and understand the technical details. The introduction provides a good overview of the background and motivation for the work, and the related work section provides a comprehensive review of existing approaches to representing and manipulating probability distributions.
One of the strengths of the paper is its technical soundness. The authors provide rigorous proofs of their results, including the polytime complexity of the multiplication operation and the intractability of summing out a variable from a PSDD. The paper also includes a detailed analysis of the properties of PSDDs, including their ability to represent probability distributions and perform probabilistic queries.
Another strength of the paper is its significance. The authors demonstrate the utility of PSDDs in compiling probabilistic graphical models, which is an important application in artificial intelligence and machine learning. The paper also provides a new perspective on the representation and manipulation of probability distributions, which is a fundamental problem in these fields.
However, there are some areas where the paper could be improved. One potential weakness is the lack of empirical evaluation of the PSDD multiplication algorithm. While the paper provides a theoretical analysis of the algorithm's complexity, it would be helpful to see experimental results demonstrating its effectiveness in practice. Additionally, the paper could benefit from more discussion of the implications of the results for real-world applications.
In terms of originality, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field by introducing a new class of tractable arithmetic circuits and demonstrating their utility in compiling probabilistic graphical models. The paper also provides a new perspective on the representation and manipulation of probability distributions, which is a fundamental problem in artificial intelligence and machine learning.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication. It makes a significant contribution to the field, is technically sound, and is well-written and well-organized. While there are some areas where the paper could be improved, these are minor weaknesses that do not detract from the overall quality of the paper.
