This paper proposes an online pricing problem with strategic and patient buyers, where the patience of buyers is modeled by a time window. The authors develop an EXP3-based learning algorithm to determine the optimal price, which bundles time steps into epochs and uses feedback from each epoch to update the price. The algorithm achieves an upper bound of O(T2/3) regret over any sequence of T buyers with respect to the best fixed price in hindsight.
The paper also establishes a matching lower bound of Î©(T2/3) regret by reducing the problem to a multi-armed bandit problem with switching cost. The reduction involves constructing a sequence of stochastic buyers that forces the seller to incur a high regret.
The paper's modeling assumptions, such as requiring knowledge of workers' patience, may be problematic and vulnerable to strategic manipulation. Additionally, the lower bound established in the paper may not be the true lower bound, as it assumes the learner always posts prices for a fixed time window size.
The comparison to existing results, such as the discount model, may not be entirely accurate, and the claim that a previous paper is a special case of the current paper may be imprecise. However, the paper's techniques for proving the lower bound may be interesting and applicable to other problem settings, and the results are presented clearly.
Overall, the paper provides a significant contribution to the field of online pricing with strategic buyers, and the results have important implications for revenue maximization in e-commerce and other applications. The paper's strengths include its novel modeling of patient buyers, its development of an effective learning algorithm, and its establishment of a tight regret bound. However, the paper's weaknesses include its simplifying assumptions and its potential vulnerability to strategic manipulation.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel and important problem in online pricing with strategic buyers.
* The authors develop an effective learning algorithm and establish a tight regret bound.
* The paper's results have significant implications for revenue maximization in e-commerce and other applications.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The paper's modeling assumptions may be problematic and vulnerable to strategic manipulation.
* The lower bound established in the paper may not be the true lower bound.
* The comparison to existing results may not be entirely accurate.
Overall, I recommend accepting the paper due to its significant contribution to the field, its novel modeling and algorithmic developments, and its important implications for revenue maximization. However, the authors should be encouraged to address the paper's weaknesses and provide more robust and realistic modeling assumptions in future work.
