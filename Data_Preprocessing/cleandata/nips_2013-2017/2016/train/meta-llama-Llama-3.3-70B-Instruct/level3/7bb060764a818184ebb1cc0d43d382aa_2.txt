This paper proposes a novel approach to learning two-layer conditional models with latent structured representations. The authors develop a convex relaxation of the bi-level optimization problem, which allows for efficient training of the model. The key idea is to leverage the first-order optimality conditions of the inner-level optimization and enforce them via a mini-max formulation. The resulting convex formulation is then solved using semi-definite programming (SDP) relaxation.
The paper is well-organized and easy to follow, with clear explanations of the technical details. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the problem, including the limitations of existing approaches and the advantages of their proposed method. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach on two different tasks: transliteration and inpainting.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to handle complex latent structures, such as graph matching and linear chain models. The authors show that their approach can be applied to a wide range of problems, making it a valuable contribution to the field.
However, there are some limitations to the paper. The authors assume that the latent structure is PO-tractable, which may not always be the case. Additionally, the paper focuses on a specific type of latent structure, and it is unclear how the approach would generalize to other types of structures.
The paper also raises some questions about the significance of the improvement obtained by the proposed approach. While the results are promising, it is unclear whether the approach would scale to larger datasets and more complex problems.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The paper is also well-written, making it easy to understand the technical details.
In terms of clarity, the paper is well-organized, and the authors provide clear explanations of the technical details. The notation is consistent, and the figures and tables are well-labeled.
In terms of originality, the paper proposes a novel approach to learning two-layer conditional models with latent structured representations. The authors combine existing techniques, such as SDP relaxation and mini-max formulation, in a new and innovative way.
In terms of significance, the paper has the potential to make a significant impact on the field of machine learning. The approach proposed in the paper could be applied to a wide range of problems, and the results demonstrate its effectiveness on two different tasks.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, as it makes a significant contribution to the field of machine learning. However, I would suggest that the authors address some of the limitations and questions raised in the paper, such as the assumption of PO-tractability and the scalability of the approach.
