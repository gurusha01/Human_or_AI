This paper proposes a novel approach to deconvolve feedback loops in recommender systems, which is a crucial problem in collaborative filtering. The authors develop a mathematical framework to recover the true ratings matrix from the observed ratings matrix, using a set of reasonable assumptions about the recommender system. The approach is based on singular value decomposition (SVD) and is able to identify items that are heavily influenced by the recommender system.
The paper is well-written and clearly explains the problem, the proposed approach, and the experimental results. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the synthetic and real-world datasets, and the results show that the proposed approach is effective in identifying items with high recommender effects.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel approach to deconvolve feedback loops in recommender systems, which is a significant contribution to the field.
* The use of SVD to recover the true ratings matrix, which is a well-established technique in matrix factorization.
* The thorough analysis of the synthetic and real-world datasets, which provides strong evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
However, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement:
* The assumptions made about the recommender system may not always hold in practice, which could limit the applicability of the proposed approach.
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with existing methods for deconvolving feedback loops, to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach.
* Some of the notation and equations could be clarified, to make the paper more accessible to readers who are not familiar with the technical details.
Overall, the paper is well-written and makes a significant contribution to the field of recommender systems. With some minor revisions to address the weaknesses and areas for improvement, the paper has the potential to be a strong candidate for acceptance.
