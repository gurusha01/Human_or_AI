This paper proposes a novel approach to learning two-layer conditional models with latent structured representations. The key idea is to relax the bi-level optimization problem into a convex formulation, leveraging the first-order optimality conditions of the inner-level optimization. The resulting convex model allows for jointly optimal estimation of model parameters and latent structured representations.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of their approach. The technical contributions are significant, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The use of a convex relaxation to address the bi-level optimization problem is a clever idea, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of the properties of the resulting convex model.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to handle complex latent structures, such as graph matching and linear chain models. The authors demonstrate the flexibility of their approach by applying it to two different problem domains: transliteration and inpainting. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both domains.
The paper also provides a thorough analysis of the theoretical properties of the proposed approach. The authors show that the extreme points of the feasible region have a low-rank structure, which is an interesting result that could have implications for other areas of machine learning.
However, there are some areas where the paper could be improved. One potential weakness is that the experimental results are limited to two problem domains, and it would be interesting to see how the approach performs on other tasks. Additionally, the paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with other related work in the area of latent structured representations.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets all the criteria for a good scientific paper. The paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The paper is clearly written, and the organization is logical and easy to follow. The paper also demonstrates originality and significance, as it proposes a novel approach to learning two-layer conditional models with latent structured representations.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication. The technical contributions are significant, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. With some minor revisions to address the areas mentioned above, the paper has the potential to make a substantial impact in the field of machine learning.
