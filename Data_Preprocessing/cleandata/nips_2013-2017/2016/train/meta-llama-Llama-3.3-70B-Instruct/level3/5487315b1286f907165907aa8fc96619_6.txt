This paper proposes a novel approach to contextual semibandits, a problem that arises in various applications such as personalized search and recommendation systems. The authors develop two oracle-based algorithms, VCEE and EELS, for the cases where the weights are known and unknown, respectively. The paper provides a thorough analysis of the algorithms, including regret bounds and experimental evaluations.
The strengths of the paper include its technical soundness, clarity, and significance. The authors provide a clear and well-organized presentation of their ideas, making it easy to follow their arguments. The paper also demonstrates a good understanding of the related work and provides a thorough comparison with existing approaches.
One of the key contributions of the paper is the development of VCEE, which achieves a regret bound of ËœO( p KLT logN) in the case of known weights. This bound is superior to existing approaches, such as the algorithm of Kale et al. [12], which requires an exponentially worse running time. The authors also provide an empirical evaluation of VCEE on two large-scale learning-to-rank datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in practice.
The paper also proposes EELS, an algorithm for the case of unknown weights. While the regret bound of EELS is not as strong as that of VCEE, it is still a significant contribution, as it provides a computationally efficient approach to learning the weights and achieving sublinear regret.
However, there are some potential weaknesses and areas for improvement. One concern is the assumption of a linear relationship between the semibandit feedback and the reward. While this assumption is common in the literature, it may not always hold in practice. The authors could consider exploring more general relationships between the feedback and the reward.
Another potential area for improvement is the exploration-exploitation tradeoff in VCEE. While the algorithm achieves a good balance between exploration and exploitation, it may be possible to improve the tradeoff by using more sophisticated exploration strategies.
In terms of originality, the paper makes significant contributions to the field of contextual semibandits. The development of VCEE and EELS represents a novel approach to this problem, and the paper provides a thorough analysis of the algorithms and their properties.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication. The paper makes significant contributions to the field, and the authors provide a clear and well-organized presentation of their ideas. While there are some potential weaknesses and areas for improvement, the paper's strengths outweigh its weaknesses, and it has the potential to make a significant impact in the field.
