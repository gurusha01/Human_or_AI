This paper proposes a modification to the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) algorithm, a popular derivative-free optimization method, by using Cholesky decomposition instead of eigen-decomposition to reduce time and storage complexity. The authors claim that this modification, referred to as Cholesky-CMA-ES, achieves a better asymptotic time complexity of O(Âµd2) for the covariance update and optimal memory complexity, while maintaining the same performance as the original CMA-ES in terms of the number of objective function evaluations.
The paper is well-written and provides a clear explanation of the proposed method, including a theoretical justification for the convergence of the new algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate a significant increase in optimization speed, with the Cholesky-CMA-ES being up to 20 times faster than the standard CMA-ES for high-dimensional problems.
However, the originality of the paper is limited, as it appears to be a trivial extension of previous work, with methods being basically identical. The paper also lacks essential contents, such as proof of algorithm equivalence to formula (2) and detailed discussion of computational complexity. Additionally, the claim of small error in the path decreasing over time contradicts Hansen's claim and requires experimental validation beyond just comparing final performance.
The paper has some notation errors, such as changing 'wk' to '\alphak' and 'n' to 'd', and 'F' to 'f' in line 185, which need to be corrected. Furthermore, the paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the implications of the proposed method and its potential applications.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria of being a good scientific paper, with a clear and well-organized structure, and providing enough information for the expert reader to reproduce the results. However, the paper could be improved by addressing the limitations and weaknesses mentioned above.
