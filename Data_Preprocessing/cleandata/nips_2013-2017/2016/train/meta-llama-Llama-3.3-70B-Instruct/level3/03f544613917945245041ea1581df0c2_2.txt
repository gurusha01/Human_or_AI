This paper proposes a novel framework for semi-supervised active clustering (SSAC) that leverages same-cluster queries to gain domain knowledge and improve clustering performance. The authors introduce a notion of clusterability, called the γ-margin property, which characterizes the separability of clusters. They provide an efficient algorithm for clustering with queries, which succeeds with high probability under the assumption that the input satisfies the γ-margin property for γ > 1. The algorithm makes O(k log n + k^2 log k) same-cluster queries and runs in O(kn log n) time.
The paper also presents a hardness result, showing that k-means clustering is NP-hard even when the optimal solution satisfies the γ-margin property for γ = √3.4. However, with access to a limited number of queries, the problem becomes efficiently solvable. The authors provide a lower bound on the number of queries needed to make the NP-hard problem feasible, indicating that at least Ω(log k + log n) queries are required.
The strengths of this paper include its novel framework for SSAC, its efficient algorithm for clustering with queries, and its thorough analysis of the computational and query complexity of the problem. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their results.
However, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement. The paper assumes that the oracle conforms to a center-based clustering with a notion of margin, which may not always be the case in practice. The authors could provide more discussion on the applicability of their framework to real-world scenarios. Additionally, the paper could benefit from more experimental evaluations to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
In terms of originality, the paper combines two themes in clustering research: clustering with partial supervision and the computational complexity of clustering tasks. The authors introduce a new notion of clusterability, which is related to but distinct from previous notions of niceness of data. The paper's results are significant, as they demonstrate a trade-off between query complexity and computational complexity in the clustering domain.
The significance of this paper lies in its potential to improve clustering performance in practice. The proposed framework and algorithm could be applied to various domains, such as image segmentation, customer segmentation, and gene expression analysis. The paper's results could also inspire further research on the computational and query complexity of clustering problems.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, as it presents a novel and significant contribution to the field of clustering research. However, I would suggest that the authors address the weaknesses and areas for improvement mentioned above to strengthen their paper.
