This paper proposes a novel approach to learning deep feature embeddings, called Position-Dependent Deep Metric (PDDM), which adapts to the local feature structure in a heterogeneous space. The authors argue that the traditional Euclidean distance metric is suboptimal for hard sample mining, especially in real-world vision tasks with complex feature variations. The PDDM unit is designed to learn a locally adaptive similarity metric, which is used to select high-quality hard samples in a local neighborhood to guide the deep embedding learning.
The paper is well-organized, and the authors provide a clear motivation for their approach. The proposed method is evaluated on two challenging image retrieval datasets, CUB-200-2011 and CARS196, and demonstrates significant improvements over state-of-the-art deep embedding methods. The authors also show that their learned feature embedding generalizes well to new classes in transfer learning and zero-shot learning scenarios.
However, there are some areas that need improvement. The paper could benefit from more detailed explanations of the PDDM unit and the double-header hinge loss function. Additionally, the authors could provide more insights into the hyperparameter tuning process and the sensitivity of the method to different hyperparameter settings.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors provide a thorough discussion of related work and clearly highlight the contributions of their approach.
The clarity of the paper is good, but there are some notational inconsistencies and minor errors in the text. The authors could improve the readability of the paper by providing more intuitive explanations of the technical concepts and using more consistent notation throughout the paper.
The originality of the paper is high, as the authors propose a novel approach to learning deep feature embeddings that adapts to the local feature structure. The significance of the paper is also high, as the proposed method has the potential to improve the performance of deep learning models in various computer vision tasks.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, but with some revisions to address the minor issues mentioned above. The strengths of the paper include its novel approach, thorough evaluation, and significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods. The weaknesses include some notational inconsistencies, minor errors, and the need for more detailed explanations of the technical concepts.
