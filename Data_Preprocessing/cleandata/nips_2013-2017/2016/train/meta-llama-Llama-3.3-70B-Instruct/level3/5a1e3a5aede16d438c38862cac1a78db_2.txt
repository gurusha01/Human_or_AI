This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of sparse vector recovery, providing a theoretical analysis of support recovery guarantees using the L1 regularizer and non-smooth fidelity terms. The authors extend the existing theory from the smooth L2 case to non-smooth cases, including L1 and L∞ losses, which is a notable achievement.
The paper's main result, Theorem 1, characterizes the stability of the support of the vector to recover in terms of dual certificates, which is a novel approach. The theorem provides a sharp condition that ensures the support of the vector to recover is stable to small additive noise in the observations. The authors also provide a detailed numerical analysis of the support stability/instability of compressed sensing recovery with different losses, which highlights the usefulness of their theory.
However, the presentation of the results could be improved. The analysis of support stability is presented in terms of dual certificates, which may diminish the clarity of the results and requires further explanation. Additionally, the main result lacks clear information on how close the estimated support is to the actual support, making it difficult to understand the impact of noise levels and vector magnitudes.
The experiments attempt to address the question of support recovery, but a comparison between the actual minimizer and the true signal is needed for a clearer presentation. The presentation of the results is also obscure, and the authors should either comment on the interest of the extended support or rephrase the results to address the actual recovered support.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of their work. The paper is well-organized, but some sections could be improved for better clarity.
The originality of the paper lies in its novel approach to analyzing support recovery guarantees using non-smooth fidelity terms. The authors provide a unique combination of familiar techniques, and their work differs significantly from previous contributions. The related work is adequately referenced, and the authors clearly explain how their work advances the state of the art.
The significance of the paper lies in its potential impact on the field of sparse vector recovery. The results could be used to improve the performance of compressed sensing algorithms and provide a better understanding of the behavior of non-smooth loss functions. The paper addresses a difficult problem in a better way than previous research and provides a unique theoretical and pragmatic approach.
