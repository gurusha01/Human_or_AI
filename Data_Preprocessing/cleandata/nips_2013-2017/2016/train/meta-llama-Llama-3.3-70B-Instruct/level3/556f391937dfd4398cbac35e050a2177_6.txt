This paper proposes a novel approach to domain adaptation in deep networks, which enables end-to-end learning of adaptive classifiers and transferable features. The method, called Residual Transfer Network (RTN), relaxes the shared-classifier assumption made by previous methods and assumes that the source and target classifiers differ by a small residual function. The RTN approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard domain adaptation benchmarks, including Office-31 and Office-Caltech.
The paper's strengths include its ability to learn adaptive classifiers and transferable features simultaneously, which is a significant improvement over previous methods that only adapt feature layers. The use of residual learning to bridge the source and target classifiers is also a key contribution. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the RTN approach, particularly on hard transfer tasks where the source and target domains are very different.
However, there are some limitations to the paper. The method's novelty is limited by its use of existing techniques, such as deep residual learning and maximum mean discrepancy. The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the trade-off between the entropy penalty and the residual module, as well as a more thorough evaluation of the method's sensitivity to hyperparameters. Additionally, the paper assumes that the source and target classifiers differ by a small residual function, which may not always be the case in practice.
In terms of quality, the paper is well-written and clearly explains the proposed method and its experimental results. The use of visualizations, such as t-SNE embeddings and layer responses, helps to illustrate the effectiveness of the RTN approach. However, the paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the related work and a clearer explanation of the differences between the RTN approach and previous methods.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of domain adaptation and has the potential to be a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners. However, it could benefit from some revisions to address the limitations mentioned above.
