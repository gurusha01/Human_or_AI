This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of machine learning, specifically in the context of Gaussian mixture models (GMMs). The authors provide two fundamental results on the population likelihood function of GMMs with M â‰¥ 3 components, resolving an open question of Srebro [2007]. The first result shows that the population likelihood function has bad local maxima, even in the special case of equally-weighted mixtures of well-separated and spherical Gaussians. The second result demonstrates that the EM algorithm, as well as its first-order variant, with random initialization, converges to a bad critical point with high probability.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, including a detailed background and preliminary section. The main results are presented in a logical and easy-to-follow manner, with a clear explanation of the implications of the results. The authors also provide a thorough discussion of the related work and the significance of their contributions.
One of the strengths of the paper is the quality of the theoretical analysis. The authors provide rigorous proofs of their results, which are well-organized and easy to follow. The use of mathematical notation is consistent throughout the paper, making it easier to understand the technical details.
Another strength of the paper is its clarity. The authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the problem, the methodology, and the results. The paper is well-organized, with a logical flow of ideas, making it easy to follow.
The originality of the paper is also a significant strength. The authors provide a novel contribution to the field, resolving an open question and providing new insights into the behavior of the EM algorithm in the context of GMMs.
The significance of the paper is also high. The results have important implications for the practice of using EM algorithms in machine learning, highlighting the need for careful initialization and the potential for poor performance in certain scenarios.
One potential weakness of the paper is the lack of experimental comparison with prior work. While the authors provide a thorough theoretical analysis, it would be useful to see empirical results to support the theoretical findings. However, the authors have agreed to add empirical results in the final version, which will strengthen the paper.
In conclusion, this paper presents a significant contribution to the field of machine learning, providing a rigorous theoretical analysis of the population likelihood function of GMMs and the behavior of the EM algorithm. The paper is well-written, clear, and concise, making it easy to follow and understand. The results have important implications for the practice of using EM algorithms in machine learning, and the paper is a valuable addition to the field.
