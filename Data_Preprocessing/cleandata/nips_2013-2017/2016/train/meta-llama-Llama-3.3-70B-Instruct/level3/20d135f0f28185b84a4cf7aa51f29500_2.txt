This paper proposes a novel approach to training ensembles of deep neural networks, called Stochastic Multiple Choice Learning (sMCL), which allows networks to specialize themselves by minimizing the oracle loss. The approach is simple to implement, agnostic to both architecture and loss function, and parameter-free. The authors demonstrate the broad applicability and efficacy of sMCL for training diverse deep ensembles on various tasks, including image classification, semantic segmentation, and image captioning.
The paper is well-written and clearly presents the idea of sMCL, which is a significant improvement over existing methods. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the training and output behaviors of the resulting ensembles, demonstrating how ensemble member specialization and expertise emerge automatically when trained using sMCL. The experimental results show that sMCL outperforms existing baselines, including classical ensembles and other strong baselines, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on several tasks.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel and effective approach to training ensembles of deep neural networks
* The demonstration of the broad applicability and efficacy of sMCL on various tasks
* The provision of a thorough analysis of the training and output behaviors of the resulting ensembles
* The achievement of state-of-the-art performance on several tasks
However, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement:
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the limitations and potential drawbacks of the sMCL approach
* The authors could provide more insight into the interpretability of the specialized ensemble members and how they can be used in practice
* The paper could be improved by including more visualizations and examples to illustrate the effectiveness of sMCL
* The authors could explore the application of sMCL to other tasks and domains, such as natural language processing and reinforcement learning
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the proposed approach is novel and effective. The experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of sMCL, and the analysis provides valuable insights into the behavior of the resulting ensembles. With some minor improvements, the paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of deep learning.
