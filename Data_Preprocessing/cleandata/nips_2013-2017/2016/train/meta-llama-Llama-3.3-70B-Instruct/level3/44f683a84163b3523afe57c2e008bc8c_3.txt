This paper proposes a novel neural memory architecture called Sparse Access Memory (SAM), which enables efficient training of neural networks with large external memories. The key innovation of SAM is the use of sparse read and write operations, which reduces the computational and memory overhead of traditional memory-augmented neural networks. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of SAM on a range of tasks, including algorithmic tasks, question answering, and one-shot learning, and show that it outperforms existing models in terms of speed and memory efficiency.
The paper is well-written and clearly explains the technical details of the SAM architecture. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the time and space complexity of SAM and demonstrate its asymptotic optimality. The experimental results are impressive, showing that SAM can learn with comparable efficiency to dense models and even outperform them in some cases.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to scale to large memories and sequence lengths, making it a promising approach for real-world applications. The use of approximate nearest neighbor indexes, such as k-d trees and locality-sensitive hashing, allows for efficient querying of the memory, and the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of these approaches in practice.
However, one potential weakness of the paper is the lack of technical novelty, as it builds upon existing work on memory-augmented neural networks. While the authors do provide a thorough analysis of the time and space complexity of SAM, the underlying architecture is not significantly different from existing models. Additionally, the paper could benefit from more detailed analysis of the latent representation and the effect of changing dimensions and neuron activation.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the results are impressive. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the technical details of SAM and demonstrate its effectiveness on a range of tasks. While there may be some limitations to the paper, it is a significant contribution to the field of neural memory architectures and has the potential to impact real-world applications.
