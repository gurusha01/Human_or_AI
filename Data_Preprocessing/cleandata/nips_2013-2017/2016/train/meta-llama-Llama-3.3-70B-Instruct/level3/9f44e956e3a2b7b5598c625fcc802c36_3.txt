This paper proposes a novel approach to reduce memory consumption of the backpropagation through time (BPTT) algorithm when training recurrent neural networks (RNNs). The authors introduce an intermediate timescale to neural networks, which improves computation by adding an input corresponding to the correlation of the current network state with past states. The paper presents novel ideas, particularly in the context of standard machine learning tasks, with a new form of addition that effectively utilizes intermediate timescales.
The proposed approach, called Backpropagation though time with mixed state memorization (BPTT-MSM), is a significant improvement over existing methods, such as Chen's âˆšt algorithm. The authors demonstrate that BPTT-MSM can fit within almost any user-defined memory constraints, gaining maximal computational performance. The algorithm is capable of tightly fitting within almost any user-set memory budget while finding an optimal execution policy minimizing the computational cost.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the proposed approach. The use of dynamic programming to find an optimal memory usage policy is a key contribution of the paper. The authors also provide a thorough analysis of the computational cost and memory usage of the proposed approach, as well as a comparison with existing methods.
However, there are some technical errors and areas for improvement. For example, there is an incorrect formatting in Table 3, and a missing reference on Line 277. Additionally, the use of mini-batches may limit memory, but this issue is not adequately discussed in the paper. The advantage of fast weights appears to be mostly beneficial for small networks, which could indicate a larger problem that requires further investigation.
