This paper presents a novel approach to representing probability distributions using Probabilistic Sentential Decision Diagrams (PSDDs), a subclass of arithmetic circuits. The authors demonstrate that PSDDs support a polytime multiplication operator, making them suitable for a broader class of applications, while they do not support a polytime summing-out operation. The paper provides a thorough analysis of the tractability of multiplication and summing-out operators for arithmetic circuits and introduces a simple compilation algorithm for PSDDs based on the multiply operator.
The results are novel and sound, relying on concentration inequalities for unbounded empirical processes, and provide new insights in an important area of research. The introduction of the "multiscale Bernstein condition" is crucial for obtaining fast rates, but a simpler example is needed to illustrate its intuition. The comparison to existing work by Audibert and Mehta and Grunwald highlights differences in conditions and proof techniques, and the authors should discuss the relation between these papers.
The approach does not immediately generalize to polynomial entropy numbers, and an explanation is needed for why this is the case, despite the use of chaining in the proofs. Additionally, the in-probability results are polynomial and not logarithmic in δ, which is different from typical results in learning theory.
The paper has some minor issues, including terminology, notation, and formatting, which should be addressed before acceptance. However, the paper is well-organized, and the authors provide enough information for the expert reader to reproduce the results.
The significance of the paper lies in its ability to provide a new and efficient way to compile probabilistic graphical models into arithmetic circuits, which can be used for various inference tasks. The empirical evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach, and the results are promising.
In conclusion, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of probabilistic graphical models and arithmetic circuits. The results are novel, sound, and well-presented, and the paper provides new insights into the tractability of multiplication and summing-out operators for arithmetic circuits. With some minor revisions to address the issues mentioned above, the paper is ready for acceptance.
