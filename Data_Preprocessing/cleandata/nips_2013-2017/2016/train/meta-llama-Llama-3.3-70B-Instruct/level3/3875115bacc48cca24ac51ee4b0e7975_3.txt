This paper explores the existence of local modes in the log-likelihood of Gaussian mixture models, demonstrating that they can exist even with infinite data and be arbitrarily bad. The authors show that random initialization can cause the EM algorithm to miss the global optima almost certainly as the number of components increases. While the paper provides valuable insights into the behavior of the EM algorithm, its practical relevance is questionable. The configurations that lead to local modes may be unlikely to occur in practice, and random initialization may not be a common practice when the data is clearly clustered.
The paper's theorem 2 is also criticized for not providing a clear statement on the likelihood of "bad" configurations under certain assumptions. Some parts of the paper are unclear or redundant, such as the example on lines 74-81 and a sentence on lines 172. To improve the paper, several minor changes are suggested, including corrections to typos and rephrasing of certain sentences for clarity.
The paper's quality is good, with well-supported claims and a clear structure. However, the originality of the paper is somewhat limited, as it builds upon existing work on Gaussian mixture models and the EM algorithm. The significance of the paper lies in its contribution to the understanding of the behavior of the EM algorithm and the importance of careful initialization.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper provides a valuable contribution to the understanding of the behavior of the EM algorithm and the importance of careful initialization.
* The paper is well-structured and easy to follow, with clear explanations of the theoretical results.
* The paper provides a negative answer to the open question of Srebro [2007], which is an important result in the field.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The practical relevance of the paper is questionable, as the configurations that lead to local modes may be unlikely to occur in practice.
* The paper's theorem 2 is not clear, and the likelihood of "bad" configurations under certain assumptions is not well-defined.
* Some parts of the paper are unclear or redundant, which may make it difficult for readers to understand the results.
Overall, the paper is well-written and provides a valuable contribution to the field, but its practical relevance and originality are limited. With some minor revisions to address the unclear or redundant parts, the paper could be a good fit for the conference.
