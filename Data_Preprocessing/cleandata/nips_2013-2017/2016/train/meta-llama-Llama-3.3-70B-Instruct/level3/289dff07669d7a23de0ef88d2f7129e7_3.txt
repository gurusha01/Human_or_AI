This paper proposes a modified version of the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) algorithm, called Cholesky-CMA-ES, which updates the triangular Cholesky factor of the covariance matrix instead of the covariance matrix itself. The authors prove the convergence of the algorithm under certain assumptions and demonstrate its efficiency through empirical experiments. 
The paper's main contribution is the development of a numerically stable quadratic-time covariance matrix update scheme with minimal memory requirements. However, the significance of this contribution is somewhat diminished by the similarity of the proposed approach to existing work by Krause et al. in 2015, which also used a rank-1 update to the triangular Cholesky factor. 
The technical quality of the paper is good, but there are some errors, such as incorrect notation in equation (1) and a typo in line 94. The convergence of the covariance in CMA-ES is generally proven through theoretical analysis, which could improve the confidence of Lemma 1. 
The experiments demonstrate that the Cholesky-CMA-ES requires the same amount of function evaluations as the standard CMA-ES but is significantly faster in terms of wall-clock time, especially for high-dimensional problems. 
Arguments pro acceptance:
- The paper proposes a novel and efficient algorithm for covariance matrix adaptation in CMA-ES.
- The empirical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
- The paper provides a thorough analysis of the algorithm's properties and convergence.
Arguments con acceptance:
- The contribution of the paper is not highly significant due to similarities with existing work.
- The paper contains technical errors that need to be corrected.
- The convergence proof could be improved through more rigorous theoretical analysis.
Overall, the paper is well-written and provides a valuable contribution to the field of derivative-free optimization. However, the significance of the contribution and the technical quality of the paper could be improved with further refinement and attention to detail.
