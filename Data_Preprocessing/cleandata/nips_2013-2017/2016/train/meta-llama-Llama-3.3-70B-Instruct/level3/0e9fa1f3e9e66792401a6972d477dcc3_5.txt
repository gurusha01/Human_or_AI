This paper proposes a novel method, Bounding Divergences with Reverse Annealing (BREAD), to evaluate the accuracy of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) based posterior inference algorithms. The authors extend the bidirectional Monte Carlo (BDMC) technique to estimate the Jeffreys divergence between the true posterior distribution and the distribution of approximate samples. The method is applicable to algorithms that can be viewed as importance sampling over an extended state space, such as annealed importance sampling (AIS) or sequential Monte Carlo (SMC).
The main contribution of this work is the derivation of an estimator that upper bounds in expectation the Jeffreys divergence between the distribution of approximate samples and the true posterior distribution. The authors also propose a protocol for using BDMC to evaluate the accuracy of approximate inference on real-world datasets by simulating data from fitted hyperparameters.
The paper has several strengths. Firstly, the proposed methodology provides a rigorous and general framework for evaluating the accuracy of MCMC-based posterior inference algorithms. Secondly, the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method on several models and datasets, including a matrix factorization model in both WebPPL and Stan. Finally, the paper highlights the potential of BREAD as a debugging tool, as it can help identify bugs in the implementation of probabilistic programming languages.
However, the paper also has some weaknesses. One of the main challenges of BDMC is that it requires an exact sample from the target measure, which can be difficult to obtain in practice. The authors attempt to overcome this challenge with heuristics, including performing diagnostics on the posterior generated by synthetic data. However, these heuristics rely on strong assumptions, such as knowing a representative hyperparameter value and that the posterior induced by synthetic data has similar properties to the original posterior.
Furthermore, the authors' assumptions, such as starting from a known hyperparameter value allowing for quick drawing of an almost exact sample, are strong and unjustified in general. These assumptions may not hold in all cases, and the method may not perform well in scenarios where existing methods fail, such as multimodal cases or cases with insufficient summary statistics.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria of quality, clarity, and originality. The paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The paper is clearly written, and the authors provide enough information for the expert reader to reproduce the results. The paper also presents a novel combination of familiar techniques, and the authors adequately reference related work.
However, the paper could be improved by providing more convincing examples and simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, particularly in comparison to existing diagnostic tools. The authors should also provide more evidence to show that their method can perform better in scenarios where existing methods fail.
In conclusion, this paper presents a novel method for evaluating the accuracy of MCMC-based posterior inference algorithms. While the paper has several strengths, it also has some weaknesses, including strong assumptions and a lack of convincing examples. With further development and evaluation, the proposed methodology has the potential to become a useful tool for practitioners and researchers in the field of probabilistic inference.
