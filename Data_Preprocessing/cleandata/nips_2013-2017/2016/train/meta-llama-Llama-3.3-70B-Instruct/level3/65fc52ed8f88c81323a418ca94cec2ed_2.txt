This paper presents a novel approach for unsupervised learning of similarities between exemplars using a two-step process involving optimization and ConvNet learning. The authors address the problem of selecting relevant positive and negative examples for CNN-based similarity training by iteratively training the CNN and recomputing cliques/batches. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on sports-related action datasets and a traditional PASCAL image classification task, showing promising results.
The paper's main strengths lie in its ability to overcome key problems associated with exemplar "single-positive" methods, performing well compared to baselines. The approach is also able to learn a general feature representation for human pose that can be transferred across datasets. The experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method, with significant improvements over state-of-the-art approaches for posture analysis and retrieval.
However, the paper has some limitations. The computational complexity of the "mutually consistent relations" algorithm is unclear, and there is a lack of discussion on potential improvements. Additionally, some figures, such as Figures 1 and 4, are unclear and could be improved for better understanding.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, with claims well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of the work. The paper is well-organized, but some sections could be improved for clarity.
The originality of the paper lies in its novel combination of familiar techniques, addressing a difficult problem in a better way than previous research. The approach is significantly different from papers in previous proceedings, and the authors provide adequate references to related work.
The significance of the paper lies in its ability to advance the state of the art in a demonstrable way, providing unique data and conclusions on existing data. The approach has the potential to be used by practitioners and researchers, and the paper provides enough information for the expert reader to reproduce the results.
