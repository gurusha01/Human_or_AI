This paper introduces the concept of Conditional Generative Moment-Matching Networks (CGMMN), a flexible framework for representing conditional distributions. The authors propose a conditional maximum mean discrepancy (CMMD) criterion, which measures the difference between the kernel mean embedding of an empirical conditional distribution and that of a generative model. The CMMD objective is optimized using stochastic gradient descent, and the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of CGMMN on various tasks, including predictive modeling, contextual generation, and Bayesian dark knowledge.
The paper is well-structured and easy to follow, with a clear introduction to the background and motivation of the work. The authors provide a thorough explanation of the CMMD criterion and the CGMMN architecture, and the experimental results are well-presented and convincing. The paper also provides a good discussion of related work and the potential applications of CGMMN.
However, there are some areas where the paper could be improved. Firstly, the notation and presentation could be clearer, with some of the equations and formulas being difficult to follow. Additionally, the authors could provide more theoretical analysis of the CMMD criterion and the CGMMN architecture, to further establish the validity and effectiveness of the approach. Furthermore, the paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the potential limitations and challenges of the approach, and how they might be addressed in future work.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria of being a good scientific paper, with a clear and well-motivated introduction, a thorough explanation of the methodology, and convincing experimental results.
