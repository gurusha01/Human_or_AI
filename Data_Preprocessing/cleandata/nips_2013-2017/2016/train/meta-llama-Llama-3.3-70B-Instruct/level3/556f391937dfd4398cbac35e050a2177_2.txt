This paper presents a novel method for local similarity-aware embedding using a deep neural network, which outperforms state-of-the-art methods in image retrieval and transfer learning tasks. The proposed Position-Dependent Deep Metric (PDDM) unit learns a similarity metric adaptive to local feature structure, allowing for more effective hard sample mining and deep embedding learning. The method uses a double-header hinge loss to optimize both the similarity metric and feature embedding, resulting in faster convergence and improved performance.
The paper's strengths include its innovative approach to similarity metric learning, its ability to handle heterogeneous feature distributions, and its impressive performance on challenging image retrieval and transfer learning tasks. The authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of their method, including the architecture of the PDDM unit and the optimization process.
However, the paper has some weaknesses. The authors do not provide sufficient details on the optimization process, including the gradient and objective optimization. Additionally, the impact of mini-batch sizes on performance and the initialization of parameters are not clearly explained. The results section lacks standard deviation and statistical significance of the results, making it difficult to verify the claims made in the paper.
To improve the paper, the authors should provide more detailed explanations of the architecture, optimization process, and experimental settings. They should also include more technical details on the implementation and network architecture, making it easier for other researchers to reproduce the results. Furthermore, the authors should provide a more thorough analysis of the results, including standard deviation and statistical significance, to support their claims.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of deep learning and image retrieval, and with some revisions to address the weaknesses, it has the potential to be a strong paper.
