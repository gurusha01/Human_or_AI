This paper presents a novel approach to reducing memory consumption in recurrent neural networks (RNNs) by using dynamic programming to balance the trade-off between caching intermediate results and recomputation. The proposed algorithm, called Backpropagation through Time with Mixed State Memorization (BPTT-MSM), is capable of tightly fitting within almost any user-set memory budget while finding an optimal execution policy that minimizes computational cost.
The paper is well-written and provides a clear explanation of the proposed algorithm and its advantages over existing methods. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through experiments, showing that it can save up to 95% of memory usage while using only one-third more time per iteration than the standard Backpropagation through Time (BPTT) algorithm.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to provide a general framework for optimizing memory usage in RNNs, which can be applied to various RNN architectures and sequence lengths. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the computational cost and memory usage of their algorithm, which helps to understand its advantages and limitations.
However, there are some areas that could be improved. For example, the paper could benefit from additional analysis or examples of the low-level outcomes of the fast weight operation, as well as more detailed implementation details. Additionally, the Conclusion section could be reorganized into a Discussion section, providing more specific descriptions of the paper's contributions and their significance to relevant fields of study.
In terms of originality, the paper presents a novel combination of familiar techniques, using dynamic programming to optimize memory usage in RNNs. The approach is well-motivated and clearly explained, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of its advantages and limitations.
The significance of the paper lies in its ability to provide a practical solution to the problem of memory consumption in RNNs, which is a major challenge in training these models. The proposed algorithm has the potential to be widely adopted in the field of deep learning, particularly in applications where memory is limited, such as in mobile or embedded devices.
Overall, the paper is well-written and provides a significant contribution to the field of deep learning. With some minor revisions to address the areas mentioned above, it has the potential to be a strong candidate for acceptance at the NIPS conference.
