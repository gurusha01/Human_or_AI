This paper presents a refined algorithm for Monte-Carlo planning that merges Monte Carlo sampling with planning to explore only near-optimal states. The algorithm's sample complexity depends on the quantity of near-optimal states, and it improves over previous worst-case bounds under various conditions. The paper achieves improved worst-case bounds for finite states, bounds dependent on near-optimal policy space, and polynomial sample complexity for infinite states.
The strengths of this paper include its ability to provide a sharp analysis for the polyhedral cases, which allows for the control of the deviation of the support of the vector to recover from the true support. The paper also provides a unique theoretical contribution by extending the existing theory from the smooth `2 case to the non-smooth cases. Additionally, the algorithm is relatively simple to implement.
However, there are some weaknesses to the paper. The theoretical progress may have limited practical impact without an anytime version of the algorithm. The development of an anytime version could enhance the practical applications and make it more suitable for experimental testing. Furthermore, the paper assumes that the support of the vector to recover is stable to small additive noise, which may not always be the case in practice.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis. The paper is a complete piece of work, and the authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of the work. The clarity of the paper is good, and it is well-organized, making it easy to follow. The originality of the paper is high, as it presents a novel combination of familiar techniques. The significance of the paper is also high, as it addresses a difficult problem in a better way than previous research and advances the state of the art in a demonstrable way.
