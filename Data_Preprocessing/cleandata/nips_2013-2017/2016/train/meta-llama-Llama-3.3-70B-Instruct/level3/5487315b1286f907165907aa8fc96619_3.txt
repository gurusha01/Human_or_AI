This paper presents a novel approach to learning problems with latent structure, introducing a two-layer model that captures latent structure and estimates model parameters jointly and optimally. The proposed approach is convex, making it more tractable and efficient than previous non-convex methods. The paper provides a clear motivation and background, and the writing is easy to follow.
The key strengths of the paper are:
* The proposed approach is novel and has the potential to make a significant impact on applications with latent structure due to its general nature.
* The paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the approach, including theoretical guarantees and experimental results.
* The approach is relevant to other methods, such as convex two-layer modeling, hidden CRF, and latent structured SVM, but with key differences in how relations between variables are encoded.
However, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement:
* The introduction could be improved with an example to clarify the meaning of latent structure and its importance in machine learning applications.
* The connection to deep learning with structured prediction is not strongly motivated, and it would be helpful to provide more context and background on this topic.
* Some questions remain regarding the experimental results, such as the performance of the proposed approach in the setting of [12] and the implementation of [12]'s global learning method.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the approach is sound and well-motivated. The experimental results are comprehensive and demonstrate the promise of the method. With some revisions to address the weaknesses mentioned above, this paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of machine learning.
