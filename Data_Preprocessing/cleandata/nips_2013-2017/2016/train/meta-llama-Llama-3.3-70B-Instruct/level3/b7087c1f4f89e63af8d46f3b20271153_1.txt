This paper proposes a novel approach for unsupervised learning of similarities between large numbers of exemplars using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The authors address the challenges of single positive exemplar setup, imbalance between exemplar and negatives, and inconsistent labels within SGD batches by formulating an optimization problem that yields SGD batches of compact, mutually dissimilar cliques of samples. The approach is evaluated on three different datasets, including Olympic Sports, Leeds Sports, and PASCAL VOC 2007, and demonstrates competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.
The paper is well-written and clearly organized, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments and methodology. The introduction provides a thorough overview of the background and motivation, while the approach section delves into the technical details of the proposed method. The experimental evaluation is comprehensive and well-structured, with clear comparisons to other methods and baseline approaches.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to handle the challenges of unsupervised learning with a single positive exemplar. The authors' approach to forming compact cliques of samples and optimizing the batch selection process is innovative and effective. The use of a CNN to learn exemplar similarities is also well-motivated, and the experimental results demonstrate the benefits of this approach.
However, there are some areas where the paper could be improved. For example, the authors could provide more detailed analysis of the optimization problem and its solution, as well as more extensive comparisons to other state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, the paper could benefit from more discussion on the limitations and potential extensions of the proposed approach.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, with well-supported claims and a clear methodology. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of their work. The paper is also well-organized and clearly written, making it easy to understand and follow.
The originality of the paper is high, as it proposes a novel approach to unsupervised learning of similarities between exemplars. The authors' use of a CNN to learn exemplar similarities is innovative, and the optimization problem formulation is unique. The paper also provides a significant contribution to the field, as it addresses a challenging problem in computer vision and demonstrates competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.
The significance of the paper is also high, as it has the potential to impact a wide range of applications in computer vision, including object recognition, posture analysis, and image retrieval. The authors' approach could be used in a variety of settings, from surveillance to healthcare, and could potentially lead to breakthroughs in these fields.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, as it makes a significant contribution to the field of computer vision and demonstrates competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. The paper is well-written, well-organized, and technically sound, and has the potential to impact a wide range of applications.
