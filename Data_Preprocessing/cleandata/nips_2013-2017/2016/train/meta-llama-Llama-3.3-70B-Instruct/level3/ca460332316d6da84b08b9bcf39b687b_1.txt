This paper proposes a new objective function for clustering networks called the "Product Cut" based on a personalized PageRank matrix. The Product Cut is a multiplicative cut-based objective that takes into account the intra- and inter-connectivity of each partition. The authors provide a detailed analysis of the mathematical properties of this objective and show that it has a stronger balancing effect compared to the Normalized Cut. They also propose an algorithm for optimizing the Product Cut, which is based on a relaxed convex maximization problem.
The paper has several strengths. Firstly, the proposed objective function has a solid mathematical foundation and is well-motivated. The authors provide a clear explanation of the rationale behind the Product Cut and show that it can be optimized using a convex maximization program. The algorithm proposed for optimizing the Product Cut is also simple and efficient. The experimental results show that the Product Cut achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets.
However, there are also some weaknesses in the paper. Firstly, the convergence of the optimization strategy for convex maximization is not fully addressed. The authors mention that the algorithm converges after a finite number of iterations, but they do not provide a rigorous proof of convergence. Additionally, the paper could benefit from more evaluations, such as NMI or F1 score, to provide a more comprehensive comparison with other clustering algorithms.
Furthermore, the paper could be improved by providing more motivation for the new objective function and a clearer presentation of its properties. The authors mention that the Product Cut has a stronger balancing effect compared to the Normalized Cut, but they do not provide a detailed analysis of the implications of this property.
In terms of originality, the paper proposes a new objective function for clustering networks, which is a significant contribution to the field. The algorithm proposed for optimizing the Product Cut is also novel and efficient. However, the paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with other clustering algorithms and a more comprehensive evaluation of its performance.
Overall, the paper makes a small but significant contribution to the literature on clustering networks. The proposed objective function and algorithm have the potential to be useful in practice, and the paper provides a good foundation for further research in this area.
