This paper proposes a novel approach to object bounding box proposals using a tree-based reinforcement learning method within a deep Q-learning network framework. The authors achieve competitive region proposal and state-of-the-art object detection results, particularly on the PASCAL07 test set, with notable performance in recall and mean Average Precision (mAP) metrics.
The strengths of this paper include its ability to leverage the submodularity of the function f to derive efficient inference techniques, combining polyhedral structure with variational inference methods to obtain both lower and upper bounds on the partition function. The authors also provide a thorough evaluation of their approach, including experiments on synthetic and real-world examples, demonstrating the efficacy and scalability of their methods.
However, there are some weaknesses to consider. The evaluation of the approach is limited to 1500 proposals, making it difficult to compare with other baseline methods that show high recall beyond this number. Additionally, the proposed method appears to saturate early, unlikely to achieve high recall beyond 1500 proposals. Reporting results beyond this limit would strengthen the paper's scientific validity.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, with well-supported claims and a clear explanation of the methodology. The authors are careful to evaluate both the strengths and weaknesses of their work, providing a balanced discussion of the results. The paper is well-organized and clearly written, making it easy to follow for an expert reader.
The originality of the paper lies in its novel combination of tree-based reinforcement learning and deep Q-learning, applied to object bounding box proposals. The authors provide a clear explanation of how their work differs from previous contributions, including a thorough review of related work in the field.
The significance of the paper is evident in its potential to advance the state of the art in object detection. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on a range of datasets, including the challenging PASCAL07 test set. The paper provides a unique contribution to the field, with potential applications in computer vision and related areas.
