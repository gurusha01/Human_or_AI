This paper presents a theoretical analysis of the robustness and consistency properties of the Robust k-means (RKM) algorithm, a variant of the classical quadratic k-means clustering procedure. The authors show that RKM is not robust with a universal breakdown point of 2/n for unbiased proximal maps and 1/n for biased proximal maps, meaning that even a small fraction of outliers can cause significant damage to the estimates of the centers. However, when restricted to well-clustered data, RKM exhibits desirable noise robustness properties.
The paper is well-written and well-motivated, with results that are of interest to the community working on clustering. The study of robust variants of clustering problems has potential for big impact, and this work contributes to this area. The experiments in the paper are good, demonstrating the effectiveness of RKM on synthetic and real-world data.
The main contribution of the paper is theoretical, providing a detailed analysis of the optimality conditions for the RKM minimization problem. The authors also show that most general results for consistency of quadratic k-means still remain valid for this robust variant.
The strengths of the paper include its thorough analysis of the robustness and consistency properties of RKM, as well as its ability to provide a detailed description of the optimality conditions for the associated minimization problem. The paper also demonstrates the effectiveness of RKM on synthetic and real-world data.
The weaknesses of the paper are minor, including some typos and minor corrections that need to be made. However, these do not detract from the overall quality of the paper.
Overall, I recommend acceptance of this paper with minor revisions. The paper makes a significant contribution to the field of clustering and robust statistics, and its results are of interest to a wide range of researchers and practitioners.
