This paper proposes a novel approach to representing probability distributions using Probabilistic Sentential Decision Diagrams (PSDDs), which support a polytime multiplication operator. The authors demonstrate that PSDDs are suitable for a broader class of applications compared to other classes of arithmetic circuits, particularly in compiling probabilistic graphical models. The paper provides a clear and detailed explanation of the PSDD representation, its properties, and the multiplication algorithm.
The strengths of the paper include its originality, as it introduces a new method for inference in probabilistic models. The approach is well-motivated, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of the tractability of multiplication and summing-out operators for arithmetic circuits. The experiments demonstrate the advantages of PSDDs compared to other arithmetic circuit representations, showing that PSDDs can lead to more efficient compilations in some cases.
However, there are some weaknesses to the paper. The impact of the method is uncertain, and it is not clear how significant the reduction in auxiliary variables will be in practice. Additionally, the paper could benefit from more intuitive explanations of some of the technical concepts, such as Theorem 4. The authors should also consider adding more references to related work, particularly in the area of probabilistic graphical models.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of the work. The paper is clearly written, well-organized, and provides enough information for the expert reader to reproduce the results.
The originality of the paper is high, as it introduces a new representation and algorithm for probabilistic graphical models. The significance of the results is also high, as the paper addresses a difficult problem in a better way than previous research. The paper provides a unique approach to compiling probabilistic graphical models into arithmetic circuits, which can lead to more efficient inference algorithms.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, as it makes a significant contribution to the field of probabilistic graphical models. However, the authors should address the minor corrections suggested, such as fixing citation formats and clarifying theorem explanations.
