This paper proposes a semi-supervised active clustering framework that uses same-cluster queries to recover optimal clustering with a certain separability. The authors provide an efficient probabilistic polynomial-time algorithm to achieve this, which can efficiently solve instances that are NP-hard for k-means clustering. The framework exhibits interesting phase transition behavior, and the authors suggest that a more realistic oracle that can make mistakes should be considered to understand the necessary assumptions for efficient solvability.
The paper's strengths include its ability to handle heavy-tailed losses and its provision of a clear path to verify the multi-scale Bernstein's condition in practice. The authors also provide a comprehensive analysis of the framework's performance and compare it to existing results in the literature. However, the paper assumes a perfect oracle, which may not be realistic in practice. Additionally, the authors do not compare the time-quality tradeoff of their algorithm with k-means approximations, such as k-means++, which would be useful to understand the practical gains of their approach.
The results are based on a hard center-based clustering assumption, and it would be interesting to explore whether the results can be translated to the setting of recovering a Gaussian Mixture Model with a probabilistic oracle. A minor error is noted in Theorem 7, where "clustering instane" should be corrected to "clustering instance".
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel semi-supervised active clustering framework that can efficiently solve instances that are NP-hard for k-means clustering.
* The framework exhibits interesting phase transition behavior and provides a clear path to verify the multi-scale Bernstein's condition in practice.
* The authors provide a comprehensive analysis of the framework's performance and compare it to existing results in the literature.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The paper assumes a perfect oracle, which may not be realistic in practice.
* The authors do not compare the time-quality tradeoff of their algorithm with k-means approximations, such as k-means++.
* The results are based on a hard center-based clustering assumption, which may not be applicable to all clustering scenarios.
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of clustering and provides a novel framework for semi-supervised active clustering. While there are some limitations to the paper, the authors provide a clear and comprehensive analysis of their framework, and the results have the potential to be useful in practice. Therefore, I recommend accepting the paper with minor revisions to address the noted errors and suggestions for future work.
