This paper introduces a novel feature selection approach, CMICOT, which is an extension of filter methods with sequential forward selection (SFS) based on conditional mutual information (MI). The authors propose a saddle point (max-min) optimization problem to build a scoring function that can identify joint interactions between multiple features. The approach is technically sound, with non-trivial results, and the conclusions are well-supported by theory. The paper is well-written, clear, and easy to follow, with accessible math and adequate commentary to aid intuition and understanding.
The idea of analyzing an idealized execution of the EM algorithm using the true Q function is novel, and the authors provide adequate discussion of relevant literature to inform the reader about the state of the art. The results are significant and help understand the sensitivity of EM to initial parameters, although the models considered are restrictive and more like a proof of concept for the analysis technique.
The paper's strength lies in its solid analysis, but its weakness is the restrictive model used, which may not be applicable to real-world data. The authors' claim about their analysis providing understanding for other ascent algorithms is unclear and requires further justification beyond the EM framework.
The paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, originality, and significance. The authors provide a complete piece of work, with careful evaluation of both the strengths and weaknesses of the work. The paper is well-organized, and the writing is superb, providing enough information for the expert reader to reproduce the results.
The arguments for acceptance are:
* The paper introduces a novel feature selection approach that can identify high-order feature interactions.
* The approach is technically sound, with non-trivial results, and the conclusions are well-supported by theory.
* The paper is well-written, clear, and easy to follow, with accessible math and adequate commentary to aid intuition and understanding.
* The results are significant and help understand the sensitivity of EM to initial parameters.
The arguments against acceptance are:
* The models considered are restrictive and may not be applicable to real-world data.
* The authors' claim about their analysis providing understanding for other ascent algorithms is unclear and requires further justification beyond the EM framework.
Overall, I recommend accepting this paper, as it provides a significant contribution to the field of feature selection and machine learning, and the strengths outweigh the weaknesses.
