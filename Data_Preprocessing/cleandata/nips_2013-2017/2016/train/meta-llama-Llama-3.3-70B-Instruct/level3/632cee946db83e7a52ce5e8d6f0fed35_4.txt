This paper proposes a novel approach to dimensionality reduction for multi-class learning by leveraging a duality between Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and boosting, resulting in the development of the LADDER algorithm. The LADDER algorithm iteratively updates both the codewords and the transformation in an efficient manner to achieve dimensionality reduction.
The paper is well-written and easy to follow, making it accessible to readers. However, the experiment section is a major concern, as it lacks comparison with state-of-the-art methods such as SmartHash, FastHash, and ShECC, which the proposed method fails to beat. Furthermore, the proposed method underperforms in the scene understanding experiment, achieving only around 55% accuracy on the MIT indoor dataset compared to the state-of-the-art approach which achieved over 80% accuracy.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis. However, the lack of comparison with state-of-the-art methods and the underperformance in certain experiments raise concerns about the significance and impact of the work.
The clarity of the paper is excellent, with clear explanations and well-organized sections. The originality of the work is also notable, as it proposes a novel approach to dimensionality reduction by leveraging the duality between SVMs and boosting.
However, the significance of the work is questionable due to the lack of comparison with state-of-the-art methods and the underperformance in certain experiments. The results do not demonstrate a significant improvement over existing methods, which raises concerns about the practical impact of the work.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel approach to dimensionality reduction by leveraging the duality between SVMs and boosting.
* The LADDER algorithm is efficient and well-designed.
* The paper is well-written and easy to follow.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The experiment section lacks comparison with state-of-the-art methods.
* The proposed method underperforms in certain experiments.
* The results do not demonstrate a significant improvement over existing methods.
Overall, while the paper has some notable strengths, the lack of comparison with state-of-the-art methods and the underperformance in certain experiments raise significant concerns about the significance and impact of the work. Therefore, I would recommend rejection, but with the encouragement to revise and resubmit with additional experiments and comparisons to state-of-the-art methods.
