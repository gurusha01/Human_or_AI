This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the sample complexity of learning approximately optimal auctions from well-studied combinatorial auction classes. The authors utilize Rademacher complexities, Rademacher calculus, and combinatorial approaches like VC dimension to bound the Rademacher complexity of the revenue objective in combinatorial auctions. The results are technically interesting from both a learning theoretic and mechanism design perspective, introducing Rademacher complexity machinery to mechanism design and bounding complex function classes.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, related work, and their contributions. The technical sections are detailed and well-organized, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments. The use of Rademacher complexity and pseudo-dimension to derive sample complexity bounds is a significant contribution, as it provides a new tool for analyzing the sample complexity of complex function classes.
The paper's strengths include its technical soundness, clarity, and originality. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the sample complexity of various auction classes, including affine maximizer auctions, virtual valuation combinatorial auctions, and mixed bundling auctions. The results are significant, as they provide tight sample complexity bounds for these classes, which are commonly used in automated mechanism design.
The paper's weaknesses are minor. Some of the technical proofs are relegated to the supplementary materials, which may make it difficult for readers to follow the arguments without consulting the additional material. Additionally, the paper assumes a significant amount of background knowledge in mechanism design and learning theory, which may make it challenging for readers without this expertise to fully appreciate the contributions.
Overall, I believe that this paper is a strong contribution to the field of mechanism design and learning theory. The results are significant, and the technical analysis is thorough and well-presented. I would recommend accepting this paper for publication.
