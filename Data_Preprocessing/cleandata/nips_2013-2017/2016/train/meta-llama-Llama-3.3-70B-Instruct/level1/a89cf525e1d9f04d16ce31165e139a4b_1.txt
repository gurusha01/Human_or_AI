This paper proposes a novel extension to the Information Bottleneck (IB) method, a principled approach to extract relevant aspects of data. The IB method seeks to compress the input data while conserving information about a relevance variable. The authors introduce a variational approximation to the IB objective function, which allows for efficient optimization and application to high-dimensional and non-Gaussian data.
The paper builds upon previous work on the IB method, including the original formulation by Tishby and colleagues, and subsequent extensions to Gaussian data. The authors demonstrate that their variational IB algorithm can be used to recover sparse features that are relevant to the input data, and that it outperforms traditional sparse coding models in certain tasks.
The paper also introduces a kernelized version of the IB algorithm, which allows for non-linear relationships between the input data and the relevance variable. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on several tasks, including image denoising and occlusion.
The strengths of this paper include:
* The introduction of a novel variational approximation to the IB objective function, which allows for efficient optimization and application to high-dimensional and non-Gaussian data.
* The demonstration of the effectiveness of the variational IB algorithm on several tasks, including image denoising and occlusion.
* The introduction of a kernelized version of the IB algorithm, which allows for non-linear relationships between the input data and the relevance variable.
The weaknesses of this paper include:
* The paper assumes a certain level of familiarity with the IB method and its previous extensions, which may make it difficult for non-experts to follow.
* The paper could benefit from more detailed comparisons to other related methods, such as canonical correlation analysis and kernel ridge regression.
* The paper could also benefit from more detailed analysis of the computational complexity and scalability of the proposed algorithms.
