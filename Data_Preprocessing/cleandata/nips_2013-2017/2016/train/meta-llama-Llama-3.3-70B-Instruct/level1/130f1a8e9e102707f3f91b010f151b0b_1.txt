This paper proposes a novel multivariate online dictionary-learning method, dubbed Smooth Sparse Online Dictionary-Learning (Smooth-SODL), for decomposing brain images into structured and sparse components. The method extends the online dictionary-learning framework of Mairal et al. (2010) by incorporating a Sobolev (Laplacian) penalty to impose spatial structure on the dictionary atoms. The resulting decompositions are shown to properly delineate brain structures from functional images, outperforming state-of-the-art models in terms of interpretability and ability to capture inter-subject variability.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, related work, and their contributions. The proposed method is thoroughly described, and the experiments are well-designed and extensively evaluated. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the Smooth-SODL method in extracting structured and denoised dictionaries that better capture inter-subject variability in small, medium, and large-scale regimes.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel and effective method for online dictionary-learning with spatial structure, which addresses a significant limitation of existing methods.
* The thorough evaluation of the method through extensive experiments on a large public dataset, demonstrating its superiority over state-of-the-art models.
* The provision of a concise study of the impact of hyper-parameter selection on the problem, which is essential for practitioners.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The method's computational complexity, which, although relatively low, may still be a concern for very large datasets.
* The choice of hyper-parameters, which, although extensively studied, may still require careful tuning in practice.
* The lack of comparison with other methods that incorporate spatial structure, such as TV-`1 minimization, which may provide additional insights into the effectiveness of the proposed method.
