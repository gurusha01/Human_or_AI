This paper presents a comprehensive study on the exact recovery of communities in the stochastic block model (SBM) with a growing number of communities. The authors provide guarantees for exact recovery via a semidefinite program and upper and lower bounds on SBM parameters for exact recoverability. The results exploit the tradeoffs among the various parameters of heterogeneous SBM and provide recovery guarantees for many new interesting SBM configurations.
The paper is well-written, and the authors have done an excellent job in organizing the material and presenting the results. The introduction provides a clear overview of the problem and the related work, and the main results are presented in a concise and easy-to-follow manner. The authors have also provided several examples to illustrate the tradeoffs in heterogeneous SBM and the applicability of their results.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The authors provide a comprehensive study on the exact recovery of communities in SBM with a growing number of communities, which is a significant contribution to the field.
* The results are well-motivated and exploit the tradeoffs among the various parameters of heterogeneous SBM.
* The authors provide several examples to illustrate the tradeoffs in heterogeneous SBM and the applicability of their results.
* The paper is well-written, and the authors have done an excellent job in organizing the material and presenting the results.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes that the number of communities is growing with the number of nodes, which may not be the case in all real-world applications.
* The authors do not provide any experimental results to validate their theoretical findings.
* Some of the proofs and technical details are relegated to the appendix, which may make it difficult for some readers to follow the paper.
Overall, I would rate this paper as a strong accept. The paper presents a significant contribution to the field, and the results are well-motivated and well-presented. The authors have done an excellent job in organizing the material and presenting the results, and the paper is well-written.
