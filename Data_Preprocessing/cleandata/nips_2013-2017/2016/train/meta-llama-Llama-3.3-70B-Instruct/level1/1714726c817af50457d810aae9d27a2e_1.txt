This paper presents a study on accelerated descent dynamics for constrained convex optimization, focusing on a family of Accelerated Mirror Descent (AMD) dynamics with a generalized averaging scheme. The authors provide sufficient conditions on the weight functions to guarantee a desired convergence rate in continuous time and propose an adaptive averaging heuristic that preserves the convergence rate. The paper is well-structured, and the authors demonstrate a clear understanding of the topic.
The paper's main strengths are:
1. Technical soundness: The authors provide a rigorous analysis of the AMD dynamics, including a Lyapunov argument to establish the convergence rate.
2. Originality: The paper introduces a new adaptive averaging heuristic, which is a novel contribution to the field.
3. Clarity: The authors provide a clear and well-organized presentation of their results, making it easy to follow their arguments.
However, there are some areas for improvement:
1. Related work: While the authors mention some related work, a more comprehensive discussion of existing methods and their limitations would strengthen the paper.
2. Numerical experiments: Although the authors provide some numerical experiments, more extensive experiments on various problem instances and comparison with other state-of-the-art methods would be beneficial.
3. Theoretical analysis: While the authors provide some theoretical guarantees for their adaptive averaging heuristic, further analysis of its convergence properties and comparison with other methods would be valuable.
In terms of the NIPS review criteria, I would evaluate the paper as follows:
* Quality: 8/10 (the paper is technically sound, but could benefit from more comprehensive related work and numerical experiments)
* Clarity: 9/10 (the paper is well-organized and easy to follow)
* Originality: 8/10 (the paper introduces a new adaptive averaging heuristic, but builds upon existing work on AMD dynamics)
* Significance: 8/10 (the paper has the potential to contribute to the development of more efficient optimization algorithms, but its impact is not yet fully demonstrated)
Overall, I would recommend accepting the paper, but suggest that the authors address the areas for improvement mentioned above to strengthen their contribution.
