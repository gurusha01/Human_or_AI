This paper presents a novel method, Bounding Divergences with Reverse Annealing (BREAD), for evaluating the accuracy of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) based posterior inference algorithms. The method extends the bidirectional Monte Carlo (BDMC) technique to bound the symmetrized KL divergence between the true posterior distribution and the distribution of approximate samples. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of BREAD by integrating it into two probabilistic programming languages, WebPPL and Stan, and validating it on several models and datasets.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the background and motivation of the work. The technical contributions of the paper are significant, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of the method, including its strengths and limitations. The experiments are well-designed and demonstrate the effectiveness of BREAD in evaluating the accuracy of posterior inference algorithms.
The paper relates to previous work at NIPS and elsewhere, particularly in the area of probabilistic inference and MCMC methods. The authors cite relevant papers and provide a clear discussion of how their work builds upon and extends existing research.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The introduction of a novel method for evaluating the accuracy of MCMC based posterior inference algorithms
* The provision of a thorough analysis of the method, including its strengths and limitations
* The demonstration of the effectiveness of BREAD through well-designed experiments
