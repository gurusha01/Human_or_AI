This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of matrix completion, a fundamental problem in machine learning with numerous applications in collaborative filtering and recommender systems. The authors investigate the non-convex optimization algorithms for matrix completion and provide a thorough analysis of the geometric properties of the objective function.
The main idea of the paper is to show that the commonly used non-convex objective function for positive semidefinite matrix completion has no spurious local minima, meaning that all local minima are also global minima. This result is achieved by analyzing the first and second-order necessary conditions for optimality and demonstrating that any point that satisfies these conditions must be a desired solution.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, related work, and their main results. The technical sections are also well-organized, and the proofs are rigorous and easy to follow. The authors use a "simple" proof strategy, which is generalizable to other statistical problems involving partial or noisy observations.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The authors provide a novel analysis of the geometric properties of the matrix completion objective function, which sheds new light on the behavior of non-convex optimization algorithms.
* The results are significant, as they provide guarantees for many basic optimization algorithms, including stochastic gradient descent, which is widely used in practice.
* The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, related work, and their main results.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The analysis is limited to the symmetric case, and it is unclear whether the results can be extended to the asymmetric case.
* The authors assume that the observed entries are sampled uniformly at random, which may not be the case in practice.
* The paper does not provide experimental results to validate the theoretical findings.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper presents a significant contribution to the field of matrix completion, and the results have important implications for the design of optimization algorithms.
* The analysis is rigorous and well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, related work, and their main results.
* The paper has the potential to inspire new research directions in the field of matrix completion and non-convex optimization.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The analysis is limited to the symmetric case, and it is unclear whether the results can be extended to the asymmetric case.
* The authors assume that the observed entries are sampled uniformly at random, which may not be the case in practice.
* The paper does not provide experimental results to validate the theoretical findings.
Overall, I recommend accepting the paper, as it presents a significant contribution to the field of matrix completion, and the results have important implications for the design of optimization algorithms. However, the authors should be encouraged to address the limitations of their analysis and provide experimental results to validate their theoretical findings.
