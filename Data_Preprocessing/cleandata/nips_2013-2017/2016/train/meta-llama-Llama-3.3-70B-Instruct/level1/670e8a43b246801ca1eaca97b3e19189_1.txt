This paper introduces a new class of Bayesian models, called Kolchin partition (KP) models, which can exhibit the microclustering property. This property is essential for applications where the size of each cluster should be unrelated to the size of the data set, and each cluster should contain a negligible fraction of the total number of data points, such as entity resolution. The authors define the microclustering property and show that infinitely exchangeable clustering models, including finite mixture models, Dirichlet process mixture models, and Pitman-Yor process mixture models, do not exhibit this property.
The paper presents two specific KP models, the negative binomial-negative binomial (NBNB) model and the negative binomial-Dirichlet (NBD) model, and demonstrates their ability to exhibit the microclustering property. The authors also propose a new Gibbs sampling algorithm, called the chaperones algorithm, which is particularly well-suited for microclustering.
The paper evaluates the performance of the NBNB and NBD models on four entity-resolution data sets, comparing them to two infinitely exchangeable clustering models, the Dirichlet process mixture model and the Pitman-Yor process mixture model. The results show that the NBNB and NBD models outperform the infinitely exchangeable models on most data sets, especially when the data is noisy.
The strengths of this paper include:
* The introduction of a new class of Bayesian models that can exhibit the microclustering property, which is essential for certain applications.
* The development of a new Gibbs sampling algorithm, the chaperones algorithm, which is well-suited for microclustering.
* The evaluation of the performance of the proposed models on real-world data sets, demonstrating their effectiveness.
The weaknesses of this paper include:
* The paper assumes that the reader is familiar with Bayesian nonparametrics and clustering models, which may limit its accessibility to a broader audience.
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison to other existing models that exhibit the microclustering property.
* The results on the Syria2000 and SyriaSizes data sets are inconclusive, and the authors acknowledge that these data sets are extremely noisy and challenging.
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The paper introduces a new class of Bayesian models that can exhibit the microclustering property, which is a significant contribution to the field.
* The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed models on real-world data sets.
* The paper is well-written and clearly organized, making it easy to follow.
Arguments con acceptance:
* The paper assumes a high level of background knowledge in Bayesian nonparametrics and clustering models.
* The results on some data sets are inconclusive, which may limit the paper's impact.
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison to other existing models that exhibit the microclustering property.
Overall, I recommend accepting this paper, as it makes a significant contribution to the field of Bayesian nonparametrics and clustering models, and demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed models on real-world data sets. However, I suggest that the authors address the weaknesses mentioned above to improve the paper's accessibility and impact.
