This paper presents a novel approach to estimating a model's test error from unlabeled data, leveraging conditional independence structure and making no parametric assumptions about the true distribution. The authors' method, based on the method of moments, allows for the estimation of the risk without explicit estimation of the loss distribution. The paper is well-structured, and the authors provide a clear overview of their approach, including examples and extensions to more complex model structures.
The paper's main contribution is the development of a framework for unsupervised risk estimation, which can be applied to a large family of losses, including the log and exponential losses, and extends to structured output settings such as conditional random fields. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through experiments on a modified MNIST dataset, showing that their algorithm can estimate the risk and perform unsupervised domain adaptation, even with limited labeled data from the source domain.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The authors' approach is novel and well-motivated, addressing a significant problem in machine learning.
* The paper is well-written, with clear explanations and examples.
* The authors provide a thorough analysis of their approach, including theoretical guarantees and experimental evaluations.
* The paper has significant implications for domain adaptation and semi-supervised learning, as it provides a way to estimate the risk without labeled data.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The three-view assumption, which is restrictive and may not hold in all cases.
* The paper assumes that the views are independent, which may not be realistic in all scenarios.
* The authors do not provide a clear comparison to existing methods, which would be helpful in understanding the strengths and limitations of their approach.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper presents a novel and well-motivated approach to unsupervised risk estimation.
* The authors provide a thorough analysis of their approach, including theoretical guarantees and experimental evaluations.
* The paper has significant implications for domain adaptation and semi-supervised learning.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The three-view assumption is restrictive and may not hold in all cases.
* The paper assumes that the views are independent, which may not be realistic in all scenarios.
* The authors do not provide a clear comparison to existing methods.
Overall, I believe that the paper is well-written and presents a significant contribution to the field of machine learning. While there are some limitations to the approach, the authors provide a thorough analysis and demonstrate the effectiveness of their method through experiments. I recommend acceptance, with the suggestion that the authors provide a clearer comparison to existing methods and discuss the limitations of their approach in more detail.
