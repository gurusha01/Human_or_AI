This paper proposes a novel extension of the encoder-decoder framework, called the review network, which enhances the existing encoder-decoder model by performing multiple review steps with attention on the encoder hidden states. The review network outputs a set of thought vectors that capture global properties of the input, which are then used as input to the attention mechanism in the decoder. The authors demonstrate that conventional encoder-decoders are a special case of their framework and show that their model improves over state-of-the-art encoder-decoder systems on image captioning and source code captioning tasks.
The paper is well-written and clearly explains the motivation, architecture, and experimental results of the review network. The authors provide a thorough review of related work, including attentive encoder-decoders and memory networks, and highlight the differences between their approach and existing methods. The experimental results are impressive, with the review network achieving state-of-the-art performance on the MSCOCO image captioning benchmark and outperforming baseline models on the source code captioning task.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The review network is a novel and interesting architecture that addresses the limitations of conventional encoder-decoders.
* The authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the model and its components.
* The experimental results are thorough and demonstrate the effectiveness of the review network on multiple tasks.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper could benefit from more analysis of the thought vectors and how they capture global properties of the input.
* The authors could provide more discussion on the computational cost and efficiency of the review network compared to existing methods.
* Some of the experimental results, such as the ablation study, could be more detailed and comprehensive.
Overall, the paper is well-written and presents a significant contribution to the field of natural language processing and computer vision. The review network has the potential to be applied to a wide range of tasks and could lead to further research and improvements in the field.
