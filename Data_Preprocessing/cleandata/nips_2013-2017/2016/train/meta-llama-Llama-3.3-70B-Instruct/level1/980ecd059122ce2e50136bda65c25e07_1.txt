This paper proposes a novel approach to measuring the robustness of neural networks by formulating the notion of pointwise robustness as a constraint system. The authors introduce two statistics, adversarial frequency and adversarial severity, to quantify the robustness of a neural network. They also develop an algorithm, called ALP, to approximate the pointwise robustness of a neural network, which is shown to be more accurate than existing algorithms.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their approach. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in estimating the robustness of neural networks, and the results show that the algorithm can be used to improve the robustness of neural networks.
