This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of computational economics, specifically in the design of revenue-maximizing combinatorial auctions. The authors provide the first sample complexity analysis for the standard hierarchy of deterministic combinatorial auction classes used in automated mechanism design. The paper is well-written, and the authors demonstrate a deep understanding of the underlying concepts and techniques.
The main strength of the paper is its ability to provide tight sample complexity bounds for various auction classes, including Affine Maximizer Auctions (AMAs), Virtual Valuation Combinatorial Auctions (VVCAs), Î»-auctions, Mixed Bundling Auctions (MBAs), and Mixed Bundling Auctions with Reserve Prices (MBARPs). The authors use Rademacher complexity and pseudo-dimension to derive these bounds, which is a significant technical achievement.
The paper also has several weaknesses. One of the main limitations is that the sample complexity bounds are often quite large, which may limit their practical applicability. Additionally, the paper assumes that the bidders' valuations are drawn from an underlying distribution, which may not always be the case in practice. Furthermore, the paper focuses on deterministic auctions, which may not be the most realistic or practical setting.
The paper is well-organized, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem and the relevant background material. The technical sections are also well-written, although some of the proofs and derivations may be challenging for non-experts to follow.
In terms of originality, the paper presents several new results and techniques, including the use of Rademacher complexity and pseudo-dimension to analyze the sample complexity of auction classes. The paper also provides a comprehensive overview of the existing literature on the topic, which is helpful for understanding the context and significance of the results.
The significance of the paper lies in its ability to provide a foundation for the design of high-revenue combinatorial auctions. The results and techniques presented in the paper can be used to inform the development of automated mechanism design algorithms, which have the potential to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of auctions in a wide range of applications.
