This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of optimization, specifically in the context of saddle-point problems, which are common in machine learning. The authors extend recent stochastic variance reduction methods, such as SVRG and SAGA, to provide the first large-scale linearly convergent algorithms for this class of problems.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, including the motivation and related work. The technical contributions are substantial, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of the algorithms, including convergence rates and computational complexities.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The authors provide a novel extension of SVRG and SAGA to saddle-point problems, which is a significant contribution to the field.
* The analysis is thorough and provides a clear understanding of the convergence rates and computational complexities of the algorithms.
* The authors provide a detailed comparison with existing batch and stochastic algorithms, demonstrating the superiority of their approach.
* The experimental results are convincing and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in practice.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes knowledge of strong convexity-concavity constants, which may not always be available in practice. The authors mention that they plan to explore adaptivity to these constants in future work.
* The paper focuses primarily on bilinear saddle-point problems, and it is not clear how the results generalize to more general saddle-point problems.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the technical contributions are significant. The authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, and the analysis is thorough and well-presented. The experimental results are convincing, and the paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in practice.
