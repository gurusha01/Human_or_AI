This paper proposes a modification to the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) algorithm, a popular derivative-free optimization method. The authors introduce the Cholesky-CMA-ES, which replaces the traditional matrix square root update with a triangular Cholesky factorization, reducing the time complexity from O(d^3) to O(μd^2), where μ is typically O(log(d)). This modification is theoretically justified and empirically verified to not impair the algorithm's performance.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the CMA-ES algorithm and its limitations. The proposed modification is thoroughly explained, and the theoretical justification is sound. The empirical evaluation is extensive, comparing the Cholesky-CMA-ES to other CMA-ES variants on various benchmark functions.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposed modification is novel and addresses a significant limitation of the traditional CMA-ES algorithm.
* The theoretical justification is rigorous and well-explained.
* The empirical evaluation is comprehensive and demonstrates the effectiveness of the Cholesky-CMA-ES.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes a significant amount of background knowledge in optimization and linear algebra, which may make it difficult for non-experts to follow.
* Some of the notation and terminology may be unfamiliar to readers without a strong background in optimization.
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the potential limitations and drawbacks of the proposed modification.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel and significant modification to a widely used optimization algorithm.
* The theoretical justification is sound, and the empirical evaluation is comprehensive.
* The paper has the potential to impact the field of optimization and machine learning.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The paper may be too specialized for a general audience, and the notation and terminology may be unfamiliar to non-experts.
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the potential limitations and drawbacks of the proposed modification.
Overall, I recommend accepting the paper, as it proposes a significant and novel modification to a widely used optimization algorithm, and the theoretical justification and empirical evaluation are sound. However, I suggest that the authors consider revising the paper to make it more accessible to a broader audience and to provide a more detailed discussion of the potential limitations and drawbacks of the proposed modification.
