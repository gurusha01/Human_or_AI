This paper presents a novel Monte-Carlo planning algorithm called TrailBlazer for Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with a generative model. The algorithm is designed to be sample-efficient and exploits the structure of the MDP by exploring only a subset of near-optimal states. The paper provides a thorough analysis of the algorithm's sample complexity, including bounds for both finite and infinite numbers of next states.
The main strengths of the paper are:
1. Improved sample complexity bounds: TrailBlazer's sample complexity bounds are better than previous worst-case guarantees, particularly in the case of finite next states.
2. Problem-dependent guarantees: The algorithm's sample complexity is expressed in terms of problem-dependent measures (Îº and d), which take into account the structure of the MDP.
3. Efficient implementation: TrailBlazer is easy to implement and numerically efficient, making it a practical solution for MDP planning.
4. Theoretical foundations: The paper provides a solid theoretical foundation for the algorithm, including a PAC consistency result and sample complexity analyses.
However, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement:
1. Complexity of the analysis: The paper's analysis is quite complex and may be challenging for some readers to follow.
2. Limited empirical evaluation: While the paper provides some theoretical results, it would be beneficial to include empirical evaluations to demonstrate the algorithm's performance in practice.
3. Comparison to other algorithms: A more detailed comparison to other MDP planning algorithms, such as UCT and StOP, would help to better understand TrailBlazer's strengths and weaknesses.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper presents a novel and efficient algorithm for MDP planning with a generative model.
* The analysis provides improved sample complexity bounds and problem-dependent guarantees.
* The algorithm is easy to implement and numerically efficient.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The analysis is complex and may be challenging for some readers to follow.
* The paper lacks empirical evaluations to demonstrate the algorithm's performance in practice.
* The comparison to other algorithms is limited, making it difficult to fully understand TrailBlazer's strengths and weaknesses.
Overall, I recommend accepting the paper, as it presents a significant contribution to the field of MDP planning with a generative model. However, I suggest that the authors consider addressing the weaknesses mentioned above, particularly by including empirical evaluations and a more detailed comparison to other algorithms.
