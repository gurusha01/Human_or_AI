This paper proposes a novel approach to domain adaptation in deep neural networks, which enables the joint learning of adaptive classifiers and transferable features from labeled data in the source domain and unlabeled data in the target domain. The approach relaxes the shared-classifier assumption made by previous methods and assumes that the source classifier and target classifier differ by a residual function. The authors propose a Residual Transfer Network (RTN) that can learn the residual function and adapt the classifier to the target domain.
The paper is well-written and clearly explains the motivation, methodology, and experimental results. The authors provide a thorough review of related work and highlight the differences between their approach and previous methods. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, which outperforms state-of-the-art methods on standard domain adaptation benchmarks.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel approach to domain adaptation that relaxes the shared-classifier assumption and enables the joint learning of adaptive classifiers and transferable features.
* The use of a residual transfer module to bridge the source classifier and target classifier, which is a key innovation of the paper.
* The thorough experimental evaluation, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach on multiple benchmarks.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The assumption that the residual function is small, which may not always be the case in practice.
* The requirement for a large amount of labeled data in the source domain, which may not be available in all scenarios.
* The lack of a clear explanation of how the hyperparameters are selected, which could be important for reproducing the results.
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of domain adaptation and provides a novel approach that can be used in a variety of applications. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, and the paper provides a thorough review of related work.
