This paper proposes a novel approach to likelihood-free inference based on Bayesian conditional density estimation. The authors introduce a parametric method that learns a flexible representation of the posterior distribution, allowing for efficient and accurate inference in simulator-based models. The key idea is to use a neural density estimator to learn the posterior distribution, which is then used to guide future simulations and improve the accuracy of the inference.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem of likelihood-free inference and the limitations of existing methods. The proposed approach is thoroughly explained, and the authors provide a detailed description of the algorithm and its components. The paper also includes a comprehensive review of related work, highlighting the advantages and limitations of existing methods.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposed approach is novel and addresses the limitations of existing methods, such as the need for a large number of simulations and the difficulty of representing complex posterior distributions.
* The authors provide a thorough evaluation of the method, including experiments on several benchmark problems and comparisons with existing methods.
* The paper is well-organized, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the proposed approach and its components.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The proposed approach requires a significant amount of computational resources, particularly for large-scale problems.
* The authors assume that the simulator-based model is available, which may not always be the case in practice.
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the theoretical properties of the proposed approach, such as its consistency and convergence rates.
