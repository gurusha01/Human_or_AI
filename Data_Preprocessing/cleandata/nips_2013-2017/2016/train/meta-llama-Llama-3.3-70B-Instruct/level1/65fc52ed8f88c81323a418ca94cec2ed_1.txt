This paper proposes a novel approach for unsupervised learning of visual similarities between large numbers of exemplars using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The authors address the limitations of existing methods, which require large amounts of labeled data or suffer from imbalanced positive and negative samples. The proposed method, called CliqueCNN, overcomes these issues by formulating an optimization problem that selects batches of compact, mutually dissimilar cliques of samples. This allows for the learning of exemplar similarities as a categorization task on individual batches, without requiring labels.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise overview of the proposed approach. The experimental evaluation is thorough, with results on three different datasets (Olympic Sports, Leeds Sports, and PASCAL VOC 2007) demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the results, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of the approach.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposed method is novel and addresses a significant limitation of existing approaches for unsupervised learning of visual similarities.
* The experimental evaluation is comprehensive, with results on multiple datasets and comparisons to state-of-the-art methods.
* The authors provide a clear and concise overview of the proposed approach, making it easy to understand and implement.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The optimization problem formulated in the paper is NP-hard, which may limit the scalability of the approach to large datasets.
* The authors do not provide a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed method, which may be a concern for large-scale applications.
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the limitations of the approach and potential avenues for future research.
Overall, I believe that the paper is well-written, and the proposed approach is novel and effective. The experimental evaluation is thorough, and the results demonstrate the potential of the approach for unsupervised learning of visual similarities.
