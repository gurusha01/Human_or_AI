This paper proposes a novel approach to training unitary recurrent neural networks (uRNNs) by optimizing the recurrence matrix over all unitary matrices, leading to significantly improved performance over uRNNs that use a restricted-capacity recurrence matrix. The authors provide a theoretical argument to determine if a unitary parameterization has restricted capacity and show that a recently proposed unitary parameterization has restricted capacity for hidden state dimension greater than 7. They also propose a method for stochastic gradient descent for training the unitary recurrence matrix, which constrains the gradient to lie on the differentiable manifold of unitary matrices.
The paper is well-written and clearly organized, with a good balance between theoretical and experimental contributions. The authors provide a thorough review of previous work on uRNNs and related techniques, and their theoretical argument is well-supported by mathematical derivations. The experimental results are also impressive, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach on a range of tasks, including synthetic and natural data.
The strengths of the paper include:
* A clear and well-motivated theoretical argument for the limitations of restricted-capacity unitary parameterizations
* A novel and effective method for optimizing full-capacity unitary matrices
* Impressive experimental results demonstrating the superiority of the proposed approach over previous methods
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes a significant amount of background knowledge in recurrent neural networks and unitary matrices, which may make it difficult for non-experts to follow
* Some of the mathematical derivations are quite technical and may require careful reading to understand
* The paper could benefit from more discussion of the potential limitations and challenges of the proposed approach, as well as potential avenues for future work
Overall, I would argue in favor of accepting this paper, as it makes a significant contribution to the field of recurrent neural networks and unitary matrices. The paper is well-written, well-organized, and provides a clear and well-motivated theoretical argument, as well as impressive experimental results.
