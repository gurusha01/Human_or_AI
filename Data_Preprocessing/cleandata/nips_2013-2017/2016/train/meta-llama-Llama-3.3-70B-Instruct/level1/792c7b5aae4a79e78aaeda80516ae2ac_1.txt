This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm for estimating parameters of statistical models, specifically in the context of Gaussian mixture models. The authors address the disconnect between the statistical principles behind EM and its algorithmic properties, providing a global analysis of EM for specific models where the observations comprise an i.i.d. sample from a mixture of two Gaussians.
The paper's main contributions include a new characterization of the stationary points and dynamics of EM in two simple yet popular Gaussian mixture models. The authors prove convergence for the sequence of iterates for Population EM, which is an idealized execution of EM in the large sample limit, and establish statistical consistency for the actual sequence of parameters produced by EM.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of their results, including proofs and theoretical analysis. The authors also discuss the implications of their results, including the fact that EM can compute statistically consistent parameter estimates without the need for specific initialization methods.
The strengths of the paper include:
* A thorough analysis of the EM algorithm for Gaussian mixture models, providing new insights into its behavior and properties.
* A clear and detailed explanation of the results, including proofs and theoretical analysis.
* Implications of the results are well-discussed, including the potential for EM to compute statistically consistent parameter estimates without specific initialization methods.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The analysis is limited to Gaussian mixture models, and it is unclear how the results generalize to other latent variable models.
* The paper assumes a large sample limit, which may not accurately characterize the behavior of EM in real-world scenarios.
* Some of the proofs and theoretical analysis may be challenging to follow for readers without a strong background in statistical theory and machine learning.
Overall, the paper is well-written and provides a significant contribution to the understanding of the EM algorithm for Gaussian mixture models. The results have important implications for the use of EM in practice, and the paper is a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the field.

Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication, as it provides a significant contribution to the understanding of the EM algorithm for Gaussian mixture models and has important implications for practice. However, the authors should consider addressing the limitations of their analysis and providing more context for readers without a strong background in statistical theory and machine learning.
