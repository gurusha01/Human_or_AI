This paper proposes a novel approach to exploration in non-tabular reinforcement learning by introducing the concept of pseudo-counts, which generalize visit counts to non-tabular settings. The authors draw inspiration from intrinsic motivation literature and use density models to measure uncertainty. They derive a pseudo-count from an arbitrary density model and show that it connects information-gain-as-learning-progress and count-based exploration.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem of exploration in non-tabular reinforcement learning. They also provide a thorough review of related work, including intrinsic motivation and count-based exploration methods. The technical contributions of the paper are sound, and the authors provide a detailed analysis of the properties of pseudo-counts.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The introduction of a novel concept, pseudo-counts, which generalizes visit counts to non-tabular settings.
* A thorough analysis of the properties of pseudo-counts, including their relationship to information gain and count-based exploration.
* The application of pseudo-counts to Atari 2600 games, which demonstrates their effectiveness in improving exploration.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The assumption that the density model is learning-positive, which may not always be the case in practice.
* The lack of a clear understanding of how the choice of density model affects the pseudo-counts and the exploration behavior.
* The limited evaluation of the method, which only includes a few Atari 2600 games.
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The paper introduces a novel concept that has the potential to improve exploration in non-tabular reinforcement learning.
* The technical contributions of the paper are sound, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of the properties of pseudo-counts.
* The application of pseudo-counts to Atari 2600 games demonstrates their effectiveness in improving exploration.
Arguments con acceptance:
* The assumption that the density model is learning-positive may not always be the case in practice, which could limit the applicability of the method.
* The lack of a clear understanding of how the choice of density model affects the pseudo-counts and the exploration behavior could make it difficult to apply the method in practice.
* The limited evaluation of the method may not be sufficient to demonstrate its effectiveness in a wide range of scenarios.
Overall, I believe that the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of reinforcement learning and exploration. The introduction of pseudo-counts and their analysis provides a new perspective on the problem of exploration, and the application of pseudo-counts to Atari 2600 games demonstrates their potential effectiveness. However, further work is needed to fully understand the properties of pseudo-counts and to evaluate their effectiveness in a wider range of scenarios.
