This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of contextual semibandits, a variant of bandit learning where the learner receives partial feedback in the form of a scalar value for each individual item in a list. The authors develop two oracle-based algorithms, VCEE and EELS, for the cases where the linear function relating the semibandit feedback to the reward is known and unknown, respectively.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, related work, and their contributions. The technical sections are also well-organized, and the proofs are thorough and easy to follow. The experimental evaluation is comprehensive, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The development of two efficient algorithms for contextual semibandits, which achieve state-of-the-art regret bounds in both cases.
* The provision of a thorough theoretical analysis, including regret bounds and proofs.
* The comprehensive experimental evaluation, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms on real-world datasets.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The assumption of a linear relationship between the semibandit feedback and the reward, which may not always hold in practice.
* The requirement of a supervised learning oracle, which may not be available in all cases.
* The lack of exploration of other potential applications of the proposed algorithms, such as in recommendation systems or personalized medicine.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper presents a significant contribution to the field of contextual semibandits, with two efficient algorithms that achieve state-of-the-art regret bounds.
* The theoretical analysis is thorough and well-supported by proofs.
* The experimental evaluation is comprehensive and demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The assumption of a linear relationship between the semibandit feedback and the reward may not always hold in practice.
* The requirement of a supervised learning oracle may limit the applicability of the proposed algorithms.
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of potential applications and future directions.
Overall, I recommend accepting the paper, as it presents a significant contribution to the field of contextual semibandits, with a thorough theoretical analysis and comprehensive experimental evaluation. However, the authors should consider addressing the potential limitations and exploring other potential applications of the proposed algorithms in future work.
