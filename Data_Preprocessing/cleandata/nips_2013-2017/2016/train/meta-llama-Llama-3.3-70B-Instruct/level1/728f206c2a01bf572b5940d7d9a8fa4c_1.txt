This paper proposes a novel approach for training Boltzmann machines using the Wasserstein distance, which takes into account the metric between observations. The authors derive a gradient of the Wasserstein distance with respect to the model parameters and demonstrate its practical potential on data completion and denoising tasks. The paper is well-written, and the ideas are clearly presented.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a new objective function for Boltzmann machines that incorporates the metric between observations, which is a significant departure from the traditional Kullback-Leibler divergence.
* The derivation of the gradient of the Wasserstein distance with respect to the model parameters, which is a crucial step in making the approach practical.
* The demonstration of the approach on real-world datasets, including MNIST and UCI PLANTS, which shows the potential of the method in practice.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The reliance on the Sinkhorn algorithm for computing the Wasserstein distance, which may not be efficient for large datasets.
* The need for careful tuning of hyperparameters, such as the smoothing parameter γ and the regularization coefficients λ and η.
* The lack of a clear understanding of the relationship between the Wasserstein distance and the Kullback-Leibler divergence, which may make it difficult to choose between the two objectives in practice.
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel and interesting approach to training Boltzmann machines that takes into account the metric between observations.
