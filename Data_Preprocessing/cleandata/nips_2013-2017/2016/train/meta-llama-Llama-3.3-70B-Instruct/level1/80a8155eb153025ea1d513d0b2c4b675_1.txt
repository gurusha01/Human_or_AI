This paper presents a theoretical analysis of the robustness and consistency properties of a variant of the classical quadratic k-means algorithm, called robust k-means (RKM). The authors provide a detailed description of the optimality conditions for the associated minimization problem and show that RKM shares the computational simplicity of quadratic k-means, making it a "computationally cheap" candidate for robust nearest neighbor clustering.
The paper is well-structured and easy to follow, with a clear introduction to the problem and a thorough analysis of the robustness and consistency properties of RKM. The authors use a variety of technical tools from variational analysis and provide a number of useful lemmas and corollaries to support their results.
One of the main strengths of the paper is its thorough analysis of the breakdown properties of RKM. The authors show that two outliers in a dataset are enough to breakdown some centers, but that RKM can recover the underlying cluster structure in spite of the outliers if the dataset is "well-structured". They also provide a detailed description of the conditions under which RKM is robust and show that the algorithm exhibits some desirable noise robustness properties.
The paper also provides a thorough analysis of the consistency properties of RKM. The authors show that most general results for consistency of quadratic k-means still remain valid for this robust variant, and provide a sketch proof of the consistency of RKM.
The experiments presented in the paper are also well-designed and provide a useful comparison between RKM and trimmed k-means (TKM). The results show that both algorithms perform similarly in practice, and that RKM is able to recover the underlying cluster structure in spite of the outliers.
Overall, I would rate this paper as excellent. The authors provide a thorough and well-structured analysis of the robustness and consistency properties of RKM, and the paper is well-written and easy to follow. The results are interesting and provide a useful contribution to the field of robust clustering.
