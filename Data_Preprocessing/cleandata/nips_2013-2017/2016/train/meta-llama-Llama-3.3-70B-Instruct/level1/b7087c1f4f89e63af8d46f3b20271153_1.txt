This paper presents a novel approach to dimensionality reduction for large-scale sparse matrices using coresets, which are weighted subsets of the input data. The authors propose a deterministic algorithm for computing a coreset of size independent of both the number of rows and columns in the input matrix, with provable guarantees on the approximation error. This is a significant improvement over existing methods, which often rely on randomization or have poor performance for large, sparse matrices.
The paper is well-structured and clearly written, with a thorough introduction to the problem and related work. The technical contributions are substantial, with two main theorems establishing the existence and efficiency of the coreset construction. The proofs are detailed and well-explained, with a clear exposition of the key ideas and techniques.
The experimental evaluation is also thorough, with a comparison to existing methods on synthetic and real-world data. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm, particularly for large-scale sparse matrices like the Wikipedia document-term matrix.
Strengths:
* The paper presents a significant theoretical contribution, with a novel approach to dimensionality reduction using coresets.
* The algorithm is deterministic, which is a major advantage over randomized methods.
