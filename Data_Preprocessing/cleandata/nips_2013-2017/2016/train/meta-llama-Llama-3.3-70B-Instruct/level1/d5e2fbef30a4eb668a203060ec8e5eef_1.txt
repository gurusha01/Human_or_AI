This paper introduces a novel feature selection approach, CMICOT, which is an evolution of filter methods with sequential forward selection (SFS) based on conditional mutual information (MI). The authors propose a saddle point (max-min) optimization problem to build a scoring function that identifies joint interactions between multiple features, addressing the limitation of existing MI-based SFS techniques that can only account for low-order dependencies.
The paper relates to previous work at NIPS and elsewhere, particularly in the area of feature selection and mutual information-based methods. The authors discuss the strengths and weaknesses of their approach, highlighting its ability to identify high-order feature interactions and its computational efficiency. They also compare their method with existing interaction-aware filters, such as RelaxMRMR, IWFS, and RCDFS, and state-of-the-art filters like CMIM, JMI, and CBFS.
The paper's strengths include its novel approach to feature selection, its ability to handle high-order dependencies, and its empirical validation on multiple datasets and classification models. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of their method's computational complexity and its advantages over existing approaches.
However, the paper could be improved by providing more insight into the choice of the team size parameter t and its impact on the method's performance. Additionally, the authors could further discuss the limitations of their approach and potential avenues for future research.
