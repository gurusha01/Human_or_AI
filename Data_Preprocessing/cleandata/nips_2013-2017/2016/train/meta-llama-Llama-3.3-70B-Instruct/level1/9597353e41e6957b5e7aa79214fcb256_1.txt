This paper proposes a framework for Semi-Supervised Active Clustering (SSAC) where the learner interacts with a domain expert through same-cluster queries to improve clustering performance. The authors study the query and computational complexity of clustering in this framework and provide a probabilistic polynomial-time algorithm for clustering with queries that succeeds under certain conditions. The paper also proves a lower bound on the number of queries needed to make NP-hard problems feasible.
The main contributions of this paper are the introduction of the SSAC framework and the demonstration that access to a limited number of query answers can turn an otherwise NP-hard clustering problem into a feasible one. The authors also introduce a novel notion of clusterability, called the Î³-margin property, which is related to previous notions of center proximity.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of their framework, algorithms, and proofs. The results are significant, and the paper provides a thorough analysis of the computational and query complexity of SSAC problems.
Strengths:
* The paper introduces a new framework for semi-supervised active clustering that combines the benefits of interactive clustering with the advantages of weak supervision.
* The authors provide a probabilistic polynomial-time algorithm for clustering with queries that succeeds under certain conditions, which is a significant contribution to the field.
* The paper proves a lower bound on the number of queries needed to make NP-hard problems feasible, which provides a theoretical foundation for the SSAC framework.
Weaknesses:
* The paper assumes that the oracle conforms to a center-based clustering with a notion of margin, which may not always be the case in practice.
* The algorithm requires a significant number of queries to achieve good performance, which may be impractical in some scenarios.
* The paper does not provide experimental results to validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and algorithm.
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The paper introduces a new and significant framework for semi-supervised active clustering that has the potential to improve clustering performance in practice.
* The authors provide a thorough analysis of the computational and query complexity of SSAC problems, which is a significant contribution to the field.
* The paper proves a lower bound on the number of queries needed to make NP-hard problems feasible, which provides a theoretical foundation for the SSAC framework.
Arguments con acceptance:
* The paper assumes a specific type of clustering and oracle behavior, which may not always be the case in practice.
* The algorithm requires a significant number of queries, which may be impractical in some scenarios.
* The paper does not provide experimental results to validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and algorithm.
Overall, I recommend accepting this paper because it introduces a new and significant framework for semi-supervised active clustering, provides a thorough analysis of the computational and query complexity of SSAC problems, and proves a lower bound on the number of queries needed to make NP-hard problems feasible. However, I suggest that the authors provide experimental results to validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and algorithm in future work.
