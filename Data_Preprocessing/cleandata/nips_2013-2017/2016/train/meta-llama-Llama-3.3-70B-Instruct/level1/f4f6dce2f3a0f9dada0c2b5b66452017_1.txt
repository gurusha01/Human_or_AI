This paper presents a novel approach to speeding up the computation of low-rank tensor CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decompositions using randomization techniques. The authors propose a sparse alternating least squares (SPALS) method that samples intermediate steps of alternating minimization algorithms, leading to significant speedups over existing randomized and deterministic routines.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem of tensor CP decomposition and the challenges associated with it. They also provide a thorough review of related work in the field, highlighting the limitations of existing approaches and the advantages of their proposed method.
The technical contributions of the paper are significant, and the authors provide a detailed analysis of the SPALS algorithm, including its theoretical guarantees and empirical evaluations. The algorithm is shown to be efficient and effective in practice, with notable speedups over previous CP decomposition routines on both dense and sparse data.
The paper also provides a clear and detailed explanation of the mathematical concepts and techniques used in the algorithm, including the Khatri-Rao product, statistical leverage scores, and importance sampling. The authors demonstrate a deep understanding of the underlying mathematics and provide a thorough analysis of the algorithm's properties and behavior.
The experimental results presented in the paper are impressive, with the SPALS algorithm showing significant speedups over existing approaches on both synthetic and real-world data. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the results, highlighting the advantages and limitations of their approach.
Overall, this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of tensor decomposition and randomized numerical linear algebra. The proposed SPALS algorithm is efficient, effective, and scalable, making it a valuable tool for a wide range of applications.
