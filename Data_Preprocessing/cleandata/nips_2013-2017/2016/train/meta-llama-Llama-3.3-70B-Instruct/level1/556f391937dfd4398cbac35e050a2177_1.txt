This paper proposes a novel approach to learning deep feature embeddings, called Position-Dependent Deep Metric (PDDM), which adapts to the local feature structure in a heterogeneous space. The authors argue that the traditional Euclidean distance metric is suboptimal for hard sample mining, especially in complex visual feature spaces. The PDDM unit is designed to learn a similarity metric that is adaptive to the local feature structure, and is used to select high-quality hard samples in a local neighborhood to guide the deep embedding learning.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear motivation for their approach, as well as a thorough review of related work. The technical contributions of the paper are significant, and the authors provide a detailed description of their method, including the PDDM unit and the double-header hinge loss function. The experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach in challenging image retrieval tasks, as well as its potential for generalizing to new classes in large and open set scenarios such as transfer learning and zero-shot learning.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel approach to learning deep feature embeddings that adapts to the local feature structure in a heterogeneous space.
* The design of a PDDM unit that learns a similarity metric that is adaptive to the local feature structure.
* The use of a double-header hinge loss function that optimizes the similarity metric and feature embedding under the large margin criterion.
* The demonstration of the efficacy of the proposed approach in challenging image retrieval tasks and its potential for generalizing to new classes in large and open set scenarios.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The complexity of the proposed approach, which may make it difficult to implement and optimize in practice.
* The requirement for a large amount of labeled data to train the PDDM unit and the feature embedding.
* The lack of comparison with other state-of-the-art methods in the experiments.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear motivation for their approach, as well as a thorough review of related work. The technical contributions of the paper are significant, and the experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach. However, the complexity of the proposed approach and the requirement for a large amount of labeled data may limit its applicability in practice.
