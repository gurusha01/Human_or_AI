This paper proposes a novel batch Bayesian optimization algorithm, the parallel knowledge gradient method (q-KG), which is designed to optimize expensive-to-evaluate functions in parallel. The algorithm is derived from a decision-theoretical perspective and is shown to be Bayes-optimal for minimizing the minimum of the predictor of the Gaussian process if only one decision is remaining.
The paper relates to previous work on Bayesian optimization, including the knowledge gradient method, which is a sequential Bayesian optimization algorithm. The authors generalize this method to the parallel setting, where multiple points can be evaluated simultaneously. The q-KG algorithm is compared to other parallel Bayesian optimization algorithms, including parallel expected improvement (EI) and parallel upper confidence bound (UCB), and is shown to outperform them on several synthetic functions and in tuning practical machine learning algorithms.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel batch Bayesian optimization algorithm that is derived from a decision-theoretical perspective
* The development of a computational method to implement the algorithm efficiently
* The comparison of the algorithm to other state-of-the-art parallel Bayesian optimization algorithms
* The demonstration of the algorithm's performance on several synthetic functions and in tuning practical machine learning algorithms
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The computational complexity of the algorithm, which may be high for large batch sizes or high-dimensional problems
* The requirement for a Gaussian process prior, which may not be suitable for all problems
* The lack of theoretical guarantees for the algorithm's performance, beyond the Bayes-optimality result for a single decision
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel and well-motivated algorithm that addresses an important problem in Bayesian optimization
* The algorithm is shown to outperform other state-of-the-art algorithms on several synthetic functions and in tuning practical machine learning algorithms
* The paper provides a clear and well-written description of the algorithm and its implementation
Arguments against acceptance:
* The computational complexity of the algorithm may be a limitation for some applications
* The requirement for a Gaussian process prior may limit the algorithm's applicability to certain problems
* The lack of theoretical guarantees for the algorithm's performance may be a concern for some readers
Overall, I believe that the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of Bayesian optimization and that the strengths of the paper outweigh its weaknesses. I recommend acceptance of the paper.
