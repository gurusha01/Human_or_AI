This paper presents a novel approach to modeling and analyzing digital crowdsourcing (CS) systems using an information theoretic rate-distortion framework. The authors aim to identify the ultimate fidelity that can be achieved by any form of query from the crowd and any decoding (inference) algorithm with a given budget. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem of CS and its challenges.
The paper's main contribution is the development of a communication system model for CS, which enables the analysis of the fundamental performance limits of CS. The authors model the crowd as a set of parallel noisy channels, where each channel represents a worker with imperfect skill levels. They also introduce a query scheme called k-ary incidence coding, which shows improved performance compared to traditional query schemes.
The paper's strengths include its novel approach to modeling CS systems, its clear and concise writing style, and its thorough analysis of the performance limits of CS. The authors also provide numerical results and comparisons with existing methods, which demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach.
However, the paper also has some weaknesses. One of the main limitations is that the authors assume a simple model for the workers' skill levels, which may not accurately reflect real-world scenarios. Additionally, the paper focuses primarily on the theoretical analysis of CS systems, without providing much insight into the practical implementation of the proposed methods.
In terms of originality, the paper presents a new approach to modeling and analyzing CS systems, which is a significant contribution to the field. The authors also introduce a new query scheme, k-ary incidence coding, which shows improved performance compared to traditional query schemes.
The significance of the paper lies in its potential to provide a fundamental understanding of the performance limits of CS systems. The authors' approach can be used to design and optimize CS systems, which can have a significant impact on various applications, such as machine learning, data labeling, and citizen research projects.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication, as it presents a novel and significant contribution to the field of CS. However, I would suggest that the authors address the limitations of their approach and provide more insight into the practical implementation of their methods.
