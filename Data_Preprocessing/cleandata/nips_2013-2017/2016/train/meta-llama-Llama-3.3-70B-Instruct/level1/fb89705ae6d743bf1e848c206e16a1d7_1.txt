This paper introduces a novel framework for analyzing concurrent measurements of neural activity at multiple scales, using vine copulas with mixed margins to construct multivariate stochastic models. The authors propose efficient methods for likelihood calculation, inference, sampling, and mutual information estimation within this framework. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the background and motivation of the research.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The authors address a significant gap in the current literature by providing a framework for analyzing mixed discrete and continuous neural data.
* The proposed framework is based on a solid theoretical foundation, using vine copulas to model complex dependencies between variables.
* The authors provide efficient algorithms for likelihood calculation, inference, and sampling, making the framework applicable to high-dimensional problems.
* The paper includes a thorough validation of the framework using simulated data and a biologically realistic neural network model.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes a certain level of familiarity with copulas and vine copulas, which may make it difficult for non-experts to follow.
* The authors do not provide a detailed comparison with other existing methods for analyzing mixed neural data, which would be helpful in evaluating the strengths and limitations of the proposed framework.
* The paper focuses primarily on the theoretical and methodological aspects of the framework, with limited discussion of the potential applications and implications of the research.
