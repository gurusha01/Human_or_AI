This manuscript introduces a two-layer modeling approach for addressing learning problems that involve latent structures. The authors commence by defining an objective function, which they then relax into a convex form by leveraging sublinear constraints to enforce the first-order optimality condition. Experimental evaluations across two distinct tasks demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methodology. 
From a technical standpoint, the paper offers a thorough analysis and clearly articulates the assumptions underlying their model. The empirical assessments conducted are also comprehensive, covering necessary aspects to validate the approach. 
In terms of novelty, to the best of my knowledge, the approach outlined in this paper is original and contributes to the existing body of research. 
The potential impact of this work is significant, given its general applicability to problems characterized by latent structures, which are common in various applications. 
The presentation of the paper is overall well-structured and clear. The motivation provided in Section 2 is particularly effective, and the text does not pose significant challenges to follow. However, there are a few points that could be improved or clarified:
- The introduction, specifically lines 41-45, could benefit from an illustrative example to enhance clarity. The meaning becomes clearer upon reading the entire paper, but initial clarity would improve the reading experience.
  
- Although the summary of deep learning literature with structured prediction in the introduction is appreciated, the connection between the proposed approach and these methodologies, such as neural networks and auto-encoders, seems tenuous, given the model's single latent layer and the specific encoding of the relationship between x and y. This weak connection makes the introduction less motivating than it could be; Section 2 does a better job of introducing the paper's goals.
  
- There appears to be a relevance to [a], particularly in the joint likelihood approach and convexification, despite [a] not introducing structure into the latent layer. 
  
- The authors might consider discussing and comparing their method to latent structured prediction approaches, including hidden CRF [b] and latent Structured SVM [c], highlighting how their approach differs, especially in how the relations between x, y, and z are encoded.
Additional comments for further clarification:
- Given the difference in experimental settings, it would be enlightening to know how the proposed approach performs under the conditions set by [12], especially considering the reported MRR of 95.4 in [12] significantly exceeds the results presented in this paper.
  
- There seems to be a discrepancy in the description of [12]'s method as using local optimization, whereas [12] actually performs global learning, which is a central claim of their work. Clarification on whether the implementation of [12] in this paper aligns with the original or if there's a misunderstanding would be beneficial.
