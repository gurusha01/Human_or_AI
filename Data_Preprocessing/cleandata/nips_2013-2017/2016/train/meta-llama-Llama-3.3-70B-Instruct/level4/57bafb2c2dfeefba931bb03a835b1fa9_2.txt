This manuscript presents rigorous recoverability bounds for identifying communities in heterogeneous stochastic block models, leveraging semi-definite program relaxations and maximum likelihood approaches to develop algorithms. It theoretically establishes the recoverability of communities beyond specific thresholds for these algorithms and provides sufficient conditions for the failure of exact recovery below these thresholds. A comprehensive series of results is offered regarding community recovery in heterogeneous stochastic block models, with detailed theoretical justifications included in the supplementary materials. The paper delivers explicit conditions for community recovery using both SDP relaxation and maximum likelihood algorithms, along with sufficient conditions for the failure of exact recovery in heterogeneous block models. Several illustrative examples are provided to demonstrate recovery cases. However, the inclusion of simulation studies, particularly for block models within the parameter space between recovery thresholds and non-exact recovery conditions, would have enhanced the manuscript. The discussion on missing edges appears somewhat peripheral to the main narrative and could potentially be explored in a separate publication. The manuscript contributes significant theoretical insights into heterogeneous block models, with the results on SDP relaxation algorithms holding considerable promise for practical applications. Given the growing interest in SDP relaxation algorithms for community detection, despite their computational inefficiency, it would have been beneficial to report on any experimental investigations involving convex relaxations, including the size of the graphs considered. The manuscript is well-structured, and the key points are articulated clearly, making it accessible to readers.
