This manuscript presents a novel deep learning approach for unsupervised domain adaptation, wherein the traditional softmax layer and loss function are supplanted by a bespoke domain-adaptive objective. This objective function simultaneously models transduction and adaptation, yielding state-of-the-art performance on both digit and office benchmark datasets upon optimization. The paper outlines a new methodology for unsupervised domain adaptation using deep learning, demonstrating superior performance on benchmark datasets. The manuscript is well-structured and clear in its presentation. Although the contribution may seem incremental, the experimental results show promise. Several questions and concerns arise: 
1. Does the proposed alternating solver guarantee convergence? What is the stability of the algorithm, and how consistent are the results? Is it possible to replicate the results consistently?
2. The explanation provided on line 166 regarding the convexity of equation (3) when feature functions are convex is unclear, particularly given that the feature function appears in the negative part of equation (3).
3. The related work section appears to be inadequate, with the most recent reference being from ICML 2015 [10]. Moreover, works [5], [19], and [32] are compared experimentally without being discussed in the related work section, suggesting a need for a more comprehensive review.
4. The writing, especially in the introduction and related work sections, could be improved. The inclusion of references often disrupts the flow of sentences in the related work section, hindering clarity.
