This manuscript employs the Cholesky decomposition as an alternative to eigen-decomposition to enhance the efficiency of the CMA-ES by reducing its time and storage complexity. Overall, the paper is well-structured and clearly presented. The proposed approach appears to be sound, and the experimental results, particularly the observed speedup rates, are noteworthy. The method has the potential to become a future standard for CMA-ES. However, the novelty of this work is somewhat limited, as it seems to be a straightforward extension of a previous study, "A More Efficient Rank-one Covariance Matrix Update for Evolution Strategies," with largely identical methodologies. I would appreciate clarification if this assessment is incorrect. Furthermore, several crucial aspects are surprisingly omitted. Firstly, it is essential to demonstrate the equivalence of the proposed algorithm to formula (2), despite the proof being established in prior work and the limited space. Secondly, the claim of O(\mu d^2) computational complexity, identical to that of CMA-ES-Ref, warrants a detailed explanation, potentially utilizing the '\Theta' notation, to substantiate the alleged superiority of the proposed algorithm. Thirdly, the assertion that the path error is minimal and diminishes over time contradicts Hansen's findings; hence, experimental validation is necessary to support this claim, as the theoretical analysis is non-deterministic. Merely comparing final performance is insufficient. Additionally, minor issues include: 1) careful notation verification, such as the inconsistency between wk in Algorithm 2 and \alphak, and the incorrect label 'n' instead of 'd' in Table 1; 2) the correction of 'F' to 'f' in line 185. In its current state, I believe this manuscript does not meet the standards for acceptance at NIPS.
