The authors present a pragmatic approach to achieving near-isometric embedding of manifold data through a novel algorithm. Building upon existing theoretical foundations, they formulate an optimization problem aimed at minimizing the discrepancy between the estimated Riemannian metric of the embedded data and that of the original ambient data. Both qualitative and quantitative experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over preceding non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques. The overall strategy of estimating the local Riemannian metric to facilitate near-isometric embedding of manifold data is commendable. However, given the non-convex nature of the optimization criterion, a more in-depth examination of how the initial embedding influences the final outcome would be beneficial, particularly considering the iterative solution process via gradient descent. Additionally, a quantitative comparison of the computational efficiency of this approach relative to standard eigendecomposition methods would be insightful. Some minor suggestions include: incorporating a discussion on the 'NuMax' algorithm in the related work section, referencing "NuMax: a convex approach for learning near-isometric linear embeddings" by Hedge et al. Furthermore, the term "relaxation" in the title is somewhat ambiguous and might be reconsidered. Lastly, minor corrections are needed, including typos found in lines 77 and 82, and a potential omission of a square in the integral of Equation 4.
