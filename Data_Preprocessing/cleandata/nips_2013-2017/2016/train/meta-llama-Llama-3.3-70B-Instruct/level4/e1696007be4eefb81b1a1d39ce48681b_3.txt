This manuscript leverages a straightforward proportionality relationship between ordinary least squares (OLS) problems and Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) to develop accelerated GLM solvers. By initially solving the OLS problem and subsequently estimating the proportionality constant, the authors propose a faster approach to solving GLMs. The theoretical framework of the paper demonstrates that, under plausible assumptions, this methodology accurately estimates GLM parameters when the sample size (n) significantly exceeds the number of predictors (p). The reduction of GLMs to OLS problems is a notable contribution. However, it would be beneficial to clarify for which classes of regularizers (as discussed in Section 3.1) this proportionality relationship remains valid, and which types of link functions are particularly amenable to this reduction. The speedup results presented in Section 5 are somewhat expected, as an OLS approach combined with single-parameter estimation of the proportionality constant would naturally be faster than iterative optimization of the GLM objective function. A more intriguing question to the reviewer is the extent to which this concept can be generalized beyond the exact equivalence established in Proposition 1. The results in Figure 2 are surprising, as one would anticipate the SLS solution to be slightly inferior to the GLM solution, yet this is consistently not observed. This discrepancy raises questions about the magnitude of the error (as defined in Equations 10 and 14) in the context of the datasets and sample size regimes considered, suggesting that the error might be negligible.
