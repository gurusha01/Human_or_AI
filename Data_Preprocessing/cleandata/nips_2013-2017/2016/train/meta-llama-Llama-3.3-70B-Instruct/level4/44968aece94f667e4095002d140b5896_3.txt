The authors present an analysis of a specific type of repeated posted-price auction, characterized by patient buyers. The scenario involves a seller with an unlimited supply of a homogeneous good, interacting with a sequence of T buyers, each having a private valuation vt for the good. A key innovation in this work is the assumption that buyers are patient, willing to wait for taut time steps to accept the best price within the window t, t+1, ..., t+taut. To make this waiting strategy optimal for buyers, the seller announces prices at time t+tau, with tau serving as an upper bound on taut, ensuring that a buyer's decision at time t does not influence prices in the subsequent tau time steps. 
The application of the EXP3 algorithm over epochs of length T^{1/3}, during which the seller maintains a constant price, yields a regret rate of O(tau^{1/3} T^{2/3}) relative to the best fixed price in hindsight. Notably, a lower bound is established, demonstrating that the T^{2/3} term cannot be improved, which is a significant finding. The model proposed by the authors is appealing due to its simplicity and offers a reasonable representation of strategic behavior that allows for a straightforward characterization of the buyer's optimal actions. 
While the upper bound is relatively straightforward, the lower bound is more complex and involves a reduction from the general multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem with switching costs to impatient sellers with switching costs, and finally to patient sellers without switching costs. The connection to MAB with switching costs is both surprising and interesting. 
However, the paper is not without its drawbacks, primarily related to clarity and presentation. There are numerous typos, grammatical errors, and issues with clarity throughout the document. Examples include errors in the abstract, inconsistencies in capitalization, and undefined terms, such as chi in Appendix A. Additionally, there are suggestions for improving the structure, such as repositioning the statement of Theorem 3 to be closer to the construction of Algorithm A' for better flow and understanding. 
Despite these issues, the model introduced is worthy of analysis, particularly for its simplicity and the insights it offers into strategic behavior under specific conditions. The technical content, including the application of EXP3 and the derivation of the lower bound, contributes to the paper's value, making it a worthwhile contribution to the field, albeit in need of refinement in terms of presentation and clarity.
