The authors propose the first linearly convergent algorithms for saddle point problems by leveraging variance reduction techniques such as SVRG and SAGA. Notably, the conventional convex minimization analysis is inapplicable to saddle point problems, making the paper's primary contribution the utilization of monotone operators to establish convergence. This approach enables the analysis to be extended to a broader class of problems, including variational inequality problems. By formulating non-separable loss functions and regularizers as saddle point problems, this method offers a viable solution. The paper's significance lies in its provision of the first algorithms to achieve a linear convergence rate for saddle point problems, which is crucial for addressing non-separable loss functions and regularizers commonly encountered in numerous machine learning models. The proof technique, which involves interpreting saddle point problems as finding zeros of a monotone operator, is intriguing and potentially widely applicable. Additionally, the paper provides simpler proofs for algorithms like FB splitting and its stochastic version. The proposed algorithms with non-uniform sampling demonstrate competitiveness and often outperform previous alternatives. The paper makes a substantial contribution to the field by extending it in a significant direction, and the analysis approach is noteworthy. Given that the primary contribution of the paper lies in the proof technique, with the algorithms being relatively straightforward extensions of existing ones, the authors may consider including more details about the proof technique, such as a proof sketch, in the main paper if space allows. The paper is generally well-presented and clearly written, although some aspects could be clarified. Specifically, the following points require further explanation: 1. The type of non-uniform sampling used for problems beyond bilinear saddle-point problems, particularly the definition of π. 2. The method for setting the step size σ in the experiments, as well as the authors' intuition regarding the essentiality of non-uniform sampling for saddle point problems, which does not seem to be the case for convex minimization problems. A discussion on this topic could enhance the paper. Minor suggestions include: 1. Correcting the typo on line 78, where k should be replaced with d. 2. Rectifying the typo on line 121 in the second equality, which contains an extra y_{t-1} term.
