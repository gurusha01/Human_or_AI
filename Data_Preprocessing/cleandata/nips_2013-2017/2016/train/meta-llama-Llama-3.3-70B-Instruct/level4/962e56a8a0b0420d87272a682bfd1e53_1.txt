The authors address a fascinating problem by investigating the impact of recommender systems on consumer behavior, positing that the observed rating matrix comprises both genuine user preferences and the influence of the recommender system. By incorporating sequential modeling, they view the observation matrix as a static representation of user true feelings and successive influences stemming from a basic recommender system that relies on item similarities. Their ultimate goal is to identify items whose ratings are significantly affected by the recommender system. To achieve this, they propose a novel metric for quantifying the effects of recommender systems and validate their approach by comparing results across various datasets, including those from real-world websites with and without recommender systems. The authors also conduct experiments on synthetic datasets to optimize the hyper-parameters of their method. This research is both original and crucial, as it tackles the important issue of measuring the persuasive power of recommender systems. Although the proposed measure captures the system's influence on rating adjustments rather than the users' genuine sentiments, the work remains highly intriguing. Notably, the scores appear to correlate with the item rating density, suggesting a potential bias in the methodology, particularly evident in categories such as films, alcohol, and food. The contrasting results between TV shows and Indian films are particularly noteworthy. It would be beneficial to conduct further analysis on the average rating and consensus in ratings for each category, as items universally liked may exhibit minimal influence from the recommender system. Additionally, minor corrections, such as the typo on line 55 ("ans" instead of "and"), and the use of a more readable font for references would enhance the overall quality of the presentation.
