The authors have developed a method for efficiently sampling from and calculating the likelihood of C-vine copulas, which can accommodate both discrete and continuous marginal distributions. This work builds upon previous research by Aas et al. and Panagiotelis et al., and the proposed algorithms offer a significant improvement in scalability, with a quadratic rather than exponential increase in computational complexity as the number of discrete random variables grows. The authors demonstrate the applicability of these copulas to neural data, which often comprises a mix of continuous measurements, such as local field potentials, and discrete measurements, such as spike counts. They show that data generated from these mixed copulas is better fit by the proposed models than by models that assume independence between marginal variables or use continuous distributions to model discrete variables. Furthermore, the authors simulate local field potential and spike data from a network driven by two different stimulus conditions and demonstrate that the mutual information between the stimulus and recorded neural signals differs substantially when calculated using the mixed copulas versus models that assume independence or continuous distributions for all variables. The development of flexible methods for modeling the joint distribution of continuous and discrete random variables is a crucial problem with numerous applications, including neuroscience. Copulas that allow for both discrete and continuous random variables offer a promising approach, and the creation of general and computationally tractable methods for fitting and performing inference with such models is of broad interest. This paper makes significant methodological contributions, and the proposed family of models appears flexible and likely useful in practice. However, some aspects of the paper could be improved. The presentation would benefit from greater clarity, as some sections were difficult to follow due to a lack of explanation and background information. For instance, equation 2 provides a general formula for the likelihood of data under a mixed copula model, but its derivation was not immediately clear, requiring additional reading of cited work to understand that it involves taking differences of discrete random variables. The description of C-vines also required supplementary reading to comprehend. While it is challenging to fully explain all concepts within an 8-page paper, providing more explanation and background would aid a general audience. Additionally, some symbols were used without introduction, such as the superscript +/- signs and "c" for the pdf of a copula. Although the overall gist of the paper was understandable, following all the details was challenging. It would be helpful to explain why a copula approach might be beneficial over existing approaches in the neuroscience literature. There is an established body of work examining the relationship between neural spiking and local field potentials, and discussing how the proposed method compares to or improves upon these existing approaches would strengthen the paper. The results section could also be enhanced with more depth. The first analysis, which generated data from a particular mixed copula model and compared the fit of different models, was reassuring but expected, as the model that generated the data would naturally fit it best. Applying the proposed methods to more realistic data, such as the simulated spike and local field potential data, was a valuable demonstration of their utility. However, to fully showcase the benefits of the proposed methods, an analysis demonstrating their sensitivity in detecting differences in mutual information between different experimental conditions would be more compelling. For example, comparing the mutual information between local field potentials and neurons in two areas when a subject is attending versus not attending to a stimulus would provide a more realistic application scenario. Experimentalists would be more interested in whether a statistical method can reveal differences in mutual information between conditions rather than the absolute values of mutual information returned by the model. References to existing work in neuroscience, such as Lepage et al., Kelly et al., and Carlson et al., highlight the importance of understanding the relationships between different types of neural data and demonstrate the need for flexible modeling approaches like the one proposed. Additionally, the work of Aas et al. and Panagiotelis et al. on pair-copula constructions provides a foundation for the methods developed in this paper. Overall, the paper presents valuable methodological contributions and a flexible family of models that are likely to be useful in practice, but could benefit from improvements in clarity, explanation, and the demonstration of its applicability to realistic scenarios.
