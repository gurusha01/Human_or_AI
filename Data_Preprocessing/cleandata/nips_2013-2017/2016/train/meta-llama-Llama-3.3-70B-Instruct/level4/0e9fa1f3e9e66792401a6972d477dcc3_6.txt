This manuscript provides an overview of existing research on bidirectional Monte Carlo and demonstrates its implementation utilizing two probabilistic programming languages, WebPPL and Stan. However, upon examination, it appears that the paper lacks novel contributions, essentially presenting the application of established methods in these languages. Considering the nature of the content, a workshop focused on Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods might be a more suitable platform for presenting this work.
