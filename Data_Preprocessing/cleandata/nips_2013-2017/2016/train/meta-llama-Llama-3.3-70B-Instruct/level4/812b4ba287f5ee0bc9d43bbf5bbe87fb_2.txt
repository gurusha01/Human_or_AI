This paper presents a innovative tree-based reinforcement learning methodology for sequentially generating object bounding boxes within a deep Q-learning framework, yielding competitive region proposal results, as evidenced by recall metrics at nboxes and iou, as well as state-of-the-art object detection results, measured by mAP, on the PASCAL07 test set. The application of reinforcement learning to object proposals is a compelling aspect of this work. However, upon examining the recall plots in Figure 5e and f, it is notable that the evaluation is limited to 1500 proposals, making it challenging to directly compare the performance with other baseline proposal methods beyond this threshold. For instance, alternative baselines such as selective search, edge boxes, and bing achieve recall values approaching 1.0 at approximately 4000 boxes with an iou threshold of 0.5. In contrast, the proposed method appears to reach saturation relatively early, suggesting that it may not attain high recall beyond the 1500 proposal limit evaluated by the authors. To strengthen the paper's scientific rigor, regardless of the outcome, it would be beneficial for the authors to report results beyond the 1500 box threshold, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the method's performance.
