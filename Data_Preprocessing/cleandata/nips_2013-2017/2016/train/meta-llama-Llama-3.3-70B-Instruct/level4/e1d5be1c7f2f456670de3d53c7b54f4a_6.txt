This paper proposes a reduction of contextual semibandits to supervised learning, aiming to harness the power of supervised learning techniques in a partial-feedback setting. The authors argue that the policies employed for arm selection in contextual semibandits form a large yet constrained class, which allows for the learning of expressive policies but poses a computational challenge in identifying a suitable policy without resorting to direct enumeration. By drawing on supervised learning methodologies, including logistic regression and support vector machines for linear classification, as well as boosting for tree ensembles, the paper accesses the policy class solely through a supervised learning algorithm, treated as an oracle. The oracle-based approach presented for contextual semibandits is innovative and noteworthy, with both theoretical regret bounds and empirical evaluations substantiating the authors' claims.
