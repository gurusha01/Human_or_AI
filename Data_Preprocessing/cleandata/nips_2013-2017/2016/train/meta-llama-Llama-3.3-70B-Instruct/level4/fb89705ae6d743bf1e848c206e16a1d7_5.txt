This paper proposes a theoretical framework utilizing vine copulas to model stochastic systems comprising mixed variable types, both continuous and discrete. The authors illustrate the application of this framework in generating samples, calculating probability densities, and parameter inference from empirical data. Additionally, they apply this method to analyze simulated neuronal dynamics, extracting information encoded jointly by local field potentials (continuous variables) and spiking activities (discrete variables). By adapting vine copulas for mixed variables, the paper offers a potentially valuable approach for joint analysis of local field potentials and spiking activities. 
Technically, the paper appears sound, but some aspects could be enhanced. For instance, figure 2 would benefit from including the results of the best-fitting mixed vine model, alongside the ground truth model, for a more comprehensive comparison. Figure 3 raises questions, as a classifier based on an independent model seems to perform better. This discrepancy could be due to the introduction of spurious information by vine-based models or the challenge of accurately estimating parameters in more complex models with limited sample sizes. 
The approach, while novel, is built upon a relatively straightforward extension of existing methods. However, its potential usefulness is tempered by two main concerns: the feasibility of accurate parameter inference in high-dimensional systems and the somewhat counterintuitive results in figure 3B, where an independent model outperforms the proposed method. This raises questions about the practical applicability of the current method, particularly in areas like brain-machine interfaces. 
The clarity of the presentation could be improved by providing a clearer rationale for combining local field potentials (LFP) and spikes, specifically highlighting the additional insights this integration offers beyond conventional methods. This would strengthen the paper's argument for the importance and utility of its proposed framework.
