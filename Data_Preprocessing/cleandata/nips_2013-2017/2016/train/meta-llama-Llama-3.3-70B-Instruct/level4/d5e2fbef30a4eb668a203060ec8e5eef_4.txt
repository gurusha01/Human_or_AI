This paper proposes a feature selection algorithm, highlighting two key contributions: firstly, the application of a two-stage greedy search algorithm to mutual information, and secondly, the utilization of binary representation of features, collectively referred to as the CMICOT method. Through various experimental comparisons, CMICOT is shown to outperform other related methods. However, several issues are noted: firstly, the explanation of SBS-based filters at line 27 is unclear. Secondly, the y-axis label is missing from Figure 1, which is the sole experimental figure provided. This omission hinders the understanding of the work's effectiveness, as the visualized differences could represent either substantial variations of up to 10 or negligible changes as small as 0.00001, without proper context.
