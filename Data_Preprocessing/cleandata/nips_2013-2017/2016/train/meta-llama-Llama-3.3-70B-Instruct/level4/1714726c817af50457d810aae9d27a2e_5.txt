This manuscript examines the accelerated descent dynamics for constrained convex optimization, leveraging a Lyapunov function to attain the desired convergence rate. The authors propose an adaptive averaging heuristic, which enhances the convergence rate of the Lyapunov function. The empirical results indicate that this adaptive averaging approach performs comparably to, or even surpasses, adaptive restarting in terms of convergence rate. Although my expertise in this area is limited, the concept of utilizing adaptive averaging to achieve faster convergence rates for constrained convex optimization appears intriguing and holds promise.
