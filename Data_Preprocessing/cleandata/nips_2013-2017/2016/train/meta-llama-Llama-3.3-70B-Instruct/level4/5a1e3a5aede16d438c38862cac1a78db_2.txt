This manuscript examines the recovery of sparse vectors using L1 regularization and non-differentiable fidelity terms, such as L0 and supremum norms. The authors investigate the stability of support recovery in the presence of minor noise, leveraging the dual certificate framework. Notably, this work appears to be the first rigorous analysis of support stability using L0 and L∞ losses, rendering its contribution substantial. However, the primary result is articulated through dual certificates, which, in my view, compromises the overall clarity. Specifically, the conditions under which the injectivity criterion is met are not immediately apparent, and it is unclear whether this is generally straightforward. Furthermore, deducing the proximity of the estimated support set J to the actual support set I from the main result proves challenging. In particular, given a specific noise level and possibly vector magnitudes, it is difficult to ascertain how much larger J can be compared to I. While the experiments attempt to provide clearer insights into this inquiry, I would also appreciate a comparison between the support of the actual minimizer xτ and that of the true signal. A rephrased version of the main result and experiments could significantly enhance the presentation's clarity. In essence, I deem the contribution robust, yet its presentation obscures the parameters of interest. The authors should either provide justification for the relevance of the extended support itself or reframe their results to directly address the recovered support.
