The authors address the problem of enhancing a baseline policy in a Markov Decision Process (MDP) with known uncertainty regarding its transitions. They propose solving an optimization problem that maximizes the difference in return between the new policy and the baseline under the worst possible model within the uncertainty set. This approach yields a less conservative formulation compared to standard robust MDPs, as the same model is applied to both the new policy and the baseline. However, the problem is proven to be NP-hard, leading to the proposal of a heuristic approximation that is empirically validated. 
I found the paper to be an engaging read, with illuminating examples throughout and clearly presented theoretical results. The investigation of the proposed optimization problem is thorough, and the comparison with existing algorithms is noteworthy. Robust MDPs, despite being around for some time, are often criticized for being overly conservative and thus of limited practical use. This original application seems to offer a natural way to overcome such conservativeness, potentially leading to more widespread adoption of robust MDPs.
One concern that requires clarification from the authors is the lack of theoretical guarantees for safety or performance bounds in Algorithm 1 due to the approximation involved. This raises the question of how it compares to simply solving the robust MDP, which maximizes over policies and minimizes over models within the uncertainty set. The latter, although also lacking guarantees, seems like a reasonable empirical baseline to assess the significance of the proposed heuristic modification. Since both algorithms come without guarantees, there's no inherent reason to prefer one over the other without empirical comparison.
Minor suggestions include considering separate counters for examples to enhance readability, as seen on page 134. Additionally, the problem of simultaneously minimizing the returns of two MDPs, mentioned on page 166, may be of independent interest. It would be beneficial to clarify if the NP-hardness of this problem is a new result and if the provided proof applies to this general case, potentially presenting it as such. Lastly, Proposition 7 on page 190 could be further examined or elaborated upon for greater clarity and impact.
