This manuscript explores saddle-point problems exhibiting a convex-concave property, demonstrating how existing stochastic variance reduced techniques, such as SVRG and SAGA, combined with a proximal operator, can be utilized to address these problems. The authors conduct their analysis within the framework of monotone operators, establishing linear convergence. Furthermore, they propose an accelerated variant and examine a non-uniform sampling scheme. 
The novelty and originality of this paper are substantial, with thorough theoretical analysis that sheds new light on saddle-point problems. Notably, the authors extend their method to apply to non-separable functions, a significant contribution. 
From a technical standpoint, while the theoretical contributions are commendable, the presentation could be improved. Enhancing the clarity of the connection to monotone operators, which currently appears as an extension in Section 6, would make the paper more accessible. The analysis heavily relies on monotone operators, suggesting an earlier introduction could benefit the reader. 
On the experimental side, expanding the results to include more than two datasets would strengthen the paper. For separable functions, a comparison with accelerated methods, such as the stochastic variant of the Chambolle-Pock algorithm (as seen in http://www.jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v37/zhanga15.pdf), would be beneficial. This reference should be included in the submission.
Several points require clarification by the authors:
1. The strength of assumptions A-C, particularly assumption (A), needs elaboration. It would be helpful to know if these assumptions hold for solving the saddle-point problem induced by SVM.
2. A clearer explanation of the differences between the stochastic primal-dual method and the authors' suggested method is necessary.
3. In Theorem 2, the constant \mu is unclear. Is it the monotonicity constant mentioned in the appendix? How does this result compare to Theorem 1?
4. The transition from assumptions (A)-(C) to strong monotonicity in the appendix is confusing. Do assumptions (A)-(C) imply monotonicity?
Minor issues include:
- A mix-up with the constant L, which is used to represent both the condition number and the Lipschitz constant. Clarification is needed, as statements like "The quantity L represents the condition number of the problem" and "we need the Lipschitz constant L" could be confusing.
- A reference for the Forward-Backward algorithm should be added to enhance the paper's completeness.
