This manuscript introduces a novel clustering approach, which utilizes a multiplicative cut-based objective function to achieve a more balanced graph partition, differing from the normalized cut method. The authors provide a theoretical justification for the proposed model, addressing a crucial issue in clustering - obtaining balanced partitions. Nevertheless, the paper lacks a necessary comparison with existing research on balanced partitions, such as the work presented in [1]. Furthermore, the presentation of the paper could be improved, as the introduction section appears disorganized and may cause confusion for readers before they proceed to subsequent sections. To enhance the manuscript, the following revisions are suggested: 
1. The authors should consider adding a comparison with prior studies on balanced partitions to contextualize their work.
2. The introduction section requires enrichment and reorganization to provide essential background information before presenting Equation (1).
3. Certain derivations, such as those for Equations (3) and (10), need clearer explanations.
4. The meaning of the three rows of numbers in Figure 2 is unclear and should be explicitly stated.
5. The percentage value in Table 2 lacks explanation, making it difficult to understand its significance.
