The authors introduce the concept of "Givens capacity" as a measure of the complexity of unitary matrices and establish bounds for a specific parametrized class of unitary matrices previously proposed. Based on these bounds, they argue that the parametrization only spans a subset of unitary matrices. As an alternative, they propose a method that operates on the entire set of unitary matrices, demonstrating improved performance on certain examples. However, the experimental section, while valuable, is marred by significant issues. Notably, the original parametrization was designed to balance representation power and computational efficiency by limiting the number of parameters. In contrast, the proposed method not only requires more parameters but also involves matrix inversion, which is computationally intensive. The authors' claim that matrix inversion is faster, as stated in lines 178-181, seems questionable, given the theoretical time complexities of O(N^3) for matrix inversion and O(N log N) for the reduced-capacity method, suggesting a potential issue with the Theano implementation. Furthermore, the comparison of methods is compromised by the inconsistent use of optimization algorithms (RMSprop and SGD) without justification, which could confound the results. The authors fail to consider these factors when drawing conclusions, leaving open the possibility that observed differences may be attributable to the choice of optimization method rather than the methods themselves. Additionally, the introduction of Stiefel manifolds appears unnecessary, as the authors only consider the square matrix case, which is equivalent to unitary matrices, seemingly done to apply a method from another paper that deals with more general Stiefel manifolds, but without a clear justification for its inclusion in this context.
