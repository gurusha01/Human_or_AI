This manuscript presents an extension of Koopman spectral analysis to the framework of reproducing kernels, with a thorough evaluation of the proposed method using both simulated and real-world data. The paper is exceptionally well-written, making it a pleasure to follow. To further enhance the manuscript, I suggest incorporating two additional elements. Firstly, a comparative analysis with traditional, non-RKHS Koopman spectral analysis in the simulation studies would provide valuable insights. Secondly, an investigation into the impact of kernel selection on the results, potentially explored through simulations, would be beneficial in understanding the method's robustness and versatility, and could be used to inform the choice of kernels in various applications.
