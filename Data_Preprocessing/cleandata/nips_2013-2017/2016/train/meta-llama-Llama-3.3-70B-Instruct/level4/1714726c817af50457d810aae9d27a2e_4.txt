This manuscript examines a particular class of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that utilize a generalized averaging approach. The authors establish sufficient conditions for the dual learning rate and weights to attain a specified convergence rate, leveraging a Lyapunov-based argument. Furthermore, an adaptive averaging heuristic is employed to accelerate the decline of the Lyapunov function, thereby enhancing convergence. The paper presents both theoretical guarantees and numerical comparisons to substantiate its claims. Within the broader context of research aimed at empirically accelerating the convergence of accelerated methods, this work offers a pivotal insight: by adaptively averaging weights along solution trajectories via ODEs, similar speedups can be achieved. The proposed methodology is noteworthy and intriguing, presenting a fresh perspective in this area.
