The authors present an information-theoretic framework for analyzing the crowdsourcing problem, deriving asymptotic limits on the number of queries per item. Specifically, they model crowdsourcing as a joint source-channel coding (JSCC) problem with a random channel state, where the channel state is unknown to the encoder but may be known to the decoder. In this model, item labels are represented as an i.i.d. source, the taskmaster as an encoder, crowd workers as multiple channel uses, worker skill levels as random channel states, and the crowdsourcer as the decoder. By leveraging existing results on JSCC coding rates, the authors establish fundamental limits on the asymptotic number of queries per item in crowdsourcing. Additionally, they provide a lower bound on the error probability of the "k-ary incidence coding" scheme under a specific crowdsourcing model. Overall, this well-written paper may be a pioneering step in applying JSCC to model crowdsourcing. Some technical observations include: 
1. The authors apply the standard source-channel separation theorem to obtain their results (Theorem 2 and 3), assuming it holds for channels with random states unknown at the encoder but potentially known at the receiver. However, they should either prove this assumption or cite an existing proof to solidify their argument.
2. The current model restricts the taskmaster and crowdsourcer to only seeing item labels and worker-produced labels, respectively, overlooking the potential for both to have access to the original data. Incorporating this side information into the JSCC model could enhance its realism and convincingness, especially if present at both the encoder and decoder or at the decoder alone.
3. When discussing Fig 2 in Sec 4.2, the authors note that the lower bounds for kIC improve with increasing k and q, likely meaning the bound becomes tighter, potentially indicating better code performance. However, without an upper bound for comparison, it's more accurate to say the lower bound becomes smaller rather than improving.
Following the authors' response, it's worth noting that while the application of JSCC to crowdsourcing is intriguing, a non-asymptotic characterization of crowdsourcing's fundamental limits would be more practical. The authors may find recent work by Kostina and Verdu on non-asymptotic converses for JSCC, such as "Lossy Joint Source-Channel Coding in the Finite Blocklength Regime," useful in this pursuit.
