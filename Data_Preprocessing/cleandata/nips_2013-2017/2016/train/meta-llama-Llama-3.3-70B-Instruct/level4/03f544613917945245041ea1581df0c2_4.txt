This manuscript presents an enhancement to existing Stochastic Gradient Markov Chain Monte Carlo (SG-MCMC) methods by introducing a Richardson-Romberg scheme, which yields improved convergence rates in terms of bias and Mean Squared Error (MSE). The proposed scheme is straightforward to implement, requiring only minor adjustments to traditional SG-MCMC algorithms. Furthermore, the paper is bolstered by robust theoretical foundations. The introduction of a Romberg-Richardson scheme aims to enhance the convergence rates of standard SG-MCMC algorithms, and both the methodology and theoretical underpinnings appear sound. However, a critical concern arises regarding the derivation of specific convergence rates from the theorem, as elaborated in the section discussing fatal flaws. Additionally, a practical concern is raised regarding the matrix factorization experiment results. Notably, if the proposed method were executed on a single-core computer, it would require three times longer than standard SG-MCMC due to the utilization of two chains, one of which employs twice as many steps. Adjusting for this, the plots in Figure 5 would not accurately reflect the comparison, as the time for Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) should be adjusted by a factor of 2/3, thereby reducing the difference between SGLD and Stochastic Gradient Romberg Richardson Langevin Dynamics (SGRRLD). In Figure 3, which depicts bias, the optimal convergence appears to be achieved by the red curve, corresponding to α=0.2, rather than the stated α=1/3. This discrepancy raises questions, particularly given the fluctuating nature of the optimal curve, which suggests that the convergence rate may not align with α=0.2. Moreover, it is stated that when the step size is too small, the term 1/Kγ dominates, yet this phenomenon does not seem to occur for SGLD, prompting further inquiry. Several minor comments are also noteworthy: Equation 1 utilizes a different symbol than θ without clear justification; the abbreviation "RR" is introduced without definition on line 94; ΓK is used without explanation on line 131; the description of the smooth function f on line 160 lacks specificity regarding the type of smoothness; and on line 249, Figure 1(b) is referenced as plotting bias versus time, rather than dimension, suggesting a potential error, potentially meant to refer to Figure 1(c). Lastly, the use of bold letters to denote vectors would enhance clarity throughout the manuscript.
