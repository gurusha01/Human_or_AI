The authors tackle an online learning problem, specifically the contextual semi-bandit problem in a partial feedback setting, where the goal is to select a list of items based on contextual information, receiving scalar feedback for each item and a reward value. They propose efficient algorithms with sublinear regret guarantees for various settings. 
Key aspects of the paper include: 
1. The problem formulation and contributions are significant, although the algorithms' motivations could be more intuitive.
2. The writing is unclear, with notational inconsistencies and undefined quantities, such as the vague definition of $p{min}$ and the unclear definitions of $Qt$ and $\tilde{Q}_t$ in Algorithm 1 (VCEE).
3. The dependence of the regret guarantee on the policy set size is unclear, with the introduction mentioning an $O(log|\pi|)$ dependence that is not evident from Theorems 1 and 2.
4. Providing insights into generalizing the algorithm for more complex reward functions beyond the current linear structure could enhance the paper's value.
