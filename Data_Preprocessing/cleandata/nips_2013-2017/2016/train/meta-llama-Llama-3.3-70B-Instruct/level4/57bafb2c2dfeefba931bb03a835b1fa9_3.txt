This paper presents a heterogeneous extension of stochastic block models, where communities can significantly vary in size and connectivity. The authors establish sufficient recovery conditions for both convex relaxation approaches and a modified maximum likelihood estimate, along with general lower bounds. Concrete examples are provided to illustrate the results, including scenarios with communities of vanishingly small size. The findings are interesting and offer a practically relevant extension of prior work. Notably, the examples in Section 3 effectively demonstrate the tradeoff in heterogeneous SBM. However, the paper lacks explanation for key conditions in the main theorems, such as Theorem 1. While upper and lower bounds on MLE performance are presented, the gap between these bounds is not discussed, making it challenging to evaluate the tightness of the results. The addition of numerical experiments would be beneficial. 
Several areas require clarification or improvement: 
1. The notion of "relative density" needs operational meaning.
2. Interpretation of the sufficient recovery condition in Theorem 1 is missing; for instance, the first condition could be seen as the mean difference exceeding the variation.
3. The modification of the maximum likelihood estimate to a parameter-independent version around Equation (2.5) may incur statistical loss, and comparisons would be helpful.
4. The lower bound in Theorem 4 requires interpretation, and its tightness relative to Theorem 3 should be discussed, including any special cases where they match.
5. The possibility of obtaining tight pre-constants, beyond scaling results, should be commented on.
6. The phrase "sufficient conditions for when the exact recovery is impossible" could be rephrased as "necessary conditions for exact recovery" for clarity.
7. Numerical experiments using convex programming would be valuable to illustrate the practical relevance of the theoretical predictions, especially concerning the power of convex relaxation for small community sizes.
