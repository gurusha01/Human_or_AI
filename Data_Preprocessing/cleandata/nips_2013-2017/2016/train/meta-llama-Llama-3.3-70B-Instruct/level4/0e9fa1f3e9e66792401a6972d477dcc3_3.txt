The authors present a novel approach for evaluating MCMC transition operators using the bidirectional Monte Carlo (BDMC) method, which involves two annealed importance sampling (AIS) sweeps to estimate lower and upper bounds on the marginal likelihood. This paper proposes utilizing the gap between these bounds as a performance measure for MCMC transition operators. The technical contributions include implementations of BDMC for Stan and WebPPL probabilistic programming systems and a protocol for evaluating the quality of posterior inference. 
A key strength of this paper is the simplicity and potential impact of using BDMC to assess convergence of MCMC operators, particularly in probabilistic programming systems. However, concerns arise regarding the novelty and depth of the technical contribution, as the main novelty appears to be the realization that the difference between the lower and upper bounds provides an upper bound on the Jensen-Shannon divergence, which, although a nice observation, may not be entirely novel.
The authors' failure to cite Radford Neal's work on Tempered Transitions (TT) is notable, as TT performs similar reverse "heating" and forward "annealing" sweeps, but with the goal of improving mixing in multimodal distributions. The analogy between BDMC and TT raises questions about the choice of β_t values and the potential for unreliable comparisons between MCMC transition operators when the gap between the log upper and lower bounds is large.
Clarity issues are present, including the definition of $\vec{v}$, inconsistent labels, and undefined estimators. Additionally, the experiments could be more thorough, with a systematic study of how the lower and upper bounds vary with step size. The "auto" part in AutoBDMC is unclear, and there is an opportunity to develop a schedule for iteratively decreasing Δβ until reliable inference results are obtained.
Despite these criticisms, the proposed method has potential, and the authors' response to addressing clarity and related work issues could impact the decision to accept the paper. Specific suggestions for improvement include defining $\vec{v}$ and estimators clearly, providing a systematic study of step size effects, and clarifying the "auto" part in AutoBDMC. With revisions to address these concerns, the paper could be considered for acceptance.
