This manuscript presents a compelling application of learning theory principles to the domain of mechanism design, specifically focusing on combinatorial auctions. It addresses a critical question regarding the generalizability of the revenue-optimal mechanism from a sampled set of bids or values to the actual distribution, given a specific class of strategy-proof mechanisms. The authors comprehensively analyze five broad categories of mechanisms, including affine maximizer auctions, virtual valuations, lambda-auctions, and mixed bundling auctions, as well as providing insights into approximations. Notably, they establish exponential lower bounds for uniform convergence in the more general mechanism classes. However, for mixed bundling auctions, they demonstrate a significant finding of polylogarithmic pseudo-dimension relative to the number of bidders and items, which is a substantial contribution. The scarcity of sample complexity results in the existing literature on combinatorial auctions makes this study particularly noteworthy. It's also worth mentioning that the work of Morgenstern and Roughgarden, although recent, does not seem to be applicable to the scenarios examined in this paper. While a thorough examination of the proofs was not conducted, the underlying concepts and methodologies used in constructing the pseudo-dimension are clearly explained and offer valuable insights. In conclusion, the problem tackled by this research is not only significant but also has the potential for considerable impact, making it a valuable addition to the field.
