This manuscript explores dictionary learning in the context of brain region learning, presenting a large-scale online dictionary learning framework that incorporates Sobolev regularization for structural purposes. The core of the paper revolves around this framework. My key observations and concerns are outlined below. 
1. Upon examination, it appears that this work primarily builds upon existing online dictionary learning methodologies (as seen in J Mairal, JMLR2010) by introducing an additional Sobolev regularization term. In my opinion, the novelty of this contribution is somewhat limited and may not align with the standards typically expected at NIPS.
2. The authors employ Sobolev regularization to impose structural constraints on the learned dictionary. However, the definition and implications of "structure" in this context remain unclear. If the intended structure refers to sparseness, it is not evident why the sparseness of the dictionary itself would yield significant improvements in the problem at hand. Therefore, the motivation behind using Sobolev regularization is not well justified.
3. There seems to be a potential error in Equation (1), where it might should be represented as \([V^1, V^2, ..., V^r]^T\).
4. Further explanation and analysis regarding the construction of Equation (2) are necessary. For instance, the choice of imposing the l2 norm on the codes, as opposed to the l1 norm used in (J Mairal, JMLR2010), requires clarification.
5. The content on line 146 is unclear and requires additional context or explanation.
6. The manuscript would benefit from refinement in terms of language and grammar, as several typos and areas of unclear expression were identified throughout the text.
