The paper explores center-based clustering in Euclidean space, a problem known to be challenging in its general form, particularly for k-means or k-median. However, it is also recognized that certain "instance niceness" properties can lead to polynomial-time clustering algorithms. This work contributes to the existing literature by considering instances that are not only "nice" but also provide the algorithm with oracle access to a domain expert. This expert can determine whether two data points belong to the same cluster. The authors introduce a novel notion of niceness, termed "\gamma-margin" (Definition 1), which stipulates that for every cluster center \(ci\), any point \(x\) in cluster \(i\), and any point \(y\) not in cluster \(i\), the distance \(d(y, ci)\) must be greater than \(\gamma\) times the distance \(d(x, c_i)\).
The paper presents two significant results for such nice inputs:
1. An upper bound: The authors provide an efficient algorithm that makes \(O(k^2 \log(k) + k \log(n))\) oracle queries and perfectly clusters the instance.
2. A lower bound: They prove that no polynomial-time algorithm without oracle access can cluster a \(\sqrt{3.4}\)-margin instance. Furthermore, this implies that no polynomial-time algorithm can cluster such an instance with \(\log(n)\) oracle calls, as one could exhaustively explore all possible answers to these queries in polynomial time.
This paper offers a fresh and novel perspective on an interesting line of research. Although the results may not be technically complex, they are of considerable significance to the field. Therefore, I recommend acceptance and suggest that it be presented, as it has the potential to stimulate interesting discussions and lead to numerous follow-up works. The paper raises several intriguing questions, such as whether such an oracle could be utilized with other stability assumptions, how it might handle non-center-based clusterings that can be approximated point-wise by center-based clusterings, and whether the oracle could be used to prune the tree in [KSS04]'s \(O(n \cdot \exp(k))\) approximation of the k-means problem.
My primary concern lies with the lower bound presentation, which is confusing due to cumbersome notation and potential technical and presentation errors. These issues detract from the paper's overall quality, despite its otherwise excellent writing. I expect the authors' rebuttal to address the following questions, as they may necessitate substantial changes to the proof of the lower bound:
(1) \(Zl\) is ill-defined, as it uses \(S{l+1}\) (lines 261-262).
(2) Figure 1 incorrectly uses "d-\(\epsilon\)" instead of "d-\(\alpha\)," unless \(\alpha\)'s role was misunderstood.
(3) \(L1\) seems to represent the cost of a type B cluster per \(Ri\) row (line 131 of the appendix) and \(L1 - \alpha\) per \(Ri\) row with type A clustering, suggesting \(L\) should include a term \(L_1 \cdot l\).
(4) The construction's purpose, particularly how "yes" instances are mapped, is unclear. Is it to \(m\) type-A rows indicating selected sets and \((l-m)\) type B rows for unselected sets, or a specific selection of \(B_{i,j}\) sets?
(5) The construction itself is unclear, with ambiguity surrounding \(w\)'s value, whether it's \(\epsilon^{-0.5}\) or a large polynomial in \(m\) and \(l\), and the input and output of the algorithm.
(6) The caveats in the lower bound, including the use of Steiner points and the implication of infinite or exponentially high aspect ratios, should be explicitly mentioned.
Minor comments include:
- Lines 152-153 should be explicitly mentioned in the introduction or highlighted as an assumption.
- Algorithm 1's input parameter \(\beta\) should be clarified.
- The \((\gamma-1)^{-4}\) term might be improved to \((\gamma-1)^{-2}\) using Chernoff bounds.
- Several typographical corrections are suggested, including "of an oracle," "without queries," and the use of canonical notation for the X3C problem.
- Theorem 14 could be rephrased for clarity, avoiding big-O notation in the lower bound statement.
