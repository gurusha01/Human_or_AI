This manuscript provides a response to the longstanding question posed by Srebro in 2007, "Are there local maxima in the infinite-sample likelihood of Gaussian mixture estimation?", and resolves it in the negative by constructing a broad class of counterexamples. The authors commence by delineating the methods through which the likelihood is maximized within the context of Gaussian Mixture Models, including the EM and gradient EM algorithms, and discuss the initialization issue, presenting a common initialization choice. They then articulate their primary theorems, which serve as counterexamples to Srebro's question. Furthermore, the authors demonstrate that even with a common random initialization, the EM and gradient EM algorithms converge to non-optimal maxima with exponentially high probability. To facilitate understanding, the authors provide intuition for their proofs by analyzing a simplified case (k=3, d=1). The paper is exceptionally clear, well-structured, and effectively balances the need for theoretical rigor with the requirement for intuitive explanations within the constraints of the manuscript. The question addressed by the authors holds significant importance for advancing our understanding of the challenges associated with non-convex optimization, even in the asymptotic limit for simple distributions. Although I did not thoroughly examine the supplementary material, the inclusion of estimates for the constants in the probability term would be beneficial. This is particularly relevant because, in practice, k is rarely considered to be excessively large; thus, estimates of these constants would help identify the point at which convergence to suboptimal solutions becomes apparent in the asymptotic limit, essentially pinpointing the phase transition. If deriving these constants proves to be overly complex or impractical, supplementary simulations would be valuable in demonstrating the observability of this phenomenon. Nonetheless, this omission does not diminish the novelty or impact of the manuscript.
