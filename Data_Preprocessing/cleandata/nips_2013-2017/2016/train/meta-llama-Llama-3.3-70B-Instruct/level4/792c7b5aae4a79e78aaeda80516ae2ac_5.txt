This manuscript examines the performance of the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm on a balanced mixture of two Gaussian distributions with known variance, focusing on mean estimation. The study investigates the convergence rate and accuracy of the EM algorithm, leveraging the analysis of Population EM as its primary methodology. The stationary points of both EM and Population EM are thoroughly characterized, and the findings are clearly presented and adequately discussed. The paper has significant practical implications, as it explores the disparity between the theoretical maximum likelihood estimate and its computational implementation using EM. With its emphasis on asymptotic limits, this work complements existing literature. Suggestions for future directions include considering the estimation of both means and variances, as well as extending the analysis to mixtures of more than two Gaussians. Additionally, it would be worthwhile to investigate the robustness of EM to model misspecification, such as scenarios where the data originate from a single Gaussian distribution, to further elucidate the algorithm's behavior under such conditions.
