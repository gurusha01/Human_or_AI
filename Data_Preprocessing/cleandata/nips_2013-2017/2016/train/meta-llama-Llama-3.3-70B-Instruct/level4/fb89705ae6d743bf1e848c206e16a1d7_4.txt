The copula method is a well-established approach for characterizing the dependency structure of discrete and continuous random variables, allowing for the separation of this structure from the description of marginal distributions. Although parametric copulas, such as the Frank and Gaussian copulas, are available for multivariate random variables, their applicability may be limited. In this context, the authors propose an iterative method for constructing a joint model by combining bivariate copula models, along with a sampling method and fitting procedure based on established techniques. The authors validate their model using simulated mixture signals of count and continuous data and apply it to simulated local field potential (LFP) and spike count data using a virtual electrode recording toolbox. Their results demonstrate that the dependency modeling significantly influences the mutual information between neural activity and stimulus conditions. Recently, there has been a growing interest in applying copula models to mixture signals of count and continuous data in neuroscience. This manuscript provides a practical and scalable method for analyzing larger numbers of neurons and LFPs by iteratively applying pairwise analyses. Despite the complex descriptions, the underlying concept is straightforward and easy to understand. However, providing an intuitive illustration of the tree structure described in lines 105-109 would be beneficial. Several questions arose while reading this manuscript, which are outlined below to help the authors extend their work. 
* As this method relies on pairwise analysis, it may neglect higher-order dependencies among signals. It would be essential to assess the extent of this potential oversight or provide a comment on this issue in the manuscript if such an evaluation is challenging.
* A comparison between the performance of the vine copula model and the Gaussian copula model, which also relies on pairwise analysis, would be valuable. The Gaussian copula is a relatively simple model for constructing multivariate dependencies, making it a suitable benchmark.
* The final result on mutual information shows a reduction in mutual information when the dependency among signals is constrained. This raises the question of whether count and LFP signals redundantly encode the two stimulus conditions. The authors are encouraged to elaborate on the implications of this finding and provide further insights into its significance.
