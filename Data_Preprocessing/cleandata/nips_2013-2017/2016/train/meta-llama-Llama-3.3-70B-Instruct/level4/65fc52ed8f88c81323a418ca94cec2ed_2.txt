This manuscript proposes a methodology for unsupervised learning of exemplar similarities, focusing on the challenge of selecting appropriate positive and negative examples for training CNN-based similarity models. The approach employs a two-stage process, initially solving an optimization problem to identify samples with consistent relational properties, followed by the training of a ConvNet to learn a unified representation for these samples. This process is iterative, with alternating cycles of CNN training and clique/batch recomputation based on similarities derived from the preceding iteration. The efficacy of this method is demonstrated through experiments on datasets related to sports actions and the traditional PASCAL image classification task. Overall, the paper successfully introduces an iterative algorithm for learning exemplar-based similarities using CNNs, addressing key limitations of single-positive exemplar methods. The strengths of the paper include its comparative performance against baseline methods. However, limitations include the lack of discussion on the computational complexity of the mutually consistent relations algorithm, uncertainty regarding potential improvements through better clique selection or enhanced CNN learning strategies, and the unclear presentation of Figures 1 and 4.
