This manuscript presents an online algorithm for learning structured dictionaries to characterize neuroimaging data across individuals, building upon the established framework in [14] by incorporating a Sobolev prior to promote spatial contiguity of dictionary atoms. The authors applied their method to empirical data, examined the effects of varying tuning parameters, and compared its performance to two alternative methods in the field. 
From a technical standpoint, I would rate this work as marginally below average, primarily due to presentation issues that undermine the clarity of the method's advantages. The model definition is clear, and the algorithms are solid, following a well-established framework. However, the paper fails to convincingly demonstrate the empirical benefits of introducing the Sobolev prior in the results section. Specifically, Figure 2 does not clearly show how the SSMF method outperforms the alternatives, lacking quantitative comparisons such as the smoothness of spatial boundaries or the identification of connected regions known from neuroscience literature. The authors should explicitly describe criteria justified by neuroscience literature and provide quantitative measurements of the improvement according to these criteria, beyond merely stating that results by SSMF were "more structured."
After reviewing the rebuttal, which provided informative results, I have revised my rating on technical quality to average. I recommend that the authors include these new results in their revision and demonstrate, with quantitative measurements, that the atoms learned by SSMF are more structured and meaningful, referencing neuroscience literature.
The paper makes a notable original contribution by extending [14] to apply Sobolev priors for spatially structured dictionary atoms. The potential impact is significant, as dictionary learning is a useful approach for explaining neuroimaging data across large groups of subjects, and introducing spatial priors like the Sobolev prior should theoretically improve results. This work provides an efficient online algorithm for doing so, potentially adding a valuable tool to the neuroscience and medical imaging community's toolbox. Exploring other applications, such as image segmentation and regional sensing, could further enhance the method's usefulness.
The paper's organization is acceptable, but it appears to be in need of editing, with confusing descriptions and typos that hinder understanding. Several specific issues need clarification or correction, including:
- The matrix decomposition equation's transpose symbol placement.
- Missing reference for the HCP dataset.
- Typographical errors ("The Graph-Net penalty can imposes," "a single, a single," "We did an extensive study of th how").
- Inconsistencies in Equation (6) and Equation (8).
- Clarification on the variable $V$ in the last line of Equation (6).
- Improvement in Figure 2 to facilitate direct comparison of results from different methods.
- Clarification of Figure 3, including what is being predicted and explanation of the legends and results.
Addressing these issues and enhancing the presentation of the method's advantages will significantly improve the manuscript's clarity and impact.
