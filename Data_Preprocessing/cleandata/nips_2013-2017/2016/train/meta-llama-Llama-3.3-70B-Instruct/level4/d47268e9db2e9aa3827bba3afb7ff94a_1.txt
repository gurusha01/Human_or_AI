The authors claim that quantum computing has the potential to (a) substantially accelerate perceptron training and (b) enhance performance bounds. However, I encountered significant challenges in understanding the paper, which also extends to the underlying motivation and the conclusions derived from this research. For example, the authors assert that quantum computing can considerably speed up conventional perceptron training, but I struggle to see how this necessarily qualifies the perceptron as a "quantum perceptron" or contributes to a more profound understanding of our learning capabilities.
