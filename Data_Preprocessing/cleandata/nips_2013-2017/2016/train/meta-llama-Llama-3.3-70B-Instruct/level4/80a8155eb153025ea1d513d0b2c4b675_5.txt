The authors examine a variation of the k-means algorithm, known as robust k-means, and delve into its theoretical underpinnings, specifically its robustness and consistency. Their findings indicate that the presence of just two outliers can compromise the efficacy of this clustering method. Nevertheless, if the data exhibits a "well-structured" pattern, as defined by the authors, the algorithm can still accurately identify the cluster structure despite the outliers. Furthermore, the authors establish the asymptotic properties of a modified version of the robust k-means approach. The paper demonstrates a high level of technical sophistication and is engagingly written, with no noticeable grammatical errors. The problems addressed in the paper are clearly articulated, and the authors effectively highlight the limitations of existing robust k-means methods while also proposing a solution. The paper presents several noteworthy theoretical results, contributing meaningfully to the field.
