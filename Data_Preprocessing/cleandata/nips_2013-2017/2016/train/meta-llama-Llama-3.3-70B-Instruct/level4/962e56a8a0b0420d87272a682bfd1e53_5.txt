This paper endeavors to dissect the feedback loops present in a recommender system, with the authors presenting an observation model grounded in multiple assumptions, which they subsequently analyze to demonstrate the feasibility of deconvolution. However, the practical application and objective of this research remain unclear, prompting the question of whether the primary goal is to assess the efficacy of an existing recommender system. To enhance clarity, it is recommended that the authors explicitly define the problem they are attempting to solve and elucidate the practical implications of this problem. Furthermore, it would be beneficial to explore whether obtaining Rtrue could lead to improved recommendation performance. Additionally, consideration should be given to whether the model accounts for the prevalent absence of ratings in Robs, noting that R_true should ideally be a dense matrix comprising ratings, where every user has a rating for each item, even if these ratings are not openly disclosed.
