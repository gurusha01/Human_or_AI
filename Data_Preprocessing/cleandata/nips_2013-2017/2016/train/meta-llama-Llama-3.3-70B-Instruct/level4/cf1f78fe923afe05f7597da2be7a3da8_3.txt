The paper presents a novel algorithm designed to enhance the low-dimensional embedding of manifold-sampled data. By introducing distortion loss functions defined through the push-forward Riemannian metric associated with the embedding coordinates, the authors provide a direct measure of deviation from isometry. These loss functions are iteratively minimized to update the initial embedding coordinates. Notably, the loss function is identified as non-convex, which may pose challenges in achieving a global optimum. The proposed method, termed Riemannian Relaxation, demonstrates superior performance with lower distortion compared to established techniques such as Laplacian Eigenmaps, MUV, Isomap, and HLLE on synthetic datasets. 
However, further clarification is needed on how the loss functions quantify the deviation from isometry. Specifically, it would be beneficial to establish a theorem and proof regarding the conditions under which a zero loss implies an isometric embedding. Additionally, a quantitative measure for assessing the deviation from isometry when the loss is non-zero, and the criteria for determining if an embedding is nearly isometric, would strengthen the methodology. 
The non-convex nature of the loss function raises concerns about the potential difficulty in achieving a global optimum, and the sensitivity of the algorithm to the initial embedding coordinates (Y^0) warrants investigation. It is unclear whether initialization with coordinates from methods like Laplacian Eigenmaps, Isomap, MVU, HLLE, or Diffusion maps is crucial for the algorithm's performance. Including running times for different embedding methods could provide valuable insights into the computational efficiency of Riemannian Relaxation. 
Given that Riemannian Relaxation is computationally more expensive and the results in Figure 2 do not significantly differ from other methods, additional justification for its practical utility, such as improvements in classification or regression tasks, would be necessary. The paper is generally well-organized and clearly written, although there are minor errors, including a typo in Eq (7) where the definition of $\mathcal{L}_k$ is not provided. Addressing these points could enhance the paper's clarity and robustness.
