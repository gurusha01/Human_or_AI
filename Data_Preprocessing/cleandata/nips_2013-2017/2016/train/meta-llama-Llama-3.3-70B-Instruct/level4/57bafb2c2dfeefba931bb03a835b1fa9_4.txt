This manuscript examines the recoverability conditions of the heterogeneous stochastic block model in a more generalized framework, lifting restrictions on community numbers, sizes, and growth rates, as well as intra- and inter-community connectivity probabilities. The authors present a comprehensive analysis from both statistical and computational perspectives on recoverability. The inclusion of examples facilitates a deeper understanding of the theoretical results. Furthermore, the identification of parameter configurations that can be efficiently recovered using semidefinite programs offers practical guidance on the application of semidefinite programming. The problem statement and results are well-articulated and straightforward to comprehend. 
Two aspects warrant further consideration: 
1. In Section 2.3, which addresses partial observations, the assumption of independent observation of the adjacency matrix entries may be overly restrictive in practical scenarios. It would be beneficial for the authors to discuss the potential impact on their conclusions if this assumption is violated, providing a more nuanced understanding of the model's applicability.
2. Table 1 presents Ex. 1 and Ex. 2 as equally significant, yet they exhibit different recoverability outcomes according to Thm. 1 and Thm. 2. Enhancing the table to include a comparison of the distinguishing features between these two examples would improve clarity and facilitate a more informed analysis of the theoretical findings.
