The authors present a method to capture local feature similarity using PDDM, addressing the limitations of global distance metrics. They also introduce a large-margin double-header hinge loss to jointly optimize similarity metric learning. The approach demonstrates good performance on image retrieval and transfer learning tasks, showcasing its efficacy. The paper is well-structured, with clear logic and well-designed figures, presenting promising results in both tasks. The authors effectively demonstrate the benefits of combining distance metric with local similarity achieved by the PDDM mechanism. The PDDM mechanism contributes a novel local similarity metric, combining feature difference and absolute position information, and exhibits fast training convergence and improved performance. The use of two double-header hinge losses, as seen in Eq (4), combines local similarity metric and distance metric on the hard quadruplet, sharing a similar idea with existing work but requiring fewer samples and having lower computational cost and faster convergence. 
To further improve the paper, several questions and suggestions are posed: 
1. A more formalized description of comparative methods, such as contrastive embedding, triplet embedding, and lifted structured embedding, would help emphasize the improvement and advantage of the proposed method beyond the comparison in Figure 3.
2. Additional analysis or demonstration is needed to explain the key reason behind the effectiveness of concatenating the feature difference vector and feature mean vector in the PDDM unit, which would be beneficial for readers.
3. Clarification is required on the particular forward pass for the end-to-end architecture, as the hard quadruplet mining during a forward pass also involves 2 CNNs and PDDM units.
4. Confirmation is sought on whether only one hard quadruplet is chosen for training per mini-batch, and if so, whether the limited samples are sufficient for fine-tuning the CNN part and training the fully-connected layers of the PDDM unit per epoch, particularly on the CUB-200-2011 dataset.
Additionally, several typos need correction: 
1. Line 47: "learn an local-adaptive" should be "learn a local-adaptive".
2. Line 103: "into an feature space" should be "into a feature space".
3. Eq (2): "$u1$ and $v1$" should be "$u'$ and $v'$".
