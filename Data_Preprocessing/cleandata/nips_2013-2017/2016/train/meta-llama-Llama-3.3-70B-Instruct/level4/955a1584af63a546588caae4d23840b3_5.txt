This paper introduces the first lower bounds that establish a limit on the achievable precision for various regression variants and classification using the hinge loss, under the constraint of limited attribution observation. The authors provide a unified proof for these theorems. However, the paper lacks empirical validation of the presented conclusions, relying solely on theoretical justification to demonstrate their reasonableness.
