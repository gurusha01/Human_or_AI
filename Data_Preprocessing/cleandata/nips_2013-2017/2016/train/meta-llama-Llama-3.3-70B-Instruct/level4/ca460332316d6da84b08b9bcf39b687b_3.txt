This manuscript proposes a novel criterion, referred to as product cut, as an alternative to the widely used normalized cut for graph partitioning. The authors demonstrate an exact continuous relaxation for the problem of minimizing the product cut, provided that the graph is connected. This continuous relaxation is subsequently solved using sequential linear programming. The introduction of the product cut criterion is motivated by the desire to enforce stronger balance among the components of the partition. However, it is worth noting that a variety of balanced cut criteria already exist in the literature, such as those discussed in [Ref1], which address the issue of imbalance. A comparative analysis against these established criteria would be beneficial in highlighting the advantages of the product cut. 
The authors' choice to utilize an older method [14] to demonstrate that the normalized cut criterion yields highly imbalanced partitions on real data is somewhat surprising. More recent methods, such as those presented in [Ref1] and [Ref2], have been shown to produce superior normalized cuts and would provide a more contemporary benchmark. Furthermore, the authors appear to employ the fully dense smoothed version (Γα) to minimize the normalized cut, rather than the similarity matrix W commonly used in the literature. 
A significant limitation of the proposed continuous relaxation is that it only functions when the product cut is defined on a fully dense matrix (Γα). If this condition is not met, the objective of the continuous relaxation is not well-defined due to the presence of a log-term (see lines 169-170). The algorithm devised for the continuous relaxation is also prone to early termination (line 197), which the authors address by initially incorporating a random subset of the constraints and then adding more constraints. To scale to larger datasets, the algorithm employs several approximations, including those used to solve the two linear systems in each iteration. As a result, it is unclear how effectively the overall algorithm minimizes the product cut.
The experimental section presents some anomalies. The authors report the average purity over 500 different runs for the product cut, whereas they should report the purity of the best initialization according to the product cut criteria. Moreover, comparisons against recent methods [Ref1, Ref2] that minimize the normalized cut are noticeably absent. To fully evaluate the benefits of the product cut, comparisons against other balanced cut criteria, such as those outlined in [Ref1], are necessary. The NMFR method [13] achieves clustering purity values comparable to those of the product cut. It would be informative to see the product cut values achieved by the partitions found by NMFR, as well as other methods, to assess the effectiveness of the proposed method in minimizing the product cut.
