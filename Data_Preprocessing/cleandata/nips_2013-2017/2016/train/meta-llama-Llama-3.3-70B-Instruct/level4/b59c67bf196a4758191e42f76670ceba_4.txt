This manuscript proposes an unsupervised domain adaptation approach that simultaneously optimizes the target data labels and the representations of both the source and target data. The method relies on two consistency types: cyclic and structured consistency. Cyclic consistency ensures that the predicted label of source data, based on the inferred target data label, aligns with its ground truth. Structured consistency, on the other hand, ensures that similar target data points have consistent inferred labels. The experimental results demonstrate the proposed method's superiority over existing state-of-the-art techniques. The core concept of jointly optimizing target labels and domain representations is sound and should be effective for unsupervised domain adaptation. However, several concerns regarding the implementation need to be addressed. Specifically, in Equation (2), the omission of the first term from Equation (1) seems unjustified, as the terms i+ and i- are dependent on (y1, ..., yNu). Furthermore, the introduction of the loss function l(x,y) in Equation (2) alters the original objective function without appearing in Equation (3), which raises questions about the convergence of the alternating minimization process. Similarly, ignoring the second term of Equation (1) in Equation (3) is problematic because Phit depends on both thetat and theta_c. 
After considering the authors' rebuttal, which highlights the stability of the proposed method, it is acknowledged that the authors intentionally omit certain terms from the objective function in sub-problems to address inaccuracies in initial iterations. However, this approach seems somewhat ad-hoc, and it is unclear whether the optimization process truly minimizes the original objective function presented in Equation (1). A more straightforward approach might be to modify the objective function directly rather than altering the sub-problems. Additionally, the rebuttal mentions the accuracy of cross-domain distances, which appears to contradict the acknowledged issue of inaccuracy in the initial iterations.
