This manuscript presents a novel approach to generating object proposals using a sequential search strategy trained with Q-learning, a type of reinforcement learning. The paper makes two significant contributions: firstly, it introduces a bifurcation mechanism at test time, where the model takes two actions from different classes, enabling it to predict multiple objects and better handle multimodality. Secondly, it designs a reward signal that provides incentives for both improving object localization and discovering new objects, without imposing a specific order. The method demonstrates impressive recall and improves upon RPN by approximately 2 points when integrated with Fast R-CNN. The ideas presented in the paper are commendable, particularly as this is the first sequential search strategy to output all objects in an image without imposing an arbitrary order during training. 
However, I have a minor query and some suggestions to enhance the experimental section, which could elevate the paper from a poster to an oral presentation. A point of clarification is needed: the ranking of the proposals appears to be based on the depth of the tree at which they are discovered. It would be beneficial for the authors to explain why this ranking is effective and whether the training process encourages the model to discover objects efficiently. 
To further strengthen the paper, I recommend adding more experiments, including: 
1. Comparisons to other proposal methods, such as MCG and DeepMask, which have shown significant improvements over existing methods like Edge Boxes. 
2. Evaluation on the COCO dataset, which captures a wider range of scale variations, particularly for small objects. This would help assess the method's performance on objects with varying scales and its ability to generalize to unseen object categories. 
Additionally, it would be interesting to see the detection AP for higher overlap thresholds, as this method seems to improve recall for higher IU, potentially leading to larger gains under more stringent evaluation metrics.
