This manuscript presents a novel approach to object detection and localization by integrating Q-learning with deep learning. Notably, it proposes a tree-based reinforcement learning framework that enables sequential determination of the most suitable image region to represent an object bounding box. The methodology is validated on the VOC2007/2012 datasets, yielding results that are comparable to other state-of-the-art detectors. The paper offers an intriguing enhancement to conventional reinforcement learning techniques. However, several aspects warrant further clarification: the optimal number of proposals is treated as a parameter, which, although determined experimentally, could benefit from a more rigorous formulation; additionally, it is unclear whether the agent's tree-RL framework undergoes any modifications when searching for different objects.
