This paper primarily investigates the feasibility of decomposing an observed rating matrix into a user's genuine item preferences and the influence exerted by a recommendation system (RS). Under robust model assumptions, the authors propose a singular value decomposition metric aimed at extracting true user preferences from any given instant rating matrix. Additionally, they suggest a method to assess the RS's impact on each user-item rating pair. Overall, I consider this a robust effort to address a novel and challenging problem. The study of feedback loop dynamics is a relatively unexplored area, and this work is at the forefront of research in this direction. While the assumptions underlying this study may not be entirely realistic, they are, to some extent, necessary for deriving a theoretical framework. Similarly, the experimental design faces challenges, notably the difficulty in obtaining ground truth data for RS, which complicates the evaluation process. Nonetheless, it appears that the authors have made a concerted effort to indirectly assess their model under these constraints. My primary concern pertains to the practical implications of this work. The main application and potential benefits of the proposed RS approach, such as its potential to enhance rating prediction tasks, are not clearly articulated. Demonstrating such practical utility, for instance by showing how RS can improve rating prediction accuracy, would significantly strengthen the paper's convincingness.
