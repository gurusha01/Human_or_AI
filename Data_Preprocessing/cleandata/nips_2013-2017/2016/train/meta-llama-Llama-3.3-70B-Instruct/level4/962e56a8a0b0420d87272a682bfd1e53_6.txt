This study aims to extract genuine user preferences from observed ratings by making sufficient assumptions to disentangle feedback loops. Additionally, it proposes a metric to quantify the impact of recommender systems (RS) on the overall user-item rating matrix. 
Several aspects of the work warrant consideration: 
1. The research concentrates solely on the user-item rating matrix, relying on item-item or user-user similarities to recover true ratings. Nevertheless, incorporating temporal, side, or contextual information from real datasets could lead to a more intriguing and practical problem of true rating recovery.
2. The supplementary file contains an excessive amount of material, which somewhat compromises the work's self-containment.
3. A minor error is noted in line 55, where "ans" appears to be a typo and should be replaced with "and".
4. Furthermore, in line 148, the term "standard normal" could be simplified to "normal" for clarity.
