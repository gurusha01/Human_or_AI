The paper presents two novel models for microclustering, deviating from traditional model-based clustering approaches that rely on latent variables, such as those implied by Dirichlet process mixture models, which typically result in linear growth of cluster sizes. Instead, the authors achieve sublinear cluster size growth empirically through simulation by relaxing the assumption of "consistency in distribution". This work is not only intriguing but also well-written, making it a suitable fit for a conference like NIPS, as it introduces innovative methodology and algorithms to address significant applications like entity resolution. To further enhance the paper, it would be beneficial to include more discussion or insights into the microclustering property, potentially referencing ongoing research in this area, either within the main text or in Appendix B. For example, the log-log plot in Figure 2 of Appendix B appears to suggest a power law decay of MN/N with an exponent of approximately 0.8, which warrants commentary. Additionally, it is noted that both plots in Figure 2 are identical, indicating the same Monte Carlo error, and should be updated. The caption for Figure 2 should also be corrected to reflect "top/bottom" accurately. Minor adjustments include correcting the subscript N in equation (3) and line 85, and on page 4, footnote 3 suggests that partitions CN should be ordered for zeta to be well-defined, which could be clarified by denoting them as ordered sets, such as ({1, 3, 4}, {2, 5}, {6}), rather than unordered sets {{1, 3, 4}, {2, 5}, {6}}. Consistency in notation for the partition space is recommended, such as using \mathcal{C}N in lines 81 and 151. Furthermore, it should be noted that K = |CN| in line 287, and after line 298, the same Gamma parameters introduced in the main text on line 100 should be used. Lastly, in the displayed equation on line 303, the correction should be made to reflect c \in C_N.
