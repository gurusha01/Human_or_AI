The authors present a feature selection method based on sequential forward selection, capable of identifying complex interactions between features. They introduce binary feature representations, enhancing the scalability of their approach. Empirical comparisons demonstrate its superior performance. 
From a technical standpoint, the experimental methodology is sound, although additional empirical experiments and more in-depth analysis of the results would be beneficial. 
In terms of novelty, the methodology builds upon existing work, representing an incremental advancement. 
The potential impact of this research, while not groundbreaking, addresses the important question of considering high-order interactions in feature selection. 
The paper's clarity and presentation are generally satisfactory, but there are areas for improvement, particularly with notation, which can be misleading. For instance, the abbreviation I(f:g,h) could be clarified, and the use of I(c;{f,H}) instead of I(c;f,H) in Section 3.1 would enhance readability. Additionally, the notation in Footnote 2, F={fi}{i=1}^{n}, should be revised to F=\cup{i=1}^{n}{fi} for accuracy. The summary of related work is comprehensive but lacks reference to "High-dimensional structured feature screening using binary Markov random fields" by Liu et al. (2012).
A qualitative assessment suggests that rewriting the paper with a focus on improving notation would be advantageous. Conducting more extensive experiments and exploring the theoretical underpinnings of the approach, potentially through the lens of submodularity, could provide deeper insights into its behavior and enhance the overall quality of the work.
