This manuscript explores the application of the Burer-Monteiro factorization method to the matrix completion problem, demonstrating that despite its non-convex nature, this formulation lacks bad local minima. Specifically, it is proven that all extraneous stationary points are strict saddles, allowing various optimization algorithms to evade them and converge to the optimal solution. This is achieved through an analysis of the objective function's geometry outside the strongly convex region, leveraging concentration inequalities. The paper presents a robust contribution to a timely topic, building upon recent works that have shown local convergence of non-convex factorization approaches to matrix completion by establishing global convergence. Notably, the proof introduced in this paper incorporates novel elements to address incoherence issues and the impact of regularization, distinguishing it from concurrent research in this area. The proof appears rigorous, and the presentation is clear. However, a minor observation is that the first inequality in equation (3.9) may not hold uniformly across B. For instance, considering x = e_1 / sqrt(d), which belongs to B, the left-hand side of (3.9) evaluates to p||x||^3 because Omega is likely to miss the sole non-zero entry of xx^T, whereas the right-hand side of the first inequality in (3.9) is p epsilon ||x||^3. This discrepancy seems to stem from the limited applicability of Theorem D.2, which may not apply to all x in B, particularly those whose infinity norm is not 1/sqrt(d) smaller than their Frobenius norm. Nevertheless, this issue appears to be readily rectifiable, as Lemma 3.4 ensures that all relevant x have a Frobenius norm exceeding 1/4, thereby significantly surpassing their infinity norm, and thus Theorem D.2 can indeed be applied to these cases.
