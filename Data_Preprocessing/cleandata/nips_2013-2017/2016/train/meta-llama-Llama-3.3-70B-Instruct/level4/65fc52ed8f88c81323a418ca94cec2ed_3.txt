This manuscript presents an unsupervised deep learning approach that categorizes samples into predefined cliques. The authors propose an optimization procedure to divide samples into batches, respecting known similarity and dissimilarity relationships between clique samples while excluding pairs with unknown relationships. This method is iteratively refined to learn a similarity network, initially utilizing HOG-LDA similarity. The results are evaluated through nearest-neighbor classification using the learned similarity on various datasets. The paper is well-written and technically sound, particularly in Section 2.3, where the optimization problem is clearly defined. The concept of consolidating transitivity relationships into batches offers a unique perspective on similarity learning. However, excluding Section 2.3, the overall methodology seems somewhat ad-hoc, as the batch assignment could potentially be performed directly on samples rather than cliques, possibly for computational efficiency. A more justified approach would involve introducing the method in terms of individual samples and then presenting the use of cliques as an optimization technique to reduce problem size. The paper's foundation appears to be the unreliability of initial similarities, resulting in the absence of labels for most of them. It would be more convincing to explicitly relate the optimization objective to this goal, potentially framing it as an approximation of the full problem. The overall presentation is good, although Section 2.2 is concise to the point of affecting reproducibility and lacks supporting references, such as "complete-linkage clustering." The experiments are sufficient, especially the use of learned similarities for nearest-neighbor classification in challenging tasks. The comparisons with ground-truth nearest-neighbors and supervised methods provide valuable context. Nevertheless, a more detailed experimental analysis of the pipeline's components would be beneficial, as it is challenging to discern their individual contributions. Training a classifier directly on cliques, as suggested, or using a simple two-stream network trained end-to-end on the same data, would serve as useful baselines to evaluate the influence of cliques clustering and the proposed method's effectiveness in avoiding incorrect relationships. The visualization of merged RGB images may not conclusively demonstrate meaningful similarities, as high pixel-level similarity does not necessarily imply semantic similarity. Alternative objective measures, such as cluster purity, could complement and validate these findings, offering a more comprehensive assessment of the method's performance.
