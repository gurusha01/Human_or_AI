The authors present a novel approach to metric learning for textual documents, expanding on the existing "Word Mover's Distance" methodology. Originally an unsupervised technique, this paper adapts it to a supervised framework where document classes are known. The code, to be released in Matlab, is a welcome addition. I appreciated the authors' thorough responses to my inquiries. 
The proposed method involves learning two key components: a linear transformation A, aligning with traditional approaches, and word importance weights w. However, I found the intuition behind Equation (5), which defines the application of w, to be somewhat obscure, and it would be beneficial to discern which component primarily contributes to the reported enhancements. 
The experimental section assesses the method's efficacy through a classification task. While evaluating distance metrics can be challenging, a comparison with a simple classifier's performance on the same datasets could provide valuable insights. 
Several aspects require further clarification: the application and distinction of Equation (2), particularly the role of lambda, which appears inconsistent with its usage in line 170. Additionally, the rationale behind the claim that the method is forgiving of syntactically different but conceptually similar words (line 316) is not clearly articulated. 
Other observations include the mention of average error across datasets on the right (line 257), which I could not locate, possibly intended for Table 3. Table 2 introduces "n" and "ne" without clear distinction. Lastly, the definition of k for kNN classification and its dependency on the dataset or method is not specified.
