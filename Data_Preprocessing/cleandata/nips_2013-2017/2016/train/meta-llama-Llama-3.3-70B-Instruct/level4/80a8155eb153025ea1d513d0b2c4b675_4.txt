This manuscript investigates the statistical characteristics of the "robust k-means clustering" procedure, focusing on its robustness in terms of the finite sample breakdown point and consistency. The authors employ techniques from variational analysis to examine the functional properties of the RKM, particularly the "breakdown point" of a family of robust k-means objectives with various regularization terms (f_lambda). Their primary finding is that this family of k-means objectives is not robust in the presence of up to two outliers (Thm 1), indicating that "robust" k-means objectives are not robust for general datasets. However, they note that when the dataset exhibits a clusterable structure, the objective is robust to outliers. Additionally, they establish the consistency of the objective. 
From a technical standpoint, the experimental section appears somewhat disconnected from the rest of the paper, as it compares two distinct robust clustering methods, one of which is based on a heuristic (coordinate descent) that locally minimizes the robust k-means objective, while the other is unrelated to a specific objective. 
The novelty of this paper stems from its application of optimization techniques to study the properties of robust k-means objectives. The potential impact and usefulness of this work lie in its demonstration that robust k-means is not robust to outliers in general and that focusing on datasets with more structure is necessary to achieve robustness, a finding consistent with recent research emphasizing the importance of clusterability in clustering procedures. The introduction of variational analysis to study clustering objectives may also inspire further research into understanding clustering objectives from this perspective.
However, the clarity and presentation of the results could be improved. For instance, in Section 3.3, the connection between Corollary 2 and the section's conclusion is unclear. Furthermore, the contribution of this paper to the discussion on the robustness of k-means objectives with an underlying clusterable structure is not explicitly stated, and it is unclear whether this has already been addressed in [2] or how the paper provides new insights. Generally, situating the work within the context of related research would be beneficial.
