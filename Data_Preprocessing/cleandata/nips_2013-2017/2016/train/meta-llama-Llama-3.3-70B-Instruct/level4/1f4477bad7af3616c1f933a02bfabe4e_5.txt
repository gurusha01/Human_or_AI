This paper presents a specific type of feedforward neural network that can achieve a unique global optimizer, along with an algorithm that converges linearly to this optimum. The mathematical derivation provided is informative, although some sections are unclear. Several aspects of the paper warrant further clarification: 
1. The transition from first-order derivatives in Theorem 3 to second-order derivatives in Theorem 4 is not explicitly justified. What motivates this shift in derivative order?
2. The network architecture appears to differentiate between the last layer and hidden layers. Specifically, the parameter matrix u, which connects to hidden layers, is treated as a vectorized gradient in equation G^\Phi (3). This raises questions about the consistency of this approach, particularly in bounding u within a certain ball, as seen in several parts of the paper.
A key concern is the requirement to maximize the 1-norm of connection parameters in equation (2), which contrasts with the common practice of weight decay to reduce the 1-norm in most neural network models. The introduction of an arbitrarily small epsilon to ensure a strictly positive gradient seems to be a theoretical necessity for the proof rather than a practical consideration for neural networks. This raises questions about the absence of free parameters and the practical implications of such a design, especially given the constraints that all data must be non-negative and the model uses exclusively positive weights, leading to cumulative additions.
The experimental comparison with Support Vector Machines (SVMs), presumably due to SVM's global optimizer, prompts the question of whether this specific neural network design offers additional practical benefits over more commonly used neural networks, such as those with ReLU activations. The practicality and potential advantages of this design in real-world applications, particularly compared to other neural network architectures, need further exploration.
