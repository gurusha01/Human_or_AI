This manuscript examines the structure of local maxima in the log-likelihood function of Gaussian Mixture Models, specifically those with equal mixing weights and identity covariance. The authors present three key findings in this context: 
1. A counter-example is provided, demonstrating the existence of local maxima (for k = 3 and d = 1) with likelihoods that are arbitrarily worse than the global maximum.
2. With random initialization, the probability of avoiding convergence to a suboptimal local maximum is shown to be exponentially small in k, under specific configurations of Gaussian means.
3. Additionally, it is proven that gradient EM almost surely does not converge to a saddle point of the log-likelihood.
In summary, this work investigates the local maxima structure of Gaussian Mixture Models' log-likelihood function, presenting the aforementioned three results that shed light on the behavior and convergence of such models under specific conditions.
From a technical standpoint, the proofs provided in the main paper, particularly for Theorem 1, appear sound upon examination. Although the details in the Appendix for Theorem 2 were not thoroughly checked, the proof idea seems reasonable based on the analysis presented. Each theorem is well-explained following its statement, contributing to the clarity of the technical content.
The novelty and originality of this paper lie in its connection between the mean configuration of GMMs and the local maxima of their log-likelihood. This observation, while intuitive, offers a fresh perspective. The concept underlying Theorem 2, which leverages Theorem 1 to show how the hierarchical grouping structure of true means influences local maxima for k > 3, is particularly noteworthy.
The potential impact and usefulness of these findings are significant, both theoretically and practically. Theoretically, they could inspire further study on the local optima structure of related clustering tasks, such as k-means problems. An interesting avenue for future research could involve examining whether the results of Lemma 7 extend to d > 1. Practically, the importance of seeding sufficient points in each true cluster is highlighted, potentially offering insights into the design of new algorithms.
The clarity and presentation of the paper are commendable. The authors effectively introduce the problem setup, provide clear intuition for their analyses, and offer interpretations of their findings. The overall presentation facilitates a thorough understanding of the research and its implications.
