This paper offers theoretical guarantees for sparse regression problems where the data term is formulated as an l_p norm, with p taking values of 1, 2, and infinity. These guarantees are established through a constrained formulation approach. The work poses a highly intriguing question, which is thoroughly investigated via rigorous theoretical analysis and carefully designed experiments.
