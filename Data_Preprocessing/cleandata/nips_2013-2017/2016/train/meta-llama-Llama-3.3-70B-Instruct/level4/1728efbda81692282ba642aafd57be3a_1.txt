This manuscript presents a spectral analysis technique utilizing the Koopman operator within a suitable reproducing kernel Hilbert space, subsequently applying a standard framework to develop kernel-based approaches for analyzing nonlinear dynamical systems from empirical data. The eigendecomposition of the Koopman operator's projection yields efficiency improvements in both synthetic and real-world data analysis tasks. The paper introduces a notable kernel construction for nonlinear dynamical system analysis, with well-motivated contributions and experimental validation. However, several concerns require the authors' attention: 
* The distinction between this work and the existing research, such as the paper by M.O. Williams, I.G. Kevrekidis, and C.W. Rowley (2015), which already employed Koopman eigenvalues, eigenfunctions, and modes for nonlinear system dynamics analysis, is unclear. A detailed comparison and discussion highlighting the primary differences, along with an enhanced discussion in section 4, would be beneficial.
* The field of nonlinear dynamical system analysis using kernels is extensive, and some relevant references, including works by L. Ralaivola and F. d'Alche Buc, Tuia et al, Rojo-Alvarez et al., M. Mouattamid and R. Schaback, or M. O. Franz and B. B. Sch√∂lkopf, are missing. The authors should consider incorporating these references to provide a more comprehensive overview.
* Although the Koopman operator is generally defined for deterministic systems, a more in-depth discussion on its performance in stochastic settings, which are more realistic, would be appreciated. The authors briefly mention this issue but could further elaborate and potentially include a toy experiment to demonstrate the operator's capabilities.
* The remark on page 5, line 216, suggests that the estimation procedure does not necessarily require a sequence but rather a collection of pairs of consecutive observables with nonlinear pointwise relations. The implications of this assumption on multidimensional time series with potentially weak pointwise relations, and the benefits of the proposed kernel construction in such cases, require further clarification. Additionally, the authors should discuss the causal assumption inherent in the setting and its implications.
* The experimental settings appear to be somewhat limited, as they primarily follow standard approaches. The "Embedding and Recognition of Dynamics" subsection lacks a discussion on connections and comparisons with the existing literature on clustering time series, such as kernel k-means and related subspace kernel methods. Furthermore, the sequential change-point detection experiment could be improved by comparing the proposed approach to state-of-the-art online change detection methods using kernels, as the currently used method is known to fail in complex dynamics. More convincing experiments are necessary to support the development.
 Minor issues: The paper is well-written and clear, but two minor typos were found: the indices on tau-1 vs. tau should be checked, and a comma should replace the dot in k(xi,xj) (last equation on page 7).
