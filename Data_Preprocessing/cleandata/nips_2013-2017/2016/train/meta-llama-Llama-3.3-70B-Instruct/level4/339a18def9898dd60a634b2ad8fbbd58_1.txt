This paper presents a modeling approach to the problem of labeling data sourced from crowds, where each worker is represented as a noisy channel, specifically considering two types of channels: the symmetric memoryless channel without feedback and the spammer/hammer channel model. By framing the problem as a coding issue for the respective channel, the authors investigate the relationship between the budget allocated and the code rate, facilitating an analysis of the tradeoff between distortion and budget. Furthermore, they explore a fundamental coding scheme, referred to as k-incidence coding, which involves crowdsourced tasks focused on labeling subsets of k items simultaneously. While I found the paper to be intriguing, given that it lies outside my specialized domain, I am unable to provide in-depth commentary.
