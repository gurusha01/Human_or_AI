This paper presents a thorough examination of the potential benefits of quantum computing in machine learning, tackling a challenging question that is often difficult to address due to the limited understanding of both computational and statistical complexities in many learning algorithms. By focusing on the well-established perceptron model, the authors investigate the limitations of quantum computers in machine learning, utilizing integer discretization of floating-point representations and assuming the presence of quantum random access memory. The approach relies on a Grover-type search, and the paper is well-structured and easy to follow, requiring only a basic understanding of quantum mechanics. Although the classical weight update scheme is somewhat simplistic, the authors provide sufficient references to more complex algorithms, allowing for a straightforward comparison with the quantum case. While applying Grover's search to machine learning is not a novel concept, this paper contributes by rigorously exploring the boundaries of this approach, a aspect that has been lacking in previous research. One notable omission is the absence of references to other studies on quantum perceptrons, particularly the work by Lewenstein (1994), which examined quantum perceptrons from a statistical learning theory perspective, closely aligning with the present study. The omission of this reference, specifically M. Lewenstein (1994), Quantum Perceptrons, Journal of Modern Optics, 41:12, 2491-2501, DOI: 10.1080/09500349414552331, is a significant oversight.
