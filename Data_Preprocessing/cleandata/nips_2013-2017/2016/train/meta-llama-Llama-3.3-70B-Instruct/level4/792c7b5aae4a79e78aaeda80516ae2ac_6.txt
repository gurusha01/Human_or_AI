The authors present a thorough examination of the EM algorithm using two simplified Gaussian mixture models, focusing on the initial parameter values that yield convergence. By utilizing the true Q function, derived as an expectation rather than a sample average, they establish an ideal parameter sequence from a given initial value. This sequence is then used to characterize the initial parameter values that converge to the true parameters. Furthermore, they demonstrate that the actual sequence from real runs converges to the idealized sequence with probability. The authors leverage this analysis to investigate the shape of the expected log likelihood near its stationary points. The paper is commendable for its technical soundness and non-trivial findings. The conclusions are well-supported by theoretical frameworks, and the conditions for initial parameters leading to convergence are particularly noteworthy. 
The paper's clarity is exceptional, with well-presented mathematics that, despite being complex, is accessible due to the effective presentation. The authors provide sufficient commentary to facilitate intuition and understanding. The novelty of analyzing an idealized execution of the EM algorithm using the true Q function, rather than relying on sample averages, is a significant contribution. The discussion of relevant literature is adequate, situating the reader within the current state of research and allowing for the proper evaluation of the authors' work.
The results are intriguing, offering insights into the sensitivity of EM algorithms (specifically for Gaussian mixtures) to initial parameters. Although the models considered are somewhat restrictive and may not directly apply to real-world data, they serve as a proof of concept for the analysis technique. The next step would be to explore whether this technique can be generalized to more complex models. A key strength of the paper is its solid analysis, while a weakness is the restrictive nature of the models used.
In the section spanning lines 188-192, the authors suggest that their analysis provides insights into other ascent algorithms. However, the subsequent justification relies on conclusions about G(Î·) made using the Q function, which is specific to the EM framework. It is unclear what claims the authors intend to make regarding the applicability of their findings to other algorithms. Overall, the recommendation is to accept the paper without reservations, given its significant contributions to the understanding of the EM algorithm's behavior.
