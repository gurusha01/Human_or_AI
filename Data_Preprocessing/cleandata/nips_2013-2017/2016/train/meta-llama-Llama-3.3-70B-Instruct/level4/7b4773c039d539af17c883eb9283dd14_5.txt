This manuscript presents a novel algorithm, termed TrailBlazer, designed for Monte-Carlo Planning, accompanied by an analysis of its sample complexity. Notably, the authors' results encompass scenarios with an infinite number of states, a significant contribution. The paper is of high quality, offering a fresh perspective through the introduction of the TrailBlazer algorithm, which boasts favorable sampling complexity and computational efficiency. A key innovation lies in the algorithm's use of two distinct parameters to manage error, separating variance and bias, thereby deviating from traditional approaches that rely on maintaining upper and lower bounds of the value function. The authors rigorously prove the sample complexity of their algorithm, with a particularly intriguing claim regarding the achievement of polynomial sample complexity even in the presence of infinite states. Furthermore, the algorithm's efficiency is enhanced as it does not necessitate visiting all possible policies. Overall, the manuscript is well-founded and of superior quality. However, several minor adjustments are recommended: corrections for grammatical errors on lines 196, 214, and 205; standardization of the notation (\epsilon, m); rephrasing of "and an a term" on line 220; and an expanded explanation on line 242 to clarify why the behavior mimics Monte-Carlo sampling.
