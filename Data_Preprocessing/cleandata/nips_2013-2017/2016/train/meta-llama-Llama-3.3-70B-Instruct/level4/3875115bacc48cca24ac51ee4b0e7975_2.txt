This manuscript explores the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for estimating the mean parameters of a Gaussian mixture model, where the number of components, mixture weights, and covariance matrices are known and fixed. The paper presents a theoretical analysis, establishing three key negative results regarding the EM algorithm. Firstly, it demonstrates that even with a large sample size, the likelihood function can exhibit local maxima with arbitrarily smaller likelihood values compared to the global maximum. Secondly, the EM algorithm, when randomly initialized, is shown to converge with high probability to a critical point with a likelihood value significantly lower than the maximum likelihood value. Thirdly, similar negative results are found to hold for the gradient EM algorithm. The question addressed by the paper is deemed interesting and worthy of investigation. To facilitate rigorous proofs, the authors simplify the Gaussian mixture model by assuming a known number of components, uniform weights, and identity covariance matrices. These simplifications are considered acceptable, given the technical nature of the proofs and the insightful results obtained. The findings are deemed highly interesting and potentially useful for understanding the practical behavior of the EM algorithm. However, it is noted that while the paper is presented in a general dimension d, the proofs are specifically for the case d=1, and the authors could provide clarification on whether similar proofs can be extended to arbitrary dimensions and discuss any additional challenges associated with higher dimensions. A concern is raised regarding the proof of Theorem 1, which is perceived as being too concise, particularly between lines 288 and 306. The computation of limits of supremums of likelihood functions over certain domains is not entirely clear, especially when dealing with unbounded domains or parameters approaching infinity. The continuity of the likelihood function, as mentioned by the authors, does not directly imply the stated convergences. Therefore, a more detailed and lengthy proof is suggested to ensure the validity of Theorem 1. Additionally, a minor concern is expressed regarding the section on the Gradient EM (lines 162-172), which is found to be more challenging to follow than the rest of the paper. Specifically, more explanation is recommended for deriving Equation (5) to enhance clarity.
