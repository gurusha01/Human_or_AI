The authors present findings on exact recovery in the stochastic block model, encompassing a broad range of regimes characterized by the number of clusters and their respective sizes. This paper offers guarantees for recovery in novel and highly generalized regimes of the Stochastic Block Model. Although the results are remarkably comprehensive, they appear to be accurate up to constant factors, which, in my opinion, constitutes a significant limitation. A challenge in evaluating this work is the rapid evolution of research on the Stochastic Block Model, making it difficult to pinpoint the current state of the art and appropriately cite all relevant studies, many of which are missing from the references due to the sheer volume of recent publications. Consequently, it is challenging for me to discern the unique contributions of this paper amidst the existing body of work. Notably, the concept referred to as "partial observations" by the authors is also known in the literature as the "Censored Block Model".
