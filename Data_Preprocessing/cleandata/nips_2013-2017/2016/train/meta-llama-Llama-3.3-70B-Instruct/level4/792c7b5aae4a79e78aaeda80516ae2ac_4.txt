The authors present a comprehensive examination of expectation maximization for mixtures of two Gaussians with identical covariance matrices and equal weights. Initially, they derive global results for the population version, illustrating the theoretical behavior of EM with access to the underlying true distributions. Building on this population analysis, the authors demonstrate that the sample-based EM behaves similarly to its population counterpart, leveraging consistency arguments. However, a query arises regarding the limitation to consistency-type results for the finite sample case. It is unclear what specific challenges or constraints prevented the authors from obtaining finite sample global results for EM, prompting the question of whether there are inherent limitations or methodological barriers that restricted their analysis to consistency-type arguments rather than more definitive finite sample guarantees.
