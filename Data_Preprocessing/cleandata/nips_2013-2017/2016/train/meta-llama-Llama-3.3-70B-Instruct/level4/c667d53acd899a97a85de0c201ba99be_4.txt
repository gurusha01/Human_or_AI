This paper examines the sample complexity of automated mechanism design for revenue maximization, where the goal is to select an optimal allocation and payment rule based on a set of samples of bidders' valuations over item bundles, aiming to approximate the maximum expected revenue on a new set of bidders. The authors focus on VCG-like mechanisms, a widely adopted class, which simplifies the problem to assigning weights to bidders and allocations within an exponentially large solution space. The paper presents compelling results, although the interpretation of some bounds, such as those involving H constants, could be clarified with additional guidance, for instance, summarizing complex sections like 3.1 with straightforward conclusions. A key aspect that warrants further discussion is the role of uniform convergence in deriving negative results, particularly in understanding the implications of requiring a large number of samples for convergence across all auctions in the class, and exploring obstacles to achieving stronger objectives like determining the sample complexity for finding nearly optimal auctions.
