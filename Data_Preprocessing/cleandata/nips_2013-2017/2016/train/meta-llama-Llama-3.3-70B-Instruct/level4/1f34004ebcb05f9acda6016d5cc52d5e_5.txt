The authors introduce PageRank and propose a framework that incorporates node and edge weights from a feature model, highlighting the lack of performance guarantees in a previous parameter learning algorithm. They aim to address this by combining a method for approximating the stationary distribution of a Markov random walk with a modified gradient-free optimization technique, which is suitable for scenarios where the loss function can only be estimated. The framework is reintroduced under a different name and notation, similar to that presented in [21]. The authors discuss various technical assumptions, a loss function, and the challenges associated with solving the problem, providing lemmas that bound the approximate gradient. A general gradient-free method is outlined, utilizing a biased gradient-free oracle, and a theorem is stated regarding its performance. Further assumptions are made to construct an algorithm for the learning problem, adapting the gradient-free method and providing additional bounds. Experimental results are briefly outlined, using a web graph from related work, but detailed results and analysis are relegated to the appendix. However, key parameters are not reported, and while the novel algorithm is claimed to outperform others, the extent and implications of this improvement are not discussed. The testing appears to be limited to a single graph, and the writing is marred by grammatical errors. Citations are also sloppy, with the problem being referred to as Supervised PageRank, despite only semi-supervised PageRank being mentioned in [21]. The impact of the solved problem is questionable, and the technical assumptions may not hold for empirical data. Some assumptions, such as restricting the search space of phi to an R-ball around a chosen phi0, may limit the algorithm's efficacy and applicability. A major concern is that the majority of the content is relegated to the appendix, with no proof outlines or full empirical results provided in the main body. The selection of phi0 and R in the empirical results section is not explained, and it is unclear whether tests were run on multiple graphs. The absence of tables or specific results in the main body of the paper makes it difficult to assess the practical consequences of the improvements. While the bounds, analysis, and algorithm may be powerful, the paper's content fails to convince due to the lack of comprehensive presentation and discussion of the results.
