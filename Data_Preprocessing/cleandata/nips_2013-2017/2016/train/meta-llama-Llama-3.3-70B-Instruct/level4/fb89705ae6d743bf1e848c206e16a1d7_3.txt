This manuscript introduces a copula-based framework for probabilistic modeling of data featuring mixed discrete and continuous variables, effectively mitigating the curse of dimensionality by constraining the interaction structure among discrete variables. The efficacy of these models is demonstrated through simulations on local field potential and spike data derived from a simulated neuronal network, revealing significant differences in model likelihood and mutual information estimates when comparing mixed copula models to independent-variables models. The paper is well-structured, although the explanation of C-vine copulas is obscure without referencing the supplementary materials and additional literature. The simulation experiments, particularly those involving simulated neuronal data, are meticulously designed and convincingly illustrate the method's utility. However, the construction of C-vine copulas remains unclear, with the supplementary information providing only partial clarification. The integration of discrete and continuous variables appears straightforward. As a comprehensive contribution that addresses key challenges in applying such models to mixed neural data, this work is deemed significant and an important advancement. Nonetheless, its impact may be limited to a specialized audience familiar with C-vine modeling and mixed data analysis until a more detailed, full-length journal publication is available.
