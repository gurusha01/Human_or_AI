This paper presents a novel class of probabilistic models, referred to as cooperative graphical models, and develops corresponding variational inference schemes. The cooperative model is formulated by augmenting the energy of pairwise graphical models with an additional submodular function, enabling higher-order interactions between variables beyond those captured by low-treewidth or pairwise models. By leveraging the submodular structure, the authors design efficient optimization algorithms to compute both lower and upper variational bounds for the partition function. The numerical experiments demonstrate the quality of these bounds and the advantages of the cooperative graphical model in a small-scale segmentation task.
The strengths of this paper include:
1. A clear and concise formulation of cooperative graphical models.
2. A demonstration of how to combine traditional variational inference methods with the two polytopes associated with the submodular function to derive convex upper bounds and submodular lower bounds.
3. Well-illustrated solutions to intermediate optimization problems.
4. Convincing and well-analyzed experimental results showcasing the effectiveness and efficiency of the optimization approaches.
However, there are some limitations:
1. The novelty of this work, particularly in relation to [11], is somewhat limited, as the variational derivation using the base polytope is similar to that in [11], despite the generalization of the models.
2. The core contribution of cooperative graphical models lies in the introduction of the extra submodular term, which allows for variational inference algorithms despite the intractability of exact inference. Further experiments highlighting the benefits of this additional term would strengthen the paper.
3. While the paper develops tractable optimization algorithms for the cooperative framework and demonstrates improved experimental performance, the added computational expense is a concern. Reporting runtimes would facilitate a more comprehensive comparison between the traditional pairwise model and the cooperative model.
