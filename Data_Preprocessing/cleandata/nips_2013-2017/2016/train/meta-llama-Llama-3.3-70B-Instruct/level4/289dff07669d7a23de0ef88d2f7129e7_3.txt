This manuscript explores the Cholesky covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy, incorporating both rank-1 and rank-μ updates for the triangular Cholesky factor, applied sequentially with rank-1 updates. Under the assumption of covariance convergence, the paper demonstrates that the modified cumulative step-size adaptation has a negligible impact on the algorithm's behavior. Experimental results on algorithm performance are also presented. 
1. The paper focuses on the Cholesky CMA-ES, extending the update mechanism for the triangular Cholesky factor to include both rank-1 and rank-μ updates. However, the significance of this contribution is questionable, given the existing work by Krause et al. (2015) that utilizes rank-1 updates for the triangular Cholesky factor. The current paper essentially generalizes this approach to rank-μ updates in a sequence of rank-1 updates, which may be seen as a straightforward extension.
2. The convergence of the covariance $C_t$ in CMA-ES has been theoretically established (Beyer, ECJ, 2014), although not directly based on the exact CMA-ES formulae. This theoretical foundation could enhance the confidence in Lemma 1.
3. Several issues were identified:
3.1. In equation (1), the notation $\sigma$ in the denominator should be specified as $\sigma_t$ to maintain consistency. A similar error is found in footnote 2 on page 3.
3.2. On line 94, the phrase "which can by be motivated by principles from..." contains an unnecessary 'by' that should be removed to correct the sentence.
