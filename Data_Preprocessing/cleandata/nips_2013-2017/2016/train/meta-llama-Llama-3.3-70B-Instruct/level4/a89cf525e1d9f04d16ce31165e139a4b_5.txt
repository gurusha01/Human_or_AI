This manuscript integrates the information bottleneck (IB) method with sparse coding, presenting two distinct instantiations of IB: one utilizing sparse priors on internal representations and another extending the first model via kernel methods. A variational learning algorithm is proposed, and the model's efficacy is demonstrated on both simulated and real-world data, including handwritten digits. The novelty and interest of this paper lie in its original algorithm, which contributes to the existing repertoire of IB-based approaches. The proposed method appears to surpass Gaussian IB in denoising and occlusion/inpainting tasks across both simulated and real data, offering new analytical tools for sparse representations through IB information curves. This work holds significant promise for applications in machine learning and neuroscience, making it a valuable contribution to the NIPS audience. 
To further enhance the paper's quality and readability, several points are worth the authors' consideration: 
1. The influence of the constraint $\gamma$ on the trained encoding/decoding dictionaries $W, U$ is not explicitly discussed. It would be beneficial to explore how different values of $\gamma$ affect the emergence of receptive fields in these dictionaries.
2. While the model is validated using simulated data and handwritten digits, which are essential for demonstrating the method's correctness, the datasets used are somewhat limited. Validation on a more diverse set of stimuli, such as natural image patches, could provide broader insights. Alternatively, a brief justification for the choice of handwritten digits as the primary real-world dataset would be helpful.
3. The selection of the sparse prior, specifically the Student-t distribution, could be justified further. Is this choice driven by analytical convenience, or are there theoretical or empirical reasons behind it? Considering the impact of different priors on model performance due to their varying entropies, a discussion on this aspect would be enlightening.
4. The discussion relating the proposed model to previous infomax/sparse coding approaches is commendable. Clarifying whether these approaches can be understood as special cases of the sparse IB model would provide additional context.
Minor suggestions for improvement include:
- Providing additional explanatory lines in certain sections, such as equation (5), to enhance clarity. For instance, elaborating on the relationship between the upper bound on $I(X;R)$ and the log-likelihood of $R$ would be beneficial.
- Correcting the objective in the presentation of the Lagrangian $L$ to reflect minimization rather than maximization.
- Revising Line 44 for better understanding, possibly by rephrasing for clarity and providing more context for the inequality mentioned.
- Clarifying the terminology in Figure 2D, where "stimuli" refers to $Y$, not $X$, to avoid confusion.
