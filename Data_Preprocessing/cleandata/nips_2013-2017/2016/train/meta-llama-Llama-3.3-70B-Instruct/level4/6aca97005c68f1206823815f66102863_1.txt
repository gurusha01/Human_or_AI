The authors of this paper propose an alternative to traditional Monte Carlo methods for Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC), leveraging Bayesian density estimation to facilitate a direct, analytic approximation of the posterior distribution. This approach shares similarities in scope with ABC using variational inference, as seen in previous work [1], yet presents a distinct methodology. The paper is well-structured and accessible, with a technical writing level suitable for experts while avoiding unnecessary complexity. Building upon existing research, the key concept introduced in Proposition 1 is skillfully applied throughout the paper, notably in selecting the proposal prior and estimating the posterior approximation. Additional novel contributions, such as extending Mixture Density Networks (MDN) to Stochastic Variational Inference (SVI), are also noteworthy. However, the discussion could be enhanced by incorporating other relevant studies on the use of SVI with ABC, like [1]. While the paper may lack a comprehensive theoretical foundation beyond the asymptotic justification provided by Proposition 1, this is deemed sufficient given the constraints of the NIPS format. The experimental results offer a balanced mix of straightforward examples and more complex datasets, presented with clarity. The authors effectively distinguish between the effects of proposal distribution selection and posterior estimation. Although the plots consider effective sample size, an alternative metric such as actual CPU time might be more appropriate, as samples in this context are computational entities.
