The authors present algorithms for manipulating arithmetic circuits that are well-suited for representing probability distributions, which can provide a sparse and efficient representation. This has significant potential for practical applications in probabilistic reasoning, aligning well with the NIPS conference. Specifically, the manuscript focuses on Probabilistic Sentential Decision Diagrams (PSDDs), offering theoretical results on multiplication, compilation into arithmetic circuits, and probability summation, along with empirical comparisons to other approaches. These contributions advance the theoretical framework of PSDDs and have the potential to make future applications of probabilistic representations more efficient. However, a notable limitation is that the manuscript is not self-contained, requiring prior knowledge to fully understand due to a lack of detailed explanations for the provided examples and some preliminary concepts. Despite this, the work is recommended for publication. 
A detailed examination of the examples reveals some areas for improvement:
- Figure 1 depicts a circuit for a network A -> B with numbered nodes, but the significance and relation of these numbers to A -> B are unclear, as they are not explained in the text. It appears to be an arbitrary example with specified parameters (\thetaa = 0.3, etc.), and the values assigned to \lambdab and \lambda_\not{b} are curious, as they should be inverses if they represent indicators. Furthermore, Figures 1 and 2 seem to illustrate distinct examples, with Figure 1 having two variables and Figure 2 having three, which adds to the confusion.
- Figure 2 contains non-intuitive numbers (1, 1, 3, 4) and inconsistencies in their placement across sub-figures, particularly with the introduction of "0" and "2" in (d), which differs from the pattern in (b) and (c). It is suggested to revise the presentation of these examples by placing the figures after the descriptive text and possibly on separate pages due to their apparent unrelatedness. The choice of drawing PSDDs as and/or gate diagrams, as opposed to labeled graphs akin to the original arithmetic circuits, might also be reconsidered for clarity.
Minor suggestions include:
- Correcting "compilating" to "compiling" on page 18.
- Improving the alignment of the trees in Figure 4 for better readability.
- Highlighting the winning (shortest) times in Table 1 in bold for easier identification.
- Clarifying the unit of measurement for "size" in Table 1, as it does not appear to be in megabytes (MB) and could potentially refer to the number of nodes.
