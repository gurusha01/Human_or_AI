The manuscript explores the concept of "churn" and presents a regularization approach for classifiers to mitigate its effects, which may be an innovative and intriguing notion with the potential to spawn new avenues of research, although its novelty is challenging for me to assess. The premise that "churn" is undesirable is logical, and the proposed regularization technique appears to be a suitable method for preventing excessive churn. However, the theoretical analysis does not provide clear guidance on the practical selection of alpha and epsilon. Furthermore, I find it unclear why the authors refer to the method in Section 2.2 as a Markov chain Monte Carlo rather than simply a Markov chain. Nonetheless, the results obtained are satisfactory.
