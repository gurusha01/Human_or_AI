The information bottleneck approach aims to maximize the information extracted from variable X regarding variable Y, while concurrently minimizing redundant information. However, its practical implementation is limited by the substantial computational requirements for analyzing complex, high-dimensional, or non-Gaussian data sets. To address this, the authors propose an alternative objective function that establishes a lower bound on the information bottleneck objective, thereby enhancing computational tractability. This alternative objective is utilized to develop an algorithm, which is then applied to two illustrative examples. Furthermore, a kernel-based extension of the method is presented and demonstrated through an occlusion task. The manuscript provides a lucid explanation of the proposed methodology, complemented by a thorough examination of a simplified scenario, an analysis of the impact of variability, and an application to a specific task, collectively offering the reader a comprehensive understanding of the method's performance and potential utility. The visual aids are well-crafted, with concise captions that facilitate an immediate grasp of the intended message without necessitating a thorough search of the accompanying text. It is anticipated that this method will be successfully adapted for practical applications by the research community.
