This paper presents an investigation into the recovery of communities under the stochastic block model, demonstrating the effectiveness of semidefinite programming in identifying communities with diverse characteristics, such as smaller sizes, that extend beyond the capabilities of previous analyses. The manuscript is well-structured and clear, making it a pleasure to read. Key strengths include: 
* The paper's organization and clarity facilitate easy comprehension.
* The theoretical result enabling the recovery of communities smaller than sqrt(log n) via convex optimization is particularly noteworthy and appealing.
* The inclusion of numerous examples enhances the interpretability of the theoretical findings, with Table 1 being especially useful for determining the applicable theorem across different regimes.
Theorem 1 (and similarly Theorem 2) provides assurance that, under specific regularity conditions, \hat{Y} and Y^ converge. However, a discrepancy arises as \hat{Y} can be continuous while Y^ is inherently a binary matrix, suggesting the need for a projection or thresholding step at the conclusion of the process. Furthermore, clarification is required regarding the set over which the maximization of (2.4) is performed, as this detail is not explicitly specified.
