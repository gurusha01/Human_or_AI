The authors demonstrate that every local minimum corresponds to a global minimum in the context of a noiseless symmetric matrix completion problem, a finding that contrasts with prior research which often relies on favorable initial conditions. Notably, this paper illustrates that gradient descent, even when initiated randomly, converges to the global minimum. An exploration of the noisy setting is also provided in the appendix, adding depth to the analysis. The core theoretical contributions are robust and technically rigorous, with the technical aspects of the paper being clearly articulated and the proof strategies in the main text being readily comprehensible. The discovery that all local minima are global minima for matrix completion problems appears to be unprecedented, paving the way for further investigation into analogous geometric properties in other non-convex machine learning problems. One potential drawback is the limitation of the results to symmetric completion matrices, which somewhat restricts the practical applicability of the theory. Nevertheless, the paper represents a significant advancement in understanding the geometric underpinnings of matrix completion problems. The writing is of high quality, with an exceptional organizational structure that facilitates easy reading. While the intricacies of certain proofs, such as the rank-1 case, may not be immediately clear, the overarching proof strategies are accessible and straightforward to follow.
