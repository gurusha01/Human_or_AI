This manuscript presents a novel approach to 3D shape generation by integrating a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with a Volumetric Convolutional Network (VCN), resulting in a combined network termed VAN. The VAN architecture learns a latent representation of objects, which is utilized for shape generation. The experimental results demonstrate reasonable performance of the shape generation pipeline, producing convincing outcomes. Furthermore, the latent representation is shown to be semantically meaningful. The idea of combining a GAN with a VCN for 3D shape generation is innovative, and the incorporation of an image encoder to output the latent representation vector from an image is noteworthy. The experiments are comprehensive and well-designed, validating the effectiveness of the method. However, the proposed approach appears to be a combination of existing methods applied to a novel problem setup, which may limit its novelty.
Several concerns require clarification: 
1. The claim that the generated shapes are similar but not identical to the nearest neighbors from the training set is not convincingly supported by Figure 2, as the shapes appear similar. A quantitative evaluation would be beneficial to substantiate this claim.
2. The utilization of the output feature from the second-to-last layer in Section 4.3 is unclear. Specifically, it is uncertain whether these features are used to retrain a classifier for classification purposes.
3. The intuition behind the loss function of VAE-VAN in Equation (2) is not explicitly stated. Additionally, the training procedure for VAE-VAN and its similarity to the training procedure for VAN require clarification.
4. The experiment in Section 4.3 demonstrates the reconstruction of 3D shapes from single images using VAE-VAN, showcasing a variety of furniture examples taken at different angles. It is unclear whether the method is invariant to viewing angles and whether images of the same object taken at different angles produce the same latent representation and final shape.
5. The use of the output of the second-to-last layer of the discriminator network as a feature for classification yields promising results. However, given the meaningfulness of the latent representation, it would be interesting to explore the use of this representation as a feature for classification and compare the results.
6. The coarse output mesh grid may be attributed to the low resolution used. It is possible that the network is learning mid-level structures of shapes, such as chair legs or armpits. The authors should investigate whether the method can be applied to higher resolutions, where more detailed features are present, and assess its performance.
Overall, this is an interesting manuscript, and addressing these concerns will enhance the clarity and validity of the proposed approach.
