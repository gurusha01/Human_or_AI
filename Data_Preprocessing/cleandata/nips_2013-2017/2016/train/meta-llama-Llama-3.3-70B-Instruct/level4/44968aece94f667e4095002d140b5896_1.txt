This manuscript examines the issue of determining reserve prices for buyers who only participate for a limited number of rounds (tau) and make a purchase decision based on whether the minimum price they encounter during their participation is below their reserve price. Following the author's rebuttal, my assessment of this problem has shifted, and I now recognize that the primary contributions of the authors lie in the lower bound they establish, rather than the upper bound. The paper's abstract requires significant revision to better reflect its content. Furthermore, the authors should emphasize the connection between their work and policy regret problems, highlighting this aspect more prominently in the presentation of their research.
