This manuscript investigates the attainment of rapid learning rates in scenarios where losses are potentially unbounded and characterized by distributions with heavy tails. The authors propose two novel conditions to address this challenge: the multi-scale Bernstein's condition and the integrability of the envelope function. By leveraging these conditions, they derive a learning rate that surpasses the O(n^(-1/2)) benchmark. The introduction of these conditions enables the achievement of a faster learning rate for losses that are both unbounded and heavy-tailed, thereby extending existing research and connecting with prior findings. To enhance comprehension, the authors could provide additional insight into the significance of heavy-tailed losses in this context. Furthermore, incorporating an illustrative example of a heavy-tailed loss function would be beneficial. Additionally, a minor correction is noted in Assumption 2.1, where "There exist" should be revised to "There exists" to ensure grammatical accuracy.
