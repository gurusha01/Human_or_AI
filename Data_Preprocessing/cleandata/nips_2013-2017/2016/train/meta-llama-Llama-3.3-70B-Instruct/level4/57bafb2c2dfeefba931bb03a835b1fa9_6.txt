This manuscript is well-structured and presents innovative findings on community detection, specifically in the context of the heterogeneous Stochastic Block Model (SBM). The key strengths of the paper include: 1) the novelty of the results, which appear to be unprecedented in the literature, particularly in the heterogeneous regime where prior work is scarce. However, there are some weaknesses: 1) the optimization problems employed are not particularly original, and the results seem to stem primarily from the utilization of more robust matrix concentration results compared to existing studies, potentially rendering them an "analysis artifact". 2) the topic, although relevant, has been extensively explored over the last decade, which somewhat diminishes its novelty. 3) the proof techniques utilized are fairly standard and do not offer significant methodological advancements. Overall, the paper was engaging to read, and the exploration of the heterogeneous regime is noteworthy and warrants further investigation. Based on the submitted manuscript, I would appreciate the inclusion of numerical demonstrations to validate the theoretically derived results. Considering the popularity of the topic and the potential for further exploration in the heterogeneous regime, I believe the paper would be well-suited for a poster presentation.
