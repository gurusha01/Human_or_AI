This manuscript investigates a dimensionality reduction problem, which entails identifying a weighted subset of n vectors that effectively approximates the sum of squared distances to any k-dimensional affine subspace, analogous to an "online" principal component analysis (PCA) problem. The authors' primary contribution lies in establishing the existence of such a subset, whose size is independent of both the number of vectors (n) and their dimensionality (d), and in providing a computationally efficient algorithm for its computation. They demonstrate the applicability of their algorithm through its use in latent semantic analysis of the English Wikipedia. The paper presents an intriguing and novel result, notably finding a corset whose size is independent of the input dimension, which could substantially reduce computational time for dimension reduction problems. However, an error appears to be present in the proof. Specifically, Theorem 2 is crucial for the main result, but the substitution of vector vi with matrix vi vi^T (at line 265) is not clearly justified. Furthermore, additional intuition on reducing the running time of Algorithm 1 in the proof of Theorem 1 would be beneficial. Enhancing the paper's result with a lower bound could provide further insight; for instance, can a specific input matrix be constructed such that any corset of size o(k^2/\epsilon^2) cannot achieve a 1+\epsilon approximation? The paper's organization is clear and easy to follow, although some typos are present. Notably, the notation for the operator norm of a matrix and the vector l2 norm is used inconsistently (e.g., in Theorem 2, lines 250-252). A typo appears on line 267, potentially referring to equation (5). Additionally, the variance is missing from line 5 of Algorithm 1. Overall, the manuscript offers a valuable contribution but requires clarification and correction of these issues to strengthen its impact.
