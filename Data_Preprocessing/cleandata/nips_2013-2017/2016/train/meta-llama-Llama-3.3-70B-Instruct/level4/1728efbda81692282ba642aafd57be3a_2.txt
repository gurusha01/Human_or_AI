This paper presents a spectral approach to analyzing nonlinear dynamical systems by leveraging the Koopman operator, which represents function composition as an operator. The proposed method applies Koopman operator decomposition to the forward nonlinear dynamics of a system, described by x(t+2) = f(f(x(t))), and utilizes collected system trajectories to perform eigen-decomposition of the operator, drawing inspiration from kernel PCA and subspace analysis. The technique is then applied to embedding and recognition of dynamical systems, yielding promising results. For readers familiar with kernel methods, the novelty lies in representing function composition as a linear operator and applying interesting decompositions to it, with dynamical systems being a notable application. However, the algorithm's similarity to existing dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) in the dynamical systems literature raises questions about the paper's novelty, as it appears to primarily kernelize existing methods. Furthermore, alternative approaches, such as recurrent neural networks, are available for recognizing dynamical systems and detecting changes, making the paper's applications less compelling in demonstrating the method's uniqueness and value.
