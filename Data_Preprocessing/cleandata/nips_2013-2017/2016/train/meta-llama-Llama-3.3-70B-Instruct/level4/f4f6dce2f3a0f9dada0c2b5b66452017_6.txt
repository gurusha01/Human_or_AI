This study leverages the spectral properties of the matrix Khatri-Rao product to develop an efficient method for computing statistical leverage scores, enabling nearly-optimal sampling of the KRP's rows. The experimental results validate the proposed approach, which extends leverage score computation from matrices to tensor data. However, several concerns need to be addressed: 
1. The derivation of the sampling size (\alpha r^2 \log^2n) in Line 294 is unclear. 
2. Table 1 on Page 8 lacks a caption. 
3. The performance degradation of SPALS with increasing sampling size in Table (a) at nsr = 0.1 requires a plausible explanation. 
4. Although the authors claim that their method can be easily applied to other tensor-related applications like SGD or HOSVD, no experimental evidence is provided to support this assertion. 
5. A grammatical error is present in Section 7, where it states "Its worth noting that …", which should be corrected to "It's worth noting that …".
