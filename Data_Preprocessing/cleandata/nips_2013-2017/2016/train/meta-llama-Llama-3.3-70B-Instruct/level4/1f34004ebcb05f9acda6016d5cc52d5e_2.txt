This manuscript formulates Supervised PageRank models as a constrained non-convex optimization problem, leveraging node and edge properties. It presents two solution approaches: a gradient-free method utilizing an inexact zero-order oracle and a gradient-based method with an inexact first-order oracle. However, a significant issue is that the experimental results are relegated to the supplement, rendering the main text incomplete. Key concerns include: 
1. The relegation of experimental results to the supplement compromises the completeness of the main text.
2. Theorem 1 assumes convexity, yet the function in equation (2.4) is non-convex; thus, it is crucial to clarify how to select the set $\Phi$ to ensure the objective function's convexity.
3. Theorem 3 establishes a bound for $MK(xK - x{K+1})$, but it remains unclear whether this bound sufficiently guarantees the convergence of the sequence $xk$ to a stationary point.
4. Figure 1 in the supplement indicates that GFNM exhibits slow convergence, suggesting the authors should also assess and report the algorithms' efficiency.
