The paper establishes a connection, referred to as a "duality," between boosting and Support Vector Machines (SVMs), leveraging this relationship to propose a novel boosting-based approach for reducing dimensionality. The suggested dimensionality reduction method appears to be reasonable, relatively efficient, and demonstrates effectiveness in experimental settings. The concept of "duality" with SVMs is somewhat intriguing. However, the ultimate approach relies solely on boosting, without alternating between boosting and SVMs, which limits the utility of this connection. The presentation is acceptable, although certain mathematical aspects could be refined for greater precision. Notably, the paper lacks theoretical foundations, such as generalization bounds or convergence proofs. Developing such theory might be feasible, as evidenced by related work like that of Allwein et al. ("Reducing multiclass to binary..."). The alternating approach presented bears some resemblance to, yet differs from, the method outlined by Schapire ("Using output codes to boost multiclass learning problems"), making a comparative analysis potentially insightful. 
Several specific comments and suggestions for improvement are also noteworthy: 
- On line 67, the claim that certain methods "tend to produce sub-optimal..." results should be supported with references to existing evidence.
- Equation (1) assumes an approximate equality that would require uniform convergence bounds for validation. Additionally, the expectation's scope and the necessity for multiplying the sum by 1/n should be clarified.
- The definition of M(xi, zi) on line 94 could be simplified by omitting the i subscripts, thus defining a margin M(x,z) that streamlines the notation.
- The mathematical precision in the section starting from line 91 could be enhanced.
- Line 95 seems to contain an error, as the classifier should map to {1,2} rather than {-1,+1}.
- The description on line 97 appears to imply that each y^z is an element of R^d, but the wording suggests the set itself is in R^d, which may be a point of confusion.
- Equation (7) introduces a change from zi to ci without clear justification.
- Algorithm 2 references a set {\cal Y}, which should be clarified as a tuple, and it is not an element of R^d. Furthermore, the algorithm cites equation (14), which does not appear to exist in the text.
- In equation (11), y^l should possibly be y^1 for consistency.
- Lastly, the reference to Figure 3b on line 246 does not match any figure description provided, indicating a potential error in the manuscript's cross-references.
