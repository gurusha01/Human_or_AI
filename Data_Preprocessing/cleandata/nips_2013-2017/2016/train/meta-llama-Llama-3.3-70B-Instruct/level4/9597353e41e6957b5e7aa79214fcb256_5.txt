The authors present a semi-supervised active clustering framework, where the learner has oracle access to a domain expert through same-cluster queries. Given that the expert has opted for a k-center based solution with a specific separability, the authors propose an efficient probabilistic polynomial-time algorithm for recovering the optimal clustering. They demonstrate that certain separable instances, which are NP-hard for k-means clustering, can be efficiently solved with access to a relatively small number of same-cluster queries. Notably, the query complexity is close to the lower bound established by the authors. This paper is well-written, clearly motivated, and offers significant theoretical insights into a challenging problem. The content is engaging, and the phase transition behavior of the k-means objective with respect to instance niceness is particularly noteworthy. The ability to efficiently solve an otherwise NP-hard problem using a relatively small number of same-cluster queries is promising. To further enhance the paper, the following points could be addressed: 
1. The assumption of a perfect oracle could be relaxed to allow for mistakes, as this would more accurately reflect real-world scenarios. It is essential to determine the necessary assumptions regarding the oracle for the problem to remain efficiently solvable. 
2. An evaluation of the practical gains would be beneficial. Assuming data is generated by a probabilistic model that satisfies the required separation condition, comparing the time-quality tradeoff between the proposed algorithm and a k-Means approximation (such as k-means++) would be insightful. In practice, k-means++ might perform exceptionally well under the same separability assumption. 
3. The current framework assumes the expert adheres to a hard center-based clustering. It would be interesting to explore whether the results can be extended to the setting where the goal is to recover a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and the oracle provides a probabilistic assignment to each cluster. Given sufficient separation and certain assumptions about the covariance matrices, the two problems become increasingly similar. 
A minor correction is needed in Theorem 7, where "clustering instane" should be corrected to "clustering instance".
