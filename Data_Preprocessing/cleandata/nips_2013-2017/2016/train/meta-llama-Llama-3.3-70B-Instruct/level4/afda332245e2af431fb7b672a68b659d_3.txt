This manuscript introduces a novel "exploration bonus" methodology grounded in the concept of "pseudo count", showcasing its desirable properties in the context of two computer games, FREEWAY and PITFALL, as detailed in Section 4. It further examines the asymptotic relationship between pseudo count and actual count in Section 5, explores the connection to intrinsic motivation and information gain in Section 6, and presents experimental outcomes utilizing pseudo count for exploration purposes in Section 7. The paper is intriguing overall, with the concept of "pseudo count", its application to exploration, and its link to information gain appearing to be innovative to the best of my knowledge. The experimental findings in Sections 4 and 7 are persuasive. In my opinion, the manuscript meets the standards for a NIPS poster, although the theoretical aspects could be strengthened. My primary concern is the paper's overall clarity and coherence, as the transitions between sections are somewhat disjointed. Additionally, the title suggests a focus on the relationships between pseudo count, intrinsic motivation, and information gain, yet this emphasis seems confined to Section 6, with other sections appearing to address disparate or unrelated topics. I recommend refining the final draft. Some minor suggestions include: 1) enlarging the figures in Figure 1 and 2 for better visibility; 2) clarifying the distinction between Cn(x,a) in Section 2.1 and R^+n(x,a) in Equation 5, as they seem to be equivalent up to a factor of \beta.
