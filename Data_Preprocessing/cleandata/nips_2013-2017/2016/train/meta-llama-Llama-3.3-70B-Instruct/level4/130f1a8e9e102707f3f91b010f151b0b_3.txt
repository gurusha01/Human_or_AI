The authors propose an extension of dictionary learning models by integrating a Sobolev prior, which addresses an intriguing problem. However, assessing the significance and improvement of this novel algorithm is challenging. The primary results figure relies on visual comparisons of the clarity and consistency of identified brain blobs, but this may not be readily apparent to non-experts. In the context of this type of decomposition, the quality of the data is often as crucial as, if not more important than, the algorithm itself. The incorporation of penalties for smoothness and spatial consistency predictably yields smoother blobs, which may be beneficial in cases with limited data, but seems less relevant given the extensive data available from the Human Connectome Project. This paper could have made a more substantial contribution by exploring the consolidation of differences between brain regions across subjects and utilizing inter-subject variability as a means of validating performance. As presented, the validation appears subjective, and the advantages of this approach are not clearly demonstrated.
