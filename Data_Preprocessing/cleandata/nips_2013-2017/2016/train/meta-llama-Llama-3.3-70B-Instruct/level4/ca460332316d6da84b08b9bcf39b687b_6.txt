The manuscript under consideration introduces a novel metric for multi-way graph partitioning problems, specifically the product cut, and accompanies it with an algorithm designed to solve this problem. The authors assert that their proposed algorithm outperforms existing solutions by a significant margin. The problem tackled in this paper is intriguing, offering insightful perspectives on clustering that, to the best of my knowledge, are unprecedented. The presentation is commendable, making it accessible to readers without specialized expertise. 
Detailed comments include:
- The algorithm's runtime analysis is notably absent. Incorporating a lemma that outlines the algorithm's runtime and performance characteristics is essential. Furthermore, the claim on Line 235 that the algorithm typically exhibits substantially faster runtime compared to other algorithms appears to be based on experimental observations. A more rigorous analytical approach is warranted to substantiate such assertions.
- The parameter 'Purity' is utilized to assess algorithmic performance. However, a justification for the choice of this parameter and a clearer explanation of its meaning are necessary. Specifically, it is unclear whether 'Purity' relates to the number of misclassified nodes. If so, an explanation is needed for why an algorithm yielding a higher purity value provides a better guarantee.
- A typo is present on Line 224, where the phrase "By and large" appears, suggesting a need for proofreading to correct such minor errors and enhance the manuscript's overall quality.
