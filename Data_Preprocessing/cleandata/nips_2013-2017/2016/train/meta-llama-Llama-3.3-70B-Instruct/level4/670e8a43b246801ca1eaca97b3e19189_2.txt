The paper presents a novel distribution over partitions of integers that facilitates micro-clustering, a property where the ratio of cluster size to the number of data points approaches zero as the data points increase. This is particularly relevant for applications like entity resolution, where existing infinitely exchangeable clustering models such as the Dirichlet Process (DP) and Pitman-Yor Process (PYP) mixture models exhibit cluster sizes that grow linearly with the number of data points. The proposed framework achieves micro-clustering by first sampling the number of clusters from a distribution with positive integer support, followed by explicit sampling of each cluster size from another distribution over positive integers. This approach preserves exchangeability but sacrifices consistency of marginals. Two specific instances of this framework are introduced: one utilizing the negative binomial distribution for both the number of clusters and cluster sizes, and another employing a Dirichlet distribution with an infinite-dimensional base distribution for cluster sizes to enhance flexibility, especially for large datasets. Reseating algorithms akin to the Chinese Restaurant Process and Pitman-Yor Process are developed for both models, leveraging their exchangeability for sampling-based inference. Experimental evaluations on four semi-synthetic datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed models over DP and PYP for entity resolution tasks, showcasing their potential. 
The paper's key strengths include identifying and addressing a critical limitation of existing clustering models, proposing a flexible framework that satisfies the micro-clustering property, and providing detailed experimental results that illustrate the usefulness of the proposed models. However, there are several areas that require improvement. The cost of sacrificing consistency of marginal distributions for achieving micro-clustering is not clearly explained, with a vague statement regarding the inability to produce an exact sample when incrementally constructing a partition. Furthermore, the paper lacks a theoretical comparison of the reseating algorithms with the Pitman-Yor Process, particularly in how the proposed models achieve micro-clustering while the PYP does not. The relationship between the two proposed models, differing in their use of the negative binomial and Dirichlet distributions, is also not satisfactorily analyzed. Additionally, the paper mentions related work, such as the Uniform Process, which achieves micro-clustering by sacrificing exchangeability, but fails to discuss its contributions in relation to the proposed framework. The experimental section could be strengthened by more convincing demonstrations of the proposed models' superiority, especially considering the simplicity of the tasks for the first two datasets and the baseline models' better performance on the more challenging datasets.
Minor suggestions for improvement include clarifying the role of alpha in the reseating algorithm, providing a high-level description of the Chaperones algorithm, rearranging the paper's flow for better readability, reconsidering the model's name for clarity, and addressing several notation and formatting issues throughout the text. Moreover, explanations for certain equations and terms, such as the definition of theta_lk in Eqn 11 and the difference between the two Syria datasets, would enhance the paper's clarity. Finally, the experimental methodology, including whether results are reported over a single synthetic dataset or averaged over multiple samples and how error rates are defined to account for label permutation issues, should be more transparently explained.
