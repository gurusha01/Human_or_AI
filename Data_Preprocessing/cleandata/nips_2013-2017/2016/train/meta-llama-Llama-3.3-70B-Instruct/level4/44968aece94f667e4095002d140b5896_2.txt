The paper examines a model of online pricing with patient buyers, where a seller with unlimited inventory sets prices for a fixed period of $\tau$ steps, and buyers arrive at each time step, willing to wait up to $\tau_i \leq \tau$ steps. Each buyer selects the cheapest time within their waiting period, and the seller aims to maximize revenue. The authors propose an algorithm with a regret bound of $\tau^{1/3} \cdot n^{1/3} \cdot T^{2/3}$, where $n$ is the number of possible prices, and establish a lower bound of $\tau^{1/3} \cdot T^{2/3}$. 
The contributions of this paper are notable, as it investigates a compelling model that extends the existing literature on posted pricing by accounting for buyers' ability to wait for lower prices, introducing a reasonable assumption on the upper bound of each buyer's waiting time. The proposed algorithm, although natural, is not immediately apparent from prior work and requires the seller to maintain the same price for slightly longer than $\tau$ steps to obtain accurate estimates of the probability of sale at a given price. 
The lower bound, derived from a reduction to bandits with switching costs, is non-trivial. Overall, the paper is well-written, and its only potential improvement would be achieving matching upper and lower bounds with respect to the number of arms, which would further strengthen the results.
