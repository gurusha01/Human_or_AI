The authors present a methodology for training a specific class of feed-forward neural networks under certain conditions, accompanied by a proof of optimal convergence. They demonstrate the applicability of their method to a range of real-world problems, which is an interesting area of investigation that warrants theoretical advancements. However, the paper somewhat falls short in convincingly demonstrating the practical utility of the proposed neural network class. Notably, the authors raise concerns about the expressiveness of their restricted model on two occasions, suggesting the need for additional discussion on the capabilities and limitations of their approach. Furthermore, a comparison with concurrent methods would be beneficial. The experimental results lack clarity regarding the model's limitations and applicability. It is surprising that the comparison is limited to SVM, neglecting other neural network training methods and algorithmic paradigms. Information on the computational resources required by the algorithms would also be valuable. The introduction is well-crafted, but the subsequent presentation could be improved, particularly in Section 2, which is not fluent. Several typos were identified, including "polyomial" and the lack of introduction for certain notations such as $R{++}$ and variables $p1$ and $p_2$. Specific suggestions include providing an informal explanation of Theorem 1 before its statement, as the current presentation is difficult to follow. Additionally, the motivation behind the function $\Phi$, including the role of the epsilon term, should be clarified within the paper, as it was only explained in the rebuttal. The statement following Theorem 1 regarding the convergence of the nonlinear spectral method should also be clarified as stemming from experimental observations, as explained in the rebuttal. Overall, while the problem under investigation is intriguing, and theoretical progress is appreciated, the paper requires enhancements to demonstrate the practical usefulness and limitations of the proposed methodology.
