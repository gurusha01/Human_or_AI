This manuscript examines the refinement of machine learning models through iterative training and feature set refinement, emphasizing the need for statistically significant improvements with each iteration. The authors introduce the concept of "churn" to quantify whether model updates yield substantial enhancements over previous versions. A novel training scheme is proposed, applicable to various classifiers, aimed at minimizing churn and ensuring genuine model improvement. Experimental results demonstrate a significant reduction in churn using three classifiers across different datasets. The strengths of this work include the utility of the "churn" metric, particularly in scenarios with continuous input data streams, as it helps justify the allocation of additional resources by guaranteeing significant model advancements. For clarity, the variables V1 and V2 in Table 3 are presumed to represent the accuracies of classifiers A and B, respectively. Further insight into the intuitive reasoning behind the formulation of Equation 2 and the Diplopia operator, specifically how they contribute to churn reduction, would enhance the understanding and applicability of the proposed method.
