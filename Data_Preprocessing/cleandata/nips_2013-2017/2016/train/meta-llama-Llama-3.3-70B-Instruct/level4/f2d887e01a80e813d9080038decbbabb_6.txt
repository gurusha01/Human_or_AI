This paper proposes utilizing the method of moments to estimate classifier error in an unsupervised context. It relies on the assumption that the classifier can be factored into three conditionally independent parameters, a notably strong generative assumption. However, the authors successfully derive a robust result from this premise. They demonstrate how this approach can be leveraged in a semi-supervised setting to capitalize on unlabeled data and a limited number of labeled examples, thereby enhancing performance. The paper's findings are intriguing, employing the method of moments and tensor decomposition in a novel and non-trivial manner. The integration of tensor decomposition into a semi-supervised framework is particularly noteworthy and appears to yield substantial improvements. While the underlying assumptions are indeed stringent, and their practical verifiability remains uncertain, the paper presents an innovative classification method that merits further investigation.
