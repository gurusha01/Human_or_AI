This manuscript presents a novel low-rank tensor CP decomposition approach, termed the sparse alternating least squares (SPALS) method, which enhances the traditional ALS algorithm through sampling techniques. Additionally, the authors derive valuable properties related to the leverage scores of the matrix Khatri-Rao product. The experimental outcomes demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed algorithm. I would like to raise the following points for consideration: 
1. The theoretical framework of this paper primarily concentrates on approximating the solution to problem (1), a crucial step in the ALS process. It would be beneficial to explore whether there exists an analysis that links the sampling methodology to the overall convergence behavior of ALS.
2. Several questions arose regarding the experimental setup: 
a) What methodology was employed to determine the initial parameter values, and how sensitive are the results to these initial values?
b) What specific stopping criterion was utilized in practice to terminate the algorithm?
c) The results presented in Table 1b do not include the sketching-based method; could the authors provide a rationale for its omission?
