This manuscript presents a novel framework for learning enhanced deep feature embeddings, which is crucial for applications such as image retrieval and distance-based classification. The proposed framework introduces a new metric, termed Position-Dependent Deep Metric (PDDM), which takes into account not only the difference between two features but also their mean, rendering it position-aware. This PDDM metric facilitates the identification of high-quality hard negative samples, essential for training a metric. By combining two losses based on the PDDM metric and feature embeddings, the framework enables joint optimization of the metric and embedding. The efficacy of the proposed framework is demonstrated through an experimental study on a fine-grained image retrieval dataset, as well as tasks involving transfer learning and zero-shot learning. The proposed deep feature embedding framework is intriguing and innovative, with the concept of a location-aware similarity metric being well-founded. Although the idea of learning local distances to better capture feature space variation is not new in metric learning, its application to deep feature embedding in this manner appears to be novel. The formulation of PDDM is clear, and the experimental study showcases the advantages of the proposed framework. 
Comments: 
1. The necessity for a local similarity metric may stem from the inconsistency between learned deep features and semantic concepts, as illustrated in Figure 1(a). It is worth exploring whether the benefits of the proposed framework would diminish as deeper learning networks are developed, yielding better deep feature representations. 
2. In Equation (2), it seems that u1 and v1 should be denoted as u' and v', respectively. 
3. Providing an illustration for the description of quadruplet (lines 163-171) or linking it to Figure 1(c) would enhance clarity. 
4. A more detailed explanation of the relationship between the S(.,.) and D(.,.) functions would facilitate understanding of the connection between the Em and Ee losses. 
5. The experimental study could be expanded by comparing results on additional benchmark datasets, such as fine-grained image retrieval, and evaluating the framework against more existing methods to further strengthen the work.
After reviewing the authors' rebuttal, I would like to express appreciation for their response. Having considered the comments from other reviewers and the rebuttal, I reaffirm that this work is interesting, novel, and effectively demonstrated through the experimental study. Therefore, I choose to maintain my original rating.
