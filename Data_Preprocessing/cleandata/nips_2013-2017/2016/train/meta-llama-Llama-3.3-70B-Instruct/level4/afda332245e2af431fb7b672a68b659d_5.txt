This manuscript presents several key contributions, including: 
1. an enhancement of counting-based exploration utilizing a sequential density model; 
2. a straightforward yet effective modification to Deep Q-Networks (DQN); 
3. notable empirical results, particularly progress made towards solving Montezuma's Revenge; 
4. an association with intrinsic motivation, which is further elaborated upon below. 
Overall, the paper is of good quality and warrants acceptance. 
Notably, the formulation of pseudo-count appears to be novel, and the experiment involving Montezuma's Revenge convincingly demonstrates the method's effective application. 
However, there are two concerns that require the authors' attention and response: 
1. The primary claim, as emphasized in the title and line 206, pertains to the relationship between pseudo-count and information gain (IG), a concept rooted in intrinsic motivation literature. 
Although the stated relationship is technically sound, it seems disconnected from existing literature on intrinsic motivation. 
The term "Information gain" in this context defines a quantity that differs both technically and philosophically from the conventional understanding of Information gain. 
Specifically, IG in this paper is defined over the information gain of a mixture of sequential density models of state visitations, whereas traditionally, IG refers to the information gain of the "model of the environment" [1,2]. 
Philosophically, IG is introduced to create a "knowledge-seeking agent" aimed at gaining as much information about its environment as possible [2], a characteristic that the "IG" definition in this paper lacks. 
This discrepancy arises because changes in the behavior policy will always yield information gain in the state density model due to alterations in state visitation frequencies, without necessarily revealing new information about the environment. 
Thus, the "IG" used in this paper is distinct from the classic notion. 
The connection between "IG", pseudo-count, and intrinsic motivation is intriguing, but clarification is needed on how it "connects to intrinsic motivation" and "unifies count-based exploration and intrinsic motivation". 
2. The authors should discuss why pseudo-count is preferable to PG. 
Figure 2 in the appendix suggests that PG performs competitively without additional tweaking regarding the selection of the function used for transformation, whereas the inverse pseudo-count performs poorly with the /sqrt transformation. 
It is suspected that if similar transformations were applied to PG, it would outperform the tweaked pseudo-count bonus. 
The proof of Theorem 2 indicates that 1/pseudo-count >= e^PG - 1, suggesting that 1/pseudo-count is exponentially larger than PG, which might explain why PG is better-behaved than 1/pseudo-count. 
Clarification is needed on whether pseudo-count has unique advantages over PG or if they are largely interchangeable.
