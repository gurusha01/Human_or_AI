This paper establishes lower bounds on the learnability of partial attributes in samples, revisiting a previously explored scenario and reconciling its findings with existing results. The authors propose a generic algorithm, demonstrating an upper bound on the achievable error. The paper is well-structured, conveying significant results with clarity and precision, and provides a thorough review of prior knowledge in the field. However, the explanation for the first lower bound, particularly for the general cost function, could be improved by elucidating why learning fails in certain cases. While the mathematical lower limit is precisely defined, a more detailed analysis of the learning process's failure modes would offer valuable insights to researchers, potentially outweighing the importance of the precise bound itself.
