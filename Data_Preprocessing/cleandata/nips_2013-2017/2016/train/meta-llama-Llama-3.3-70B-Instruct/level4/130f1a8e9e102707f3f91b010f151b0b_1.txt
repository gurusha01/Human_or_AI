This manuscript presents a novel approach to identifying notable brain regions through a large-scale online dictionary learning framework, a topic of considerable interest. Nevertheless, the absence of theoretical analysis to demonstrate the algorithm's efficacy is a notable omission. Furthermore, the writing appears to lack rigor, suggesting that the authors did not thoroughly review the draft prior to submission. Specifically, the presence of unresolved comments, such as "146 XXX: I don't understand the switch between V and v," indicates a lack of careful editing, undermining the overall quality of the paper.
