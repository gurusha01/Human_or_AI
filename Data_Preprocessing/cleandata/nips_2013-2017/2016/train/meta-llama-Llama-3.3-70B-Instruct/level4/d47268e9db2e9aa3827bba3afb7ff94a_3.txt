The authors propose two methods for training the classical perceptron algorithm on a quantum computer, leveraging Grover's search algorithm. The core concept involves mapping the training process to a search for misclassified data points or separating hyperplanes within the version space, drawn from a uniform distribution over the data and a specified number of sampled hyperplanes. This concept is thoroughly explained, and the authors demonstrate that their algorithms achieve a quadratic speedup in terms of the required training data points and the margin between the two classes. In my view, this paper warrants presentation at the NIPS conference, at least as a poster, due to its rigorous investigation of a fundamentally interdisciplinary question with potential significant implications for machine learning. To the best of my knowledge, the proofs and arguments presented are accurate. Although experimental evaluation would have been beneficial in supporting the theoretical claims, the lack of a suitable device to execute the algorithm excuses the authors. The results are well-presented and analyzed, showcasing originality and novelty, particularly in the application of Grover's search algorithm and the resulting interdisciplinary insights. While the immediate impact may be limited due to the theoretical nature of the work, it has the potential to bridge multiple disciplines and could have a significant impact if a quantum computer is developed in the future. The authors generally succeed in expressing their ideas in an accessible language, relying on minimal prior knowledge of quantum mechanics, and the explanations and proofs are primarily based on mathematical arguments. However, some concepts, such as superposition and the resulting speedups, could benefit from additional explanation, and the lack of familiarity with basic quantum mechanics principles may hinder understanding for some readers. Nevertheless, given the page limit, the authors have done a reasonable job of introducing key quantum mechanics concepts.
