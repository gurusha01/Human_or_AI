This manuscript presents a spectral analysis of the Koopman operator in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHSs) and introduces a modal decomposition algorithm for this purpose. The authors also propose a robustification method and conduct numerical experiments to validate their approach, which can be seen as an extension of dynamical mode decomposition utilizing the kernel trick. A significant strength of the paper lies in its clear and organized presentation, effectively conveying complex theoretical concepts that underpin the methodology. The technical solidity of the paper is also commendable, although a deeper comparison with existing state-of-the-art methods is lacking. Nonetheless, the numerical experiments adequately demonstrate the method's usefulness, which, in my opinion, suffices. However, several concerns need to be addressed. A major issue arises in Section 3.1, particularly with Equation (7) and the proof of Theorem 1, which are not entirely clear. The similarity between Equation (7) and Equation (2) raises questions about the former's purpose. Furthermore, the consistency of Equation (7) is dubious since $KH$ is a linear operator from $H$ to itself, yet $\phi$ is not an element of $H$ but rather a function from $M$ to $H$. Clarification on this point and the application of $KH$ to scalar numbers (as mentioned in Line 149) is necessary, as $KH: H \to H$ does not apply to scalars. The assumptions in Theorem 1 appear stringent and lack explicitness, and the introduction of additional assumptions during the proof requires justification. It is also crucial to assess whether these assumptions can be easily satisfied. Lastly, minor errors include a typo in Line 55 ("the the") and an incorrect subscript in Line 153, where $\kappaj / \lambdaj$ should be $\kappai / \lambda_i$.
