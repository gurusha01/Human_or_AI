The paper presents a novel approach to estimating the risk of a model on unlabeled data and optimizing the model accordingly. This method relies on a structural assumption about the underlying data distribution, specifically that it can be decomposed into label-independent views. Initial experimental results demonstrate the potential of this approach. The paper is well-organized and enjoyable to read, tackling an intriguing problem with a notable method that does not require parametric assumptions about the underlying distribution. The core idea of imposing structural assumptions while utilizing discriminative models is elegant. 
The key insight lies in estimating risk from unlabeled data by encoding a structural assumption - that the data consists of three independent views - which implicitly provides information about class-conditional risks by examining the first three moments of the label vectors. This leads to a solvable system of equations to infer class-conditional risks. A similar technique is applied to estimate the gradient of the risk from unlabeled data, enabling the optimization of models like logistic regression without labels, under relatively mild assumptions. 
The approach draws from the tensor decomposition framework for latent variable models, such as the work by Anandkumar et al. in 2012, a field with which I am not intimately familiar. Therefore, I am unable to definitively assess the novelty of the presented approach, though preliminary research suggests it may offer a unique application of these methods to unsupervised risk estimation. The use of the three-view assumption to aid in estimating classification error is a compelling conceptual insight.
The technical content is clearly presented, with high-level intuition provided for the proofs of the main theorems. However, the reliance on Theorem 7 from Anandkumar et al. (2012) for the proofs of Theorem 1 and 2, and the extent of its contribution, is not entirely clear to me. Similarly, the sample complexity's precise form and its dependence on various parameters are explained but not fully intuitive. The paper's contribution is primarily theoretical, with preliminary experiments indicating usefulness in covariate shift scenarios and potential, though more erratic, benefits in semi-supervised learning.
Minor suggestions include clarifying the dimensionality of feature maps for the three views in logistic regression, specifying the version of multiclass hinge loss referred to, making explicit the dependence of M on theta in equations, elaborating on the distinction of the hidden Markov model extension from existing work like Anandkumar et al. (2012), clarifying the role of the seed model, specifying that the domain adaptation experiment is a case of covariate shift, and addressing the performance discrepancy for small values of a in domain adaptation experiments. Additionally, considering adjustments to reference formatting to ensure all citations are visible in the main body would be beneficial. Overall, the paper is interesting and well-written, offering a theoretical solution to a significant problem, though its novelty would benefit from assessment by a field expert.
