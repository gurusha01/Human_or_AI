This manuscript presents a coreset-based approach for dimensionality reduction via feature selection, specifically designed for extremely large sparse matrices. The authors employ an efficient computational algorithm, accompanied by a theoretical examination of the coreset's size and runtime boundaries. The experimental outcomes demonstrate the proposed method's efficacy and superiority. The manuscript is well-structured and clearly written, although some minor errors require attention, such as inconsistencies in notation, for instance, the constraint on $w_i$ in Definition 1 should be standardized for clarity and precision.
