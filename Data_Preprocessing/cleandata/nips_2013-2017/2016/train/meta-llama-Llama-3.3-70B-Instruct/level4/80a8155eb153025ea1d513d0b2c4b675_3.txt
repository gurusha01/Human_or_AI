The authors conducted an examination of the robust k-means algorithm, assessing its robustness and consistency. Their findings indicate that the presence of merely two outliers can compromise the algorithm's performance, although it remains resilient to outliers when the data exhibits a well-structured pattern. Notably, the authors demonstrated that the consistency property of robust k-means holds even when incorporating a non-convex penalty function. The manuscript tackles an intriguing and significant problem, with a sound analytical approach. However, Chapter 5 appears to be disconnected from the rest of the paper, and the experimental results lack thorough analysis. To further reinforce the conclusions, it is recommended that simulations be conducted to validate the previously obtained results regarding robustness and consistency, should experimental exploration be of interest.
