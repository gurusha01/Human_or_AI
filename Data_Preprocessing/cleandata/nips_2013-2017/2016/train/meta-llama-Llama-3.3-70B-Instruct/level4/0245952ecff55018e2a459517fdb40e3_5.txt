The authors propose an extension of generative moment-matching networks (GMMNs) by focusing on matching conditional distributions rather than joint distributions, leveraging a technique introduced by Song et al. in 2009 that embeds conditional distributions in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. The resulting algorithm, CGMMN, is empirically evaluated on multiple real-world datasets. However, the definition of $\hat{C}{Y|X}$ (Line90) appears to be incomplete, as it lacks terms related to the estimators of $\muX$ and $\muY$. Furthermore, the assumption that $\muX$ and $\muY$ are zero, implying that the data is already centered in the RKHS, is unconventional. Given the central role of $\hat{C}{Y|X}$ in CGMMN, clarification on this omission and its implications for gradient computation and experimental implementation is necessary. Although the approach is novel and well-structured, the experimental outcomes are somewhat underwhelming. In predictive performance, CGMMN yields higher error rates than the state-of-the-art CMMVA algorithm on both datasets. Moreover, without a comparison to other conditional generative methods, such as conditional generative adversarial nets, it remains uncertain whether CGMMN can generate superior samples. The manuscript also contains minor errors, including typos like "Frobeniu norm" (Line48), "an universal" (Line65), and "which the" (Line238). Following the author rebuttal, all concerns have been addressed, prompting a revision of the evaluation scores.
