This manuscript establishes a lower bound on the number of attributes required to attain specific precision levels when regression and classification models, utilizing various loss functions, have restricted access to attributes. The paper is well-structured and clearly presented, with the theoretical foundations and appendix appearing to be rigorously established. To further substantiate the claims, the inclusion of empirical results would be beneficial. Additionally, the appendix could be enhanced by providing an overview of the underlying concepts that drive the proofs, such as the rationale behind deriving the theorems from the disjoint nature of sets S1 and S2. A point of curiosity arises from the assumption that the elements of vector x are binary (0 or 1); it would be interesting to explore whether the outcomes differ if x is assumed to belong to the continuous domain [0, 1]^d.
