This paper presents a supervised extension of the word mover's distance, leveraging learning-based weights to enhance the distance metric. A comprehensive experimental evaluation is provided, demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach. It is commendable that the authors have built upon the word mover's distance framework, incorporating discriminative training to develop a domain-specific metric. The methodology is well-founded, clearly explained, and effectively conveyed with sufficient detail. The experimental results are extensive, covering multiple classification datasets and a broad range of baseline methods and features, with the proposed method achieving significant outperformance. Overall, this is a robust paper that warrants presentation at NIPS.
