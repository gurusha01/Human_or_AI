This paper presents an intriguing approach to establishing upper and lower bounds for Markov random field models that incorporate an additional submodular energy term, which is not factored. The methodology leverages two established techniques: (1) deriving upper and lower linear bounds for the submodular function, effectively transforming it into supplementary low-order factor terms, and (2) applying standard variational bounds to the resulting Markov random field. The combination of these methods yields bounds on the partition function of the original Markov random field. However, the practical utility of these bounds remains somewhat unclear, as the experiments primarily focus on the pseudomarginals of the upper bound rather than exploring applications of the partition function itself. It is anticipated that the upper bounds would be particularly beneficial in parameter learning scenarios, and clarification from the authors on this aspect would be appreciated. The connections to existing research are well-articulated and comprehensive. From a technical standpoint, it is suggested that the marginal polytope form of TRW in equation (3) be replaced with a decomposition form, such as a combination of spanning trees or dual decomposition, to potentially simplify the optimization process and enhance computational efficiency by converting the double-loop optimization into a single minimization problem.
