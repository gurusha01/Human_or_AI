This manuscript extends the "Generative Moment-Matching Networks" approach to enable conditional generation by developing a kernel embedding of the moments that define the conditional distribution, allowing them to be optimized using the same framework as the unconditional version. The proposed model achieves competitive results in predictive modeling, contextual generation, and distilling predictions from a Bayesian model, demonstrating its effectiveness. From a technical standpoint, the paper appears to be sound, with well-presented proposals, although a detailed examination of all equations was not conducted. In terms of originality, while conditioning the generative moment matching framework is a logical extension, the derivation of the empirical estimator is non-trivial and not immediately apparent, suggesting that the paper contributes novel and useful ideas. The framework's applicability is facilitated by its straightforward implementation, as illustrated in Algorithm 1, making it a valuable resource for researchers interested in deep generative models or the distillation of complex statistical processes. The manuscript is well-structured, clear, and readable, with a comprehensive appendix that provides additional details on the methods and experiments, further enhancing its usefulness.
