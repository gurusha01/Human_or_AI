The authors propose novel criteria for l1-sparse support recovery under low noise levels in the context of non-smooth regression losses, specifically l\infty and l1. Historically, support recovery research has focused on fixed MSE (l2^2) loss while exploring various non-smooth penalties, from Fuchs' l1 penalty to Vaiter et al.'s partly smooth penalties. In contrast, this work retains the simple l1 penalty and investigates the impact of altering the loss function, examining l\infty and l1 losses, both of which are polyhedral. The authors provide proofs for both cases, accompanied by confirmatory experimental results. This paper introduces a new generalization of l1 support recovery criteria to other loss functions, which are valuable in regression: l\infty corresponds to uniform noise, while l1 corresponds to sparse noise. By doing so, it reveals the functionality of certain quantities obtained in the classic MSE + l1 setting, which were previously too specific to be named. The proofs in the main paper are sound. However, my primary concerns regard the paper's readability. This paper took the longest to review due to its mathematically rigorous yet dense presentation, which underestimates the contribution's non-trivial convex analysis and lacks concessions to the reader, such as intuitive explanations or elucidating figures. Specifically, I suggest:
* Adding a small diagram to illustrate the regression problem in 1D or 2D, particularly since l1 and l\infty losses are equal or equivalent in these settings.
* Clarifying the transitions between general dual pairs α, β, polyhedral losses, and specific losses like l_\infty, and providing intuition for the general (α, β) case.
* Improving the introduction of notations, such as defining \tildeΦ and S before their use, and providing quick intuitions for assumptions like |S| = |J|.
* Reorganizing formulae to introduce symbols before their use and adding intermediate steps to facilitate understanding, particularly in sections like l139.
* Providing more intuition on Lagrange multipliers vβ and pβ, including their geometric interpretation and the space they inhabit.
* Adding diagrams to illustrate the polytope defined by the regression constraint, which could help readers understand the intersection of seminorm balls.
* Addressing minor errors, such as typos and formatting issues, to enhance the paper's overall readability.
