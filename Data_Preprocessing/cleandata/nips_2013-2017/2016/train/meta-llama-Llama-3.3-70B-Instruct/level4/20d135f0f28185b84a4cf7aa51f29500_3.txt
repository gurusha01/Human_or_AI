This manuscript presents a straightforward approach to addressing the multiple choice learning problem in the context of deep neural networks, an area where existing solutions are not directly applicable. The authors demonstrate that incorporating a winner-takes-the-gradient layer during backpropagation enables the seamless integration of learner training with the assignment problem in an ensemble setting. The experimental evaluations underscore the efficacy of this method across a broad spectrum of tasks, including image classification, image segmentation, and image captioning. 
The strengths of this paper include its relevance to the NIPS community, given the significance of the multiple choice learning problem in deep learning. The proposed methodology is commendable for its simplicity. Furthermore, the experiments are comprehensive, covering three distinct tasks. 
However, there are notable weaknesses. A major concern is the paper's emphasis on "diversity" without explicitly enforcing it in the model. This omission is particularly disappointing given the prominence of "diversity" in the paper's title and motivation. Additionally, the proposed solution can be seen as an incremental advancement, especially considering the relaxation proposed by Guzman et al.
Several minor suggestions are also worth considering. The abstract's first sentence could benefit from a rewrite. The emphasis on "diversity" should be tempered to reflect the model's actual capabilities more accurately. There are also a few typographical errors, such as the incorrect use of "f" instead of "g" in the phrase "we fixed the form of" on line 108, and an extra period in the middle of a sentence on line 115.
One question remains regarding the baseline MCL with deep learning: How did the authors ensure that each network converged to a reasonable result? Prematurely terminating the learners could significantly impact the ensemble's performance, and clarity on this point would strengthen the paper's conclusions.
