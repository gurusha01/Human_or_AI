This manuscript examines the optimization problem of minimizing the L1 norm of x subject to a constraint on the norm of the difference between Φx and y, where the norm is either L1 or L-infinity. The authors provide a dual characterization of the solution set, demonstrating that recovery of the optimal x's structure is achievable under certain conditions. However, given the extensive existing literature on sparse recovery in linear systems, it is crucial to contextualize this work within the NIPS framework and justify its contribution, which, in my opinion, the paper fails to do adequately. The claimed novelty of the proof techniques, which involve constructing a dual vector to optimize the problem under specific noise conditions on w (where y = Φx + w), enabling sign recovery and structure recovery, is not entirely convincing. The dual witness technique has been employed in the analysis of convex relaxations of sparsity problems for many years, notably by Donoho, Candes, Tao, and Wainwright, making it unclear what genuinely new insights this paper offers. Furthermore, the experimental evaluation is somewhat lacking in detail and clarity. The specifics of the experiment, such as the presence and distribution of noise in the observation of y, are not clearly stated. The experiments seemingly fail to investigate how different noise distributions on w affect the analysis, which was purportedly a motivation for this work. The results presented, particularly Figure 2, suggest that classical L2 loss techniques may be superior, but it is unclear whether this outcome is due to the noise distribution used or an inherent limitation of using L1 or L-infinity norms. Overall, the experiments do not provide conclusive evidence to support the paper's claims, leaving the reader without a clear understanding of the significance and implications of the results.
