This paper presents a solution to the domain adaptation problem where the target domain data labels are unknown, achieving this through an iterative process of transduction and adaptation. The experimental results showcase the efficacy of the proposed approach. However, several aspects warrant further clarification. Firstly, the Structured Consistency term may inadvertently reduce the similarity between instances of the same label, potentially hindering target domain classification. It is essential to explain how the proposed method mitigates this issue. Secondly, the hyper-parameter settings, particularly lambda in equation 1, likely have a significant impact on performance. The authors should provide a sensitivity analysis of the proposed solution with respect to varying lambda values and also examine the effect of alpha. Thirdly, given the alternating nature of transduction and adaptation, it is crucial to disclose the typical number of iterations required for convergence. Since each iteration involves training a Deep Neural Network (DNN), with N iterations necessitating N rounds of DNN training, the process appears to be computationally intensive. Therefore, a comparison of the training times for different methods would be beneficial to fully assess the practicality of the proposed framework.
