This manuscript presents an unsupervised risk estimation approach grounded in two primary assumptions regarding the feature vector x = (x1, x2, …, xv): firstly, that the class-conditional distributions can be factored into a product of individual distributions for each xi, and secondly, that the loss function is separable, comprising one term for each xi. The authors describe the first assumption as "surprisingly weak," yet it appears to be quite strong, particularly in the context of Gaussian class-conditional distributions, which would necessitate block-diagonal covariances. A more detailed justification of this assumption, potentially through its relation to multi-view learning, would be beneficial. The introduction of a real-world example to motivate this assumption would also enhance the manuscript. Furthermore, the second assumption seems to preclude the use of commonly employed loss functions, such as hinge and logistic losses, due to their non-linear and non-separable nature. For instance, the logistic model presented in Example 1 of the paper takes the form θ^T (φ1(x1, y) + φ2(x2, y) + φ3(x3, y)), whereas the standard logistic model for a linear classifier is y  w^T x = y  (w1^T x1 + w2^T x2 + w3^T x3), which cannot be represented in the form of Example 1 unless the φi functions incorporate learnable parameters. Example 2 proposes a separable form of hinge loss, which, although accommodating the authors' approach, differs from the conventional hinge loss. Motivating these modifications within the context of multi-view learning could strengthen the manuscript. The paper claims that previous work in this area is limited to handling 0/1-loss, whereas the main contribution of this manuscript is the consideration of the aforementioned framework with continuous losses. To maintain computational tractability, the authors propose a method of moments approach, given that the losses are continuous rather than discrete counts. Specifically, under the "3-view" assumption, the approach involves finding a decomposition of a third-order tensor. The manuscript is generally well-written, and the application of tensor decomposition methods to unsupervised risk estimation appears novel, although the tensor-based machinery used to prove the main theorem is relatively standard. The manuscript would benefit from a more thorough motivation of the 3-view assumptions, including conditional independence of views and separability of loss, potentially through the inclusion of a compelling real-world application example in the introduction.
