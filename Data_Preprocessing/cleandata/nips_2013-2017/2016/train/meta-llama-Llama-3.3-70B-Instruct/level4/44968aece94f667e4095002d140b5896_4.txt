This paper examines a dynamic pricing scenario where a seller offers an infinite set of identical items to T bidders arriving over time, with the goal of minimizing regret compared to the optimal posted price in hindsight, despite the strategic behavior of bidders. To avoid complex game-theoretic issues, the analysis focuses on seller strategies that post prices a fixed number of days, denoted as \tau, in advance, where \tau represents the longest window a bidder remains present. The authors establish upper and lower bounds of T^(2/3) on regret, leveraging a no-regret algorithm that maintains fixed prices for T^(1/3) steps at a time. The model and ideas presented are compelling, and the paper effectively addresses these concepts. However, some minor issues with presentation, including typos and an abstract that could be improved, were noted. Furthermore, the results build upon previous work, which somewhat limits their novelty. A key finding of interest is the significant impact of bidder patience on optimal regret, transitioning from sqrt(T) to T^(2/3) as patience increases from 0 to 1, with the proof simplifying to this foundational case regardless of initial bidder patience. The upper and lower bound concepts are also noteworthy, and the discussion section provides valuable insights. Following the author's response and discussion, my overall assessment remains unchanged.
