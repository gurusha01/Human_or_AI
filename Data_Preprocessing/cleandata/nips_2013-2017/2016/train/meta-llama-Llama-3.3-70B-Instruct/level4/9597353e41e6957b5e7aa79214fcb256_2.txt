This paper presents a valuable addition to the semi-supervised clustering literature, offering a compelling model from a learning theory perspective. The proposed clustering model is notable for its ability to not only receive a clustering instance and a distance function but also to inquire about "same cluster" queries, which determine whether two data points belong to the same cluster. This innovative approach combines access to both a distance function and a query oracle, a dual capability that has not been typical in previous algorithms. The model enables interesting outcomes in a semi-supervised clustering context, primarily through the introduction of a margin property characterized by a parameter that simplifies the clustering instance by strengthening the assumption. A key finding is the existence of a sharp threshold for this parameter in the context of k-means. The algorithm itself is relatively straightforward, involving sampling and binary search phases. A significant contribution of this paper is the demonstration that certain regimes, which are NP-hard without queries, become tractable with the additional assumption, leveraging the relationship between the proposed notion, center proximity, and the careful transfer of lower bounds. One potential concern with this model is that its greatest utility over unsupervised methods may lie in instances where the desired clustering is most ambiguous for the user, potentially limiting its practical application. Nonetheless, the direction of this model and its learning theory contributions are commendable and represent a positive advancement in the field.
