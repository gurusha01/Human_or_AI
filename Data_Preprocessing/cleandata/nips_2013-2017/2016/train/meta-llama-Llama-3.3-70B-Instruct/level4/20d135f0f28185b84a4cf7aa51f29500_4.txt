The authors propose a stochastic gradient descent approach integrated with Multiple Choice Learning (MCL). They assert that their framework offers advantages across various tasks, including classification, segmentation, and captioning. 
1. This manuscript demonstrates that the sMCL method presents incremental novelty. While the motivation behind MCL is well-articulated, it cannot be regarded as a novel contribution of this study. Essentially, this work adapts the approach outlined in [8] to a neural network framework with minor modifications.
2. The paper's writing quality is subpar. Notably, the technical section (Section 3) is concise, spanning only one page. A critical omission is a detailed comparison of the proposed framework with alternative training methods, which are commonly employed when training multiple tasks concurrently.
3. The authors conduct experiments across a range of computer vision tasks, such as classification, image segmentation, and captioning. However, these experiments are limited by the absence of robust baselines, and the observed performance improvements are marginal. To convincingly demonstrate the efficacy of their framework, the authors should consider conducting additional experiments on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset, allowing for a comparison with more stringent baselines.
