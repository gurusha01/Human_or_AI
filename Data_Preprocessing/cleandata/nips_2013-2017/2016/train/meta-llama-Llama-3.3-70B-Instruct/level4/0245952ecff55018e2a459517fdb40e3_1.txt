This manuscript presents a neural network methodology grounded in a conditional maximum mean discrepancy criterion. The proposed approach is assessed on standard, albeit small, benchmark tasks to evaluate its discriminative and generative capabilities. Overall, the work constitutes an intriguing contribution to the deep learning research subset concentrated on constructing generative models. The manuscript's clarity is satisfactory, although the mathematical components can be challenging to comprehend at certain points, a common issue in this field. The experimental tasks, while limited in scope, are comparable to those in recent studies within this domain. Given the computationally intensive nature of the model training algorithm, it would be beneficial to include commentary in the experimental section regarding the training duration in comparison to existing methods such as DSN. The inclusion of reference code for the experiments would significantly enhance the manuscript's strength, as the absence of such details may hinder practitioners from accurately replicating the evaluated models based on the information provided in the model section.
