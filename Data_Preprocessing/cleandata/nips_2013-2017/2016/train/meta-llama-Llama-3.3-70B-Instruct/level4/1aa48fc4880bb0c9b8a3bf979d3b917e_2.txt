This study addresses the convex-concave saddle point problem and builds upon recent variance reduction techniques to solve it, providing a convergence analysis for the proposed methods. The authors demonstrate that these methods can be efficiently accelerated using an extended catalyst framework. Additionally, they extend their approach to monotone operators and include numerical results. However, the assumption of strong convexity in both the primal and dual problems is overly restrictive; it would be more reasonable to assume strong convexity in either the primal or the dual problem. Furthermore, the inclusion of more numerical examples would enhance the robustness of the findings.
