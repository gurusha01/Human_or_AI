The authors address the issue of evaluating the reliability of MCMC outputs and comparing the efficiency of various MCMC schemes by utilizing the upper and lower stochastic bounds on the log marginal likelihood provided by the Bidirectional Monte Carlo (BMC) procedure. The proposed approach involves selecting the MCMC scheme that yields the tightest BMC stochastic bounds for a given computational effort. However, a significant challenge arises from the requirement of an exact sample from the target measure to produce a valid stochastic upper bound. To overcome this, the authors propose heuristics, including performing diagnostics on the posterior generated by synthetic data rather than actual data, leveraging the ease of producing good approximate samples for such posteriors. The methodology is then tested on several examples. 
The concept of using stochastic lower bounds from Bidirectional Monte Carlo for MCMC convergence diagnostics is intriguing, as it attempts to provide theoretically justified diagnostic tools. Although the methodology appears to be tailored to specific samplers and focuses solely on marginal likelihood-based diagnostics, it still holds value. Nevertheless, the implementation is marred by several drawbacks stemming from the heuristic approach to circumvent the need for an exact sample from the posterior. 
Three notable drawbacks are identified. Firstly, the authors assume prior knowledge of a representative hyperparameter value, which presupposes convergence of the algorithm used to find this value and that the posterior can be adequately summarized by a single value. Both assumptions are strong and lack general justification. Secondly, they assume that the posterior induced by synthetic data has similar MCMC convergence properties to the original posterior, an assumption that requires careful justification, particularly in cases of model mis-specification. This seems to sidestep the difficulty posed by Bidirectional Monte Carlo by essentially altering the problem under consideration. Thirdly, the authors optimistically assume that starting from the representative hyperparameter value allows the MCMC algorithm to quickly draw an almost exact sample from the posterior, which may not always be the case. 
The proposed methodology thus relies on several assumptions closely related to the convergence properties of the original MCMC algorithm, which is the very aspect under assessment. Although Section 5.1 presents simple examples where these issues do not seem to affect the conclusions, these examples are not convincing enough to guarantee that the recognized issues will not be critical in more complex scenarios. The authors criticize previous diagnostic tools for their potential failure in multimodal cases or when summary statistics are insufficiently expressive. It is essential for the authors to explain why their method can perform better in such scenarios and provide supporting evidence. Furthermore, simulations comparing their method to commonly used diagnostic methods would be beneficial to demonstrate its reliability and advantages over existing tools.
