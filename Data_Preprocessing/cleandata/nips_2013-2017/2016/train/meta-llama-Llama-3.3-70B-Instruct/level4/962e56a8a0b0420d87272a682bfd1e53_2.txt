This manuscript presents a systematic examination of the impact of recommender systems (RS) on rating values, with the primary objective of developing a method to infer the true, unbiased rating matrix from the observed rating matrix, based on certain plausible assumptions. The authors propose a truncated-SVD algorithm to recover the true rating matrix and introduce a score to quantify the influence of RS on the rating matrix. Although the authors conduct extensive validation of their proposed algorithm using synthetic and real-world datasets, I have concerns that the assumptions underlying their approach may not accurately model real-world RS. Specifically, the problem of inferring the true rating matrix from the observed one is inherently ill-posed, requiring somewhat unrealistic assumptions. My concerns regarding these assumptions are as follows: 
1. Assumption 1 is overly restrictive, as popular recommendation algorithms, such as Bayesian matrix factorization, cannot be adequately represented by Eq. (2). If a real-world RS employs a complex algorithm not covered by Assumption 1, it is challenging to assess the quality of the extracted true rating matrix. 
2. Assumption 2 utilizes a single Bernoulli random variable to approximate the indicator matrix, implying that all users follow recommended ratings in a uniform manner, which is an unrealistic scenario. Therefore, I believe that Assumptions 1 and 2 are too stringent to accurately model real-world RS.
Additionally, I have questions regarding the score defined in Eq. (10), which aims to measure the impact of RS on ratings. I find the proposed score to be unnecessarily complex, lacking clear justification. For instance, a simpler approach could involve using the distance between observed ratings and a straight line as a score to measure RS influence. If normalization is necessary, a sigmoid function could be employed to properly normalize the distance. 
The research question addressed in this paper is intriguing and has potential applications in scenarios where the true, unbiased rating matrix is required. However, the inference of this matrix from the observed one is a complex problem that necessitates strong assumptions, which may not always hold in real-world RS.
