This manuscript investigates the parameter estimation problem for generalized linear models in scenarios where the observation count, n, significantly exceeds the predictor count, p. The authors propose an estimation algorithm grounded in the observation that generalized linear model parameters approximate proportionality to the ordinary least squares solution. The manuscript is well-organized and clearly written, with derivations that appear to be accurate. Furthermore, experimental results demonstrate the proposed algorithm's substantial outperformance of standard methodologies. Overall, the paper presents a robust contribution, and based on its merits, I support its acceptance.
