This manuscript proposes a methodology for learning Support Vector Machines (SVMs) aimed at dimensionality reduction, referred to as LADDER, which stands for Large Margin Discriminant Dimensionality Reduction. However, the abbreviation could be clarified for better understanding. A minor typo is noted in line 38, where "than" should be replaced with "that". Furthermore, several mathematical notations appear to be incorrect and require correction. The term "predictor" used throughout the manuscript is ambiguous and should be explicitly defined, potentially as a strong learner or weak learner, to avoid confusion. Specifically, in equation 7, the variables "l" and "c_l" are not clearly defined and need explanation. Additionally, the notation "dY" in line 178 seems incorrect, and the small letter "m" in line 179 lacks explanation. The function "f(x)" mentioned in line 89 should be clarified as a real-valued function. Most importantly, the manuscript needs to provide a detailed explanation on why the proposed algorithm is optimized and functions correctly from an optimization perspective.
