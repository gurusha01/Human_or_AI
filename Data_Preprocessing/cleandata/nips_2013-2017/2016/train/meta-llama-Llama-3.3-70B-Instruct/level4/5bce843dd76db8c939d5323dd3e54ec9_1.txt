This paper proposes an enhancement to Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks by introducing a "time gate" that is regulated solely by time and learned parameters, with each LSTM cell possessing its own unique time gate. The operation of the time gate is such that when it is closed, the corresponding cell remains unchanged. The novelty of this approach is commendable. 
From a technical standpoint, two key aspects warrant consideration: 
1. The formulation of the time gate, as presented, may not be optimal. An alternative could be to define the time gate as a continuous function of time, potentially a piece-wise linear function that oscillates between specific values (e.g., alpha, 1, alpha, 0, alpha, 1, etc.), which might offer improved performance.
2. Evaluating the model on a speech recognition benchmark would provide valuable insights into its capabilities.
The paper's novelty lies in its consideration of asynchronous event processing, a noteworthy contribution. The potential impact of this work is significant, as it inspires further research and proposals for improvement. The results demonstrate substantial improvements on the tasks undertaken. 
However, one aspect that requires clarification is whether the reported twenty-fold reduction in runtime compute cost is theoretical or based on actual hardware measurements, as this distinction has significant implications for the practical applicability of the proposed enhancement.
