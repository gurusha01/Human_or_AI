The authors introduce the concept of micro clustering, where models exhibit this property if their cluster sizes increase sublinearly with the size of the data. This notion is well-motivated by the entity resolution problem, which involves identifying duplicate records in noisy databases. The authors demonstrate that traditional mixture models for clustering do not satisfy the micro clustering property and propose a new class of partition models. They focus on two specific models within this class and provide empirical evidence that these models satisfy the micro clustering property. Additionally, they develop a Gibbs sampling algorithm for posterior inference. The authors compare their proposed models with the Dirichlet process and Pitman-Yor process mixture models using four realistic simulated datasets. The results show that the proposed models perform better in simulated de-duplication scenarios, but their performance is worse and similar across the four models in noisy datasets with a small number of features. This paper is interesting and well-written, and the proposed models are well-motivated by the entity resolution problem. However, my primary concern lies with the introduced class of "Flexible models for Microclustering" (FMMC). Specifically, I expected a proof that this class of models satisfies the micro clustering property, but such a proof is not provided in the manuscript. Furthermore, the authors claim that the partition model induced by the Dirichlet process is a special case, but this seems confusing given that the parameters μ and κ depend on the sample size N, which is not the case in the definition provided. The authors also discuss how the Dirichlet process does not satisfy the micro clustering property, which raises questions about the appropriateness of the name for this class of models and the motivation behind introducing it. To strengthen the paper, the authors could provide a theorem stating the conditions under which the micro clustering property holds for the parameters μ and κ. Moreover, I was disappointed that the micro clustering property was only shown to hold empirically for the two proposed models, NBNB and NBD. The paper could be improved by demonstrating that the choice of μ and κ for these models satisfies the theorem. Several minor comments and corrections are also necessary: 
1. On page 3, equation 3 and line 85 should be revised to replace κ|C|N with κ|CN|.
2. On page 3, line 88 should be revised to "We now present two flexible FMMC" by removing the word "more".
3. On page 5, lines 200-201 should be revised to clarify that the authors are referring to the posterior expected number of clusters and the posterior expected value of δ_l, and to specify whether they are using posterior expectation to estimate these quantities.
4. On page 5, line 201, the authors should clarify whether they are assuming a common δ across l or taking an average, as the reported posterior expected value of δ_l is a single number, whereas I expected L different values.
5. On page 6, Figure 1 should be revised to include labels for panels a, b, c, and d.
