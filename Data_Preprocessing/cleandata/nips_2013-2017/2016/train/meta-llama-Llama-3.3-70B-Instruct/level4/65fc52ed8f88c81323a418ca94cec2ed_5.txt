This paper presents an iterative approach to enhancing similarity measures, commencing with a basic similarity metric and refining it through successive iterations. In each cycle, the authors form cliques of similar samples and determine optimal training batches by solving an optimization problem, which are then utilized to train a convolutional neural network (CNN). The resulting similarities are primarily evaluated on human pose similarity tasks, yielding competitive results, with additional testing on the PASCAL VOC dataset. Although the technical aspects, including formulations, are sound, the problem introduction and methodology lack clarity. A more comprehensive overview of the problem, followed by a detailed, step-by-step explanation, would be beneficial. The methodology appears somewhat ad-hoc, comprising multiple components without a thorough evaluation of each component's individual impact. A more rigorous motivation for the selection of each component, potentially through comparisons with simpler alternatives, would strengthen the approach. For example, comparing the proposed batch assignment method to random batch assignments or simpler methods on at least one task would provide valuable insights. The experimental results demonstrate promising outcomes for unsupervised pose similarity learning, indicating the potential of the proposed method.
