This paper presents a theoretical bound on the tradeoff between budget and fidelity in label crowdsourcing, leveraging rate-distortion theory and the channel coding theorem to derive an information-theoretic limit. The derivation of this bound is technically sound. If this represents the first application of rate-distortion theory and channel coding theorem to crowdsourcing, it could constitute a significant contribution to the field. Nevertheless, the novelty and practical implications of this work remain uncertain due to the relatively straightforward nature of the derivation and the potential looseness of the bound. A major concern lies in the difference between the channel coding problem, where codebook design has considerable flexibility (e.g., repetition, Hamming, convolutional, RS, LDPC codes), and the crowdsourcing scenario, where designing the sequence of channel inputs $u^n$ to enhance error-correcting capabilities is less clear. Unlike channel coding, where assigning the same query to the same worker multiple times is feasible, in crowdsourcing, this approach would violate the iid assumption due to workers likely providing the same answer to the same query repeatedly. This distinction underscores fundamental constraints on encoding schemes in crowdsourcing that are not present in traditional channel coding, potentially rendering the proposed bound overly loose. A comparison between the performance of state-of-the-art methods and the derived information-theoretic bound would be beneficial. Additionally, several minor points warrant attention: 
- The minimization in equation (8) should be clarified to be over $C$ and $C'$ with the constraint $E[d(Z,\hat{Z})] \leq D^t$.
- The proof for Theorem 4 could be more detailed.
- In Theorem 4, given that $\ln(1-q) < 0$, it should be specified whether $\epsilon_S$ is larger than $\hat{\epsilon}$.
- The appearance of $H_M(E(\epsilon))$ in equation (17) requires explanation or a citation to prior work to justify its inclusion.
