The challenge at hand is assessing the risk of a classifier or regression function utilizing solely unlabeled data, a problem initially proposed by Donmez in 2010. The current paper posits that each object has at least three distinct "views," which are conditionally independent given their labels, and under additional assumptions, it derives certain performance guarantees. However, my primary concern lies in the lack of clarity regarding the main contribution or improvement over Donmez's 2010 work. Notably, Donmez also introduced the concept of conditional independence, albeit in the context of predictors rather than "views." In the present paper, predictors are decomposed view-wise, implying their predictions are conditionally independent, which appears to strengthen the assumption beyond that in Donmez's work. It is unclear whether conditional independence of views, as opposed to predictors' outputs, is strictly necessary. Furthermore, the precise nature of the improvement over Donmez's 2010 work remains ambiguous. Perhaps the authors could provide clarification on this point in their rebuttal. I acknowledge that the problem's uniqueness may contribute to my misunderstanding, though I view this uniqueness as an advantage. Additionally, the application of the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) setting seems misleading, as it typically requires multiple independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) time series to uphold the i.i.d. assumption, whereas HMMs usually involve inference from a single time series. Following further review and consideration of other critiques, the novelty of the paper has become clearer, leading me to withdraw my initial objection regarding its original contribution.
