This paper examines the recovery of supports from noisy linear observations of an underlying model by solving an $\ell1$ norm minimization problem, subject to data fidelity constraints expressed as $\ell\alpha$ norms of the error. The authors provide support recovery guarantees for this optimization problem, with proofs presented for specific cases involving $\ell1$ and $\ell\infty$ constraints, as well as general insights for any $\ell\alpha$ constraint where $\alpha \geq 1$. The paper's presentation is of high quality, with Figure 2 offering valuable intuition into the behavior of $\ell\alpha$ constraints. A potential extension could involve plotting $1/\alpha$ against $k$ in Figure 2, which may reveal symmetric behavior around $\alpha = 2$, given that $1/\alpha$ seems a natural choice for understanding $\ell\alpha$ norms. In the numerical experiments, discussing how the choice of $x0$ (with equal nonzero absolute values) influences the results would be beneficial. Several minor corrections are suggested: on line 118, rephrase "is often coined" to "is coined as" or "is often referred to as"; in section 2, consider naming the two equations (FO) in the text for clarity; on line 139, remove boldface from "r"; on line 186, the first sentence could be rephrased for better readability; and finally, improving the spacing for figure captions would enhance the overall readability.
