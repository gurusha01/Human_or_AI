This paper presents a compilation of minor results, including the intractability of multiplication and marginalization for arithmetic circuits (ACs) with specific properties, as well as the introduction of a newly defined subclass of ACs, known as PSDDs. The primary focus of the paper lies in the examination of PSDDs, yielding two key contributions: the development of a polynomial-time algorithm for PSDD multiplication, which addresses a limitation of general tractable circuits, and the construction of a corresponding arithmetic circuit that exhibits both decomposability and determinism. These advancements lead to a novel method for compiling probabilistic graphical models, which the authors compare to existing methods. Although the paper's results and algorithms appear clever and novel, to the best of my knowledge, their contribution to the literature seems marginal. Several concerns arise, including the inadequate description of the PSDD multiplication algorithm, with certain steps lacking clarity, and the absence of supplementary material to address these ambiguities. Furthermore, the comparison with other models in the literature raises questions regarding the method's performance across different network choices, warranting a discussion on the types of networks for which this method yields significant improvements. Notably, the compilation time, which seemingly remains unchanged, is barely mentioned. The paper's writing quality is also compromised by recurring errors, such as inconsistent verb conjugations (e.g., p3 l105, p7 l215) and reference inconsistencies (e.g., p5 l155, p5 l161). Additionally, it is unclear whether the projection illustrated in Figure 4 functions similarly to marginalization over remaining nodes and their parents in DAGs, prompting further inquiry.
