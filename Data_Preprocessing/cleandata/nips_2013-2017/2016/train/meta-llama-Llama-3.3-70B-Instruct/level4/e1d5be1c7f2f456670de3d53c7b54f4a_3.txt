This manuscript explores the realm of contextual combinatorial semi-bandit problems and introduces novel learning algorithms that leverage supervised learning oracles, addressing both scenarios where weights are known and unknown. The authors derive regret bounds for both cases, as outlined in Theorem 1 and Theorem 2, and provide preliminary experimental results in Section 6. Overall, the paper is intriguing and meets the standards for a NIPS poster, particularly as it pioneers the investigation of contextual combinatorial semi-bandits with unknown weights. However, there are areas that could be enhanced, and refining these aspects would strengthen the manuscript: 
1. The regret bound of O(T^{2/3}) in Theorem 2 is somewhat disappointing, as one might anticipate a bound of O(T^{1/2}). It would be beneficial if the authors could discuss whether this bound is inherent or a result of the analysis, pinpointing the specific steps that lead to this less-than-optimal bound.
2. The presentation of Algorithm 2 is challenging to follow. A rewritten explanation and motivation for this algorithm would significantly improve clarity.
3. A recent publication directly pertinent to contextual combinatorial semi-bandits has been overlooked. The authors should consider citing this work to enhance the paper's context and relevance: @article{wen2014efficient, title={Efficient learning in large-scale combinatorial semi-bandits}, author={Wen, Zheng and Kveton, Branislav and Ashkan, Azin}, journal={http://jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v37/wen15.html}, year={2014} }.
