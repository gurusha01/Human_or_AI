This manuscript introduces a novel approach to data embedding that preserves the geometric structure of the data, as defined by a Riemannian metric on the tensor space of each point. The authors propose a gradient descent-based method to optimize this non-convex objective. However, the claim that the Riemannian metric is superior for geometry preservation, compared to existing embeddings [3, 4, 12, 19, 20], lacks motivation and intuitive explanation. Furthermore, the authors assert that their method differs from previous approaches by not providing a one-shot mapping, yet they overlook the existence of methods like t-SNE, which also employ gradient descent for deriving embeddings. Additionally, the manuscript fails to demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on a sufficient number of large-scale datasets, nor do they compare their embeddings to existing methods or evaluate their practicality in terms of runtime. 
The initialization used in Figure 1 is already remarkably similar to the true shape, raising questions about the algorithm's performance without such prior information. The plot of MSE/loss versus sigma is of poor quality, and it would be beneficial to see intervals for MSE and loss drawn from multiple randomized initializations, as well as more points tested for sigma. 
Figure 2 is poorly formatted, making it difficult to discern that the same embeddings are used for two datasets. The use of top-left, top-right, etc., is confusing, and the figure would benefit from labeled sections (A-G) with corresponding legend entries. The line plots are not of publication quality, and it would be helpful to have more points sampled on the X-axis or replicates of each condition to provide an interval, as the observed trends may be an artifact of individual runs.
Figure 3 presents an incomplete analysis, showcasing a real dataset with superficial improvements in analysis using the proposed method. However, the authors fail to provide a physics-based analysis that would demonstrate their method's ability to enhance the analysis of such data for scientists.
