The paper presents an approach to accelerate tensor CP decomposition using ALS by approximating each least squares problem through leverage score sampling. By leveraging the structure of the design matrix in each least squares problem, which is a Khatri-Rao product of the other tensor modes, the authors efficiently sample rows based on their leverage scores and solve the problem without explicitly forming the Khatri-Rao product. Theoretical results are provided on the required number of samples to achieve an additive approximation guarantee for each least squares problem. As errors do not accumulate across ALS iterations, the approximation requirements are relatively mild, and experimental results demonstrate speedups of up to 30x with negligible loss of accuracy. The paper's ideas and contributions are noteworthy, and it is anticipated that such speedups will be applied to other areas, given ALS's widespread utility. Although sampling proportional to leverage scores is not novel, this paper innovates effectively in its application, meeting the NIPS standards. However, the presentation can be substantially improved by ensuring that symbols are defined before use (e.g., R, n) and correcting the listed typos. Furthermore, the assertion in line 160 requires a proof or citation for clarity. The typos to be corrected include: Line 5 (redundant "the" before "Khatri-Rao"), Line 13 ("significantly speedups" to "significant speedups"), Line 22 ("from the tensor data" to "from tensor data"), Line 25 ("has became" to "has become"), Line 26 ("tensor analytic" to "tensor analytics"), Line 52 ("SPASL" to "SPALS"), Line 62 ("approximates" to "approximating"), Line 149 (correcting the tensor product notation), Line 163 ("matrix" to "matrices"), Line 202 ("spare" to "sparse" and removing the redundant "the").
