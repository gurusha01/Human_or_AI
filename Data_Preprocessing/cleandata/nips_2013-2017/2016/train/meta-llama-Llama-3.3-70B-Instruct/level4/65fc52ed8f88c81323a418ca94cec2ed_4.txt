This manuscript presents a deep learning-based approach to examplar learning, specifically addressing the challenge of having only one positive example per class and multiple negative examples. The authors propose a method for batch selection in CNN training, which yields competitive results in experiments. However, the discussion on supervised learning formulations for similarity learning (lines 71-73) overlooks the fact that CNN training with minibatches does not necessarily lead to linear scaling of training time with the number of tuples or triples, as the training time is influenced by the conditional information content in the data, which typically grows sublinearly with the amount of data points. Furthermore, the issue of imbalance between one exemplar and many negatives (line 93) can be mitigated using importance-weighted gradients or a reweighted objective, which can also address the concern about biased gradients due to limited data (lines 110-111). The paper is well-written, but in my view, it lacks a clear introduction to examplar-based learning, failing to concisely articulate the problem being addressed by the end of page 3. The experimental results on posture analysis and pose estimation are promising, but due to my limited familiarity with the problem domain and related literature, I am unable to accurately evaluate the significance and quality of the contributions made by this paper.
