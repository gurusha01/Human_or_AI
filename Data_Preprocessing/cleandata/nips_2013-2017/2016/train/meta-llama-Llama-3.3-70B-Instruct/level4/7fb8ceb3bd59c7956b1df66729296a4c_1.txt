This manuscript examines the conditions that facilitate the alignment of critical points in a regularized problem, characterized by a quaternary term, with the optima of a matrix completion problem. In my opinion, this is the most outstanding paper I have had the privilege of reviewing this year, as it presents a lucid and well-structured exposition of a significant result, effectively contextualizing it within the framework of recent relevant research. I am intrigued by the potential for these findings to be generalized to ensembles with uniformly distributed entries, such as those discussed in http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.2467. The paper bears a close resemblance to a recent study available at http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.08101; however, given the coinciding submission deadline, it is unlikely to pose an issue, although citing this work would be a worthwhile addition. My comments are otherwise minor and include suggestions for correction: the "F" in "Frobenius" should be capitalized, the phrase "our attention" (line 229) could be rephrased for clarity, and the sentence "nice properties that ensure" (line 251) contains an unnecessary plural suffix.
