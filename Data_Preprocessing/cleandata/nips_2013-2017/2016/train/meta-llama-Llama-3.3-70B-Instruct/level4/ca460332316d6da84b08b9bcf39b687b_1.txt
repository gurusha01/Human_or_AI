The authors introduce a novel objective function, termed "product cut," for clustering networks, which is based on a personalized PageRank matrix. Although this choice appears incidental and a broader class of matrices could be applicable, the key concept involves a complex product of partition properties rather than a straightforward sum of graph-based metrics. The objective function leverages the personalized PageRank matrix and satisfies an analytical property that preserves partitions in a specific region around a sample problem with two distinct clusters and a third cluster as perturbation. Notably, the problem can be solved using a relaxed convex maximization problem, which, although not providing computational efficiency, enables more practical algorithms. The relaxed problem has integer solutions at its extrema, motivating a heuristic LP procedure for optimization. Experimental results demonstrate standard performance on test problems in terms of purity, but additional evaluations using metrics like NMI or F1 would be beneficial.
Several minor issues and questions arise, including concerns regarding the convergence of the optimization strategy for convex maximization. The paper's results do not justify convergence to a local optimum or the cluster itself, and it is unclear whether additional properties were used to draw conclusions about convergence. Furthermore, the simple example provided could also be appropriately clustered by grouping A, B, and C, highlighting the need for clarification on how the method would handle tripartition in such cases.
To improve the paper, it is suggested that a broader class of matrices, such as heat-kernel matrices, be explored to support the procedure. A parameter study on alpha would also be valuable, and more motivation for the new objective function would enhance the paper's context. Presentation-wise, defining the objective function with its most important term missing hinders appreciation of its properties, and a typo in figure 1a should be corrected. While the paper has issues related to the final optimization procedure, addressing these concerns could lead to a small yet meaningful contribution to the literature, particularly in the context of introducing new objective functions. The usefulness of such additions is often unclear, but this objective function exhibits promising properties that warrant consideration for acceptance.
