The authors present a novel approach to graph partitioning, which shares a similar concept of clustering with the traditional Normalized Cut optimization problem. By formulating this problem as a convex maximization program, they derive an exact continuous relaxation of the original discrete problem. This formulation enables the development of a monotonic algorithm that solves the optimization problem through a series of linear programs, as well as a randomized variant that yields a straightforward algorithm. The authors conduct a thorough experimental evaluation of their proposed method, demonstrating its efficacy in terms of cluster purity across various real-world datasets. The paper is well-structured and clearly written, with an interesting and novel problem formulation. The comparison to the classical Normalized Cut is meaningful, although additional analysis with more complex input cases, beyond isolated vertices, would be beneficial to further illustrate the method's capabilities. Nonetheless, the usefulness and stability of this partitioning method are evident, and its ability to be cast as a convex maximization program is a significant contribution to solving the original problem. The experimental evaluation is rigorously conducted, showcasing impressive algorithmic performance in terms of cluster purity across diverse real-world datasets. The results appear substantial, and the methodology employed seems sufficiently rigorous. Overall, my assessment of the paper is positive.
