This manuscript introduces AutoBDMC, a novel approach for evaluating MCMC convergence, which leverages the Bidirectional Monte Carlo method to estimate stochastic upper and lower bounds for the log marginal likelihood, utilizing annealed importance sampling. The authors demonstrate that the disparity between these bounds serves as a bound on the Jensen-Shannon divergence between the true posterior and the approximate sample distribution, providing a scalar metric for assessing MCMC convergence. Although the method is limited to analyzing convergence on synthetically generated data from the joint distribution, the authors provide empirical evidence suggesting that its analysis on such data is indicative of its performance on real-world data. They also illustrate the method's applicability to model selection and debugging. Overall, the paper is well-structured and clearly motivated, with the presented method appearing to be highly useful and the experimental evaluation being reasonably convincing. However, Section 3 is somewhat challenging to follow, particularly the transition to Section 3.1, which abruptly introduces variable and equation definitions without adequate motivation. If the divergence bound in Section 3.1 is an original contribution, it should be explicitly stated, as it seems to be a crucial aspect of the paper's novelty. The definition of AutoBDMC is not explicitly provided, leaving some ambiguity; it appears to refer to the approach of utilizing AIS and rAIS for MCMC convergence analysis, but a clear statement to this effect would be beneficial. By the time Section 3.2 mentions the challenges posed to AutoBDMC, its definition should be clearly established. Additionally, several minor issues were noted, including a potential error in Line 149, where p(theta, z | y) may be incorrectly stated as p(theta, z, y). Notational inconsistencies, such as the alternating use of y and D to denote data or observations, may cause confusion. Furthermore, the WebPPL code in the supplemental materials should be accompanied by information on compatible WebPPL versions and integration instructions, or ideally, released as a WebPPL package installable via npm. A similar release for the Stan version of the code would also be appreciated.
