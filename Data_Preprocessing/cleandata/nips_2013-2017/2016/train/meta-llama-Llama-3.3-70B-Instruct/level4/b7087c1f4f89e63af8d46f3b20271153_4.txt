This manuscript presents a methodology for computing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on exceptionally large sparse matrices, leveraging coresets as a weighted subset of the data matrix's rows. Notably, the authors demonstrate a coreset computation approach that is dimension-agnostic. A significant highlight of the paper is its application to the vast Wikipedia document-term matrix, showcasing the algorithm's capabilities. The writing is clear, with a well-articulated motivation that effectively conveys the significance of the work. The utilization of coresets to tackle the complex Wikipedia dataset is particularly noteworthy. Overall, the paper is engaging, thought-provoking, and a pleasure to read, offering a compelling exploration of a challenging problem.
