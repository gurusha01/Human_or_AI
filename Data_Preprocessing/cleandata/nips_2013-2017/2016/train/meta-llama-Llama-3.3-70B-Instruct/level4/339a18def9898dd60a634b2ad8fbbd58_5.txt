This paper presents a novel information-theoretic framework for modeling digital crowdsourcing, providing lower bounds on the required number of queries per task to achieve a specified probability of error. The workers are represented as parallel independent channels, with symmetric discrete memoryless channels (DMC) and spammer-hammer channel models (SHC(q)) used to account for worker errors and spamming behaviors, respectively. Assuming nonadaptive coding, the analysis considers two scenarios: one where the crowdsourcer has knowledge of all workers' skill levels and another where no such information is available. In both cases, the taskmaster is assumed to be unaware of worker skills, resulting in uniform task assignment. A necessary condition for the minimum required rate is derived for k-ary incidence coding with an SHC(q) worker pool. The paper is well-organized and clearly written. However, the absence of experimental or simulation-based comparisons to existing schemes, such as those used in Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT), is notable. Sections 2.4 and 3.1 could be condensed, with a focus on providing proof sketches for the theorems instead. The work appears to be pioneering in its information-theoretic approach to crowdsourcing, offering a valuable tool for designers to determine the minimum rate required for task completion with a given error probability, which can inform project pricing. As the appendix was not reviewed, the validity of the proofs cannot be confirmed.
