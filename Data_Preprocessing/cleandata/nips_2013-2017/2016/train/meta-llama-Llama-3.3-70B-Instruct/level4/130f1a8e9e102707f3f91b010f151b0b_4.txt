This paper presents an approach to under-complete dictionary learning, incorporating combined Sobolev/L1 regularization, aimed at identifying functional components within fMRI data. The methodology appears intriguing, with a notable contribution being the application of dictionary learning coupled with Sobolev/L1 regularization to promote component smoothness and sparsity. However, the outcomes of this novel method do not demonstrate significant improvement over simpler alternatives, with the extent of enhancement not adequately elucidated. Furthermore, the manuscript gives the impression of being hastily prepared, as evidenced by the presence of draft comments (line 146), and its dense, occasionally perplexing narrative makes for a laborious reading experience.
