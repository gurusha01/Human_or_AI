This study examines the boundaries of a population EM algorithm for specific instances of Gaussian distribution mixtures, with a focus on initial starting points. The authors then demonstrate that a sample-based EM algorithm exhibits identical asymptotic properties to the population EM algorithm, given the same initial conditions. The research concentrates on the EM algorithm's performance within two distinct models, namely mixtures of two Gaussian distributions, providing a comprehensive analysis of its behavior in this context. The findings are noteworthy, with all relevant cases addressed, resulting in a thorough understanding of the EM algorithm's performance in this setup. One criticism is that the proofs appear excessively lengthy, considering the paper's narrow focus on a specific model. Nevertheless, given that even simple mixtures of two Gaussian components are not yet fully comprehended, this work contributes meaningfully to the field, and I am inclined to support its acceptance at NIPS.
