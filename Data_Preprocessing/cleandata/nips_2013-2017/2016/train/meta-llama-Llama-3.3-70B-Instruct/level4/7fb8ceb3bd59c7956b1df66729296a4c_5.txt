This manuscript examines the geometric characteristics of a non-convex objective function for completing a Positive Semi-Definite (PSD) matrix. The primary result, as stated in Theorem 2.3, asserts that all data points $x$ satisfying $\text{grad}(x) = 0$ and $\text{hessian}(x) \geq -\tau I$ are global minima. This implies two key points: i) all such $x$ are local minima and globally optimal, and ii) all saddle points have $\text{hessian}(x) < -\tau I$. Furthermore, later analysis reveals that $\tau \leq 0.1p$, indicating that a larger sampling probability corresponds to a larger negative curvature of the saddles. This finding aligns with the characterization of functions featuring only strictly ridable saddle points in prior research, suggesting that certain optimization algorithms, such as cubic regularization, trust region algorithms, and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), can converge to global optima.
To establish the main theorem, the authors focus on excluding critical points with (1) high coherence with the standard basis (as in Lemma 3.7) and (2) significant negative curvature (as in Lemma 3.8) from being local minima. They then demonstrate that (3) the remaining critical points can only be global optima (as shown in Lemma 3.10), which involves proving that these points satisfy Lemma 3.3 and ultimately Appendix C.1, with Lemma 3.3 being derived from Lemma 3.6.
However, there are a few suggestions for improvement: 
* It appears that Lemma 3.8 implies that data points satisfying the first and second-order optimality conditions will have an $l_2$ norm of at least $\frac{1}{8}$, which cannot be achieved for data points with $\text{hessian} < -0.1p I$. If this interpretation is correct, rephrasing Lemma 3.8 for clarity would be beneficial. Otherwise, further clarification on how these points are excluded is necessary.
* The chain of reasoning in (3) seems lengthy and could be condensed for better presentation. Additionally, incorporating Lemma C.1 into the main text would be advantageous, as it is a crucial step and provides insight into how the parameter $p$ scales, given its dependence on an upper bound of $\epsilon$ in Lemma 3.3.
* Minor details include a potential inconsistency in Theorem 3.2, where $\tau < -0.1p$ is stated, despite $\tau$ being defined as positive in Definition 2.2. The context of Lemma 3.4 suggests that $\tau \leq 0.1p$ might be the intended condition. Furthermore, Figure 1 contains an error, with the bound for the $l\infty$ norm being $40u / \sqrt{d}$, and the representation of the $l2$ ball as an ellipsoid rather than a single circle could be misleading.
In summary, while this is a solid paper, its presentation and clarity could be enhanced. Outlining the proof idea more succinctly and providing connections between the technical definitions, intuitions, and prior work would benefit readers unfamiliar with this area, ultimately strengthening the manuscript.
