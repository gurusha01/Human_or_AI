The authors demonstrate the global convergence of the EM algorithm for a Gaussian mixture model with predetermined covariance and mixing proportions. While the presentation is generally clear, the paper's central contribution and significance are not immediately apparent. As a non-expert in this field, I found it challenging to grasp the practical implications of the results. The estimation of Models 1-2 can be readily achieved with large samples using methods such as the method of moments (MOM) or a one-step estimator, which may also serve as a suitable pilot estimator for the techniques outlined by Balakrishnan et al. (2014). For the paper to be considered acceptable, the proof techniques would need to be innovative and potentially applicable to more complex models. However, these techniques are currently relegated to a lengthy technical supplement, lacking intuitive explanations that could facilitate understanding. Furthermore, the choice of these models as a test case for the EM algorithm is unclear, particularly given the relatively simple landscape of the population likelihood function in Model 1, which features only two local maxima and one saddle point. In light of the EM algorithm's properties as a majorization-maximization procedure, convergence to a global maximum seems almost inevitable, making the results less surprising.
