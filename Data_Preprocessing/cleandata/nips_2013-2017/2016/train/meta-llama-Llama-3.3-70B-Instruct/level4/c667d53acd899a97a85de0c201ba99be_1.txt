This manuscript explores the sample complexity of automated mechanism design in the context of maximizing revenue in combinatorial auctions (CAs). The automated mechanism design process utilizes samples from the bidders' valuation distribution, which may be derived from historical records of previous auctions, to select an auction mechanism that yields high revenue. The authors present several upper bounds on sample complexities for various auction classes, building upon and expanding the work of Morgenstern and Roughgarden (reference [19]), which focused on "simple auctions" reducible to single-bidder settings. In contrast, this paper delves into the hierarchy of deterministic CA families, including VCG-based mechanisms, which offer more complex structures and greater flexibility in mechanism design compared to sequential auctions. Specifically, the authors investigate the affine maximizer auction (AMA), virtual valuation CA (VVCA), lambda-auction, mixed bundling auction with reserve prices (MBARPs), and mixed bundling auction (MBA). For AMA, VVCA, and lambda-auction, the authors derive negative results, including an exponential upper bound on the Rademacher complexity of the revenue function for AMA (Theorem 2), which leads to exponential upper bounds on sample complexity for these three classes, complemented by exponential lower bounds for lambda-auction and VVCA (Theorem 1). In contrast, more positive results are obtained for the less general models MBARPs and MBA. For MBA with two bidders, the authors demonstrate that the pseudo-dimension is 2 (Theorem 3) and establish a polynomial upper bound on sample complexity (Theorem 4), later generalizing these results to the case of n bidders (Theorems 5 and 6). Finally, polynomial upper bounds on the pseudo-dimension and sample complexity of MBARPs are provided. This work can be seen as an extension of the research presented in [19], "learning simple auctions," where techniques for proving generalization error bounds were applied to reason about mechanism design. The current submission focuses on broader classes of auctions and yields more general results. While the techniques and results are intriguing, considering the foundational work already established in applying learning theory to mechanism design problems of this form, it is questionable whether the results are sufficiently groundbreaking to warrant publication in a top-tier conference like NIPS, although they certainly exceed the standards for other conference venues.
