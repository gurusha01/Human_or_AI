The authors tackle the challenge of aggregating worker output in crowdsourcing using the framework of information theory, deriving the fundamental limits of the tradeoff between budget and fidelity. Although I struggled to fully comprehend the paper, I found the proposed model and insights to be intriguing and potentially valuable for designing crowdsourcing aggregation techniques. To enhance the paper's clarity, I suggest emphasizing the key intuition and takeaways from the results, such as those presented at the end of section 3, and including a concise conclusion to summarize the main points. While the authors' efforts to make the paper accessible to non-experts in information theory are appreciated, I still found it difficult to follow and recommend rephrasing many of the results in terms of the crowdsourcing application rather than relying on information theory terminology. The related work section should also mention the parallel research on robust economic incentives for workers, often referred to as "crowdsourcing mechanisms" or "mechanism design for crowdsourcing," which explores varying worker abilities and the combination of incentives with advanced aggregation methods. Additionally, several minor corrections and clarifications are needed, including: correcting the subject-verb agreement on page 84, clarifying the distinction between the crowdsourcer and taskmaster on page 106, fixing a typo on page 122, rephrasing the sentence on pages 275-276 for better readability, and providing a more detailed caption for figure 2 to improve its interpretability.
