This manuscript examines the support recovery guarantees of relaxed basis pursuit algorithm variants, focusing on l1 and infinity loss functions as alternatives to the traditional l2 loss. By extending existing theoretical frameworks for l2 loss, the authors provide a comprehensive analysis of support recovery guarantees under specific low-noise conditions. The primary contribution lies in the detailed theoretical support recovery guarantees for l1 and infinity loss variants, thereby completing the theoretical analysis for these cases. The paper clearly outlines the problem setup, main results, and experimental findings, although a minor typo is noted ("explicitely" in line 62). However, several weaknesses are identified: 
- The motivation for using l1 and infinity loss is rooted in different noise models, yet the simulations do not clarify which noise model is employed. A comparison of the three methods under various noise models would be insightful, as the current simulations suggest l2 loss superiority for support recovery, raising questions about the practical relevance of the theoretical guarantees if no interesting cases are presented. 
- Theorem 1 is limited to small noise settings, lacking insight into scenarios with larger noise levels. As discussed in line 215, the theorem might only be applicable in noise-free cases, prompting the need for the authors to elaborate on the implications for larger noise settings, either theoretically or through simulations. 
- While key details about the numerical experiments are provided, the noise level remains unspecified in all experiments, a critical omission that requires rectification to fully assess the findings.
