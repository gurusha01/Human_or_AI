The authors propose a vine copula model that is well-suited for high-dimensional data comprising mixed observation types, including both continuous and discrete variables. This model can be effectively fitted to data, and sampling-based estimates can be utilized to calculate information-theoretic quantities. The approach appears to be both computationally feasible and relevant for researchers seeking to model complex datasets with diverse observation types, such as neuronal spike counts and continuous calcium signals. However, a general limitation of this type of model in neuroscientific applications is the lack of explicit incorporation of external variables, such as visual stimuli. It is unclear whether integrating external variables, like visual stimuli or motor outputs, into the model would be cumbersome or infeasible. Furthermore, although the model can accommodate various forms of observations, formatting data for this type of model may be challenging, particularly given the disparate sampling rates of different signals, such as continuous calcium signals and intracellular voltage signals, which may pose significant difficulties in practice.
