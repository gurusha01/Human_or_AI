This study investigates the relationship between sampling-based regression and low-rank tensor factorization, proposing a novel approach that utilizes a straightforward bound on the leverage scores of the KRP matrix. The methodology and theoretical framework are grounded in established results from sampling-based matrix approximation, and the analysis is relatively straightforward, with the primary innovation lying in the integration of existing concepts. Nevertheless, the work is technically sound, and the practical outcome appears to offer an improvement over the current state of the art, albeit a moderately incremental one. While the paper contains several typographical errors, grammatical mistakes, and awkwardly phrased sentences, the underlying ideas are presented effectively. The observations in Theorem 3.2 and 3.3 are noteworthy, although they are relatively simple results. On line 174, the statement "The estimation is tight" may be misleading; instead, it would be more accurate to say that the estimation is tight up to a constant factor R. The table referenced between lines 295 and 296 is not explicitly defined, although its identity as Table 1 can be inferred from the context. Furthermore, in part (a) of this table, it is not immediately clear that "sketch" refers to the method described in [37].
