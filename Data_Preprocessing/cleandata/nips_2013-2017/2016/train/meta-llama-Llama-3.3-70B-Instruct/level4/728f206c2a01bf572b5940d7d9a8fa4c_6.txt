This paper proposes an enhancement to the traditional MLE objective for training Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) by incorporating a smooth Wasserstein distance. The Wasserstein distance, which is dependent on a chosen metric in the data space, incentivizes the model to allocate mass in regions proximal to the data according to this metric, leading to more realistic samples, albeit potentially at the cost of reduced coverage. The manuscript is well-organized and clearly written. The observed clustering or shrinkage property in the experimental results is noteworthy and could have significant practical implications if the methodology can be effectively scaled. To further strengthen the presentation, it would be beneficial to provide details on the computational time required for the experiments and offer insights into the complexity of the involved steps. Given the current interest in objective functions that generate more realistic samples within the variational autoencoder and generative adversarial network communities, this work contributes meaningfully to the RBM field along similar lines. Exploring potential applications of this approach to other methods could also yield valuable outcomes.
