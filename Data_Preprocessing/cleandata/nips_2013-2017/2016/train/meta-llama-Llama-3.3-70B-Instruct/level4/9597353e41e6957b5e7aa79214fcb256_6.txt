The authors present a framework for clustering with same-clustering queries and demonstrate its potential. However, several major concerns need to be addressed: 
1. A significant omission in the paper is the lack of empirical studies to validate the theoretical properties of the SSAC algorithm on real-world datasets. It is essential to include such studies in any revised version, even if they are relegated to supplementary materials.
2. The authors claim to focus on "center-based clustering in Euclidean space" but assert that their results are applicable to any Hilbert space. A more detailed discussion or proof supporting this generalization should be provided. Furthermore, the authors primarily discuss K-means; they should explore the potential application of their approach to other clustering techniques.
3. The theoretical results in Section 3 appear disconnected from the rest of the paper, lacking introductory statements or contextual discussion. The authors should add transitional text and consider dividing these properties into a separate subsection for better clarity.
4. Some proofs, such as those for Lemma 6 and Theorem 14, are incomplete or lack crucial details. It is necessary to provide fully detailed proofs in the supplementary materials.
Additionally, several minor issues were noted: 
- Numerous typos are present throughout the manuscript, including "address this issues," "exhibit some nice properties and likely to," "In such cases, optimal," "help relaxing," and others. A thorough review for grammatical and punctuation errors is recommended.
- The term "niceness" should be defined early on to avoid confusion with its colloquial usage.
- The abstract's reference to "success" is ambiguous and should be clarified, particularly if it pertains to the algorithm's accuracy.
- Section 1.1 contains redundant information from earlier sections.
- The choice of 3.4 as a special number lacks explanation and should be justified in more detail.
- Providing additional intuition or a brief example to illustrate the equivalence between Definition 4 and the definition of a same-cluster query in Definition 2 would enhance reader understanding.
- The statement regarding the variability of the solution of choice across different applications should be supported with references.
