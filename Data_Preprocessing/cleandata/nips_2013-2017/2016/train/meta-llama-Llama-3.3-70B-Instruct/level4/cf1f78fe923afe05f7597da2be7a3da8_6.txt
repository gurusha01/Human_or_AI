The authors present a novel approach to dimensionality reduction, wherein a set of points is embedded into a lower-dimensional space through an iterative process of refinement. This refinement is achieved by initializing an embedding and subsequently optimizing it via the minimization of a defined loss function. Experimental evaluations of the proposed algorithm on various tasks have yielded encouraging outcomes. The manuscript is well-structured and devoid of apparent methodological errors. The research objectives and contributions are clearly articulated by the authors, providing a coherent narrative. However, the innovation appears to build upon existing foundations, leveraging established estimators for the Laplace-Beltrami operator and the push-forward metric. A comprehensive comparison with state-of-the-art embedding algorithms is provided, highlighting the efficacy of the proposed method. Nonetheless, a notable omission is the lack of guidance on selecting appropriate values for the embedding dimension and intrinsic dimension parameters, which could significantly impact the algorithm's performance and applicability.
