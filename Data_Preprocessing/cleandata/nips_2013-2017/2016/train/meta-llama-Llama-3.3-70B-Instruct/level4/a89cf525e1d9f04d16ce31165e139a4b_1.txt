This manuscript brings together two prominent concepts in theoretical neuroscience, namely information bottleneck (IB) and sparse coding, thereby holding significant potential to substantially impact the field of neural coding. From a technical standpoint, the paper is robust, presenting several algorithms, including an EM-IB type algorithm that assumes a sparse approximate prior for the encoding variable, as well as a kernel extension that facilitates handling more complex, nonlinear relationships between observables. The analysis encompasses a range of intriguing problems. To further enhance the manuscript, it might be beneficial to more explicitly highlight its relevance to neuroscientific and neural coding aspects, such as comparing the results to those obtained using standard sparse coding approaches. The comprehensive description of concepts and methods made for an engaging read, and it is anticipated that this research will have a profound impact on theoretical neuroscience. Several questions arise, primarily out of curiosity: 
1. Could the authors speculate on why the sparse IB filters in Fig. 1C appear curved, given that the stimuli described were oriented bars rather than curved arcs?
2. Was the observed horizontal bias in orientation representation exclusive to a strong bottleneck, and would this effect diminish with a softer coding constraint? To what extent did sparsity contribute to this outcome? This finding resonates with the well-documented "oblique effect" in neuroscience, concerning the asymmetry of orientation representation in V1, which could serve as an ideal setup for further experimentation. The authors may be able to contribute a compelling functional hypothesis on the origins of this effect in highly visual animals, potentially worthy of a separate publication in a neuroscience-oriented venue.
The manuscript is well-written, with a few minor typos identified in lines 90, 93, 95, 175, 195, 222, 239, and 256, as well as Equation 1, where X and Y are swapped in the first line. Additionally, the X-axis label in Fig. 1F should be verified to ensure it correctly reads "units." Consideration should also be given to clarifying that phi(x) (beginning in line 146) is a row vector, as notations such as phi(x) phi^T(x) could be interpreted as dot-products, potentially causing confusion.
