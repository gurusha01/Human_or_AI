This manuscript presents a novel update scheme for the CMA-ES algorithm, termed Cholesky-CMA-ES, which approximates the original covariance matrix adaptation with a reduced computational complexity of O(μd^2) compared to the original O(d^3), where d represents the dimension of the optimization problem and μ denotes the number of samples per iteration, typically on the order of O(log(d)). The core idea behind this update scheme is to maintain and update a lower-triangular Cholesky matrix instead of the full covariance matrix, thereby eliminating the need to estimate a random orthogonal matrix Et at each step. Under certain restrictive assumptions regarding the convergence of a sequence of covariance matrices to a target covariance matrix, the authors provide an asymptotic argument suggesting that the sequence of Et converges to an identity matrix, rendering the two schemes equivalent. The manuscript demonstrates the validity and efficiency of the Cholesky-CMA-ES through standard runtime and convergence plots on selected objective functions, as well as comparisons with two state-of-the-art CMA-ES alternatives that delay full covariance matrix updates using different approaches. This work contributes significantly to accelerating the CMA-ES algorithm, which is widely regarded as the most effective method for non-convex black-box optimization when the topology of the objective function is unknown and first or higher-order information is inaccessible or unhelpful. The proposed method substantially speeds up the algorithm without compromising optimization performance on synthetic test cases. However, a common limitation of any CMA-ES speed-up proposal is that, in practice, the overall optimization process is often dominated by the runtime of the black-box oracle, and the actual runtime of CMA-ES may be negligible in comparison. Furthermore, in typical CMA-ES applications, problem dimensionalities rarely exceed a few tens of variables, and only in scenarios where single function evaluations are on the order of milliseconds or less and dimensionalities are higher does the CMA-ES runtime become a significant factor. Given the challenges in obtaining theoretical guarantees for complex schemes like CMA-ES, additional empirical experiments and plots could further strengthen the presentation of the results. Firstly, visualizing the evolution of Et on selected optimization trajectories in different norms could provide valuable insights, such as by running the full CMA-ES and calculating the approximation simultaneously for comparison. This would offer empirical evidence regarding the fluctuations of Et over time. Secondly, including actual runtimes and performance of CMA-ES without delay strategies would enhance the completeness of the contribution. Thirdly, conducting a simulation study on quadratic functions with varying spectral distributions of quadratic forms, as seen in Stich and Mueller (PPSN 2012), and comparing solution quality and error in E_t in relation to the spectral distribution, would be beneficial. Lastly, a real-world experiment, such as policy gradients in real-time robotics applications where speed is crucial and the parameter space is manageable, would complement the simulation results and demonstrate the practical applicability of the proposed method.
