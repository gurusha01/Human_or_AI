This manuscript proposes a novel sampling approach for dropout, wherein distinct features or neurons are governed by separate multinomial distributions. The authors present enhancements to the conventional dropout technique that may have practical applications. Notably, the results and benchmarks presented in Figure 2, Section 5.1, and Figure 3 are particularly noteworthy and deserving of attention.
