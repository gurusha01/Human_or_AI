This paper introduces a novel approach to Approximate Bayesian Computation, tailored for models with intractable likelihoods but allowing for straightforward simulation of mock datasets under various parameters. The proposed method leverages a versatile parametric modeling tool, the Mixture Density Network, to approximate the Bayesian conditional density in the parameter space with respect to the simulated data. By combining concepts from machine learning and statistical theory, the authors present a potentially groundbreaking synthesis. In my opinion, this paper has the potential to be outstanding, as the approach is well-motivated and clearly explained. The numerous examples provided suggest that it will likely have a significant impact on the application of likelihood-free methods, particularly in scenarios where mock data simulations are computationally expensive, such as weather simulations, cosmological simulations, and individual-based models for epidemiology. Notably, parallel developments in the statistics community, such as random forest methods for epsilon-free ABC inference, highlight the growing interest in innovations in this area. However, I have a concern regarding the proof of Proposition 1, where the term "sufficiently flexible" is not explicitly defined, which could be clarified to identify sufficient conditions for using the MVN model. Naturally, these conditions will be restrictive, so it is essential to understand the circumstances under which the approximation may be considered adequate and to develop empirical metrics to guide this decision. Some minor points to consider: the comparison to existing work in Section 4 is well-done, but it might be worth mentioning that early ABC work, such as Diggle & Gratton (1984), involved kernel-based likelihood estimation. Additionally, the introduction mentions the challenge of combining posteriors from separate analyses, which has been addressed in recent studies on scalable Bayesian methods, including those by Zheng et al. (2014), Scott et al. (2013), and Minsker et al. (2014).
