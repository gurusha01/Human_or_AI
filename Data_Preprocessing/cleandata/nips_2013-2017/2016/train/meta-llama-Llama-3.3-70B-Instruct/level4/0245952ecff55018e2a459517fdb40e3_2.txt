The authors propose a conditional extension of moment matching networks, a non-trivial undertaking that differs from models capable of single-example updates where conditional incorporation is straightforward. This complexity arises from the need to match distributions of numerous samples (mini-batches) to a large number of inputs, which no longer share the same distribution unless the same conditional is applied to each update, an inefficient approach. A significant issue with the paper is its reliance on advanced mathematical formulations without providing an intuitive understanding of the underlying concepts and the computational efficiency of the algorithm. The authors replicate the extension of moment matching networks to a conditional version, distinct from models that can update on a single example where such an extension is straightforward. However, the challenge here lies in matching the distributions of a large number of samples to multiple inputs, now dissimilar due to differing conditionals, which would only be the same if the same conditional were used for every update, a method that is inefficient. The primary concern with the paper is the lack of explanation for the formula being optimized (equation 2), including its computational efficiency, underlying assumptions, and the actual computations performed, leaving the reader without insight into the formula's derivation or practical implementation. Unlike the non-conditional version, which can be intuitively explained without resorting to complex mathematical concepts like reproducing kernel Hilbert space, the conditional version lacks a clear, intuitive explanation for its formula. It would be beneficial for the authors to provide an intuitive rationale for the conditional formula (equation 2) and outline the steps from this formula to the practical algorithm, addressing questions such as: 
- How does one intuitively derive formula (2)?
- What are the practical steps from formula (2) to the algorithm's implementation, with some details currently buried in the supplement and difficult to follow?
