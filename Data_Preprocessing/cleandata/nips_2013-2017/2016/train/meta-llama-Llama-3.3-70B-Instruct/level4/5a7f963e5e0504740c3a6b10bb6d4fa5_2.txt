This manuscript proposes a compilation algorithm to transform a Markov network into a Probabilistic Sentential Decision Diagram (PSDD) representation, initially introduced by Kisa et al. in 2014. Experimental results indicate that this algorithm can generate smaller arithmetic circuits compared to existing compilers in certain cases. However, the novelty of this work is somewhat limited, as the presented compilation algorithm bears a strong resemblance to the one used for AND/OR Multi-Valued Decision Diagrams (AOMDDs), a special case of PSDDs. Theorem 6 can be directly inferred from a similar theorem established for AOMDDs. Moreover, the multiplication algorithm outlined in Section 3 is essentially identical to the one employed for Sentential Decision Diagrams (SDDs), and it is expected that it operates in polynomial time. The primary contribution and significance of this paper lie in its experimental results, which suggest that compiling into PSDDs can be more effective than compiling into AOMDDs. A more in-depth analysis of the origins of these advantages would make the paper more compelling. 
The paper overlooks the fact that Theorem 6 does not directly apply to the compilation algorithm, as it only asserts the existence of a compact PSDD without guaranteeing its discovery. In contrast, the corresponding theorem for AOMDDs ensures that the compiled representation will be compact. The paper's audience may be limited due to its reliance on prior knowledge of Darwiche (2011) and Kisa et al. (2014), making certain definitions, such as Definition 6, unclear without this context. For instance, the description of the left child having multiple SDDs is confusing when each vtree node is said to produce a single SDD. It would be beneficial to rephrase this definition or adopt Definition 5 from Darwiche (2011) for clarity.
When discussing the relationship between SDDs and PSDDs, it is crucial to note, as Kisa et al. did, that the SDD underlying a PSDD is not compressed, contrary to what is suggested in Line 111 of the paper. A more extensive discussion on the relationship between PSDDs and AOMDDs, particularly highlighting that AOMDDs are a special case of PSDDs, would be valuable. This relationship implies that PSDDs can be more succinct but potentially less tractable than AOMDDs, using the terminology from Darwiche (2011). This is illustrated by the fact that the compilation algorithm for AOMDDs has a provable upper bound related to treewidth, whereas the same algorithm for PSDDs does not.
