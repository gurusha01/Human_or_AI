This manuscript presents a novel approach to manifold learning, which involves directly minimizing isometric deviation. The proposed method utilizes projected gradient descent for iterative optimization. Several aspects of the paper warrant further clarification: 
In Algorithm 1, the selection of parameters d and s is not clearly outlined. It would be beneficial to provide a systematic approach for choosing s once d has been determined. 
Additionally, the function "poly" referenced in line 25 requires definition. 
A sentence in line 27 begins with "An embedding..."; however, the sentence appears to be incomplete and should be revised for clarity. 
A notation inconsistency is observed in line 71, where "W{ij}" should be replaced with "W{kl}". 
In equation (1), the notation "D = W1" should be corrected to "D = diag(W1)", and similarly, "tilde(D) = diag(tilde(W1))". 
A minor typo is found in line 77, where "give" should be replaced with "gives". 
The qualitative results for the Swiss roll and curved half-sphere examples (Figure 2) suggest that HLLE and Isomap perform better, although the numerical performance evaluated using equation (10) favors the proposed RR method. 
To further assess the performance, it would be informative to compare the individual loss terms in equation (10) across different algorithms. 
A comparison of the computational complexities of each algorithm would also provide valuable insight.
