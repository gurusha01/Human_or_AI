This manuscript proposes an extension of existing results on fast learning rates to accommodate unbounded losses characterized by heavy-tailed distributions. The authors commence by establishing the preliminary conditions, which are subsequently verified. Ultimately, they demonstrate that under the specified conditions, it is possible to achieve fast learning rates for losses with heavy tails. However, the notation could be improved, as some variables used in the formulas are not explicitly defined, which may hinder understanding for a broader audience. Additionally, the selection of certain variable values appears to be arbitrary, lacking clear justification or rationale. Furthermore, there are instances of redundancy in the text, suggesting opportunities for conciseness.
