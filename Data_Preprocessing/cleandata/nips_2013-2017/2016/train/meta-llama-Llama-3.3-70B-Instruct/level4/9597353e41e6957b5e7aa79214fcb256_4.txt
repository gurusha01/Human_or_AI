This paper examines a specific clustering problem where a margin exists between points belonging to different clusters, and an oracle is available to verify whether two points should be in the same cluster. The authors propose a probabilistic polynomial-time algorithm for this problem, utilizing a limited number of oracle queries. Additionally, they demonstrate that the k-means objective is NP-hard for instances with gamma margins below approximately 1.84 and establish a lower bound on the required number of oracle queries for such cases to be solvable in polynomial time. However, the writing and notation are occasionally unclear or unnecessarily complex, and minor grammatical errors are present. Some sections are challenging to read, and the manuscript appears to lack spell checking. 
The algorithm employs an interesting application of binary search, but a poor choice of estimator for the cluster center could lead to false negatives or false positives, a point that the authors fail to acknowledge. The description of the algorithm on page 4 differs slightly from the actual algorithm on page 5, primarily due to confusing writing. The description suggests selecting points until one cluster is sufficiently large, whereas the algorithm description states that a fixed number of points are selected to guarantee a large enough cluster. Although this distinction is minor, clearer description would be beneficial.
The authors claim that the algorithm is guaranteed to succeed when the gamma condition is met, but based on the provided information, this claim is not entirely convincing. The proof of Lemma 5 assumes a difference between the real and sample centers less than ε*radius, which is only probabilistically proven in Lemma 6. These results should be rearranged for clarity, and Lemma 5 should likely be probabilistic as well. The overall result in Theorem 7 is stated to hold with probability 1-δ, which is weaker than the "guaranteed success" asserted in the abstract and introduction. Unless this result follows from something overlooked, the details should be more clearly explained.
Section 4.1 is concise, but without accessing the supplementary content, it is difficult to fully understand. A more concise presentation in the proceedings version, avoiding excessive notation only referenced in the supplementary material, would be clearer. The proof of the query lower bound is elegant. Overall, the paper requires editing and additional details to explain the results. The main result may be weaker than claimed (probabilistic rather than guaranteed), and Lemmas 5 and 6 need reordering and expansion.
