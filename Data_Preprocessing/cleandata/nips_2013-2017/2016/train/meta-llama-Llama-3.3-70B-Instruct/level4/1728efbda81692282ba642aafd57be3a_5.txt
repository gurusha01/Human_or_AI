The manuscript "Koopman Spectral Analysis of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems with Reproducing Kernels" presents an extension of dynamical mode decomposition (DMD) to reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), resulting in the KDMD algorithm, which is applied to several toy problems. This approach enables the use of feature maps as kernel definitions, linking DMD to specific features of interest and providing a powerful generalization of DMD. However, my primary concern is that the paper is overly complex and difficult to read, with an excessive emphasis on mathematical notation for simple concepts and verbose sections that may hinder understanding, even for specialists. Some points require clarification, making the paper unsuitable for publication in the Neural Information Processing Systems conference proceedings in its current form. Nevertheless, I strongly encourage the authors to rewrite the paper in a more pedagogical manner, as the resulting article has the potential to be highly cited.
I. MAJOR REMARKS
My major remarks are as follows:
1. The presentation is unnecessarily verbose and could be simplified. For example, the concept of DMD approximating Koopman eigenfunctions using linear monomials of observables as basis functions could be concisely summarized in a single sentence.
2. Section 4 appears to be redundant, as it partially repeats information from the introduction, and could be omitted in a short paper.
3. Section 5 would benefit from illustrations or a summary in the conclusion to enhance clarity.
4. Section 6 is overly condensed and could be expanded, similar to Section 5, to provide more detailed information.
II. MINOR REMARKS
My additional minor remarks include:
1. A potential typo in the description of the toy NL case, which appears to be linear rather than nonlinear.
2. The first two problems are polynomial in nature, and the KDMD should be particularly effective in such cases, where the kernel can be guessed. More details, similar to those provided in Section 5, would be beneficial.
