The authors investigate repeated games where players employ regret-minimizing algorithms to select their actions, substantially expanding on recent research. Notably, they only require "realized feedback", a more realistic scenario, as opposed to the expected feedback over other players' actions. The paper also presents several noteworthy extensions and insights regarding bandit feedback and dynamic population games. This well-written paper clearly motivates the problem and offers conceptually significant improvements over prior work (SAL15 and LST16), despite technical similarities. The use of "realized feedback" instead of "expected feedback" is a crucial distinction, making the problem more realistic. However, an experimental comparison with SAL15 and LST16 would be beneficial to understand the practical implications of this difference. Specifically, it is unclear whether having access to expected feedback provides any advantages. The empirical results included in the rebuttal are a welcome addition, and their inclusion in the final paper is recommended. Overall, this is a valuable contribution that will be of interest to game theorists, offering a nice blend of theoretical and practical insights.
