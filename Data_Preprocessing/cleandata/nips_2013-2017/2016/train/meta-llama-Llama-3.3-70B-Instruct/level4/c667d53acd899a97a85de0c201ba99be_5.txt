This manuscript presents a sample complexity analysis of automated mechanism design, specifically for identifying high-revenue combinatorial auctions within a particular auction class. The key findings include uniform convergence bounds of revenue for a hierarchy of auction classes, demonstrating that exponential sample complexity is unavoidable for general AMA, VVCA, and Î» auctions, whereas polynomial sample complexity can be attained for MBARP and MBA auctions. The central technique employed involves bounding the complexity of various auction classes using Rademacher complexity or pseudo-dimension. The paper delves into a novel and intriguing research area within learning theory, leveraging traditional sample complexity analysis techniques to uncover fresh insights into the structural hierarchy of auction classes. The writing is clear and concise, making the content readily accessible. However, one notable omission is the lack of explanation for the quantity "U" that appears in the bounds.
