The authors introduce CMICOT, a filter-based feature selection approach capable of capturing interactions between more than three features, thereby addressing a common limitation in handling higher-order interactions. The submission is well-organized, and the authors effectively contextualize their proposed method within the broader challenges of the domain and existing research, providing formalized explanations of their approach. However, the evaluation of CMICOT is somewhat lacking in depth. While multiple datasets are utilized, the aggregated performance results obscure the extent and underlying reasons for any outperformance. Although supplementary results are included in the appendix, the main body of the work, within the page limit, is insufficient. For instance, Figure 1 is missing a y-axis, which is necessary for interpreting the magnitude of performance differences, making it difficult to fully assess the benefits of the proposed method.
