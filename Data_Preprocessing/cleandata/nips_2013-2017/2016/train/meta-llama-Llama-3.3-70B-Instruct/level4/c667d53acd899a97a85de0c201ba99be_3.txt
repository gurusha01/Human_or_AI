The authors provide an in-depth examination of the sample complexity associated with learning nearly optimal auctions from established combinatorial auction classes. They investigate the relationship between the best in-sample mechanism within a given class and the revenue generated by this mechanism when applied to the actual distribution of player values. By leveraging the theoretical framework of Rademacher complexities and calculus, in conjunction with combinatorial methods such as VC dimension, the authors successfully derive bounds for the Rademacher complexity of the revenue objective across well-studied combinatorial auction classes. The findings are noteworthy from both a learning theory perspective, as they effectively analyze and bound complex function classes, and a mechanism design perspective, where they innovatively apply Rademacher complexity to mechanism design. Therefore, based on the technical merit and significance of the work, I suggest accepting the submission.
