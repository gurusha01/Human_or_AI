This manuscript proposes an alternative prior for Bayesian non-parametric clustering, which is more suitable for applications where cluster sizes do not increase linearly with the number of data points, thus deviating from the "rich gets richer" assumption inherent in Dirichlet Process (DP) and related priors. The authors have explicitly modeled the distribution of cluster sizes within this new process, presenting two variants that utilize different forms of distributions over cluster sizes. Additionally, they provide a Gibbs-sampling algorithm and a split-merge algorithm in the appendix. The paper includes comparisons with DP and the Pitman-Yor Process (PYP) across various datasets, addressing a significant issue in Bayesian non-parametric (BNP) clustering and introducing an intriguing prior. However, several weaknesses are noted: 
1. The authors acknowledge the work in [13], which also tackles the same problem by introducing a uniform prior as an alternative to the "rich gets richer" prior implicit in DP and PYP, resulting in a larger number of clusters. Unfortunately, the manuscript lacks a comprehensive comparison with [13] and does not delve into the details of how their work relates to and differs from [13] in terms of the properties of the resulting prior, beyond a brief mention.
2. The implications of sacrificing consistency to achieve the micro-clustering property are not thoroughly discussed, nor is a comparison made with sacrificing exchangeability as seen in [13], which would provide valuable insight into the trade-offs involved.
3. The experimental results are inconclusive, as it is unclear whether any improvements are statistically significant. The performance of the new processes does not radically dominate that of existing ones across all measures, which raises questions about their effectiveness.
4. The writing is somewhat dense and challenging to follow, even for those familiar with the field, due to the extensive use of symbols. Simplification and clarification would enhance the readability and understanding of the manuscript.
