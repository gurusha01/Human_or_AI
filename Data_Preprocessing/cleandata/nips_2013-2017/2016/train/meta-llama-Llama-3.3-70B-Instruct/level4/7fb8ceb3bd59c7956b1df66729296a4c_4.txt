This manuscript demonstrates that the widely employed non-convex objective function in matrix completion lacks spurious local minima, implying that gradient descent methods can converge to the global optimum. The finding appears remarkably robust. The authors provide a thorough theoretical analysis, which I think has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of matrix completion.
