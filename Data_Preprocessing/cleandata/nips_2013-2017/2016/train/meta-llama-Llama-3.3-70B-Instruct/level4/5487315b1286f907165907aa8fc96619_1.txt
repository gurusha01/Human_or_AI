This work presents a convex approximation for a bi-level training objective in two-layer networks, where the middle layer is subject to specific structural constraints. The authors provide a detailed derivation, apply it to two structured settings, and conduct experiments on transliteration and image inpainting tasks. However, my primary concern lies in the numerous assumptions, adjustments, and approximations made throughout the paper, which compromise confidence in the resulting algorithm's behavior. For instance, the introduction of a "bi-level" objective, rather than the standard likelihood objective, lacks a clear optimization context interpretation and is motivated solely by simplification, warranting further discussion on its impact on the learned models. Similarly, the SDP relaxation, although convexifying the problem, is not thoroughly characterized, leaving unclear the trade-off between convexity and fidelity degradation. Technical issues, such as the unsubstantiated claim of equivalence between optimizing over S and Y, unless Y is constrained (e.g., to {0,1}^d), and numerous typos and grammatical errors, detract from the paper's clarity. The experiments, while intriguing and yielding positive results compared to CRF-AE, would benefit from a more detailed analysis, including comparisons of likelihood values, computational efficiency, and performance relative to non-structured methods, to fully elucidate the importance of structure in these problems. Ultimately, despite the method's potential utility, a more rigorous presentation, analysis, and experimental evaluation are necessary to establish its convincingness. Following the authors' feedback, I acknowledge the error in my initial critique regarding line 132 and have adjusted my technical quality score accordingly.
