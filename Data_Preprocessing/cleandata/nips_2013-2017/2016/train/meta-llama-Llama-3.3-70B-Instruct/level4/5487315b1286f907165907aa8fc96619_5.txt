This manuscript presents a novel methodology for prediction using structured latent variable models, which also extends to structured auto-encoders, achieving both convexity and tractability under the assumption of polar operator tractability and a relaxation related to rank in a semi-definite programming (SDP) formulation. The proposed approach is innovative, technically sophisticated, and apparently rigorous, addressing a challenging problem that has garnered significant attention from prominent researchers. Although the reduction to SDP may lead to scalability issues, this work contributes a fresh perspective to a difficult problem, potentially inspiring substantial subsequent research. The paper's clarity is noteworthy, particularly given its technical complexity. However, a limitation of the writing is the occasional ambiguity between novel contributions and applications of existing concepts, which could be attributed to the writing style and may be easily addressed. One specific section is somewhat perplexing, as the authors claim that the only relaxation employed is the rank relaxation, whereas another relaxation appears in Equation 5, where \Omega(Ux) is upper-bounded by max_y y'Ux, justified by a max-margin principle. While this is acceptable, its justification in the context of probabilistic models is not entirely clear, warranting further clarification.
