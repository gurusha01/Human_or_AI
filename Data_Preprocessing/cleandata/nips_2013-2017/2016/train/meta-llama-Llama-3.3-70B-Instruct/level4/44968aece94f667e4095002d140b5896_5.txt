This manuscript examines an online pricing problem where a seller encounters a stream of strategic and patient buyers, with the patience of buyers captured by a time window beyond which they will depart. The arrival of buyer types is assumed to be adversarial, and an EXP3-based learning algorithm is proposed, which bundles time steps into epochs and announces a fixed price for each epoch, updating EXP3 based on epoch-wide feedback. This approach facilitates the establishment of an upper bound on the learner's regret via EXP3 results. Furthermore, the problem is shown to be reducible to a multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem with switching costs, yielding a matching lower bound through this reduction. The paper explores a distinct worker patience model for online pricing, with interesting techniques for proving the lower bound that may have broader applications. The results are clearly presented. 
Upon reviewing the authors' rebuttal, while the problem formulation is sound and both upper and lower bounds are nicely presented, several concerns arise. Firstly, regarding modeling, the algorithm's requirement for knowledge of workers' patience, assumed to be gatherable through buyer reports, may be complicated by strategic manipulation and reporting. Secondly, concerning the lower bound, it appears to be established over a learning space where the algorithm always posts prices for a fixed time window size (tau+1), potentially not representing the true lower bound as the learner and workers can be strategic about price posting and response. 
Additionally, the intuition behind minimizing price changes, presented before Algorithm 1, seems based on pre-posted prices, which may not hold if the learner can adjust prices dynamically, as forgoing the current price might risk missing a lower price. Other observations include the mention of modeling patient workers using time windows as a key aspect, despite discounted buyer models being considered in existing works, such as [1]. Clarification is also needed on whether the window size equals tau (patience) + 1, which affects the claim that [11] is a special case of this paper, given [11] has tau = 0, whereas this paper's results are for tau >= 1, precluding a direct comparison and implying [11] could yield a sort{T} lower bound based on its results.
