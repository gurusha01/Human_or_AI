The authors propose a methodology for approximate marginal inference and partition function estimation in a novel and useful class of 'cooperative graphical models', which extends pairwise Markov Random Fields (MRFs) through the incorporation of an additional submodular cost function on edges, thereby enhancing their applicability, such as in image segmentation tasks. Building upon earlier work that focused on MAP inference for a subset of these models, this paper tackles marginal inference by ingeniously combining polyhedral results with prior research on variational inference. The manuscript is engaging, well-structured, and clearly written, providing a solid motivation, background, and illustrative examples. The derivation of novel convex upper bounds and concave lower bounds for log Z is a significant contribution, followed by the appropriate application of a range of existing inference methods to estimate these bounds, including Frank-Wolfe, Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), Tree-Reweated Weighting (TRW), Belief Propagation (BP), mean field, and perturb-and-MAP methods. An empirical evaluation of these methods is conducted, leading to initial conclusions and guidance. Regarding the empirical results on smaller models, it would be beneficial to clarify the method used for exact inference - presumably, a brute force approach was employed. The inclusion of a larger example from the computer vision domain is particularly useful, as it demonstrates the potential of this approach. The application of the Bethe approximation, as seen in lines 216-223, is a noteworthy idea. However, it appears that both conditions (i) and (ii) from the preceding section are necessary for the subsequent analysis, as indicated on line 224. Minor suggestions include revising the Abstract to specify "methods for approximate inference" for clarity, as the term "efficient" might be misleading given that some methods, like BP, lack guaranteed runtime. Additionally, Footnote 1 could be expanded upon in the Appendix, and several typographical corrections are recommended, such as replacing "mu" with "tau" in the equation following line 29, and modifying "an entropy" to "a concave entropy" on line 146, as well as changing "solved exactly" to "solved exactly or upper bounded" on line 236.
