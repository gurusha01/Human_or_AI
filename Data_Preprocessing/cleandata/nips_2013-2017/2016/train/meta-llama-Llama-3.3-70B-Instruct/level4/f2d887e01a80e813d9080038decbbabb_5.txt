This manuscript presents a novel approach to unsupervised risk estimation using tensor decomposition, founded on the 3-view assumption, which is subsequently utilized to develop a semi-supervised learning algorithm. The problem of risk estimation in the absence of labeled data is both intriguing and significant, and this paper attempts to address it. While some concepts are noteworthy, their novelty is questionable (as discussed below). Currently, the paper's acceptance is uncertain and will depend on the authors' rebuttal and the ensuing discussion. Several questions and comments arise: 
- The methodology relies on the 3-view assumption, treating separate pieces as experts and seeking consensus among them. Similar ideas have been explored in previous research, such as "Estimating Accuracy from Unlabeled Data: A Bayesian Approach" (ICML 2016) and related references. A comparison with this line of work would be beneficial. 
- Another relevant area of research is the "discrepancy"-based approaches proposed by Ben-David et al. and Mohri et al. for domain adaptation, which do not require the stringent 3-view assumption and provide data-dependent guarantees, unlike the results presented in this paper. 
- Is it possible to test the validity of the 3-view assumption? How realistic is this assumption, particularly for logistic regression, where it seems to be equivalent to Naive Bayes, an assumption that rarely holds? 
- What is the robustness of the results if the 3-view assumption is violated? Can this be quantified in some manner? 
- The experimental results are somewhat underwhelming, with only one dataset being used. It would be beneficial to see more comprehensive results and an exploration of the methodology's robustness. In practice, the validity of the 3-view assumption is often unknown, making it crucial to assess the methodology's robustness. 
- A section is dedicated to discussing different structures, but no corresponding experimental results are provided. It would be valuable to see these results, as well as experiments using different loss functions, given the emphasis on this aspect in the paper.
