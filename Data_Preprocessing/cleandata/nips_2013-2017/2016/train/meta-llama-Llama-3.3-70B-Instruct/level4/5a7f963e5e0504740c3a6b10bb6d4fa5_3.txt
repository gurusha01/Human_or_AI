This study presents an innovative approach by utilizing PSDDs as an alternative to factor and model counting based representations. The authors demonstrate that efficient multiplication can be achieved, leading to a streamlined algorithm for representing the Algebraic Circuit (AC) that captures the distribution of a Probabilistic Graphical Model (PGM), which is a product of factors. This research offers a novel and valuable perspective on inference in probabilistic models, with clear and detailed explanations. Although the experimental results indicate progress, the overall impact of this method is uncertain, as it may be perceived as another heuristic for representing compact ACs, which often exhibit significant performance variance across different problems. However, considering related work that has shown benefits from reducing auxiliary variables in knowledge compilation for PGMs, it is plausible that this approach could have a substantial impact. 
Detailed comments include: 
- In Algorithm 1, lines 12 and 13, the "multiply" function returns a tuple, suggesting that "P,c1" and "S,c2" should be used, and the cache calls in line 15 could be replaced with c1 and c2 for clarity. 
- Section 4, Theorem 4 lacks intuitive explanation or reference, making it challenging to fully comprehend. 
- In Section 4, lines 212 and 213, the phrase "the product AC" could be rephrased as "the resulting AC" for better accuracy. 
Minor suggestions include: 
- Section 3, line 156, requires a correction in citation format to maintain consistency.
