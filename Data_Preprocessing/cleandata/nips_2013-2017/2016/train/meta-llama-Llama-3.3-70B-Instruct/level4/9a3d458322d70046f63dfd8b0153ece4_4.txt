This manuscript presents a novel approach to robust optimization, integrating the maximization of policy performance and the minimization of transition model uncertainty into a unified framework. The proposed objective function simultaneously evaluates the performance of both the suggested policy and the baseline policy under a shared, optimized model, enabling policy improvement even in the presence of substantial uncertainty in transition probabilities. In contrast to traditional robust optimization formulations, which assess the baseline policy under the most favorable conditions and the proposed policy under the most adverse conditions, this new formulation jointly considers both policies, thereby avoiding the need to wait for the proposed policy to demonstrably outperform the baseline policy's optimal performance. Although my expertise in robust optimization is limited, I find the reformulated approach to be compelling. However, I do have concerns regarding the potential increased computational cost associated with optimizing this new formulation, particularly given that the authors have shown it to be NP-hard and have thus focused on developing approximate algorithms. One minor issue that caught my attention is the assumption that transition probabilities are known for actions aligned with the baseline policy, which seems unrealistic in the context of the energy market example provided, where actions may influence pricing; I would appreciate further clarification on this point to better understand the underlying mechanisms.
