This paper presents an extension of recent incremental algorithms, including SVRG, SAGA, and their accelerated variants via Catalyst, to tackle strongly convex-concave saddle point problems characterized by a finite sum structure. This structure can arise from two types of splits: individual or factored splits. The authors conduct a comprehensive analysis of the complexity of these algorithms under various splits and sampling strategies, including uniform and nonuniform approaches. Experimental results on a binary classification example demonstrate the importance of nonuniform sampling and acceleration in outperforming competitive batch algorithms. Although the concept of applying variance reduction and incremental algorithms to saddle point problems may seem straightforward, the findings presented here are notably innovative, and the technical aspects are undoubtedly non-trivial. For the significant bilinear saddle point problem, the authors provide a clear comparison among batch, stochastic, and incremental FB algorithms, which bears some resemblance to the convex minimization case and is logical. However, a major concern arises: while solving the saddle point problem overcomes the issue of non-separability of loss functions, the proposed incremental algorithms appear to be hindered by a fundamental bottleneck, namely, the O(n+d) cost of computing the proximal operator at each iteration. Consequently, the overall complexity, even for the accelerated SVRG with non-uniform sampling, as indicated in Tables 1 and 2, is not necessarily superior to the accelerated batch version. Specifically, when the number of data points (n) significantly exceeds the dimension (d), a common scenario in most machine learning applications, the complexity under factored splits (used in simulations) is actually inferior to that of batch FB algorithms, as shown in Table 2. Unlike the typical advantages observed in convex minimization, the theoretical benefits of using variance reduction in this context are not clearly substantial. I recommend that the authors provide an in-depth discussion on this matter and address the following questions: i) Is factored splits theoretically worse than individual splits? ii) Under what conditions is accelerated SVRG favorable against batch FB? iii) Is the dependence on n and d tight enough? Following the author's rebuttal, I remain satisfied with their response, and my evaluation scores remain unchanged.
