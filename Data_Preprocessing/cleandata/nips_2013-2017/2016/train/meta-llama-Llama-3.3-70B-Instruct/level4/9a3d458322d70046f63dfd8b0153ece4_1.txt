The paper explores the concept of robust Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), specifically focusing on the scenario where the transition probabilities are uncertain, modeled using a rectangular uncertainty set, and a baseline policy is given. The objective is to derive a new policy that guarantees performance at least as good as the baseline, referred to as safe policy improvement. A robust approach aims to maximize the worst-case performance. To ensure safety, the new policy's performance is compared to the baseline's, but since the baseline's performance is unknown, it is compared against the best possible performance of the baseline. However, this comparison might be overly pessimistic due to the difference in model selection for the robust policy and the baseline evaluation. 
A more balanced approach involves comparing the regret of the new policy to the baseline. Regret is defined as the difference in performance between the baseline policy and the new policy under the same probability model. By maximizing the negative worst-case regret within the uncertainty set, the resulting policy is guaranteed to be safe and potentially less conservative than previous methods. The paper provides a performance bound for this solution and shows that, in general, such a policy is randomized. However, the corresponding optimization problem is NP-Hard, posing a significant challenge.
To address this challenge, the paper proposes a heuristic approximation based on the observation that if there is no uncertainty when actions are selected according to the baseline policy, the problem simplifies to a standard robust MDP, solvable in polynomial time. The approximation involves setting the uncertainty for actions selected by the baseline policy to zero, assuming no model error for these actions. This is reasonable when data collection primarily follows the baseline policy with occasional exploratory actions, making the estimated model for the baseline more accurate. Although this is an approximation without a quality guarantee, empirical results show it outperforms both a standard robust MDP approach and a certainty-equivalence approach that ignores uncertainty.
Technically, the results appear sound, with standard technical tools employed. The optimization formulation is novel, while the error bound derivations are more standard. The potential impact is somewhat limited due to the finite MDP restriction and the lack of a solution guarantee. However, the paper is well-written and addresses an important problem relevant to real-world reinforcement learning applications. The formulation of the problem as an optimization issue and the provision of theoretical guarantees on the optimal solution's behavior are significant contributions. 
The suggested algorithm is straightforward, but a theoretical performance guarantee for the approximate algorithm would be preferable. Empirical results, however, are reassuring. Some areas for improvement include clarifying certain terms and concepts, such as the removal of a constant term in an algorithm, specifying the finite state and action spaces, defining norms and variables in a theorem, and explaining the concept of a randomized uncertain set. Additionally, comparing the choice of regret as an objective with existing work, such as Regan and Boutilier's "Regret-based Reward Elicitation for Markov Decision Process," would provide further context. 
Overall, the paper presents a reasonably good contribution to the field, formulating a more reasonable optimization problem than conventional robust MDP approaches, albeit with the challenge of NP-Hardness. The empirical validation of the proposed approximation algorithm, despite its lack of theoretical guarantees, demonstrates potential for practical application. Further work could build upon these findings, potentially leading to more significant real-world impacts.
