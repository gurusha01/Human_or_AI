This paper presents a cooperative inverse reinforcement learning (CIRL) framework for learning from demonstration, modeling the learning process as a two-player Markov game with identical payoffs between the demonstrator and the learner. By reformulating the computation of the Markov game as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) problem, the authors make the model computationally feasible for small-scale practical applications. The apprenticeship learning problem is formulated as a turn-based CIRL, comprising a learning phase and a deployment phase. A key contribution of this work is the demonstration that the learner's optimal reward response (policy in the deployment phase) to the CIRL model (learning phase) surpasses the performance of expert demonstrations assumed in prior inverse reinforcement learning studies. This claim is substantiated through a coffee supplier counterexample and a 2D navigation grid experimental setting. While this work appears novel and potentially useful in scenarios where the learner can interact with the demonstrator, the experimental validation seems insufficient to conclusively demonstrate the model's practical utility, particularly in the absence of experiments using real-world data. Several questions and suggestions arise: 
1. The counterexample posits different action domains for the demonstrator and the learner; does this discrepancy underlie the violation of the expert demonstrator assumption when considering the best response to the learner's policy? How would the outcomes differ if the demonstrator and learner shared the same embodiment settings?
2. Real-world experimental results are crucial for convincingly demonstrating the efficacy of CIRL in practical applications.
3. Corollary 1 lacks an interpretation of the symbol \Delta^\theta, which is presumed to represent the domain of the learner's belief, highlighting a need for clearer notation and explanation to enhance the readability and understanding of the theoretical contributions.
