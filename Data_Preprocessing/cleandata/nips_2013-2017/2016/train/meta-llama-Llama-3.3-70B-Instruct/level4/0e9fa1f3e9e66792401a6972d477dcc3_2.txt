This manuscript employs the state-of-the-art bidirectional Monte Carlo technique to assess MCMC-based posterior inference methods, providing insights into the lower bounds of KL-divergence between the true posterior and approximate distributions. The approach has been successfully implemented in WebPPL and Stan, demonstrating its practical applicability. Overall, the paper presents a compelling contribution. By leveraging recent advances in bidirectional Monte Carlo, the authors tackle a timely and intriguing problem in MCMC-based posterior inference. The concept explored is noteworthy, and I suggest accepting this paper for presentation.
