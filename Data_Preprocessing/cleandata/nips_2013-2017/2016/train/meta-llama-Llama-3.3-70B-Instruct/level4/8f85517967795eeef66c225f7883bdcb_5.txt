This manuscript presents a novel approach to deriving variational lower and upper bounds for a specific class of graphical models, referred to as cooperative graphical models. These models are an extension of pairwise graphical models, with their energy function incorporating an additional submodular function of disagreement variables. The core methodology involves formulating these bounds by identifying a corresponding pairwise graphical model and its associated polytope, which serves to upper or lower bound the original cooperative graphical model. The authors also propose algorithms for computing these bounds and provide experimental results demonstrating their application to image segmentation. The proposed cooperative graphical model is both interesting and novel, offering a lower bound and a fully convex upper bound for the partition function. Notably, the variational bounds are formulated using pairwise graphical models, such as mean field approximation and SDP, thereby allowing the application of existing variational methods for pairwise graphical models to cooperative graphical models. The authors further provide algorithms, including Frank-Wolfe, PGD, and BP, for finding these upper and lower bounds. Experimental results indicate that cooperative graphical models, along with their variational methods, outperform pairwise graphical models in image segmentation tasks. The variational bounds presented in the paper are derived by bounding the cooperative graphical model with pairwise models and leveraging existing variational bounds for pairwise models to bound the cooperative graphical model. However, the application of two bounds consecutively may result in a loose bound. Moreover, the lower bound is not tractable due to the intractability of optimizing over the polytope U(f), rendering the variational lower bound intractable as well. The authors suggest an algorithm based on block coordinate descent to find the lower bound for the proposed variational lower bound, but this algorithm only explores finite points of U(f) and may not yield a tight lower bound. The technique of constructing B(f) and U(f) appears to be generic, raising the question of whether it can be applied to a broader class of functions or other probability distributions. Additionally, the optimization objectives for the variational upper and lower bounds seem independent of the submodularity of f, although the algorithms themselves do depend on it. Several typos were noted: on page 2, lines 59-60, "for all x,y" should be "for all y,y'"; in the procedure Linear-Oracle on page 5, a closing parenthesis is missing for procedures 4 and 5; on page 6, line 211, "U(F)" should be "U(f)"; and on page 5, line 179, "smoth" should be spelled "smooth".
