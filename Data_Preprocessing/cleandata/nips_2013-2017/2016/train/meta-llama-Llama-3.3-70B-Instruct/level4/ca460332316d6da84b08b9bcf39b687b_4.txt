This manuscript presents the concept of a Product Cut in graph theory, positing that it offers a more intuitive and robust objective for graph clustering compared to existing methods. An algorithm is proposed to identify partitions that optimize the Product Cut, with experimental results indicating superior clustering performance over current approaches. The rationale behind the Product Cut is convincing, and the paper is well-structured and clearly written. However, I did not thoroughly verify the proofs and the algorithm's details for approximating the maximum Product Cut. The experimental findings on cluster purity are encouraging, demonstrating the favorable performance of PCut. Nevertheless, the results on running time (Table 2) require more detailed explanation, and the experimental setup lacks crucial information such as the machine specifications and programming language used for the algorithms. Furthermore, the manuscript does not provide a discussion on why PCut exhibits faster performance than NMFR or compare its running time with other methods. Additional considerations include the computational complexity of the problem, potentially discussing whether it is NP-hard like many existing objective functions, which could be addressed even briefly in the conclusion if a full analysis has not been completed. Several specific technical points also require clarification: the caption of Figure 1a suggests that C should be colored red; the description between lines 111-115 implies a restriction on the set of vertices in B connected to C, which should explicitly state that u0*k0 is less than or equal to n_0; the conductance formula appears to require a denominator of min(vol(A), vol(A^C)); the program being executed on line 146 is unspecified; the reference to Table 2.1 on line 152 seems incorrect and might refer to Figure 2; and a minor typo on line 209 ("close" should be "closed").
