This manuscript offers a rigorous framework for defining and quantifying the robustness of neural networks against minor input perturbations. It demonstrates the application of these definitions to assess the robustness of deep networks on the MNIST and CIFAR datasets. Furthermore, it presents a method to approximate and encode the proposed metrics using linear programming. The authors provide empirical evidence suggesting that existing approaches to robustness, which rely on adversarial examples, may result in model overfitting to these examples. Notably, the proposed approach can enhance robustness according to both existing metrics and those introduced in this work. 
The paper delivers a technically sound examination of neural network robustness to input perturbations, with a particular focus on adversarial examples. It introduces a novel formulation for defining and approximating metrics, including adversarial severity and frequency. As noted, adversarial frequency aligns with the concept of accuracy on adversarial examples used in previous studies, while severity offers a means to distinguish between neural networks with similar adversarial frequency. The technical rigor in defining these metrics, formulating a linear programming approach for their approximation, and utilizing this approach to generate adversarial examples for robustness improvement is commendable.
A key contribution lies in the restriction of analysis to the local linear regime of neural networks employing ReLU units, thereby simplifying the analysis. However, the discussion on the non-convexity of disjunctions (lines 197-212) lacks clarity regarding whether the proposed strategy yields an exact convex reformulation or another approximation. It is essential for the authors to address this ambiguity in their response, ideally by suggesting precise language that could be incorporated into the manuscript to clarify this point.
The experimental component of the work is adequately executed. A more substantial demonstration of practical impact, particularly in the CIFAR experiments, would have potentially led to an even higher evaluation. Considering the valuable contributions from the technical analysis, the LP convex optimization formulation, and the experimental work, this manuscript deserves a solid poster rating.
