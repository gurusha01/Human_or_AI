This manuscript examines a dynamic trading model in which a seller encounters a series of buyers with uncertain levels of "patience", prompting the seller to adjust the optimal price at the end of each period due to the unpredictability of buyer purchasing decisions. The paper presents an algorithm for dynamic price adjustment, yielding a tight lower bound on the seller's regret. Two key observations are noteworthy: Firstly, the model's assumption that the seller lacks knowledge of buyer patience at any given day seems oversimplified, as it is plausible that the seller would possess some prior knowledge about buyer patience that could be updated based on observations of buyers choosing not to purchase. Secondly, the paper could benefit from a clearer justification of why the buyers' behavior constitutes an optimal response to the seller's pricing algorithm, particularly given the strategic nature of the interactions between buyers and the seller; a detailed description of the equilibrium achieved under this algorithm would strengthen the analysis, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the model's implications.
