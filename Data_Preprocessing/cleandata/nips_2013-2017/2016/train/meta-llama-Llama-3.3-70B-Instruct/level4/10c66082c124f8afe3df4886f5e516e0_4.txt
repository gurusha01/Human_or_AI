This manuscript presents a supervised approach to learning document distances based on the word mover's distance (WMD), which was previously introduced as an adaptation of the earth mover's distance. The WMD calculates the optimal transport between two word distributions to determine the document distance, initially utilizing word2vec embeddings for the transport distance between words. The authors propose two key modifications: (1) applying a linear transformation to the embedded words and (2) reweighting the word distribution to enhance the separation of documents with different labels. The paper is well-organized and easy to understand, featuring a comprehensive review of related prior works that demonstrates the authors' strong grasp of the literature. The authors also provide experimental results for their algorithm on various novel datasets. However, the formulation's motivation requires further clarification, and its impact is limited. Several concerns arise: (1) The rationale behind reweighting the word distribution using 'w' is not well-justified, and this approach may alter the document's essence. A clearer explanation of how this reweighting improves the outcome without fundamentally changing the document would be necessary to validate this method. (2) The contribution of this work is not substantial, as applying a linear transformation 'A' and reweighting 'w' with an NCA objective function is a straightforward extension of WMD to a supervised setting, lacking novelty or sophistication. (3) It is unclear how the algorithm would determine the distance for a completely new document, particularly in terms of finding an appropriate reweight 'w'. (4) The term 'semantic difference' in the abstract appears to refer to the document's label, whereas differences in authorship or topic do not seem to constitute semantic differences; clarification on the intended meaning of 'semantic difference' is needed. Overall, while the paper is well-written, addressing these questions is essential to fully appreciate its value, and resolving these concerns could support the paper's acceptance.
