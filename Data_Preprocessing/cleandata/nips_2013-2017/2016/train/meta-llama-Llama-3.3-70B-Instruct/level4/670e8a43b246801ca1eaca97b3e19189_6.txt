This paper explores the clustering task using models that produce clusters with sizes increasing at a sublinear rate relative to the total number of data points, deviating from the traditional linear growth. To address this, the authors introduce the concept of the microclustering property and propose two novel models, namely the NBNB and NBD models, which adhere to this property. The defined microclustering property offers a framework for characterizing models that necessitate sublinear cluster size growth, encompassing applications such as entity resolution. The authors put forth the NBNB and NBD models as exemplars of this property and conduct a comparative analysis of their performance using real-world datasets. Although the paper is not without its limitations, notably the absence of theoretical underpinnings, it has the potential to significantly influence future research directions in clustering models.
