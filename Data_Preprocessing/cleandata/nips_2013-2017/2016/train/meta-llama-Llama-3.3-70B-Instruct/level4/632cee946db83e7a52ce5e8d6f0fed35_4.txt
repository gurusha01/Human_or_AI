The authors propose a dimensionality reduction approach for multi-class learning by exploiting the duality between Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and boosting. Specifically, SVMs determine a feature transformation and learn weights to separate classes using a decision boundary, whereas boosting fixes the codewords and learns the transformation. Leveraging this duality, the authors develop the LADDER algorithm, which iteratively updates both the codewords and the transformation efficiently. The paper is well-structured and easy to understand, with several experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach. However, my primary concern lies in the experimental section. Notably, in the hashing and retrieval experiments, the authors fail to compare their method with state-of-the-art techniques, such as SmartHash, FastHash, ShECC, OSH, and the method presented in reference [5], which their approach does not outperform. Furthermore, in the scene understanding experiment, the proposed method achieves approximately 55% accuracy on the MIT indoor dataset, whereas the state-of-the-art approach [6] has attained over 80% accuracy. To strengthen their results, the authors could consider integrating their method into a state-of-the-art approach to demonstrate potential performance improvements. Overall, while the paper presents an interesting approach, the experimental evaluation could be more comprehensive and comparative to establish the method's efficacy.
