This paper introduces a novel algorithm for addressing contextual semibandit problems, leveraging an oracle and providing rigorous proofs regarding the algorithm's regret, as well as comparative results against existing algorithms on two search-related datasets. However, the explanation of the contextual semibandits problem could be improved, as it required multiple readings and careful mapping of formal definitions to examples to fully comprehend. The problems addressed in this work are significant, challenging, and have far-reaching implications and applications, particularly in scenarios where the weights from the action list to the reward are unknown. The paper presents a compelling synergy of tackling a new problem, conducting a thorough theoretical analysis, and applying the findings to a practical dataset. Notably, the authors demonstrate a commendable level of transparency and objectivity in discussing both the insights and limitations of their proposed algorithm and results.
