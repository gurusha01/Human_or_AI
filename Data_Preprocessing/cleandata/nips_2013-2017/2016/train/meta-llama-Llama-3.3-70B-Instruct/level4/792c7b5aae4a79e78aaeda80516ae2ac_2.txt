This manuscript demonstrates the convergence of the EM algorithm to the global minimum for mean estimation in mixture-of-Gaussian distributions, yielding a significant and valuable insight into the properties of EM. The finding is both crucial and innovative, substantially enhancing our comprehension of EM. Unfortunately, due to time constraints, I was unable to thoroughly examine the proofs within the initial review period, but I intend to conduct a detailed analysis over the coming days. To my knowledge, the outcome presented appears to be unprecedented. Although I have not yet had the opportunity to assess the proof in depth, it seems complex and sophisticated. The overall result, as well as the clarity and organization of the writing and presentation, are exemplary, making the paper an enjoyable and engaging read.
