A novel regularization technique for matrix factorization is proposed, aiming to enforce sparsity and smoothness. While the existence of a solution is not theoretically established, an algorithm for obtaining a solution is provided. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of this approach over the current state-of-the-art method. A significant strength of the paper lies in the introduction of a new regularizer in the optimization problem, with experimental results showcasing the potential of this approach. However, as acknowledged by the authors, the problem is non-convex, and the existence of a solution remains unproven, with the algorithm's validity relying solely on experimental evidence. Furthermore, the writing requires improvement, as evident in line 146. Following the rebuttal, I am satisfied with the authors' response regarding the convergence of the algorithm, which prompts me to reconsider my initial rating for Clarity and Presentation, upgrading it from 2 to 3.
