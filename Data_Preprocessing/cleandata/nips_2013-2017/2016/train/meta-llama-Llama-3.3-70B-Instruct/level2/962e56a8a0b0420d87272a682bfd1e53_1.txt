This paper proposes a novel approach to deconvolve feedback loops in recommender systems, which is a crucial problem as it can help identify the true preferences of users without the influence of the recommender system. The authors develop a mathematical model of a recommender system and make several assumptions to ensure the model is tractable. They then propose an algorithm to deconvolve the feedback loops using singular value decomposition (SVD) of the observed ratings matrix.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear explanation of their approach, including the assumptions made and the mathematical derivations. The use of synthetic and real-world datasets to validate the approach is also a strength of the paper. The results show that the proposed method can effectively identify items affected by feedback loops and distinguish between datasets with and without recommender systems.
The paper has several strengths, including:
* The proposal of a novel approach to deconvolve feedback loops in recommender systems
* The use of mathematical modeling and SVD to solve the problem
* The validation of the approach using synthetic and real-world datasets
* The provision of a clear and well-written explanation of the approach
However, there are also some weaknesses and limitations, including:
* The assumptions made by the authors may not always hold in practice, which could limit the applicability of the approach
* The use of SVD may not be suitable for very large datasets, which could limit the scalability of the approach
* The paper could benefit from more discussion on the potential applications and implications of the proposed approach
Overall, I would rate this paper as a strong contribution to the field of recommender systems, and I believe it has the potential to be accepted at NIPS. The paper provides a novel approach to a important problem, and the results are well-supported by experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets.
