This paper presents a comprehensive study on linear regression and classification in the limited attribute observation (LAO) setting, where the learning algorithm can only access a limited number of attributes per example. The authors provide the first lower bounds on the precision attainable by any algorithm for several variants of regression, including linear regression with absolute loss and squared loss, as well as classification with hinge loss.
The main claims of the paper are: (1) there exists an information-theoretic lower bound on the error attainable by any algorithm for regression with absolute loss, and (2) a similar lower bound exists for classification with hinge loss. The authors also provide a general-purpose algorithm that achieves an error of O(1/âˆšd) for regression and classification with missing data.
The support for these claims is provided through a series of theorems and lemmas, which are rigorously proved using techniques from convex analysis and probability theory. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the limitations of their results and discuss potential avenues for future work.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the LAO setting and the problems they address. The technical sections are also well-organized, and the proofs are easy to follow.
The usefulness of the paper lies in its ability to provide a fundamental understanding of the limitations of learning algorithms in the LAO setting. The results have important implications for practitioners and researchers working on problems where data is limited or missing.
The paper demonstrates a good understanding of the field, and the authors are aware of the relevant literature. The references are comprehensive, and the authors provide a clear discussion of how their work relates to previous research.
The novelty of the paper lies in its ability to provide the first lower bounds on the precision attainable by any algorithm for several variants of regression and classification. The authors also provide a general-purpose algorithm that achieves a good trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency.
The significance of the paper is high, as it provides a fundamental understanding of the limitations of learning algorithms in the LAO setting. The results have important implications for a wide range of applications, including medical diagnosis, image classification, and natural language processing.
In terms of completeness, the paper provides a detailed analysis of the limitations of the results and discusses potential avenues for future work. The authors also provide a clear discussion of the implications of their results and how they relate to previous research.
The limitations of the paper are acknowledged by the authors, who discuss the potential for future work to bridge the gap between the upper and lower bounds of the precision limits. The authors also discuss the potential for extending their results to more general functions, such as classification with logistic loss.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication. The paper provides a significant contribution to the field, and the results have important implications for practitioners and researchers working on problems where data is limited or missing.
