This paper proposes a novel approach to learning a supervised document distance metric, called the Supervised Word Mover's Distance (S-WMD). The authors build upon the recently introduced Word Mover's Distance (WMD) metric, which leverages word embeddings to compute distances between documents. The key contribution of this work is the incorporation of supervision into the WMD metric, allowing it to learn a task-specific distance metric that outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on eight real-world text classification tasks.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise overview of the background and related work. The technical contributions are sound, and the experimental evaluation is thorough and convincing. The use of a relaxed version of the optimal transport problem, called the Sinkhorn distance, allows for efficient computation of the S-WMD metric.
The strengths of this paper include:
* The proposal of a novel and effective approach to learning a supervised document distance metric
* The thorough experimental evaluation, which demonstrates the superiority of S-WMD over 26 competitive baselines
* The efficient computation of the S-WMD metric, which makes it scalable to large datasets
The weaknesses of this paper include:
* The reliance on a pre-trained word embedding, which may not always be available or suitable for a given task
* The potential sensitivity of the S-WMD metric to the choice of hyperparameters, such as the learning rate and the number of nearest neighbors
Overall, this paper presents a significant contribution to the field of natural language processing and metric learning. The proposed S-WMD metric has the potential to be widely adopted in various text classification tasks, and the authors' thorough evaluation and analysis provide a solid foundation for future research.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel and effective approach to learning a supervised document distance metric
* The experimental evaluation is thorough and convincing, demonstrating the superiority of S-WMD over state-of-the-art baselines
