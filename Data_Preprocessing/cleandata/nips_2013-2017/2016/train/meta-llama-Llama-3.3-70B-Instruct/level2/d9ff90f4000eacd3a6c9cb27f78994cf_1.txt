This paper proposes a novel approach to training unitary recurrent neural networks (uRNNs) by optimizing the recurrence matrix over all unitary matrices, leading to significantly improved performance over uRNNs that use a restricted-capacity recurrence matrix. The authors provide a theoretical argument to determine if a unitary parameterization has restricted capacity and show that a recently proposed unitary parameterization has restricted capacity for hidden state dimension greater than 7. They also propose a method for stochastic gradient descent for training the unitary recurrence matrix, which constrains the gradient to lie on the differentiable manifold of unitary matrices.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their contributions. The theoretical argument is sound, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The authors also provide a thorough comparison with existing methods, including LSTMs and restricted-capacity uRNNs.
The strengths of the paper include:
* A clear and concise explanation of the theoretical argument and the proposed method
* A thorough comparison with existing methods
* Strong experimental results that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes a significant amount of background knowledge in recurrent neural networks and unitary matrices, which may make it difficult for non-experts to follow
* The experimental results are mostly focused on synthetic data, and it would be beneficial to see more results on natural data
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the authors provide a significant contribution to the field of recurrent neural networks. The proposed approach has the potential to improve the performance of uRNNs and address the vanishing and exploding gradient problems.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper provides a novel approach to training uRNNs that has the potential to improve their performance
* The theoretical argument is sound, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach
* The paper provides a thorough comparison with existing methods
Arguments against acceptance:
