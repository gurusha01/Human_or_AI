This paper proposes a novel approach to training restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) using the smooth Wasserstein distance, which takes into account the metric of the data. The authors derive the gradient of the Wasserstein distance from its dual formulation and use it to effectively train an RBM. The paper demonstrates the practical potential of this approach on data completion and denoising tasks, where the metric between observations plays a crucial role.
The main claims of the paper are:
1. The proposed approach can learn distributions that are better from a metric perspective, as measured by the Wasserstein distance.
2. The Wasserstein-trained RBM outperforms the standard RBM on practical tasks such as completion and denoising.
The support for these claims comes from:
1. Theoretical analysis of the Wasserstein distance and its gradient, which provides a solid foundation for the proposed approach.
2. Experimental results on three datasets (MNIST-small, UCI PLANTS, and MNIST-code), which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in learning distributions that are closer to the true data distribution in terms of the Wasserstein distance.
3. Comparison with standard RBMs and other models (such as kernel density estimation), which shows that the Wasserstein-trained RBM performs better or comparably on completion and denoising tasks.
The strengths of the paper include:
1. The proposal of a novel approach to training RBMs, which takes into account the metric of the data.
2. The derivation of the gradient of the Wasserstein distance, which provides a solid foundation for the proposed approach.
3. The experimental results, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on practical tasks.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
1. The reliance on a specific metric (the Hamming distance) for the experiments, which may not be representative of all possible metrics.
2. The lack of comparison with other distance metrics, such as the Euclidean distance or the Mahalanobis distance.
3. The limited scope of the experiments, which only consider completion and denoising tasks.
Overall, the paper presents a novel and interesting approach to training RBMs, which has the potential to improve the performance of these models on practical tasks. However, further research is needed to fully explore the potential of this approach and to address the limitations of the current paper.
