This paper introduces a new class of Bayesian models for clustering, called Kolchin partition (KP) models, which can exhibit the microclustering property. This property is essential for applications like entity resolution, where the size of each cluster should remain small even for large data sets. The authors define the microclustering property and show that infinitely exchangeable clustering models, including finite mixture models, Dirichlet process mixture models, and Pitman-Yor process mixture models, do not exhibit this property.
The paper presents two specific KP models, the negative binomial-negative binomial (NBNB) model and the negative binomial-Dirichlet (NBD) model, and demonstrates their ability to exhibit the microclustering property. The authors compare these models to two infinitely exchangeable clustering models, the Dirichlet process mixture model and the Pitman-Yor process mixture model, using four entity-resolution data sets. The results show that the NBNB and NBD models outperform the infinitely exchangeable models for most data sets, especially when the data is noisy.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the microclustering property and the KP models. The experimental results are thorough and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed models. The paper also provides a good review of the related work and highlights the limitations of infinitely exchangeable clustering models.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The introduction of a new class of Bayesian models for clustering that can exhibit the microclustering property.
* The demonstration of the effectiveness of the proposed models using four entity-resolution data sets.
* The clear explanation of the microclustering property and the KP models.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes that the reader is familiar with Bayesian nonparametrics and clustering models, which may limit its accessibility to a broader audience.
* The experimental results are limited to four data sets, and it would be beneficial to see more extensive experiments on a wider range of data sets.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the proposed models show promise for applications like entity resolution. The authors provide a clear explanation of the microclustering property and the KP models, and the experimental results demonstrate their effectiveness.
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The paper introduces a new class of Bayesian models for clustering that can exhibit the microclustering property.
