This paper introduces a novel framework for multi-way graph partitioning based on a multiplicative cut-based objective, referred to as the Product Cut. The authors provide a detailed analysis of the mathematical properties of this objective and propose an effective algorithm for its optimization. The paper is well-structured, and the ideas are clearly presented.
The main claims of the paper are: (1) the Product Cut objective provides a distinctive way to incorporate classical notions of a quality partition, and (2) the proposed algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark data sets. The support for these claims comes from a combination of theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors show that the Product Cut objective has a non-vanishing lower bound, which leads to superior stability properties and performance compared to the Normalized Cut objective.
The paper is practically useful, as it provides a new approach to graph partitioning that can be applied to various real-world problems. The algorithm is simple to implement, and the authors provide a clear description of the optimization procedure. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm on several data sets, including text and image data.
The paper reflects common knowledge in the field, and the authors demonstrate a good understanding of relevant literature. The references are comprehensive, accessible, and relevant, with proper citations. The novelty of the work lies in the introduction of the Product Cut objective and the proposed algorithm for its optimization.
The paper is complete, providing sufficient details for reproducibility. The authors discuss the limitations of their approach, including the potential for early termination in the optimization procedure. However, they also propose a randomized version of the algorithm to address this issue.

* A clear and well-structured presentation of the ideas
