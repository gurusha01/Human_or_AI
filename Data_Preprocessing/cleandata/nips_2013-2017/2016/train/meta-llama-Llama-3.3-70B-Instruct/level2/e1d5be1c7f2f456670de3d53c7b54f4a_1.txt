This paper presents two oracle-based algorithms, VCEE and EELS, for the contextual semibandit problem, which is a variant of the bandit problem where the learner receives additional feedback about each individual item in a composite action. The main claims of the paper are that VCEE achieves a near-optimal regret bound of ˜O(pKLT logN) when the linear function relating the semibandit feedback to the reward is known, and that EELS achieves a regret bound of ˜O(T2/3(K logN)1/3) when the linear function is unknown.
The support for these claims comes from a combination of theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation. The theoretical analysis provides regret bounds for both algorithms, which are derived using techniques from online learning and statistical estimation. The empirical evaluation compares the performance of VCEE with other contextual semibandit approaches on two large-scale learning-to-rank datasets, and demonstrates that VCEE outperforms these approaches, especially when using a rich policy class.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the problem, the algorithms, and the theoretical results. The empirical evaluation is also well-designed, and the results are presented in a clear and easy-to-understand manner.
The usefulness of the ideas presented in the paper is high, as they provide a new approach to solving the contextual semibandit problem, which is an important problem in many applications, such as recommendation systems and personalized search. The algorithms presented in the paper are also computationally efficient, which makes them suitable for large-scale applications.
The paper demonstrates a good understanding of the field, and the authors provide a thorough review of the related work. The novelty of the paper is also high, as it presents new algorithms and theoretical results that improve upon existing approaches.
The completeness of the paper is good, as it provides all the necessary details for reproducing the results. The limitations of the paper are also acknowledged, and the authors provide a clear discussion of the potential limitations and future directions.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, as it presents a significant contribution to the field of online learning and provides a new approach to solving the contextual semibandit problem.
