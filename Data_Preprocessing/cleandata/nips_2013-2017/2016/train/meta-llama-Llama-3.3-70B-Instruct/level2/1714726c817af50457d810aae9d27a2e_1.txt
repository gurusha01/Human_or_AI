This paper presents a study on accelerated descent dynamics for constrained convex optimization, focusing on a family of Accelerated Mirror Descent (AMD) dynamics with a generalized averaging scheme. The authors provide sufficient conditions on the weight functions to guarantee a desired convergence rate in continuous time and propose an adaptive averaging heuristic that preserves the convergence rate. The paper is well-written, and the authors demonstrate a good understanding of the field, citing relevant literature and providing a clear explanation of the concepts.
The main claims of the paper are: (1) the authors provide a unified study of AMD dynamics using a Lyapunov function, (2) they give sufficient conditions on the weight functions to guarantee a desired convergence rate, and (3) they propose an adaptive averaging heuristic that preserves the convergence rate. The support for these claims is strong, with a clear and detailed analysis of the AMD dynamics and the adaptive averaging heuristic.
The paper is practically useful, as it provides a new perspective on accelerated descent dynamics and proposes a heuristic that can be used to improve the convergence rate of first-order methods. The authors also provide numerical experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness of the adaptive averaging heuristic compared to other restarting heuristics.
The paper reflects common knowledge in the field, with a clear understanding of convex optimization, mirror descent, and accelerated methods. The authors cite relevant literature and provide a clear explanation of the concepts, demonstrating a good understanding of the field.
The novelty of the paper lies in the proposal of the adaptive averaging heuristic, which preserves the convergence rate of the AMD dynamics. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the AMD dynamics and the adaptive averaging heuristic, which is a significant contribution to the field.
The paper is complete, with a clear and detailed analysis of the AMD dynamics and the adaptive averaging heuristic. The authors provide sufficient details for reproducibility, including numerical experiments and a clear explanation of the algorithms.
The limitations of the paper are acknowledged by the authors, who note that the adaptive averaging heuristic is proposed for a specific class of problems (simplex-constrained problems) and that further investigation is needed to extend the results to other problems.
In conclusion, the paper is well-written, and the authors demonstrate a good understanding of the field. The main claims are well-supported, and the paper is practically useful, with a clear and detailed analysis of the AMD dynamics and the adaptive averaging heuristic. The paper reflects common knowledge in the field and proposes a novel heuristic that preserves the convergence rate of the AMD dynamics.
