This paper proposes a novel extension to the Information Bottleneck (IB) method, a principled approach to extract relevant aspects of data. The authors introduce a variational approximation to the IB objective function, which allows for efficient optimization and application to high-dimensional and non-Gaussian data. The resulting algorithm, called sparse IB, is able to recover sparse features that are relevant to the input data and a separate set of variables of interest.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the IB method and its limitations. The proposed variational approximation is well-motivated, and the authors provide a detailed derivation of the algorithm. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the sparse IB algorithm in recovering sparse features and outperforming existing methods, such as Gaussian IB and kernel ridge regression.
The paper has several strengths. Firstly, the proposed algorithm is novel and addresses a significant limitation of the IB method. Secondly, the authors provide a thorough analysis of the algorithm, including a detailed derivation and experiments on various datasets. Thirdly, the paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the IB method and its limitations.
However, there are some limitations to the paper. Firstly, the authors could provide more discussion on the relationship between the sparse IB algorithm and other sparse coding methods, such as L1-regularized regression. Secondly, the authors could provide more experiments on real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm in practice. Thirdly, the authors could provide more analysis on the computational complexity of the algorithm and its scalability to large datasets.
