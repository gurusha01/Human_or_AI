This paper proposes a spectral analysis method for nonlinear dynamical systems using the Koopman operator in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs). The main claim of the paper is that the proposed method can provide a modal decomposition of the dynamics into a finite number of modes, which can be used as a feature extraction procedure for nonlinear dynamical systems. The authors support this claim by providing a theoretical framework for the method, as well as empirical examples using synthetic and real-world data.
The paper is well-written and clearly organized, with a good balance between theoretical and empirical contributions. The authors provide a thorough review of related work, including dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) and other spectral analysis methods. The proposed method is shown to be an extension of DMD, with the key difference being the use of RKHSs to approximate the Koopman eigenfunctions.
The strengths of the paper include:
* A clear and concise presentation of the theoretical framework for the proposed method
* A thorough review of related work, including DMD and other spectral analysis methods
* Empirical examples using synthetic and real-world data to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method
* A discussion of potential applications of the proposed method, including prediction, sequential change-point detection, and recognition of dynamic patterns
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes a strong background in functional analysis and operator theory, which may make it difficult for some readers to follow
* The empirical examples are limited to a few simple systems, and it is not clear how well the method will perform on more complex systems
* The paper does not provide a clear comparison with other spectral analysis methods, such as DMD, in terms of computational efficiency and accuracy
Overall, the paper is well-written and provides a significant contribution to the field of nonlinear dynamical systems. The proposed method has the potential to be a useful tool for analyzing and understanding complex systems, and the empirical examples provide a good illustration of its effectiveness.
