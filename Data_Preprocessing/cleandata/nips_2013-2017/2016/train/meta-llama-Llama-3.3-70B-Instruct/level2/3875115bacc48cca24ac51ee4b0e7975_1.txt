This paper presents two fundamental results on the population likelihood function of Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) with M â‰¥ 3 components. The first result shows that the population likelihood function has bad local maxima, even in the special case of equally-weighted mixtures of well-separated and spherical Gaussians. The second result demonstrates that the EM algorithm, as well as its first-order variant, with random initialization, converges to bad critical points with high probability.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, including the necessary background and motivation. The main results are stated clearly, and the proofs are provided in the appendix. The paper also includes a discussion of the implications of the results and some open problems.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The results are significant and resolve an open question in the field.
* The paper provides a clear and concise introduction to the problem and the necessary background.
* The proofs are well-organized and easy to follow.
* The paper includes a discussion of the implications of the results and some open problems.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes a high level of background knowledge in statistics and machine learning, which may make it difficult for non-experts to follow.
* Some of the proofs are technical and may require a significant amount of time to understand.
* The paper could benefit from more numerical experiments to illustrate the results and provide a better understanding of the practical implications.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication. The results are significant, and the paper is well-written and easy to follow. The authors have made a valuable contribution to the field, and the paper will be of interest to researchers in statistics and machine learning.
