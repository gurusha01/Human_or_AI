This paper presents a novel approach to estimating the coefficients of generalized linear models (GLMs) in the large-scale setting where the number of observations is much larger than the number of predictors. The authors show that the GLM coefficients are approximately proportional to the corresponding ordinary least squares (OLS) coefficients, and design an algorithm, called Scaled Least Squares (SLS), that achieves the same accuracy as the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) with a significantly reduced computational cost.
The main claims of the paper are: (1) the GLM coefficients are approximately proportional to the OLS coefficients, (2) the SLS algorithm achieves the same accuracy as the MLE with a reduced computational cost, and (3) the algorithm has a cubic convergence rate and a per-iteration cost of O(n), which is cheaper than other batch optimization algorithms by at least a factor of O(p).
The support for these claims is provided through a combination of theoretical analysis and numerical experiments. The authors prove that the GLM coefficients are approximately proportional to the OLS coefficients under certain conditions, and show that the SLS algorithm achieves the same accuracy as the MLE in a variety of numerical experiments. The experiments demonstrate that the SLS algorithm outperforms other optimization algorithms, including Newton-Raphson, BFGS, and gradient descent, in terms of computational cost and convergence rate.
The usefulness of the ideas presented in the paper is significant, as they provide a novel approach to estimating GLM coefficients in large-scale settings. The SLS algorithm has the potential to be widely used in practice, particularly in applications where the number of observations is very large and computational cost is a concern.

The novelty of the paper is significant, as it presents a new approach to estimating GLM coefficients that is based on the proportionality relationship between the GLM and OLS coefficients. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the theoretical properties of the SLS algorithm, and demonstrate its effectiveness in a variety of numerical experiments.
The completeness of the paper is good, as the authors provide a clear and detailed presentation of the SLS algorithm and its theoretical properties. The paper includes a thorough analysis of the numerical experiments, and the authors provide a clear discussion of the results and their implications.
The limitations of the paper are acknowledged by the authors, who note that the SLS algorithm is based on an approximation of the GLM coefficients, and that the accuracy of the algorithm may depend on the specific problem and data. The authors also note that the algorithm may not be suitable for all types of GLMs, and that further research is needed to fully understand its properties and limitations.
