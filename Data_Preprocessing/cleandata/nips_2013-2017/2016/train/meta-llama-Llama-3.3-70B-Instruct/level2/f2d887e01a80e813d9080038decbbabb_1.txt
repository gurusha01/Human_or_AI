This paper presents a novel approach to unsupervised risk estimation, which is the problem of estimating a model's test error from unlabeled data, without assuming that the test distribution is close to the training distribution. The authors propose a method that relies on conditional independence structure, making no parametric assumptions about the true distribution. The approach applies to a large family of losses, including the log and exponential loss, and extends beyond classification tasks to conditional random fields.
The main claim of the paper is that, under certain conditional independence assumptions, it is possible to estimate the risk of a model from unlabeled data, with a sample complexity that depends on the number of classes, but not on the dimension of the parameters. The authors provide a detailed analysis of the method, including a proof of the main result, and demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments on a modified MNIST dataset.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The method is based on a clear and well-motivated set of assumptions, which are weaker than those required by previous approaches to domain adaptation and semi-supervised learning.
* The approach is flexible and can be applied to a wide range of losses and model structures.
* The authors provide a detailed analysis of the method, including a proof of the main result, and demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The three-view assumption, which is the most restrictive part of the framework, may not always hold in practice.
* The method requires a seed model that can distinguish between classes in expectation, which may not always be available.
* The sample complexity of the method may be high, especially for large numbers of classes.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of machine learning, and the approach has the potential to be widely applicable. However, further research is needed to address the limitations of the method and to explore its potential applications in practice.
