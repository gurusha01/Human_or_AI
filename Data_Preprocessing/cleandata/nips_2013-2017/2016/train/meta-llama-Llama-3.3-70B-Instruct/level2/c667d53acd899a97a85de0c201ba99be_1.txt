This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of automated mechanism design, specifically in the context of combinatorial auctions. The authors provide the first sample complexity analysis for the standard hierarchy of deterministic combinatorial auction classes, which is a crucial step in understanding how to relate the performance of mechanisms in the search space over input samples to their expectation over the underlying, unknown distribution.
The paper's main claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and mathematical proofs. The authors derive tight sample complexity bounds for various auction classes, including Affine Maximizer Auctions (AMAs), Virtual Valuation Combinatorial Auctions (VVCAs), Î»-auctions, Mixed Bundling Auctions (MBAs), and Mixed Bundling Auctions with Reserve Prices (MBARPs). These bounds provide valuable insights into the number of samples required to guarantee that the empirical revenue of a designed mechanism is close to its expected revenue.
The paper's strengths include its rigorous theoretical analysis, clear notation, and well-organized structure. The authors also provide a comprehensive review of related work, highlighting the significance of their contributions. The use of learning theory tools, such as Rademacher complexity and pseudo-dimension, adds depth to the analysis and demonstrates the authors' expertise in the field.
However, the paper's complexity and technicality may make it challenging for non-experts to follow. Some sections, such as the proof of Theorem 2, are highly technical and may require careful reading. Additionally, the paper assumes a strong background in mechanism design, learning theory, and optimization, which may limit its accessibility to a broader audience.
In terms of novelty, the paper presents a significant improvement over existing work in the field. The authors' sample complexity analysis provides a foundation for understanding the performance of automated mechanism design algorithms, which is a crucial step towards developing more efficient and effective mechanisms.
The paper's significance is evident in its potential impact on the field of mechanism design. The authors' results can be used to inform the design of more efficient and effective combinatorial auctions, which have numerous applications in economics, operations research, and computer science.
