This paper introduces Sparse Access Memory (SAM), a novel neural memory architecture that enables efficient training of neural networks with large external memories. The main claim of the paper is that SAM achieves asymptotic lower bounds in space and time complexity, making it suitable for real-world applications. The authors support this claim through a combination of theoretical analysis and experimental results.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear overview of the background and related work in the field. The introduction of SAM is motivated by the limitations of existing memory-augmented neural networks, such as Neural Turing Machines (NTMs) and Memory Networks, which scale poorly in both space and time as the amount of memory grows.
The authors evaluate the performance of SAM on a range of synthetic and natural tasks, including algorithmic tasks, question answering, and one-shot learning. The results show that SAM achieves significant speedups and memory reductions compared to existing models, while maintaining comparable performance. The authors also demonstrate the ability of SAM to generalize to longer sequences and larger memories.
The paper has several strengths, including:
* The introduction of a novel and efficient memory architecture that addresses the scalability limitations of existing models.
* A thorough evaluation of the performance of SAM on a range of tasks, including synthetic and natural tasks.
* A clear and well-written presentation of the results, including detailed descriptions of the experimental setup and hyperparameter settings.
However, there are also some limitations and potential areas for improvement:
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the trade-offs between the sparse and dense models, including the effects of sparsity on learning and generalization.
* The authors could provide more insight into the choice of hyperparameters, such as the number of non-zero entries in the sparse read and write operations.
* The paper could be improved by including more comparisons to other state-of-the-art models and techniques, such as reinforcement learning-based approaches to scaling memory architectures.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of neural memory architectures, and the results demonstrate the potential of SAM to enable efficient training of neural networks with large external memories. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and thorough evaluation of the performance of SAM.
