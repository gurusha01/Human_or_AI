This paper proposes a novel model-based approach to compute a safe policy in sequential decision-making under uncertainty. The approach aims to improve upon a given baseline strategy by minimizing the negative regret with respect to the baseline policy. The authors formulate an optimization problem that captures this idea and analyze its properties, including the possibility of randomized policies, performance bounds, and computational complexity.
The paper's main claims are:
1. The proposed approach can improve upon the baseline policy by combining it with a learned policy on a state-by-state basis.
2. The optimization problem is NP-hard, but approximate algorithms can be effective.
3. The approach outperforms standard methods, such as solving the simulator or robust MDP, in terms of solution quality and safety.
The support for these claims is provided through:
1. Theoretical analysis of the optimization problem, including the derivation of performance bounds and the proof of NP-hardness.
2. Experimental evaluation on several domains, including a grid problem and an energy arbitrage problem, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the problem, the proposed approach, and the experimental results. The use of examples and figures helps to illustrate the key concepts and ideas.
The strengths of the paper are:
1. The proposal of a novel approach to compute safe policies, which addresses the limitations of existing methods.
2. The thorough theoretical analysis of the optimization problem, which provides insights into its properties and challenges.
3. The experimental evaluation, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach in various domains.
The weaknesses of the paper are:
1. The complexity of the optimization problem, which may limit its applicability to large-scale problems.
2. The reliance on approximate algorithms, which may not always provide optimal solutions.
3. The need for further experimentation and evaluation to fully understand the benefits and limitations of the proposed approach.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of sequential decision-making under uncertainty, and the proposed approach has the potential to improve the safety and performance of policies in various applications.
