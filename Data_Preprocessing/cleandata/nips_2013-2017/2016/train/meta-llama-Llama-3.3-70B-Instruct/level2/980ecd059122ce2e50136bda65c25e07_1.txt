This paper proposes a novel approach to measuring the robustness of neural networks by encoding the robustness property as a constraint system. The authors introduce two statistics, adversarial frequency and adversarial severity, to quantify the robustness of a neural network. They also develop an algorithm, called ALP, to approximate the pointwise robustness of a neural network, which is shown to be more accurate than existing algorithms.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their approach. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in estimating the robustness of neural networks, and the results show that the algorithm can be used to improve the robustness of neural networks.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel approach to measuring the robustness of neural networks, which is based on encoding the robustness property as a constraint system.
* The introduction of two statistics, adversarial frequency and adversarial severity, to quantify the robustness of a neural network.
* The development of an algorithm, called ALP, to approximate the pointwise robustness of a neural network, which is shown to be more accurate than existing algorithms.
* The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in estimating the robustness of neural networks.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes that the neural network is piecewise linear, which may not be the case for all neural networks.
* The algorithm ALP is not guaranteed to find the global optimum, and the authors rely on an iterative constraint solving optimization to improve the efficiency of the algorithm.
* The paper does not provide a thorough analysis of the computational complexity of the algorithm, which may be a concern for large-scale neural networks.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their approach. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in estimating the robustness of neural networks, and the results show that the algorithm can be used to improve the robustness of neural networks.
