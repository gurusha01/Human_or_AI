This paper presents a novel approach to exploration in non-tabular reinforcement learning by introducing the concept of pseudo-counts, which generalize visit counts to non-tabular settings. The authors derive pseudo-counts from a density model over the state space and show that they are closely related to information gain, a commonly used measure of novelty or curiosity. The paper provides a thorough analysis of the properties of pseudo-counts, including their asymptotic behavior, and demonstrates their effectiveness in guiding exploration in several Atari 2600 games.
The main claims of the paper are: (1) pseudo-counts provide a generalized notion of visit counts in non-tabular settings, (2) pseudo-counts are closely related to information gain, and (3) using pseudo-counts as an exploration bonus leads to improved performance in several Atari 2600 games. The paper supports these claims through a combination of theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the concepts and techniques used. The analysis of the properties of pseudo-counts is thorough, and the empirical evaluation is convincing. The paper also provides a good overview of the related work in the field, highlighting the connections to intrinsic motivation and information-theoretic quantities.
The strengths of the paper include: (1) the introduction of a novel concept (pseudo-counts) that generalizes visit counts to non-tabular settings, (2) the thorough analysis of the properties of pseudo-counts, and (3) the convincing empirical evaluation. The weaknesses of the paper include: (1) the assumption that the density model is learning-positive, which may not always be the case, and (2) the lack of a clear understanding of the induced metric over the state space.
Overall, I believe that this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of reinforcement learning and exploration. The concept of pseudo-counts has the potential to be widely applicable, and the paper provides a solid foundation for future research in this area. I would recommend accepting this paper for publication.
