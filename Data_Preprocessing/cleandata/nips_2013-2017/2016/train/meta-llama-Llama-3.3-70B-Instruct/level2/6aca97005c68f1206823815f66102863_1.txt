This paper proposes a novel approach to likelihood-free inference based on Bayesian conditional density estimation. The main claim of the paper is that this approach can learn a parametric approximation to the exact posterior distribution of a simulator-based model, which can be made as accurate as required, and can do so more efficiently than traditional Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) methods.
The paper is well-written and clearly organized, with a thorough introduction to the problem of likelihood-free inference and the limitations of traditional ABC methods. The authors provide a detailed description of their proposed approach, including the use of Bayesian neural networks and stochastic variational inference. The paper also includes a comprehensive review of related work in the field.
The experiments presented in the paper demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on several benchmark problems, including a mixture of two Gaussians, Bayesian linear regression, the Lotka-Volterra predator-prey population model, and the M/G/1 queue model. The results show that the proposed approach can learn accurate parametric approximations to the posterior distribution, and can do so more efficiently than traditional ABC methods.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel approach to likelihood-free inference that can learn a parametric approximation to the exact posterior distribution.
* The use of Bayesian neural networks and stochastic variational inference to learn the posterior distribution.
* The comprehensive review of related work in the field.
* The thorough experimental evaluation of the proposed approach on several benchmark problems.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The complexity of the proposed approach, which may make it difficult to implement and tune in practice.
* The requirement for a large number of simulations to learn the posterior distribution, which may be computationally expensive.
* The lack of a clear comparison to other parametric approaches to likelihood-free inference, such as synthetic likelihood.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of likelihood-free inference, and the proposed approach has the potential to be more efficient and accurate than traditional ABC methods. However, further work is needed to fully evaluate the proposed approach and to make it more accessible to practitioners.
