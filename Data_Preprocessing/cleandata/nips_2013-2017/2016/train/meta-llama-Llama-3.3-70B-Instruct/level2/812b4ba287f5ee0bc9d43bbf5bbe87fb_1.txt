This paper proposes a novel Tree-structured Reinforcement Learning (Tree-RL) approach for object localization, which incorporates global interdependency between objects into the search process. The main claim of the paper is that Tree-RL can achieve comparable recall rates to state-of-the-art object proposal algorithms, such as RPN, with significantly fewer candidate windows. The paper also claims that Tree-RL can provide more accurate localizations and achieve higher detection mAP when combined with a Fast R-CNN detector.
The support for these claims comes from extensive experiments on the PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012 datasets, which demonstrate the effectiveness of Tree-RL in localizing multiple objects with a small number of windows. The paper also provides a detailed analysis of the Tree-RL approach, including the design of the reward function, the tree-structured search scheme, and the deep Q-learning algorithm used to learn the optimal policy.
The usefulness of the proposed approach is evident in its ability to reduce the number of candidate windows required for object localization, which can lead to significant computational savings in object detection systems. The paper also demonstrates the potential of Tree-RL in improving the accuracy of object detection systems, particularly when combined with a Fast R-CNN detector.
The paper reflects a good understanding of the field, with correct use of terms and evidence of understanding of relevant literature. The authors provide a clear and concise overview of the related work, including object proposal algorithms and active object search with visual attention. The paper also provides a comprehensive list of references, which demonstrates the authors' familiarity with the field.
The novelty of the paper lies in its proposal of a tree-structured reinforcement learning approach for object localization, which allows the agent to travel along multiple near-optimal paths to discover multiple objects. The paper also introduces a new reward function that encourages the agent to balance the exploration of uncovered new objects and the refinement of covered ones.
The completeness of the paper is evident in its provision of sufficient details for reproducibility, including the implementation details of the Tree-RL approach and the experimental setup. The paper also discusses the limitations of the approach, including the potential for the agent to be trapped in the endless refinement of a single object.
Overall, the paper presents a significant improvement over existing approaches to object localization, and its ideas are practically useful and have the potential to be used in real-world applications. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the proposed approach and its experimental evaluation.
