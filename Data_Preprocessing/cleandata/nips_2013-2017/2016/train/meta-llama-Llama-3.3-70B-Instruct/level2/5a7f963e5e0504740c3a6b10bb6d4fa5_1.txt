This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of probabilistic graphical models, specifically in the representation and manipulation of probability distributions using arithmetic circuits. The authors investigate the tractability of two fundamental operations on arithmetic circuits: multiplying two circuits and summing out a variable from a circuit. They show that both operations are intractable for some influential classes of arithmetic circuits, but that a recently proposed subclass, called Probabilistic Sentential Decision Diagrams (PSDDs), supports a polytime multiplication operator.
The paper is well-written, clearly organized, and provides a thorough introduction to the background and motivation of the research. The authors provide a detailed explanation of the PSDD representation and its properties, including its ability to support polytime multiplication. They also present an algorithm for multiplying two PSDDs, which is shown to be sound and efficient.
The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed compilation algorithm for probabilistic graphical models into PSDDs. The results show that the compiled PSDDs are often smaller than those obtained using other methods, and that the compilation time is reasonable.
The paper has several strengths, including:
* A clear and concise introduction to the background and motivation of the research
* A thorough explanation of the PSDD representation and its properties
* A sound and efficient algorithm for multiplying two PSDDs
* Experimental results that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed compilation algorithm
However, the paper also has some weaknesses, including:
* The lack of a clear comparison to other related work, such as Algebraic Decision Diagrams (ADDs) and Algebraic Sentential Decision Diagrams (ASDDs)
* The limited scope of the experimental results, which only consider Markov networks and do not provide a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed algorithm
Overall, I would rate this paper as a strong accept, as it presents a significant contribution to the field of probabilistic graphical models and provides a thorough and well-written explanation of the research. The paper has the potential to make a significant impact in the field, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper presents a significant contribution to the field of probabilistic graphical models
* The PSDD representation and its properties are thoroughly explained
* The algorithm for multiplying two PSDDs is sound and efficient
* The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed compilation algorithm
Arguments for rejection:
* The lack of a clear comparison to other related work
* The limited scope of the experimental results
However, I believe that the strengths of the paper outweigh its weaknesses, and that it should be accepted.
