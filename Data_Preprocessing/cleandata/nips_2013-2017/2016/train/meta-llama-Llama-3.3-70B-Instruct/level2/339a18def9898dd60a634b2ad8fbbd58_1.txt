This paper presents a novel approach to modeling and analyzing digital crowdsourcing (CS) using an information theoretic rate-distortion framework. The authors aim to identify the ultimate fidelity that can be achieved by any form of query from the crowd and any decoding algorithm with a given budget. The paper introduces a communication system model for crowdsourcing, where the crowd is modeled as a set of parallel noisy channels, and the query scheme and inference are represented as a joint source channel coding scheme.
The paper makes several key contributions, including the introduction of a new query scheme called k-ary incidence coding (kIC) and the analysis of its performance. The authors also derive information theoretic bounds on the minimum number of queries per item required to achieve a certain level of fidelity. The paper provides a thorough analysis of the crowdsourcing problem, including the modeling of worker skill levels and the impact of spammer-hammer workers on the system.
The paper is well-written and well-organized, with clear explanations of the technical concepts and notation. The authors provide a comprehensive review of related work in the field and clearly position their contributions within the existing literature. The paper includes numerical results and simulations to illustrate the performance of the proposed kIC scheme and to compare it with existing approaches.
The strengths of the paper include its novel approach to modeling crowdsourcing, its thorough analysis of the problem, and its clear and concise writing style. The paper also provides a useful framework for understanding the fundamental limits of crowdsourcing and for designing optimized crowdsourcing systems.
However, there are some limitations to the paper. For example, the authors assume that the worker skill levels are unknown or perfectly known, which may not always be the case in practice. Additionally, the paper focuses primarily on binary labeling tasks, and it is not clear how the results would generalize to more complex tasks or datasets.
Overall, I would rate this paper as a strong accept. The paper makes significant contributions to the field of crowdsourcing and provides a thorough and well-written analysis of the problem. The results are well-supported by numerical simulations and provide a useful framework for understanding the fundamental limits of crowdsourcing.
