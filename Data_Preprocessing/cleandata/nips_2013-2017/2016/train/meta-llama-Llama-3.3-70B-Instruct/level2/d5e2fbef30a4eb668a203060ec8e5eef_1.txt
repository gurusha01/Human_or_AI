This paper introduces a novel feature selection approach called CMICOT, which is an extension of filter methods with sequential forward selection (SFS) based on conditional mutual information (MI). The main claim of the paper is that CMICOT can identify joint interactions between multiple features, filling the gap of MI-based SFS techniques with high-order dependencies. The authors support this claim by proposing a novel saddle point (max-min) optimization problem to build a scoring function that can capture high-order feature interactions.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the proposed method and its components. The use of a two-stage greedy search and binary representatives of features makes the approach efficient and effective in practice. The experimental evaluation on synthetic and real datasets demonstrates the superiority of CMICOT over existing interaction-aware SFS-based filters and state-of-the-art filters.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel feature selection approach that can identify high-order feature interactions
* The use of a two-stage greedy search and binary representatives of features to make the approach efficient and effective
* The comprehensive experimental evaluation on synthetic and real datasets
* The comparison with existing interaction-aware SFS-based filters and state-of-the-art filters
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The complexity of the proposed method, which may make it difficult to understand and implement for some readers
* The limited analysis of the time complexity of the proposed method, which may be a concern for large-scale datasets
* The lack of comparison with other feature selection methods, such as wrapper and embedded methods
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the proposed method shows promising results. However, further analysis and comparison with other feature selection methods are needed to fully evaluate the effectiveness of CMICOT.
