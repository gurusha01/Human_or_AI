This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of machine learning by studying fast learning rates for heavy-tailed losses. The authors introduce two new conditions, the multi-scale Bernstein's condition and the integrability of the envelope function, which enable the analysis of fast rates for unbounded losses. The paper provides a comprehensive framework for deriving fast learning rates and applies it to the problem of k-means clustering with heavy-tailed source distributions.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of the mathematical framework and the proofs of the theorems. The results are novel and extend existing work in the literature. The authors also provide a thorough discussion of the related work and the implications of their results.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The introduction of the multi-scale Bernstein's condition, which is a more general and proper assumption for studying fast rates for unbounded losses.
* The derivation of fast learning rates for heavy-tailed losses, which is a significant improvement over existing results.
* The application of the framework to k-means clustering with heavy-tailed source distributions, which is an important problem in machine learning.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes that the hypothesis class has a finite VC-dimension, which may not be the case in practice.
* The paper does not provide a clear path for verifying the multi-scale Bernstein's condition in practice, which may limit the applicability of the results.
* The paper does not compare the results with other existing methods for handling heavy-tailed losses, such as robust estimators.
Overall, the paper is well-written and presents a significant contribution to the field of machine learning. The results are novel and have important implications for practice. However, the paper could be improved by addressing the weaknesses mentioned above.
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The paper presents a significant contribution to the field of machine learning.
