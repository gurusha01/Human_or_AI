This paper presents a theoretical analysis of the robustness and consistency properties of a variant of the classical quadratic k-means algorithm, called robust k-means (RKM). The authors provide a detailed description of the optimality conditions for the associated minimization problem and show that RKM shares the computational simplicity of quadratic k-means.
The paper's main claims are that RKM has a universal breakdown point of 2/n, meaning that two outliers in a dataset are enough to breakdown the algorithm, and that the algorithm exhibits desirable noise robustness when restricted to "well-structured" datasets. The authors also show that the consistency properties of quadratic k-means still remain valid for this robust variant.
The support for these claims is provided through a combination of theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors use variational analysis and subdifferential calculus to derive the necessary conditions for the optimality of the cluster centers, and they provide a detailed description of the properties of the Moreau envelope and the proximal map. The experimental results demonstrate that RKM performs similarly to trimmed k-means, another robust variant of k-means, in terms of clustering accuracy, cluster estimation error, and outlier detection.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the technical details. The use of mathematical notation is consistent throughout the paper, and the authors provide a detailed appendix with proofs of the main results.
The usefulness of the ideas presented in the paper is evident, as RKM provides a computationally efficient and robust alternative to quadratic k-means. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of RKM in handling outliers and noise in the data, which is a common problem in many real-world applications.
The field knowledge demonstrated by the authors is excellent, as they provide a thorough review of the relevant literature and demonstrate a deep understanding of the technical concepts. The novelty of the paper lies in the theoretical analysis of RKM and the derivation of the optimality conditions, which provides new insights into the properties of the algorithm.
The completeness of the paper is good, as the authors provide a detailed description of the technical details and provide a clear explanation of the results. The limitations of the paper are acknowledged by the authors, who note that RKM is not robust against any type of contamination and any type of datasets.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication, as it provides a significant contribution to the field of robust clustering and demonstrates the effectiveness of RKM in handling outliers and noise in the data.
