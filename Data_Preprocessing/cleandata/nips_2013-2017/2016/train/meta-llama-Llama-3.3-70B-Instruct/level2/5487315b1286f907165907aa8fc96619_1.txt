This paper proposes a convex relaxation of two-layer conditional models with latent structured representation. The authors develop a framework that captures latent structure and estimates model parameters jointly and optimally. The flexibility of the model is demonstrated on two structures based on total unimodularityâ€”graph matching and linear chain. Experimental results confirm the promise of the method.
The main claims of the paper are: (1) the proposed convex relaxation of two-layer conditional models with latent structured representation is effective, and (2) the method outperforms local training and other state-of-the-art approaches on two prediction problems with latent structure.
The support for these claims comes from the theoretical analysis of the convex relaxation and the experimental results on two datasets. The authors provide a detailed derivation of the convex formulation and demonstrate its effectiveness on graph matching and inpainting tasks. The experimental results show that the proposed method, CVX, outperforms the state-of-the-art approach, Local, on the transliteration task and CRF-AE on the inpainting task.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the proposed method and its theoretical foundations. The experimental results are thorough and well-presented, and the authors provide a detailed comparison with other state-of-the-art approaches.
