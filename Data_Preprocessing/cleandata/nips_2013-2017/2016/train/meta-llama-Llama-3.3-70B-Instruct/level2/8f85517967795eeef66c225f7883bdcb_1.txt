This paper presents a novel approach to inference in discrete probabilistic models with cooperative interactions, which are more expressive than traditional pairwise or log-supermodular models. The authors introduce cooperative graphical models, which retain structure that can be exploited for efficient inference techniques. They develop variational upper and lower bounds on the partition function, combining polyhedral structure of submodular functions with variational inference methods.
The paper's main claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors provide a comprehensive review of related work, including variational inference methods for pairwise models and log-supermodular models. They also introduce new notation and background on submodularity, which is essential for understanding the paper's contributions.
The paper's strengths include its novelty, technical soundness, and clarity. The authors present a clear and well-organized exposition of their ideas, making it easy to follow their arguments. The experimental results demonstrate the efficacy and scalability of their approach, including a real-world image segmentation task.
However, there are some limitations to the paper. The authors assume that the function f is submodular, which may not always be the case in practice. Additionally, the optimization problems involved in computing the upper and lower bounds can be computationally expensive, although the authors provide efficient algorithms to solve them.
The paper's significance lies in its potential to advance the state of the art in discrete probabilistic modeling and inference. The authors' approach can be applied to a wide range of problems, including computer vision, natural language processing, and statistical physics.
