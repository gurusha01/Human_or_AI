This paper proposes a novel approach to domain adaptation in deep neural networks, which enables the joint learning of adaptive classifiers and transferable features from labeled data in the source domain and unlabeled data in the target domain. The authors relax the shared-classifier assumption made by previous methods and assume that the source classifier and target classifier differ by a residual function. They propose a Residual Transfer Network (RTN) approach, which uses a residual block to bridge the source classifier and target classifier, and a tensor product to fuse features of multiple layers for feature adaptation.
The paper is well-written and clearly explains the motivation, methodology, and experimental results. The authors provide a thorough review of related work and demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on several benchmark datasets, including Office-31 and Office-Caltech. The results show that the RTN approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, including Deep Domain Confusion (DDC), Deep Adaptation Network (DAN), and Reverse Gradient (RevGrad).
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel approach to domain adaptation that jointly learns adaptive classifiers and transferable features.
* The use of a residual block to bridge the source classifier and target classifier, which is a key innovation of the paper.
* The thorough experimental evaluation on several benchmark datasets, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach.
* The clear and well-organized writing style, which makes the paper easy to follow.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The assumption that the source classifier and target classifier differ by a residual function may not always hold in practice.
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the sensitivity of the approach to hyperparameters, such as the tradeoff parameters λ and γ.
* The paper could also benefit from a more detailed comparison with other state-of-the-art methods, such as adversarial training approaches.
Overall, the paper is well-written and proposes a novel approach to domain adaptation that has the potential to improve the state-of-the-art in this area. The experimental results are convincing, and the paper provides a good contribution to the field.
