This paper presents a theoretical analysis of the support recovery guarantees of underdetermined sparse regression using the `1-norm as a regularizer and a non-smooth loss function for data fidelity. The authors focus on the cases of `1 and `∞ losses and provide a sharp condition that ensures the support of the vector to recover is stable to small additive noise in the observations. The paper also includes numerical simulations to illustrate the theoretical findings on a compressed sensing scenario.
The main claims of the paper are: (1) the authors provide a sharp analysis for the polyhedral cases α ∈ {1,+∞} that allows one to control the deviation of the support of the minimizer from the true support; (2) they identify an "extended support" and show that this extended support is stable to small additive noise; and (3) they provide numerical simulations to illustrate the theoretical findings.
The support for these claims is provided through a combination of theoretical analysis and numerical simulations. The authors use a novel proof strategy to establish the stability of the support recovery, which is different from the classical approach developed for smooth loss functions. The numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and provide insights into the behavior of the support recovery under different noise models.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the theoretical results and numerical simulations. The use of notation is consistent throughout the paper, and the authors provide a detailed explanation of the mathematical concepts and techniques used.
The paper has several strengths, including: (1) it provides a novel proof strategy for establishing the stability of support recovery; (2) it includes numerical simulations to illustrate the theoretical findings; and (3) it provides insights into the behavior of support recovery under different noise models.
