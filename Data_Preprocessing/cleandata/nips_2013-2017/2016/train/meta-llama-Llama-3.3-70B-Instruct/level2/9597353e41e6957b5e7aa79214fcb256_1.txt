This paper proposes a framework for Semi-Supervised Active Clustering (SSAC) where the learner interacts with a domain expert through same-cluster queries to improve clustering performance. The authors introduce a novel notion of clusterability, called the γ-margin property, and demonstrate that access to a limited number of query answers can turn an otherwise NP-hard clustering problem into a feasible one.
The main claims of the paper are: (1) the introduction of the SSAC framework, and (2) the demonstration that access to a reasonable number of same-cluster queries can enable efficient solutions to otherwise NP-hard problems. The authors provide a probabilistic polynomial-time algorithm for clustering with queries that succeeds under the assumption that the input satisfies the γ-margin condition for γ > 1. They also show that without access to query answers, k-means clustering is NP-hard even when the solution satisfies the γ-margin property for γ = √3.4.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their framework and results. The technical contributions of the paper are significant, and the authors demonstrate a good understanding of the related work in the field. The paper is well-organized, and the authors provide a clear overview of their results and their implications.
The strengths of the paper include: (1) the introduction of a novel framework for semi-supervised active clustering, (2) the demonstration of the effectiveness of the framework in improving clustering performance, and (3) the provision of a probabilistic polynomial-time algorithm for clustering with queries.
The weaknesses of the paper include: (1) the assumption that the domain expert is always available and willing to answer queries, and (2) the lack of experimental evaluation of the proposed framework.
In terms of novelty, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of clustering, as it introduces a new framework for semi-supervised active clustering and demonstrates its effectiveness in improving clustering performance.
In terms of significance, the paper has the potential to impact the field of clustering and machine learning, as it provides a new approach to improving clustering performance through interactive learning.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication, as it presents a significant contribution to the field of clustering and machine learning. However, I would suggest that the authors consider addressing the weaknesses of the paper, such as the assumption of availability of the domain expert and the lack of experimental evaluation, in future work.
