This paper presents a novel approach to speeding up the computation of low-rank tensor CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition, a fundamental tool in modern data analytics. The authors propose a sparse alternating least squares (SPALS) method, which samples intermediate steps of alternating minimization algorithms to reduce computational costs. The key innovation is the exploitation of the spectral structures of the matrix Khatri-Rao product, allowing for efficient access to statistical leverage scores. This enables the development of a sublinear-time algorithm that approximates the output of deterministic alternating least squares algorithms.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, related work, and their contributions. The technical sections are detailed and well-organized, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the SPALS method, showing significant speedups over existing randomized and deterministic routines for performing CP decomposition.
The strengths of the paper include:
1. Novelty: The authors propose a new approach to speeding up CP decomposition, which is a significant contribution to the field.
2. Technical soundness: The paper provides a thorough analysis of the spectral structures of the matrix Khatri-Rao product and its application to leverage score estimation.
3. Experimental evaluation: The authors provide a comprehensive experimental evaluation of their method, demonstrating its effectiveness on both dense and sparse data.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
1. Limited scope: The paper focuses on CP decomposition, which might limit its applicability to other tensor decomposition methods.
2. Complexity: The technical sections can be challenging to follow for readers without a strong background in linear algebra and tensor analysis.
To improve the paper, the authors could consider:
1. Providing more context: Adding more background information on tensor decomposition and its applications could help readers understand the significance of the authors' contributions.
2. Simplifying technical sections: Breaking down complex technical arguments into smaller, more manageable pieces could make the paper more accessible to a broader audience.
3. Exploring extensions: Discussing potential extensions of the SPALS method to other tensor decomposition methods or applications could increase the paper's impact and relevance.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the authors' contributions are significant. With some minor revisions to address the weaknesses mentioned above, the paper has the potential to make a substantial impact in the field of tensor analysis and data analytics.
