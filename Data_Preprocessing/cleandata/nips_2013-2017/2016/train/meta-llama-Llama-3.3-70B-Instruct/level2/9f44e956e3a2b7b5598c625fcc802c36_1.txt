This paper proposes a novel approach to improving the performance of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) by introducing a mechanism called "fast weights" that allows each new state of the hidden units to be attracted towards recent hidden states in proportion to their scalar products with the current state. The authors argue that this form of attention to the recent past can be used to store temporary memories of the recent past and provide a neurally plausible way of implementing the type of attention to the past that has recently proved very helpful in sequence-to-sequence models.
The paper is well-written and clearly explains the concept of fast weights and how they can be used to improve the performance of RNNs. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the benefits of using fast weights, including the ability to store temporary memories of the recent past and to implement a form of attention to the recent past. The paper also provides a detailed comparison of the performance of RNNs with fast weights to other models, including LSTMs and convolutional neural networks.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel approach to improving the performance of RNNs
* A thorough analysis of the benefits of using fast weights
* A detailed comparison of the performance of RNNs with fast weights to other models
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes a significant amount of background knowledge in neural networks and machine learning, which may make it difficult for non-experts to understand
* The paper could benefit from more detailed explanations of the mathematical derivations and the implementation of the fast weights mechanism
* The paper could also benefit from more extensive experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach
Overall, the paper is well-written and provides a significant contribution to the field of machine learning. The proposal of fast weights as a mechanism for improving the performance of RNNs is novel and has the potential to be widely applicable.
