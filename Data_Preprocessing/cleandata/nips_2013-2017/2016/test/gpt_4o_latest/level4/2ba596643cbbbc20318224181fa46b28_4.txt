The authors present a novel framework termed Multi-fidelity Multi-armed Bandit. In this setup, arms can be sampled at varying levels of fidelity, each associated with a specific cost. Lower fidelity samples, while less expensive, are drawn from distributions that approximate the highest fidelity distribution. The authors propose an algorithm that adapts to the sequence of available approximations and costs, along with its regret analysis and a lower bound for the problem. They also provide numerical simulations on synthetic problems, demonstrating that their algorithm outperforms UCB. The proposed framework is intriguing and has the potential to be impactful if further developed. However, in its current form, I find the paper unsuitable for publication. 
1/ The introduction of notations is confusing and scattered, making it difficult to locate their definitions. For instance, the variable $s$ is not defined until a page after its first appearance and is then rarely used throughout the paper (this became clear only after the rebuttal). 
2/ The use of advertising as an example is misleading in certain aspects. The paper frequently draws correlations with ad display time and non-stationarity, but non-stationarity is irrelevant to the context of this work. It might be more appropriate to use a different example (see 4/).
3/ The justification for the regret analysis in this setting is unclear. Regret analysis typically aims to maximize long-term gain by identifying the arm with the best reward-to-cost ratio. However, in this framework, the optimal policy always corresponds to the arm with the highest mean, irrespective of its associated cost. Consequently, the optimal policy is constrained by the requirement to sample the best arm at lower fidelity levels, which may obscure the cost implications of unnecessary low-fidelity sampling.
4/ A sample complexity analysis (or more specifically, a cost complexity analysis) could be highly relevant in the context of Multi-fidelity Multi-armed Bandits. This could be motivated by scenarios such as prototype testing during the development of new products. Here, the objective is to identify the best product with high probability while minimizing the cumulative cost of the testing phase prior to mass production. Due to regulations, contracts, and existing infrastructure, companies are often compelled to rely on low-fidelity approximations before conducting advanced and expensive tests.
5/ Some portions of the text are difficult to follow. A thorough revision to streamline the paper would likely improve its readability and clarity.
