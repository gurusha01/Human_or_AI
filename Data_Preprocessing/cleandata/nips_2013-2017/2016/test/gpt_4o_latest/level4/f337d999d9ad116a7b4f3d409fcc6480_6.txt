This paper addresses a method for mapping the connectivity between "voxels of a template brain" using multiple viral injections that trace the anatomy of the associated neurons. Over the past decade, viral techniques in connectomics have gained significant traction. Recently, the Allen Institute released a dataset employing such an approach. In this work, the authors enhance the connectivity inference routine presented in that original study. The proposed method offers a reasonable approach to connectivity inference and demonstrates improved performance compared to the baseline, which assumes uniform connectivity within brain regions. In this regard, the proposed method can be viewed as a relaxation of the baseline assumption. I find this approach valuable for uncovering overarching connectivity patterns, akin to diffusion MRI. However, the smoothness constraint may partially undermine the ability to capture the intricate details of neuroanatomy. A discussion of the linear model would be beneficial, as it assumes fluorescence increases linearly with the injection sites. Additionally, the composite dataset, derived from multiple brains to create a template brain, requires further clarification. Lastly, expressions such as "the number of voxels in the brain" should be avoided for greater precision.
