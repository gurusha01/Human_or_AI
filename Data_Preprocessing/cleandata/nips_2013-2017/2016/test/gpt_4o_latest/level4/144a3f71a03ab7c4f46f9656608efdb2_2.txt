The authors propose a method that utilizes a predefined set of ancestral constraints to guide the (admissible) heuristic in an exhaustive search algorithm. I found the experimental setup somewhat unclear. Specifically, Table 1 appears to compare (EC + proposed method) against (GOB + modified method), while Table 3 seems to compare EC directly to GOB (or am I misunderstanding this?). It would be helpful to explicitly compare (EC + proposed method) to EC alone. While the comparison of (GOB + modified method) to GOB is interesting, EC seems to significantly outperform GOB overall. Thus, even if GOB benefits more than EC from the proposed method, the results would likely still favor (EC + proposed method).
