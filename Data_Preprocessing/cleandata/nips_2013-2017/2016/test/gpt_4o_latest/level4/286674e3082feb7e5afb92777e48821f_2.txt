The paper establishes a relationship between various clustering distance measures. It examines network models such as the Preference Frame Model (PFM) and the Stochastic Block Model (SBM), demonstrating a locally convex-like property for clustering. Specifically, it is shown that any two clusterings that equally well estimate the parameters of the model fitted to network data are also close to each other in terms of misclassification distance measures. The paper highlights an interesting property of clusterings in network data, proving the equivalence between different clustering distance measures for such data. Both theoretical and experimental validations of the stated results are provided. While the results are novel, there has been recent work in the network literature with a similar focus, such as Peng, Sun, and Zanetti (COLT, 2015) and Chao, Lu, Ma, and Zhou (Arxiv, 2015). The theoretical contributions of the paper are relatively straightforward extensions of well-established results. Although the paper mentions potential applications in detecting clusterability, it does not provide formal results in this direction. Overall, the paper is well-written and effectively conveys its core ideas in a clear and accessible manner.
