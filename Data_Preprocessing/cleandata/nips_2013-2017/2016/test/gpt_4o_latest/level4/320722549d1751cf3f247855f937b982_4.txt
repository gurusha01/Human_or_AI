In this paper, the authors propose a novel approach to address the classical problems of learning with expert advice (LEA) and online linear optimization (OLO) in Hilbert spaces. Their method involves reducing these two problems to another well-studied problem, the coin-betting problem. By leveraging an existing coin-betting protocol, the authors derive parameter-free algorithms for both LEA and OLO. The algorithm for the LEA problem achieves a regret bound that improves upon prior results, while the algorithm for the OLO problem matches the regret bound of an existing method. However, there appears to be an error in the proof of Lemma 14, which raises concerns about the validity of Corollaries 5 and 6. Specifically, the second inequality below line 430 is incorrect: it should be \(\leq\) rather than \(\geq\), as \(\ln(1+x) \leq x - (1-\ln(2))x^2\). Despite this issue, we suspect that Lemma 14 remains valid, though its proof requires revision. Assuming this error can be resolved, the paper is compelling because it introduces a fresh perspective on designing online algorithms by establishing an unexpected connection to the coin-betting problem, a topic with a rich history of research. Through this connection, the authors successfully transform an existing coin-betting protocol into new parameter-free algorithms for LEA and OLO. The parameter-free nature of these algorithms eliminates the need for parameter tuning, which is a notable strength of the work. Furthermore, the paper is generally well-written and accessible. 
That said, we identify two potential weaknesses. First, the potential function employed in this work is relatively complex and lacks intuitive appeal, which might limit its broader applicability. It is unclear whether alternative potential functions can be easily designed to produce other online algorithms, as is possible with the mirror-descent framework. Second, the OLO problem addressed by the proposed algorithm is the unconstrained version, rather than the more widely studied constrained variant. It remains uncertain whether the techniques introduced in this paper can be extended to handle the more general OLO problem over arbitrary convex feasible sets.
