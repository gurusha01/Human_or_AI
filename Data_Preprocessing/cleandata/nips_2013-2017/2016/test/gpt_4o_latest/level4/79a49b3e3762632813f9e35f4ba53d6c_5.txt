This paper addresses the challenge of estimating class prior probabilities when only positive and unlabeled examples are available, with the added complexity of label noise. While the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms competing methods, the paper lacks a compelling motivation for why solving this problem is of significant importance. As a result, despite finding no major flaws in the work, I find it difficult to recommend acceptance. That said, I acknowledge my limited expertise in this specific area and remain open to being convinced otherwise by the authors or other reviewers.
The paper proposes a method to estimate the prior probability of an example being positive, given access only to positively labeled and unlabeled examples, under the assumption of potential label noise. The approach models the two distributions (positive and negative examples) as mixtures of base distributions with varying mixture weights. It then jointly learns the parameters of these mixtures using either a parametric approach (Gaussian Mixture Models) or a nonparametric one (AlphaMax, which I am not familiar with). Additionally, the paper establishes sufficient and necessary conditions for the identifiability of class priors. The experimental evaluation spans a variety of datasets and demonstrates that the proposed methods significantly outperform existing alternatives.
I am conflicted about this paper. On one hand, it is technically sound: prior work is appropriately cited, the theorems and methods are clearly presented, and the experiments are thorough. On the other hand, I have several concerns that make me lean towards rejection. My primary issue is the lack of a strong justification for the importance of the problem being addressed. While the paper mentions molecular biology and social networks as potential application domains, it does not convincingly articulate how better class prior estimation would lead to meaningful advancements in these areas. Without this, it is difficult to see how the work could pave the way for impactful real-world applications.
Second, the theoretical contributions feel limited. The identifiability condition presented in the paper appears overly restrictive and unlikely to hold in practice. Specifically, the requirement that there exists an \(x\) where one density is zero and the other is positive seems unrealistic, particularly when dealing with empirical distributions. This condition either always holds (for empirical distributions) or almost never holds (for smoothed distributions), which diminishes the practical relevance of the theorems. Consequently, the theoretical results do not seem to provide significant new insights into the problem.
Finally, the proposed method depends on density estimation, which is notoriously challenging in high-dimensional spaces. While the authors acknowledge this limitation in the abstract, all the datasets used in the experiments are low-dimensional (\(d < 128\)), which contrasts sharply with domains like molecular biology, where dimensionality is typically much higher. This discrepancy raises concerns about the method's scalability and applicability to real-world problems in such domains.
Update After Authors' Feedback and Discussion  
After reviewing the authors' feedback and revisiting the paper, I realized I had overlooked a critical detail: the specific approach used to reduce the original high-dimensional problem to a unidimensional one. I appreciate the authors clarifying this point and have adjusted my score accordingly. However, I still find the lack of concrete real-world applications for this algorithm problematic, which keeps my assessment of its potential impact low. Since this remains my primary concern, I am still inclined to recommend rejection, though I will not strongly oppose acceptance due to my limited confidence in this area.
