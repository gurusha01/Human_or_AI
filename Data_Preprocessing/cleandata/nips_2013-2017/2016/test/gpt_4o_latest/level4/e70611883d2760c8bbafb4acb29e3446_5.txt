The paper builds upon the random features framework for kernel machines introduced by Rahimi and Recht by proposing an efficient optimization method to enable kernel learning. The empirical results demonstrate its effectiveness. While the mathematical derivations are somewhat challenging to follow in detail, the critical components appear to be sound. The heuristic aspect of the approach clearly impacts its efficiency, but this has not been explicitly analyzed. Additionally, the performance evaluation is limited to comparisons with the previous method using three different kernels. It would be valuable to see how the proposed method performs against other well-known efficient approaches, especially given the paper's claim of general superiority.
