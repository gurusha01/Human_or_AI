This concise paper generalizes the standard multivariate normal density by substituting the Euclidean metric with a locally adaptive Riemannian metric. This leads to an extension of the normal distribution tailored to the manifold learning framework, demonstrating broad applicability (as evidenced by the experiments provided). Notably, the paper succinctly presents a complete parameter estimation procedure based on maximum likelihood. The extension to a mixture of LANDS enhances its practicality as a viable alternative to the now widely used GMM. The experiments are highly compelling (at least from this reviewer's perspective) and pave the way for extensive future research. The language, structure, bibliography, and alignment with the NIPS scope are all excellent.
