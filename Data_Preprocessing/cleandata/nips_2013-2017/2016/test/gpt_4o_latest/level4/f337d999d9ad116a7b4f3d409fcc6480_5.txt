The paper presents a method for estimating a weights matrix that represents neural connectivity in the brain. The approach integrates multiple machine learning techniques. The findings have the potential to be highly significant for neuroscientists. As this topic falls outside my area of expertise, my evaluation focuses solely on the technical contribution, specifically the originality of the proposed algorithm.
