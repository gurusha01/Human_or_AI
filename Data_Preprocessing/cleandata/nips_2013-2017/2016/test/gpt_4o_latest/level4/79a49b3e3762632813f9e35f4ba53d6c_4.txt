A Bayesian classification framework is proposed for estimating positive-only labels, primarily designed for noise-prone applications. The authors present theoretical results to highlight key properties of their method, complemented by empirical evaluations. From a theoretical perspective, the analysis is comprehensive and well-aligned with the problem at hand. While the proofs appear correct, I did not verify them line-by-line due to time limitations. However, the section on univariate transformation lacks significant innovation. This approach is suboptimal for handling large datasets, and it remains unclear how much information is lost in the process. Such methods may also be challenging to justify to practitioners. The authors assert that their method is robust to noise and effective for high-dimensional data. The robustness claim is supported by theoretical arguments, and the authors make a compelling case overall. Empirical results in Table 2 further reinforce this claim, though some uncertainty remains. While the proposed technique frequently outperforms others, the row-to-row (and column-to-column) comparisons under the Laplace distribution exhibit considerable variability, potentially due to excessive noise. On real-world datasets, the method achieves 19 wins out of 36 cases, with 12 being statistically significant, but it is also significantly outperformed in 11 cases. I appreciate the authors' transparency in presenting both their successes and failures (e.g., retaining the concrete dataset despite weaker results). Comparisons with prior work are appropriate and thorough. Overall, the proposed approach appears to be a reliable option. The primary weakness of the paper lies in the lack of practical evaluation regarding the algorithm's scalability with increasing sample size (n). For instance, no details are provided on the runtime for the Shuttle dataset. While the authors acknowledge susceptibility to the curse of dimensionality and note that other methods share this limitation, a more detailed analysis of scalability is expected at this level of venue. Although the paper claims robustness to high-dimensional data, the depth of analysis on this aspect is insufficient.
