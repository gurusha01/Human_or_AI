This paper addresses the challenge of identifying an optimal Bayesian network configuration. Specifically, the authors demonstrate how to integrate non-decomposable constraints, particularly ancestral constraints, into the structure learning framework proposed by Chen et al. [2015, 2016]. The empirical evaluation of the proposed method, compared to ILP-based approaches, reveals significant performance improvements. The authors reformulate the problem as a MaxSAT problem with tailored constraints. Although my familiarity with this specific approach is limited, the reported results (runtime comparisons) appear highly compelling. Notably, the authors achieve a runtime reduction by several orders of magnitude compared to existing methods.
