The paper addresses the challenge of estimating the power consumption of individual household appliances based on time series data of total energy usage. The authors approach this problem using an additive factorial HMM model and employ several innovative techniques for inference, including formulating the problem as a convex semidefinite relaxation, applying random rounding, and utilizing an efficient and scalable alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). They demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on a simulated dataset. The paper explores a compelling problem and is well-written. The proposed solution, though intricate and comprising multiple components, is presented in a step-by-step manner, with each stage logically building on the previous one. The paper is self-contained and accessible, even to readers unfamiliar with the domain. However, one aspect that remains unclear after reading is how the number of appliances is determined. It would be helpful if the authors could expand on this point in Section 5. Additionally, it would be valuable to understand how sensitive this choice is during the empirical evaluation.
