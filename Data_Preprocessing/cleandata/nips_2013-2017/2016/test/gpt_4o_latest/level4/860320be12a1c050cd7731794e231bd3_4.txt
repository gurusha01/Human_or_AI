The paper introduces three complexity measures for recurrent neural networks: 1) recurrent depth, 2) feedforward depth, and 3) recurrent skip coefficients. Through experiments conducted on tasks such as parsing, language modeling, program modeling, and image modeling, the study assesses the significance of these complexity measures in various applications. In my opinion, the paper offers a valuable empirical analysis of how different complexity measures impact performance. This evaluation holds considerable utility for the research community.
