The paper introduces a visual attention method leveraging an RRSVM classifier. RRSVM identifies image categories using a sparse set of regions. Visual features are extracted through a deep neural network (VGG16). To enable multi-object detection within an image, a biological mechanism, IOR, is incorporated into the RRSVM's optimization objective to promote diversity during training. The proposed approach demonstrates competitive performance on visual search tasks involving both single and multiple objects. While the adoption of IOR in the paper is reasonable, a sensitivity analysis of IOR-related parameters is necessary, as the suppression area can influence the prediction accuracy for multi-objects at varying scales. This could also provide insights into some failure cases illustrated in Figure 3. Another concern pertains to the experiments in Table 1. The proposed SDR utilizes VGG16 as the feature extractor and RRSVM as the classifier, with the paper's novelty centered on the RRSVM classifier rather than the feature extractor. Consequently, experiments should employ a consistent feature extractor across all methods. However, RCNN and CAM rely on different feature extractors, which obscures the specific contribution of RRSVM.
