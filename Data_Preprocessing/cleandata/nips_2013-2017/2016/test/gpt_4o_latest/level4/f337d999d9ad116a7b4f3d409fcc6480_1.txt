This paper introduces a structured regression model designed to infer neural connectivity from viral tracing data. By integrating a nonnegativity constraint, a spatial smoothness regularizer, a low-rank assumption, and a masking mechanism to address ambiguity at the injection site, the authors develop a model capable of leveraging observed tracer data to deduce the underlying connectivity. While the individual components of this approach have been studied in other structured regression contexts, this work provides a comprehensive and well-executed application of these techniques to a compelling scientific problem. The core model is a non-negative linear regression, y = Wx + \eta, where \eta is sampled from a spherical Gaussian distribution. The weight matrix, W, is constrained to be nonnegative and is modeled probabilistically using a spatially smooth prior. Additionally, the model allows for an optional low-rank assumption on the weight matrix, which can significantly enhance memory efficiency in large-scale scenarios. Although the individual elements of this framework (nonnegative regression, Laplacian regularized least squares, low-rank constraints) are well-established, this paper presents a thoughtful integration and application of these methods to a real-world problem. The exposition of the model, the synthetic experiments, and the real-world applications (including supplementary movies) are particularly clear and well-presented. 
While it is valid to directly construct an objective function that incorporates both the reconstruction error and the domain-specific constraints and inductive biases, adopting a probabilistic perspective could reveal additional extensions and connections to related work. For instance, Jonas and Kording [1] address a similar connectomics problem by proposing a probabilistic generative model with latent variables for each neuron. Although their approach differs in framing (unsupervised modeling versus regression), a similar set of latent variables could potentially serve as a prior for your weight matrix. Furthermore, from a probabilistic standpoint, the Gaussian noise model may not be entirely realistic given the nonnegative nature of fluorescence observations. Similarly, the assumption of spherical covariance could be overly restrictive. While these simplifications may be computationally advantageous and justifiable, they warrant further discussion. Lastly, the orthogonal projector, P_{\Omega}, appears to be a somewhat elaborate way of stating that the loss function sums only over observable voxels.
