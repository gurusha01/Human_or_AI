This paper establishes broad concentration guarantees for community detection problems using spectral clustering techniques. The authors derive these guarantees across various generative models without relying on any specific parameters from those models. The work is engaging, highly relevant, and contributes meaningfully to advancing a prominent area of research in a significant direction. The paper addresses an intriguing question regarding the stability of solutions in community detection and presents these results in a highly general framework, while also applying them to well-known graphical models of interest. The manuscript is exceptionally well-written, making it both accessible and enjoyable to read. The authors effectively justify their choices in defining error metrics and the assumptions required for their proofs. My primary critique, which the authors themselves acknowledge in their conclusion, is that the proofs depend on spectral algorithms and results that are not tight and can become nearly intractable for many challenging community detection problems, particularly in the case of very sparse graphs. Nonetheless, this work represents a strong initial step toward developing stability results for community detection, and I look forward to seeing further progress in this area in the future.
