The paper introduces algorithms for estimating class priors and posteriors using noisy positives and unlabeled data. The approach closely follows the methodology outlined in Jain et al., 2016, which was limited to the pure positives scenario. The proposed improvements over Jain et al. are demonstrated through simulations. 
1. A recent work [1] (referenced below) is not cited, despite the fact that the authors of [1] present advancements over Jain et al., 2016. It would be beneficial to compare the proposed methodology against [1*], both theoretically and through simulations.  
2. Considering Jain et al., the novelty and technical depth of the proofs appear to be somewhat limited.
