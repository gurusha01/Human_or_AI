The paper explores the regret associated with sequential prediction in nonstationary environments. It introduces a parameter, Î›, which represents the variance of the loss distributions throughout the process. The study examines this parameter and its influence on prediction regret, particularly its interaction with other distributional characteristics, such as the frequency of distributional changes and the magnitude of distributional deviations over time. Additionally, the paper derives a lower bound for the regret. While the work shows potential, it appears to be incomplete. Including experimental results to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms would enhance the robustness and credibility of the theoretical findings. The abstract is unclear and requires rewriting. Symbols and parameters are not adequately defined, and their context (e.g., equations, algorithms, etc.) is not explicitly stated, leading to confusion. This issue is also present in the introduction. For instance, on page 2, line 44, the term UCB is used without definition. Overall, the clarity of the paper needs significant improvement. Furthermore, the bibliography should be expanded to include relevant works from the literature on best expert tracking.
