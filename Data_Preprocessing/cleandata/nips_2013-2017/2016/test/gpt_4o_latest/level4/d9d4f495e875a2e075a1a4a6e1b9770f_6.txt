The authors present a model designed to predict video pixels based on conditioned actions. Additionally, they intend to release a dataset comprising 50k robot interactions as part of their contribution. The model is evaluated not only on the proposed robot interaction dataset but also on human motion prediction tasks. While the model and the dataset creation process are well-explained, the figures illustrating the predictions are difficult to interpret. It would have been highly beneficial if the authors had included supplementary video material to better demonstrate the results.
