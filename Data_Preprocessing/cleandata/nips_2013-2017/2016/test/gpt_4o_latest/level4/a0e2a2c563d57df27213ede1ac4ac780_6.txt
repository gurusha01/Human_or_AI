This paper proposes a novel approach that adapts the Region Ranking SVM (RRSVM) into a biologically plausible model of visual attention. Since the RRSVM prioritizes a limited number of non-uniform regions within the visual field for classification, it is logical that these regions are the most salient for decision-making. By determining a fixation sequence based on the RRSVM and incorporating an inhibition of return mechanism, the method enables visual search to focus on critical areas while reducing the likelihood of revisiting previously attended regions. The results demonstrate behavior consistent with physiological observations, as well as performance that is either superior to or on par with comparable methods. Additionally, the paper identifies scenarios where the algorithm performs suboptimally, which is valuable for understanding both the strengths and limitations of the approach, providing a solid foundation for future research. The manuscript is well-written, with experiments that are thorough, well-designed, and clearly explained. 
Regarding novelty, while the RRSVM itself performs much of the heavy lifting, leveraging its most salient regions as fixation points for visual attention is a natural extension. However, the integration of the inhibition of return mechanism and the framing of the work within a physiological context—supported by the results—enhances its significance beyond the basic application of the RRSVM. That said, the lack of biological plausibility in the RRSVM's implementation may limit the framework's potential for deeper insights into biological visual search. Despite the incremental nature of the contribution and some limitations in implementation, the concept, experimental methodology, and results provide meaningful insights into biological visual attention, making this work a valuable addition to the field.
