The paper introduces a general framework for providing theoretical guarantees on the stability of a clustering \( C \) that aligns well with the data. Stability is assessed through the distance between \( C \) and any other clustering \( C' \) that also fits the data well. The authors illustrate the application of this framework using two block models, PFM and SBM, where all quantities involved in the guarantees are explicitly computable from the data. Additionally, the paper leverages these stability results to establish exact recovery guarantees for the models. However, the simulations indicate that either the goodness-of-fit criteria or the theorem conditions limit the practical utility of the results. 
1) The paper addresses the problem of deriving a generic framework for theoretical guarantees in clustering without assuming a specific data-generating model. The objective is to establish guarantees based on quantities computable from the data and the clustering algorithm outputs. Developing such model-agnostic guarantees is significant for both theoretical insights and practical applications.
2) Since PFM encompasses DC-SBM as a special case, which itself generalizes SBM, it is unclear why PFM and SBM are treated separately. Given that Spectral Clustering performs well across all the specified models, why not use a unified model estimator? Specifically, why is the Laplacian used for PFM while the adjacency matrix is employed for SBM? Moreover, the results for PFM are expressed in terms of weighted ME, whereas for SBM, they are in terms of ME. How do these results compare? Additionally, why are results for DC-SBM omitted?
3) In Proposition 10, the definition of \( \langle M', M \rangle_F \) is unclear. 
4) In Assumption 5, is the intended expression \( \|L^{\hat{}}^2 - L^2\|F \) or \( \|L^{\hat{}} - L\|F^2 \)? If it is the former, what is the intuition behind squaring the Laplacians?
5) The paper primarily focuses on disjoint clusters. Can the techniques or framework proposed here extend beyond block models to other models where Spectral Clustering is effective? For instance, Spectral Clustering is known to perform well for hierarchical clustering, with theoretical guarantees available (e.g., "Noise Thresholds for Spectral Clustering," S. Balakrishnan et al., 2011). How would the proposed framework adapt to such cases?
6) The evaluation metric and estimators used for both PFM and SBM are restricted to \( C \) and \( C' \) having the same number of clusters. However, different clustering algorithms may yield different numbers of clusters. For example, the eigenvalues of \( A \) might suggest \( K \) clusters for \( C \), while the Laplacian of \( A \) might suggest \( K' = K + 1 \) clusters for \( C' \), where \( C' \) differs from \( C \) only by splitting one cluster into two. Such a \( C' \), though "close" to \( C \), cannot be captured within the current framework.
7) The related work section does not adequately reflect the existing body of model-agnostic results. For example:
   - "Clustering with Spectral Norm and the k-means Algorithm," Kumar and Kannan, 2010.
   - "Clustering under Perturbation Resilience," Balcan et al., 2012.
   - "Clustering under Approximation Stability," Balcan et al., 2013.
How does the notion of stability in this paper relate to those in these works? Specifically, how does the stability defined here compare to stability measured via perturbations of cluster centers?
8) The perturbations tolerated in the PFM simulations are minimal. Lines 252–253 state that "large eigengap makes PFM(G, C) differ from PFM(G, C_0) even for very small perturbations," but this statement is not well-qualified. Why is this the case? On the other hand, the political blog data is smoothed by raising \( A \) to a power, which exaggerates eigenvalue gaps but appears to improve stability. If small perturbations significantly affect model fit, this undermines the practical utility of the guarantees, especially since the quantities are intended to be computable from the data. Lines 248–250 also note that the conditions for SBM guarantees are difficult to satisfy, which is unfortunate.
9) The caption for Figure 1 states, "For SBM, \( \delta \) is always greater than \( \delta_0 \)." To which subplot does this refer? If SBM is not plotted, this should be clarified in the caption.
10) The theoretical guarantees for PFM are derived for weighted ME, whereas the experiments perturb ME. This inconsistency should be addressed.
Minor Points:
1) The axes in Figure 1 lack labels.
2) (Line 44) For block models, \( A_{ij} \) for \( i > j \) are independent given the cluster assignments for \( i \) and \( j \).
3) The notations \( B \), \( C \), and \( Y \) are defined differently for PFM and SBM in Section 3.2, which can be confusing. Given the extensive use of notation, consistency is crucial. For instance, \( Y{\perp} \) and \( CD \) could replace \( B \) and \( C \) for PFM. Similarly, for SBM, the estimator \( Y_Z \) is unnecessary, and its expression could be directly used in Proposition 8. Additionally, distinguishing eigenvalues for PFM and SBM using \( \lambda^L \) and \( \lambda^B \), respectively, would improve clarity.
4) Section 4.4 would be better positioned as a subsection within the related work section.
