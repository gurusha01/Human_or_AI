The authors propose a supervised kernel learning approach based on random features. Building on a kernel alignment problem, they derive an efficient method that is well-supported by theoretical analysis. Empirical results are also presented. The technical contribution is significant, and the paper is clearly written. However, while the empirical evaluation is already thorough in terms of the explored settings, there is still room for improvement. For instance, it would be valuable to compare the proposed method against standard MKL using a linear combination of multiple Gaussian kernels with varying parameters or other established kernel learning techniques. Additionally, a missing baseline is a Gaussian kernel with bandwidth optimized through model selection methods, such as cross-validation. Including such comparisons would, in my opinion, further strengthen the case for the proposed approach.
