The formulation presented by Rahimi and Recht [21] for the binary classification problem is extended in equation (6). In this equation, \(\hat{q}\) is introduced as an additional component compared to equation (5). The term \(\hat{q}\) is derived as the solution to equation (4). Notably, equation (4) also addresses a binary classification problem but does not incorporate a regularization term. While the differences from Rahimi and Recht [21] are relatively minor, the proposed approach demonstrates improved generalization error compared to [21]. Additionally, the computational speed is reasonable. Overall, the proposed modification is effective and valuable.
