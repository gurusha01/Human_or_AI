The authors propose an innovative approach for determining structural connectivity in the brain using sparse retrograde labeling experiments. Their method integrates a matrix completion loss, a smoothing penalty to enforce spatial homogeneity in the inferred structural connectivity, and a low-rank approximation of the data, which offers scalability to full-brain mapping. The approach is validated on synthetic datasets and applied to publicly available data from the Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas, where it achieves substantial improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods. The authors address a pertinent and compelling challenge: how to infer mesoscale anatomical connectivity from brain tracing experiments when the number of experiments is limited, the connectivity matrix has a high number of free parameters, and the experiments are affected by injection-induced artifacts. They introduce a sophisticated method that effectively addresses these challenges through a well-constructed optimization framework. Their assumption of spatial smoothness in the connectivity matrix is well supported by the retinotopic organization of the visual cortex, which is the source of the data they analyze. To mitigate the impact of experimental artifacts at injection sites, they employ a projection operator akin to those used in matrix projection techniques. Additionally, they extend their optimization framework to include a low-rank representation of the connectivity matrix, enabling the method to scale to larger datasets. The paper is well-written and accessible, with the authors systematically justifying their modeling decisions using synthetic data with known ground truth. They conclude by presenting results on real-world data, where their method demonstrates significant advancements over the current state of the art.
