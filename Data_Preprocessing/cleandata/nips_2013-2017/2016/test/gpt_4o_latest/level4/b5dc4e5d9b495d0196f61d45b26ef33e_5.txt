The manuscript addresses a non-smooth optimization problem characterized by a composite objective, where the first component is expressed through an explicit max structure. By integrating Nesterov's smoothing and acceleration techniques with the recent findings of Yang and Lin [23], the authors introduce a homotopy method that achieves a convergence rate potentially surpassing O(1/\epsilon). The actual convergence rate is contingent on the error bound parameter \theta, and the paper provides illustrative examples of functions satisfying this error bound condition. The manuscript is well-structured and accessible, employing established concepts and proof techniques from convex optimization. However, it presents these ideas in a refined manner, leading to what appears to be the first analysis of Nesterov smoothing and acceleration that demonstrates a faster-than-O(1/\epsilon) rate for non-smooth functions. The results hinge on the local error bound property, and the authors draw connections between this property and other well-known function characteristics in convex optimization, such as local strong convexity and the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz property. 
While these connections are valuable, I would have appreciated a more in-depth discussion of them, and I encourage the authors to compare their contributions to related works, such as [1,2]. Another point of concern is the dependence of the algorithm's performance on prior knowledge of the constants c and \theta. The manuscript should address how these constants can be estimated or identify scenarios where such knowledge is reasonable to assume. Although Section 4.4 suggests that the primal-dual variant of the algorithm might address this issue, the explanation is unconvincing and requires substantial elaboration.
Below are additional comments for the authors to consider:  
- The remark on line 75 ("it can be made sharp by some transformation") is unclear. Please explicitly reference Definition 4 and the subsequent remark for clarity.  
- The proofs appear to draw significant inspiration from [23], and this should be explicitly acknowledged.  
- The notation for the dual norm deviates from standard conventions. Is there a specific reason for this choice?  
- Equation (11) could be improved by repositioning the quantifier at the beginning.  
- In practical applications, discuss whether the constant c is typically independent of the problem's dimensionality.  
- On line 231, the statement "minx F(x) has a polyhedral epigraph" is problematic, as minx F(x) is a scalar and does not possess an epigraph.  
- The example on lines 240-242 is problematic: the function described is not necessarily locally strongly convex. For instance, if x^ - x lies in Null(A), then ||x - x^|| > 0 while F(x) - F(x^*) = 0. Perhaps the authors intended to state that this function satisfies condition (10).  
- On line 252, define the term "o-minimal structure" for clarity.
