This paper enhances the accuracy and resolution of linear models applied to neural projection tracing experiments by incorporating a smoothness prior. Furthermore, the use of a low-rank approximation for the connectivity matrix provides significant memory savings. The manuscript is highly readable, and the proposed method is both straightforward to implement and demonstrates substantial performance improvements over the previous region-based approach. Consequently, to the best of my knowledge, this method is likely to be valuable for practitioners, particularly if the code is made available following publication. %% After authors' rebuttal %% I appreciate the authors' rebuttal and commend them on an excellent paper. My only minor suggestion is to revise the title so that the technical terminology appears at the end, for example: "High-resolution neural connectivity extracted from incomplete tracing data using nonnegative spline regression."
