The authors enhance the RRSVM image classification model by incorporating a straightforward diversity mechanism, achieving state-of-the-art performance in predicting human gaze fixation locations during visual search. Preface: While I am not a specialist in vision research (neither behavioral nor computational), I believe this paper merits acceptance. The idea of repurposing a classification model for fixation prediction is innovative, the results are state-of-the-art, and the presentation is clear. Below are some suggestions for improvement:
1. Human AUC Benchmark: What is the split-half AUC for the human data? If the models outperform this, it might indicate the need for additional data collection. Conversely, the human AUC could serve as a natural upper bound for model performance. With a reliable estimate of human AUC, it would be reasonable if the model's AUC does not surpass this threshold.
2. Uncertainty in AUC Scores: Could you provide uncertainty estimates for the mean AUCs of RRSVM and SDR? For instance, running the models on different validation sets and reporting the standard error of the mean would help. It would be useful to demonstrate that SDR's 0.85 AUC is significantly different from RRSVM's 0.81 AUC.
3. Metric Choice: Out of curiosity, while AUC appears to be the dominant metric for fixation prediction, why doesn't the field adopt an alternative metric, such as the log-likelihood of human data under the priority map?
4. Writing Similarity: The writing in Section 2 seems quite similar to Section 3.1 of Wei and Hoai's original CVPR paper on RRSVM. If you are not Wei and Hoai, you might consider revising the language to make it more distinct.
5. Region Search Details: As someone outside the computer vision domain, I would appreciate more clarity on the regions that RRSVM searches over. Based on Wei and Hoai, the regions seem to be rectangular, but details such as their size range, the total number of possible regions, etc., are unclear. Additionally, it would be helpful to understand how much the SDR region selection function, Psi, reduces the dimensionality of the region space.
6. Performance on Specific Items: Table 1 indicates that all models perform worse on the "and" and "sofa" items. Wei and Hoai's work suggests that base RRSVM also struggles with classification for these items. Is there a broader insight here about the relationship between classification and fixation prediction? For instance, is strong classification performance a prerequisite for effective fixation prediction?
Update: After reviewing the other reviews and the authors' rebuttal, which appears to address the technical concerns raised, I remain in favor of accepting this paper.
