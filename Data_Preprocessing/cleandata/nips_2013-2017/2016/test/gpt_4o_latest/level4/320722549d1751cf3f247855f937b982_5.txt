Many online learning algorithms rely on a learning parameter that governs the extent to which the algorithm updates its predictions upon receiving new data. While some algorithms keep this parameter fixed throughout, others adapt it dynamically as they progress. The primary focus of this paper is on designing an algorithm that performs comparably to the ideal scenario where all data is known in advance, rather than being received incrementally. To address this, the authors propose a strategy for a coin betting game, where the gambler must decide, at each turn, how much to bet and on which outcome. This strategy is derived from carefully chosen potential functions. Each family of potential functions generates a betting strategy, which in turn provides an upper bound on the regret of the game—defined as the difference between the gambler's winnings under this strategy and the hypothetical winnings if all coin tosses were known beforehand. The authors then extend this coin betting strategy to tackle other online learning problems, such as Online Learning Optimization and Learning with Expert Advice. Notably, this approach appears to generalize existing parameter-free algorithms. 
The coin betting game, along with the Online Learning Optimization and Learning with Expert Advice problems, are significant topics in online learning, and the choice of the learning rate is a critical aspect of many algorithms. Consequently, any framework that offers a principled way to determine this rate is highly valuable and has the potential for broad applications. However, the main concern with the paper lies in the definition of the Coin Betting potential, which underpins the selection of the learning rate. While the formula below line 137 clarifies the utility of the condition in line 130, and lines 138-140 provide a somewhat confusing explanation of the derivation of β_t, it remains unclear how to construct such potential functions in general. Although the paper later demonstrates that known online learning algorithms correspond to specific potential functions, it would be highly beneficial if the authors could provide intuition or guidance on how to generate new potential functions. This would not only reinforce the claim that their algorithm generalizes existing results but also highlight its capacity to produce novel algorithms (rather than merely replicating similar potentials).
Additional minor comments:
- Line 16: Replace "the Hilbert space" with "a Hilbert space," unless this specific space has been defined earlier in the text.
- Lines 24-29: Consider adding a clearer explanation of what a learning rate is, rather than solely describing its use in examples like OGD. Readers unfamiliar with the concept may find the introduction more confusing than helpful. Additionally, it might be useful to clarify that "parameter-free" refers to not predefining the learning rate. For instance, you could write "learning rate or learning parameter" instead of just "learning rate."
- Line 49: Clarify what is meant by "dom(f) not empty." If the domain is not the entirety of V, this should be explicitly stated.
- Line 109: The inequality in (5) is not immediately obvious. If it involves straightforward calculations, consider adding an intermediate step or explicitly stating that this is the case.
- Line 114: Why are the names "Krichevsky" and "Trofimov" highlighted in blue? This formatting choice seems inconsistent.
- Line 141: The coin betting strategy appears to be one-dimensional throughout. What is the intended meaning of "infinite dimensional" in this context?
- Line 196: Does the "peculiar property" mentioned have any deeper significance? If so, it would be helpful to elaborate.
