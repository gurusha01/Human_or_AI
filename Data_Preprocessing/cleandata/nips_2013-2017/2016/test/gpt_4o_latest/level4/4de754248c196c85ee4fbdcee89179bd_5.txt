The authors present a method for estimating energy consumption in a domestic household. They introduce a system based on an additive factorial hidden Markov model and enhance previous implementations by incorporating an additional constraint into the objective function to account for abrupt changes in power consumption levels. The paper is highly engaging and proposes technically sound methodologies that can be effectively applied to address the critical issue of energy consumption management. I was already inclined to view the study as novel and valuable, and the reviewers' comments along with the authors' feedback have reinforced this perspective. My primary concern, which aligns with that of some reviewers, pertains to the lack of a detailed study on the computational complexity of the proposed method. While the authors address this point in their rebuttal, I believe this discussion should be included in the final version of the paper. Moreover, given the nature of the problem being addressed, a more formal analysis of computational complexity would be beneficial. Lastly, as the paper is quite technical, I believe it would be better suited for presentation in a poster format.
