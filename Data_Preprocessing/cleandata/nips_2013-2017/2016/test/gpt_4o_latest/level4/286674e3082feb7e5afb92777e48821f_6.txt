In this paper, the authors attempt to develop a theory applicable to graph clustering within a model-free framework. However, the proposed results come across as simplistic and unpersuasive. While the authors aim to present a novel theoretical framework, their approach appears to lack rigor and relies heavily on superficial reasoning. For instance, consider Theorem 1 (Generic Theorem): "which also fits G well is close to C," and Proposition 3 (Informal): "under standard recovery conditions." These examples highlight the lack of depth and precision in the theoretical contributions.
