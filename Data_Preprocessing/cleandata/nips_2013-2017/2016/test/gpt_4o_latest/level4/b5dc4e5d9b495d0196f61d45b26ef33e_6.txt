The authors introduce a novel optimization algorithm grounded in homotopy smoothing, which achieves an iteration complexity of O(1/eps^(1-\theta)\log(1/\eps)) to attain an eps-level gap from the optimal objective value. However, based on my familiarity with the existing literature, many of the results presented in this paper appear to be either already established or straightforward extensions of known findings. For instance: (1) Zhang et al. (2012) demonstrated that for sigma-strongly convex functions, the iteration complexity is O(eps^{-1/2}sigma^{-1}). Their analysis can be further generalized to locally strongly convex optimization, which aligns with the result presented in this paper on Line 237 of Page 7. Reference: Zhang et al. (2012) "Smoothing Multivariate Performance Measures," JMLR --http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume13/zhang12d/zhang12d.pdf. (2) The KL condition mentioned on Line 243 of Page 7 is also commonly referred to as the Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) or gradient-dominated condition. Numerous prior works have leveraged the PL condition as a relaxation of strong convexity. I recommend that the authors provide more detailed justifications to highlight the significance and novelty of the proposed algorithm.
