The paper introduces an alternative to Gaussian Mixture Models, referred to as the Locally Adaptive Normal Distribution, which is constructed based on Riemannian Manifolds. It presents a Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) approach for parameter estimation and validates the proposed method through experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets. The manuscript is well-written, with robust theoretical foundations and solid experimental results. However, in comparison to the work of Simo-Serra et al. [19], the contribution lacks significant novelty. Additionally, the distinctions between the proposed approach and the current state-of-the-art are not adequately clarified until the conclusion section. These differences should have been explicitly highlighted earlier in the paper, particularly in the introduction (notably, reference [19] is missing from the introduction).
