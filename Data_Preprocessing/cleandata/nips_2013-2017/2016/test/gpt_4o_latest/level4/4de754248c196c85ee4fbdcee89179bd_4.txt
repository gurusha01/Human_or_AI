This paper addresses the task of energy disaggregation load monitoring. The authors frame the problem as an integer quadratic programming optimization problem, subsequently applying standard SDP relaxation and randomized rounding techniques. While the theoretical contribution of this paper is somewhat incremental, my primary concerns lie with the experimental evaluation: (1) The real dataset (REDD) used in this study is the same as that utilized in Kolter & Johnson (KJ). Upon reviewing the experiments in KJ, it appears that their reported precision/recall values (averaging 87.2%/60.3% across 7 appliances) are significantly higher than those achieved by the proposed algorithm in this paper (as shown in Table 1). This discrepancy is puzzling, suggesting that one of the two sets of results may have issues. (2) The experimental study lacks a comparison of running times. Such a comparison is crucial, as the introduction emphasizes the goal of developing a "scalable, computationally efficient method." Additionally, the size of the tested dataset is not specified, leaving it unclear why solving the SDP directly is deemed infeasible in this context. Regarding related work (second paragraph of the introduction), several papers cited in the introduction were published after 2012 (e.g., Zhong et al., 2014). It would be helpful to clarify why KJ is considered the state-of-the-art. Minor comments: -- Line 75: What does I{} s{t,i} = s mean? -- Title of Section 6: Why is it labeled "Synthetic Data Set"?
