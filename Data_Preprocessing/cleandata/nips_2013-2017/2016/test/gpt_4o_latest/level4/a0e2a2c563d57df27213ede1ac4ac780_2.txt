This paper proposes that the sparse and diverse features learned by RRSVM can also predict visual saliency. The authors designed experiments to validate this hypothesis. The idea of leveraging the sparse and diverse features learned by RRSVM for classification to predict visual saliency is intriguing and merits further exploration. The paper is well-structured and clearly written. However, the primary limitation lies in the lack of substantial evidence demonstrating that the proposed method outperforms a simple center bias model. To strengthen the paper, the authors could conduct the following experiments and comparisons: 1. Employ the shuffled AUC (sAUC) metric [R1, R2] for performance evaluation, as it is specifically designed to address center bias. 2. Compare the proposed method with approaches presented in [R3, R4] to provide more compelling evidence. 3. Alternatively, the authors could enhance the evaluation by directly comparing the selected regions' positions with eye fixation points using the metric described in [R5].
