This paper introduces a novel perspective on parameter-free algorithms by interpreting them as coin-betting strategies aimed at achieving maximal reward. It begins by employing a betting algorithm grounded in the Krichevsky-Trofimov estimator with a coin-betting potential function and subsequently extends this approach to online learning optimization in Hilbert spaces and learning with expert advice. Experiments on real-world datasets further validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The paper offers a fresh understanding of parameter-free algorithms through the lens of coin-betting with maximal reward. Building on this insight, the authors propose several new algorithms for online convex optimization and learning with experts. The paper is well-structured, making it easy for readers to follow. In summary, this work is comprehensive and provides innovative interpretations.
