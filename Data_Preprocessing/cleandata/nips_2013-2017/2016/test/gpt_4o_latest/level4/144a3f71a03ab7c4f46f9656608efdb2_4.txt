This paper presents a method for projecting non-decomposable ancestral constraints into decomposable constraints, enabling decomposable-score-based structure learning approaches to incorporate such domain knowledge and thereby enhance learning efficiency. The primary contribution of this work is detailed in Section 5, where the authors propose a technique to transform non-decomposable ancestral constraints into edge and topological ordering constraints, which are decomposable. The paper is well-written and effectively communicates its contributions in both the theoretical and experimental sections. Below are my concerns and suggestions:
i. Table 3 indicates that the projection of ancestral constraints improves the performance of EC trees but not the ILP approach. Does this imply that the proposed method of projecting ancestral constraints into decomposable constraints is specifically effective for EC trees but lacks generalizability to other learning approaches? Given that the core innovation of this paper is the inference of decomposable constraints from non-decomposable ancestral constraints, it would strengthen the paper if the authors could demonstrate that incorporating these decomposable constraints enhances the performance and efficiency of a learning approach that inherently cannot handle non-decomposable constraints.
ii. Table 2 reveals an easy-hard-easy pattern in the performance of EC trees as the proportion of ancestral constraints increases. What is the underlying reason for this phenomenon? Does it suggest that the reduction of the EC tree search space via ancestral constraints is highly sensitive to the amount of domain knowledge incorporated, especially in comparison to the ILP approach? If so, does this imply that the number of ancestral constraints must be carefully calibrated to achieve optimal performance?
iii. Table 2 only reports the structural Hamming distance results for EC trees. How do these results compare with the ILP approach? Including such a comparison would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method.
iv. A minor suggestion: While I understand that the BN graph provides the theoretical foundation for EC trees, as EC trees are an extension of it, the experimental section focuses exclusively on the search space of EC trees with ancestral constraints. Therefore, I recommend omitting Section 4.1 and instead dedicating more space to a detailed explanation of EC trees and the A* algorithm in the context of EC tree settings.
