Review of "Homotopy smoothing for non-convex problems with lower complexity than O(1/e)"
This paper introduces a novel homotopy smoothing algorithm designed to address non-smooth optimization problems. The introduction and related work sections effectively outline the problem setting and the specific contributions of the paper. Unlike the Nesterov method, which employs a fixed smoothing parameter across all iterations, the proposed HOPS method dynamically adjusts the smoothing parameter. This adjustment allows for faster convergence during early iterations and more accurate approximations of the non-smooth objective in later iterations. Notably, the paper provides the first theoretical complexity guarantee for the homotopy smoothing method. 
Sections 3 and 4 detail the homotopy smoothing approach, with Section 4.2 being particularly useful for understanding the core concept behind the method. Figure 1 is also instrumental in clarifying the local sharpness parameter, theta, which plays a role in the local error bounds. It is commendable that Section 4.4 employs the duality gap as a metric to monitor solution accuracy. Section 5 presents experimental results, while Section 6 offers a concise conclusion. Overall, the paper is a valuable contribution to the optimization literature, providing insights into the mechanics of the homotopy smoothing method.
The main limitation of the paper lies in its experimental section. Without including measures of error, such as standard deviations or confidence intervals, it is challenging to substantiate claims about significant differences in algorithm speeds. Additionally, it would have been helpful to include an experiment or figure illustrating how the convergence speed is influenced by the choice of the homotopy smoothing parameter (b). For instance, at one extreme with b=1 (no updates to the smoothing parameter), the performance should align with APG and be relatively slow, while increasing b should result in faster convergence. Is that correct?
Minor comments:
- In the experiments, what value of the b parameter was used for the HOPS algorithm? Does this choice significantly impact the results?
- What does the statement "the optimal value is obtained by running PD with a sufficiently large number of iterations such that the duality gap is very small" mean? Why is it necessary to know the optimal value? Shouldn't the duality gap be computable independently of knowing the optimal value?
