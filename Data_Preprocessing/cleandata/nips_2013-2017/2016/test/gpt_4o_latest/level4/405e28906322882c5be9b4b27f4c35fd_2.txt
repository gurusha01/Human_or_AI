In the stationary setting, where the distribution remains constant across all time steps, a proficient online player can identify the optimal choice with high confidence. However, in a non-stationary environment, the distribution may shift as time progresses. This paper addresses this challenge by segmenting the sequences into \(\Gamma\) intervals, each characterized by a stationary distribution. The authors introduce a parameter \(V\) to quantify the difference between the means of consecutive distributions and use \(\Lambda\) to measure the total statistical variance of the distributions. The paper explores how \(\Gamma\), \(\Lambda\), and \(V\) influence the dynamic pseudo-regret in both full-information and bandit settings. The study is well-motivated and tackles the compelling problem of tracking dynamic regret in sequential prediction within a non-stationary stochastic environment. The paper is well-written and generally accessible even to readers without prior expertise in online learning or the foundational work referenced. The contributions appear to be novel and significant. However, there are areas where the presentation could be improved, and some results are challenging to interpret. 
1. Line 115: What does \(at\) represent in \(l{t,a_t}\)?  
2. Theorem 2.1 is presented without any accompanying discussion. Why is Theorem 2.1 introduced at this point?  
3. Algorithm 1: Why do you use equidistant intervals \([(m-1)B+1, mB]\)? Given that distributions may have intervals of varying lengths, are you confident that different partitions will not impact the regret bound (as suggested in Note 1 on Page 4)?  
4. Line 147: How is Formula (2) derived?  
5. Line 162: What does \(N\) represent?  
6. Lines 174–175: How is the formula for \(B\) obtained?  
7. Lines 186 & 190: The symbolic interpretation should be consistent—for example, expert \(k\) versus arm \(k\).  
8. Page 6, Line 215: What does it mean to "hide a \(\ln \ln T\) factor"? Additionally, what distinguishes a switching distribution from a drifting distribution? Should \(\Gamma\) be used to represent switching and \(V\) for drifting?  
9. Page 5: Section 3.3 is difficult to follow. What do \(w{t,k}\) and \(m{t,k}\) represent? They seem to resemble an exponential weighted average. How is Formula (6) derived? The logic in this section is unclear and confusing.  
10. Page 7, Section 4: The discussion is limited to the case of \(K=2\), which appears to be a significant limitation.  
11. The paper concludes abruptly, and the references are incomplete. Two highly relevant papers are missing: "Tracking the Best Expert" by Mark Herbster and Manfred K. Warmuth, and "Switching Portfolios" by Yoram Singer (1998). The authors should compare their model and results with these works.
