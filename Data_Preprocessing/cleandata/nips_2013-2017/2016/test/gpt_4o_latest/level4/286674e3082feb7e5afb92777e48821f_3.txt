The manuscript introduces a collection of algorithms designed for clustering on graphs and for evaluating the similarity between two cluster assignments. While the algorithms are presented clearly, as noted earlier, their motivation and the rationale behind organizing them as a list of algorithms are not sufficiently clarified. The proposed algorithms are adaptations of existing methods, with the sole innovation being the constraints described in the final section.
