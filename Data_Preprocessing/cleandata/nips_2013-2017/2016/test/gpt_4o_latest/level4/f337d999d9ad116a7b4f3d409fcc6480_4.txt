This paper employs a regularized multivariate regression approach to tackle the intriguing task of reconstructing the neural connectivity of the mouse brain's visual cortex at a finer resolution by estimating a large, sparse coefficient matrix. Experimental results on real data demonstrate improved performance compared to outcomes at the coarser regional level.

After considering the rebuttal and the feedback from other reviewers, I have adjusted my score. The primary contribution of this work lies in applying a regularized regression method to an interesting neuroscience application, specifically estimating the connectivity maps of the mouse brain. The authors build upon the work of [17] by addressing the problem at a finer voxel level, which involves estimating a significantly larger regression coefficient matrix (5000x5000). However, from a modeling perspective, the approach essentially amounts to a smoothing-penalized multivariate linear regression model for solving a least-squares problem. This is conceptually similar to numerous existing matrix/tensor completion methods, which limits the novelty of the contribution. Regarding the experiments, the authors did not compare their method against any alternative approaches, leaving it unclear whether the proposed method performs competitively. I believe the inclusion of more algorithms and baseline comparisons is necessary.
