This paper introduces three measures of complexity for RNNs and demonstrates experimentally that these measures are meaningful, as increasing complexity appears to correlate with improved performance. Update: On line 71, there is a "V" without a subscript, which I believe should be "Vc." --- I find this paper interesting and well-motivated, but some figures require clearer explanations. Figure 1(a) is straightforward and aligns well with Definitions 2.1 and 2.2. However, Figure 1(b) and Figure 2 use a different notation, which took me considerable time to interpret. The caption for Figure 2, "We only plot the hidden states within 1 time step (which also have a period of 1)," is too vague to be helpful. Specifically, the arrows now represent nonlinear transformations, including implicit input/output nodes, which adds to the confusion. This is particularly problematic in Figure 2(a), where the depiction with only two time slices resembles a cyclic representation rather than an unrolled one (except for the absence of cycles). Additionally, while I understand you may not wish to revise this, it seems that the definitions and explanations become significantly more complex to accommodate m > 1, with limited clarity on the benefits: If RNNs were restricted to m = 1, would the set of RNNs meaningfully change? Or does m > 1 simply make explicit a specific structural property of RNNs? If so, why is the period number particularly noteworthy? A brief discussion addressing these questions would be helpful. Minor notes: - In the definition of unfolding, specifically in the definition of V{un}, I believe the subscript on "V" should be "c." - In the definitions, should we explicitly prevent the weight sigma from being negative?
