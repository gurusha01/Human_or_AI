This paper explores a novel multi-armed bandit framework. The framework involves $M$ fidelities at which the learner can select to play an arm. Each successive fidelity offers a more accurate approximation of the rewards but incurs a higher cost. A strategy that leverages the lower-cost, less accurate fidelities to eliminate many sub-optimal arms and reserves the higher-cost, more accurate fidelities for a smaller subset of promising arms could potentially outperform the standard UCB algorithm, which does not account for these fidelity-specific characteristics. This framework has practical applications, such as in online advertising, where one might display ads for a short duration to estimate long-term click-through rates while minimizing costs. For this problem, the authors propose a new regret definition, present an algorithm with theoretical analysis (including a regret lower bound), and validate their approach through simulations. The theoretical analysis is innovative. However, since the deviation $\varepsilon^{(m)}$ of the $m$-th fidelity mean from the highest fidelity mean is assumed to be known beforehand, it raises the question of how these values can be determined in real-world scenarios (e.g., in online advertising). Could this assumption be relaxed?
Minor comments:
1) Lines 326, 357, and 386: "... arm $k \in H^{(m)}$" — 'H' should be 'K'.
2) Line 343: In the last indicator term of the inequality, the argument "$\Beta{k^\ast,t} \leq s$" — 's' should be $\mu{\ast}$.
3) Line 345: Replace $\gamma$ with $\gamma^{(m)}$.
4) Lines 346–347: "... and the last step uses $\psi( \Deltak^{(m)} - \gamma^{(m)} ) \leq \psi( \gamma^{(m)} )$ when $\psi( \Deltak^{(m)} ) \leq 2 \gamma^{(m)}$" — both instances of $\leq$ should be $\geq$.
5) Line 384: In the inner summand on the left-hand side of the first inequality, the summation over all $k \in$ those "above" $K^{(m)}$ should instead be over all $k \in$ those "below" $K^{(m)}$.
6) Line 407: On the right-hand side of the last inequality, $\delta^{(m)}$ should be $\delta^{(M)}$, and the final term $\mu_{\ast} \kappa \lambda^{(m)}$ should be $\kappa \lambda^{(m)}$.
7) Line 431: "for $l \geq m$" should be "for $l \geq p$".
8) Line 440: In Eq. (17), "for $l \geq m$" should be "for $l \geq p$".
9) Line 450: $P(A{n,3})$ should be $P(A{n,2})$.
