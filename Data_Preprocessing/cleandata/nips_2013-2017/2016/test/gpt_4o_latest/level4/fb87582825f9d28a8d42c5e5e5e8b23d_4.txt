This paper introduces a novel approach to simplifying the design of optimizers used for function minimization by employing a meta-optimizer. The meta-optimizer takes the gradient of the target function as input and outputs the update to be applied. The concept is undoubtedly intriguing, and I can see its potential value for practitioners. However, I believe the paper struggles to fully deliver on its claims. Despite the clear appeal of the idea, there remain significant challenges before this or similar approaches can be widely adopted. The optimization field is vast, with numerous techniques published annually. Selecting the most suitable method for a specific problem requires considerable expertise, and even then, hyperparameter tuning is often necessary. Building on this observation, the paper aims to present a meta-algorithm capable of generating optimizers (or gradient transformations) applicable to a broad spectrum of problems. The idea is compelling and, if successful, could have a substantial impact on the community. 
The paper is generally well-written, with a thorough literature review and clear presentation of its ideas. Although I am not deeply familiar with LSTMs, I was able to follow the meta-algorithm and the claims made. However, I have concerns about the claims themselves and the extent to which the paper substantiates them. 
First, the paper asserts that the proposed architecture could theoretically model well-known algorithms such as L-BFGS. While this is technically true in the sense that it can represent a low-rank linear transformation of the gradient using historical updates, the claim that "a memory could allow the optimizer to learn algorithms similar to [...] L-BFGS" is overly ambitious. The phrase "if appropriately designed" does little to bridge the significant gap between implementing history-based transformations and replicating the specific updates of L-BFGS. 
Second, while the paper correctly identifies the challenge posed by the wide variety of optimizers tailored to specific problem classes, the proposed architecture does not address these specialized cases. For example, the LSTM is not well-suited for problems involving sparsity (which often require proximal methods and sparsity-inducing norms), convex problems with finite training sets (addressed by methods like SAGA or SVRG), strongly convex problems (e.g., L-BFGS), or optimization over compact sets (e.g., Frank-Wolfe). The comparisons in the paper are limited to diagonal scalings of SGD, which undermines the claim that "the design of an optimization algorithm can be cast as a learning problem." The conclusion of the paper is more accurate, stating that "learned neural optimizers compare favorably against state-of-the-art optimization methods used in deep learning."
Third, the use of an LSTM introduces additional parameters that practitioners must tune. While I lack the expertise to comment on the sensitivity of the LSTM to specific optimizers, an analysis of this issue would have been valuable. Furthermore, unless I am mistaken (and I welcome correction if I am wrong), the baseline optimizers compared to the LSTM did not employ momentum or other common techniques such as batch normalization. Given that the performance gains reported are of a similar magnitude to the improvements these techniques typically provide, incorporating such comparisons would significantly strengthen the paper.
In summary, the idea of designing a model that uses local information about the function as input and outputs an update, while leveraging a hidden state to summarize historical data, is highly appealing. Such an approach could potentially unify many existing stochastic gradient-based techniques. However, the added complexity of the LSTM is only justifiable if the method delivers on its promises. As it stands, the paper's contributions are limited to modest speedups over a few well-established methods, which does not justify the increased complexity. A more comprehensive analysis of the LSTM's optimization and its applicability to a broader range of problems is necessary.
UPDATE AFTER AUTHORS' FEEDBACK AND DISCUSSION  
After carefully reviewing the authors' feedback, I believe they did not adequately address the main concerns I raised. While I agree that designing an optimizer through examples rather than mathematical properties is an appealing concept, this is not what the paper demonstrates. Specifically, the paper does not show that the effort required to learn the proposed optimizer is less than the effort needed to tune a first-order optimizer for deep networks. Additionally, the generalization achieved is limited to a narrow scope. As a result, I cannot conclude from the paper that the overall design effort for someone tackling a broad range of problems is reduced compared to tuning individual optimizers. For these reasons, I maintain my original score and believe the paper requires significant revisions to accurately reflect its contributions and limitations.
