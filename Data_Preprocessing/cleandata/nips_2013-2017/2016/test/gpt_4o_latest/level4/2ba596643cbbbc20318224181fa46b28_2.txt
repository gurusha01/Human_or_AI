This paper presents a novel multi-armed bandit framework where each arm can be pulled at varying levels of accuracy (or fidelity). The cost of pulling an arm increases with the desired accuracy, and the regret is defined as the product of the cost and the standard pseudo-regret. The authors introduce an algorithm tailored to this setting, MF-UCB, and establish both upper and lower bounds on its cumulative pseudo-regret. The main manuscript is clear and well-structured. However, the supplementary materials, which contain most of the proofs, are less polished. They include numerous typos and minor, easily fixable errors that could confuse readers (see below for a non-exhaustive list). Addressing these issues would significantly enhance the paper's readability. 
Additionally, the use of "up-to-a-multiplicative-constant" notation in the paper could be misleading, as the so-called constants are not strictly constant. For example, in Theorem 2, a factor \rho (a parameter of the algorithm) is hidden within the constant. Replacing this with the exact inequalities (as presented in the supplementary materials) could improve the clarity of the results. From a practical standpoint, it is unclear whether this algorithm can be readily applied to real-world problems. For instance, the MF-UCB strategy (which relies on low-accuracy pulls to eliminate highly suboptimal arms) might be vulnerable to inaccuracies in estimating \zeta (the fidelity accuracy). A discussion on these practical limitations and potential ways to address them would strengthen the paper. 
From a theoretical perspective, the paper provides valuable insights into the problem, along with interesting theorems and rigorous proofs. Overall, I believe this work makes a meaningful and noteworthy contribution to the field.
