This paper introduces an online sequence-to-sequence model that generates output incrementally as it processes segments of an input sequence. The mapping from input segments to output is determined by a standard sequence-to-sequence model, augmented with state information carried over from the previous segment. Sequence alignment is approximated through a dynamic programming approach that employs a greedy local search heuristic. The authors present experimental results for phone recognition on the TIMIT dataset. An incremental transducer is a logical and natural extension of sequence-to-sequence models. The experimental results on TIMIT demonstrate that this model can be effectively trained and optimized. I anticipate that this model, or its future iterations, will have significant applications in processing data streams. A minor critique: the two tables in Section 4.2, each containing only two rows, appear somewhat inelegant. Could the data be presented in a more visually appealing manner? Additionally, the first column of Table 2 is left empty.
