The paper extends the region sparsity model by incorporating an inhibition of return mechanism and explores its relationship with visual attention. While studies on sparsity and attention, such as those by Hou, Harel, and Koch (PAMI 2012), have been conducted previously, the authors claim a connection between the two in this work but fail to provide sufficient theoretical justifications. As a result, the proposed link appears somewhat superficial. Introducing inhibition of return into attention models is a promising idea, but the current implementation seems ad hoc. To strengthen this aspect, the authors should provide more detailed explanations, either through mathematical formulations or experimental validations. For instance, experimental results comparing the model's performance with and without this mechanism would offer a clearer demonstration of its effectiveness. 
Sections 2 and 3 feel disconnected from the rest of the paper and bear a resemblance in structure to reference [29]. I recommend that the authors reformat these sections to better align with the context of visual attention. The task paradigms designed and reported by the authors are commendable, but the qualitative figures do not clearly highlight the advantages of the proposed approach. The test stimuli used are relatively simple, often involving one or two objects in isolated scenes. It remains unclear whether the observed accuracy is due to straightforward factors, such as the presence of object regions or the size of the objects. I suggest including experimental results on more complex scenes and providing a more comprehensive discussion of these findings. Additionally, the visualization of the maps could be improved, as the current heatmap obscures the original stimuli and human fixation points to a significant extent.
