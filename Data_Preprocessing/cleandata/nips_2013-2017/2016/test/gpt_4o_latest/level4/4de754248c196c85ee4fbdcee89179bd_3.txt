This paper introduces an efficient approximate solution to the problem of energy disaggregation for home appliance monitoring, formulated as a binary quadratic program (equation (2)). Initially, equation (2) is relaxed into a convex problem (equation (7)) by introducing additional variables. Subsequently, it undergoes another relaxation into a semidefinite programming (SDP) problem with continuous variables, resulting in problem (8). The authors further propose employing a variant of the alternating direction method of multipliers to solve this large-scale SDP. Binary variables are then recovered using randomized rounding. The proposed approach demonstrates superior performance compared to the method introduced by Kolter & Jaakkola (2012) across multiple metrics that evaluate the accuracy of load disaggregation solutions. The paper is well-written, largely self-contained, easy to follow, and represents a significant contribution to the field. However, the global organization could be improved, as there are subsections such as 1.1 without a corresponding 1.2, 3.1 without 3.2, and 4.1 without 4.2. A particularly noteworthy aspect of the paper is the comprehensive methodology employed to address the initial optimization problem. The techniques presented in this work have the potential to benefit the broader machine learning community.
