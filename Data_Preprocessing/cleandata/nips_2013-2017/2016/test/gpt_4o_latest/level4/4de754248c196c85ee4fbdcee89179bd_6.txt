This paper presents a method to obtain improved approximate solutions for the energy disaggregation or non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) problem, building upon the prior work of Kolter & Jaakkola (2012), who employed an additive factorial HMM to model energy consumption. The authors integrate an SDP relaxation and randomized rounding approach (Park & Boyd, 2015) with ADMM (Boyd, 2010). The proposed method demonstrates superior performance compared to existing approaches. It is noteworthy that the method achieves excellent simulation results in terms of accuracy. However, the paper lacks academic novelty and originality, as the proposed approach merely combines existing methodologies. While the authors claim that the algorithm is scalable and computationally efficient, they do not provide any analysis of computational complexity or experimental evidence to support this claim. To address this, the authors should include a discussion of computational complexity or provide a comparison of execution times with existing methods, ideally using large-scale datasets. Overall, the paper is well-written and includes the necessary information. However, the authors should correct several errors in expression, such as those found in the title of section 6 and its subsection, line 75, and line 223. Additionally, it would be preferable to present key figures or tables within the main manuscript rather than relegating them to the supplementary material, despite space constraints. Lastly, the conclusion section is too brief and should be expanded.
