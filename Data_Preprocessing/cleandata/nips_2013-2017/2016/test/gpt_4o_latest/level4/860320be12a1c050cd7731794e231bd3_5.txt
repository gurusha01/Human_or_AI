This paper presents an analysis of the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture by introducing several key measurements: 1) Recurrent depth, \(dr\); 2) Feedforward depth, \(df\); and 3) Skip coefficient, \(s\). Through experiments, the authors compare various RNN variants with differing \(dr\), \(df\), and \(s\) values across five standard datasets and tasks. Based on these experiments, the paper provides guidelines for designing RNNs. The primary objective is to establish theoretical and quantitative principles for tailoring RNNs to specific problems. This is a significant and challenging topic that merits exploration. The proposed measurements of \(dr\) (Recurrent depth), \(df\) (Feedforward depth), and \(s\) (Skip coefficient) appear reasonable, and the authors have conducted extensive experiments to evaluate different RNN variants. 
However, I found the paper difficult to follow. While the core idea behind the proposed measurements is relatively straightforward, the paper relies heavily on symbols and definitions, which often complicates comprehension. In several instances, symbols are introduced without prior explanation or definition (e.g., "\(s\)" in the caption of Figure 1 on Page 3 is only defined on Page 5). This forces the reader to search manually for symbol definitions. I strongly suggest that the authors eliminate unnecessary symbols and rewrite the paper in more accessible language. Additionally, summarizing the key symbols in a table at the beginning of the paper would be extremely helpful. Some definitions and lemmas could also be moved to the supplementary material to enhance the paper's clarity and impact.
I also have several concerns regarding the experiments:  
1. In Table 1, the performance differences between models appear to be very small (e.g., 1.84 vs. 1.83). What is the variance in performance for the same model with different random initializations? If the experiments were repeated, could the conclusions potentially differ? Furthermore, while BPC is explained in the main text, it would be helpful to explicitly write out "Bit-Per-Character" at least once in the caption, as not all readers may be familiar with this term.  
2. In Table 2, the top-left table reports the best MNIST performance as 87.8. However, in the bottom-left table, the best performance is listed as 98.1 when comparing the model with other papers. This discrepancy is confusing. I assume the models differ, with the top-left table referring to RNN(tanh) and the bottom-left table to RNN(stanh). If so, why not compare RNN(stanh) models with varying \(s\) values in the top-left table for consistency? Please clarify.  
3. Minor issue: Please add a vertical line in Figure 2 to separate the left and right sub-figures for better readability.
In conclusion, this paper addresses an interesting and important problem. However, its current presentation is unclear and occasionally confusing. Significant revisions and refinements are necessary for it to be suitable for acceptance at NeurIPS.
