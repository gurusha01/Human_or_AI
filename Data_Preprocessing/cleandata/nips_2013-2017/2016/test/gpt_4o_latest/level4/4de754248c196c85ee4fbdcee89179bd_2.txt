The paper introduces enhanced optimization techniques for training additive factorial HMMs, driven by their application in energy disaggregation. The proposed method is evaluated against baseline approaches on both synthetic and real-world datasets. The technical quality appears to be very robust. The overall presentation is clear, though the authors should review the manuscript for grammatical issues. This work has a high potential for societal impact. However, I would rate the originality slightly lower, as there is already considerable prior work in this area. The experimental results demonstrate notable improvements over existing methods, making this a meaningful advancement over the current state-of-the-art. In their rebuttal, the authors thoroughly addressed concerns raised by some reviewers regarding the novelty and scalability of their approach, as well as the comparison with the results reported by Kolter and Jaakkola (2012).
