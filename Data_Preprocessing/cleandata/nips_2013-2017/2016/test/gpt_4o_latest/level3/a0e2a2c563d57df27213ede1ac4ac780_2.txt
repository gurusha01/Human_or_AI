Review of the Paper
This paper hypothesizes that sparse and diverse features learned by the Region Ranking SVM (RRSVM) for classification can also predict visual saliency, particularly in visual search tasks. By incorporating the biologically plausible mechanism of Inhibition of Return (IoR) into the RRSVM framework, the authors propose a Sparse Diverse Regions (SDR) classifier that achieves state-of-the-art results in predicting human gaze fixations, even when trained solely on image-level labels without object location annotations. The work bridges behavioral and computer vision literatures, offering a novel computational perspective on visual attention mechanisms.
The paper is well-organized and clearly written, providing sufficient background on RRSVM and its extension to SDR. The experimental results are compelling, demonstrating the model's ability to predict human attention across three visual search conditions: single-target present, target absent, and multiple-target present. The authors also address the center bias issue, which is a common challenge in fixation prediction tasks, and provide qualitative and quantitative evidence to differentiate their method from simple center bias models.
Strengths:
1. Originality: The idea of leveraging sparse and diverse region selection for fixation prediction is novel and biologically inspired. The incorporation of IoR into RRSVM is a creative extension that enhances the model's interpretability and performance.
2. Clarity: The paper is well-written and provides sufficient details about the methodology, experiments, and results. The inclusion of comparisons with baseline methods strengthens the narrative.
3. Significance: The work has the potential to advance both computer vision and cognitive science by offering insights into visual attention mechanisms and improving computational models for visual search tasks.
4. Technical Soundness: The experiments are thorough, and the results are well-supported by quantitative metrics such as AUC and sAUC. The authors also provide qualitative visualizations to support their claims.
Weaknesses:
1. Lack of Strong Baseline Comparisons: While the results are promising, the paper does not provide direct comparisons with state-of-the-art saliency models such as those referenced in [R3, R4]. Including these comparisons would strengthen the evidence for the proposed approach.
2. Evaluation Metric: The use of AUC as the primary evaluation metric does not fully address the center bias issue. The reviewer suggests incorporating the shuffled AUC (sAUC) criterion to better handle center bias and provide a more robust evaluation.
3. Limited Validation of Superiority: The paper does not convincingly demonstrate the superiority of SDR over simpler models like the center bias model. While the authors argue that SDR and center bias maps differ, the performance gap in AUC scores is relatively small in some cases.
4. Eye Fixation Comparison: Directly comparing the selected region positions with human eye fixation points using metrics such as those in [R5] could provide additional validation of the model's alignment with human attention.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:
- Pro: The paper presents a novel and biologically plausible approach to fixation prediction, with strong experimental results and potential impact on both computer vision and cognitive science.
- Con: The lack of direct comparisons with state-of-the-art saliency models and the limited use of robust evaluation metrics like sAUC weaken the claims of superiority.
Recommendation:
This paper presents an interesting and promising idea that merits further investigation. However, to strengthen its contribution, the authors should incorporate comparisons with methods in [R3, R4], use sAUC for performance evaluation, and consider more direct comparisons with human fixation data. With these improvements, the paper could make a significant contribution to the field. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions.
