This paper proposes an innovative approach to designing gradient-based optimization algorithms by framing the optimizer itself as a learnable model, implemented using LSTM-based deep neural networks (DNNs). The authors jointly train the optimizer (LSTM) and the optimizee (target model), enabling the optimizer to accumulate gradient information dynamically, akin to momentum-based methods. The trained optimizers demonstrate reusability for similar tasks and partial generalization to new architectures. The paper evaluates this approach on tasks such as quadratic functions, training neural networks on MNIST and CIFAR-10, and neural style transfer, showing competitive performance with state-of-the-art optimizers like ADAM and RMSprop.
Strengths:
1. Originality and Creativity: The idea of "learning to learn" by training optimization algorithms is both novel and timely. By leveraging meta-learning, the paper addresses a longstanding challenge in optimizationâ€”designing algorithms that can adapt to specific problem structures.
2. Potential Impact: If scaled effectively, this approach could significantly influence deep learning by automating the design of optimizers tailored to specific tasks, reducing reliance on hand-engineered methods.
3. Empirical Results: The experiments demonstrate promising results, with trained optimizers outperforming baseline methods on tasks they were trained for and showing some degree of generalization to unseen tasks and architectures.
4. Transfer Learning: The ability of the LSTM optimizer to generalize to new architectures (e.g., different MLP configurations) and tasks (e.g., neural art with different styles and resolutions) is a noteworthy contribution.
Weaknesses:
1. Limited Scale of Experiments: While the results are promising, the experiments are relatively small in scale. For example, the paper does not evaluate the optimizer on larger, more complex models like AlexNet or ResNet, which would better demonstrate its scalability and practical utility.
2. Lack of Theoretical Guarantees: The method lacks formal theoretical analysis, such as convergence guarantees or insights into when and why the learned optimizer works well. This limits its interpretability and broader applicability.
3. Modest Performance Gains: While the learned optimizer outperforms baselines in some cases, the improvements are often incremental, highlighting the robustness of existing hand-designed optimizers.
4. Post-hoc Analysis: The paper provides limited insight into the learned optimization strategies. A deeper analysis could inspire new theoretical directions or practical improvements.
5. Generalization Limitations: The optimizer struggles with tasks significantly different from its training regime, such as networks with ReLU activations instead of sigmoid, indicating limited robustness.
Recommendation:
The paper introduces a creative and impactful idea, but its contributions are currently constrained by the limited scale of experiments and lack of theoretical depth. To strengthen its impact, the authors should:
- Conduct experiments on larger-scale models and datasets.
- Provide theoretical insights or guarantees about the learned optimizer's behavior.
- Include a more detailed post-hoc analysis of the learned optimization strategies.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Novel and timely idea with potential for significant impact.
- Promising empirical results demonstrating the feasibility of learning optimization algorithms.
- Strong transfer learning capabilities in certain scenarios.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Limited experimental scale reduces practical relevance.
- Lack of theoretical guarantees and interpretability.
- Modest performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods.
Overall, this paper is a valuable contribution to the field of meta-learning and optimization, but further work is needed to fully realize its potential. I recommend acceptance with the expectation that future iterations will address the outlined weaknesses.
