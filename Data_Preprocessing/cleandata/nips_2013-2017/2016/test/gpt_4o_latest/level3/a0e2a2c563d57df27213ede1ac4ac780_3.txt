The paper presents an innovative extension to the Region Ranking SVM (RRSVM) classification model by incorporating a biologically inspired diversity mechanism, specifically Inhibition of Return (IoR), to predict human gaze fixations during visual search tasks. This approach bridges the gap between behavioral studies of visual attention and computer vision techniques. By adding IoR, the authors introduce a Sparse Diverse Regions (SDR) classifier, achieving state-of-the-art results in fixation prediction across multiple datasets (POET, PET, MIT900) while maintaining classification performance. Notably, the model operates without object location annotations, relying solely on image-level labels. This work represents a significant contribution to both fixation prediction and the broader understanding of attention mechanisms in computer vision.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Clever Premise: The use of a classification model (RRSVM) for fixation prediction is a creative and biologically plausible approach, offering a fresh perspective on visual attention modeling.
2. Strong Empirical Results: The SDR model achieves superior AUC scores compared to existing methods, including those with access to object location annotations, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness.
3. Biological Inspiration: The incorporation of IoR adds a meaningful connection to human visual behavior, enhancing the model's interpretability and relevance to cognitive science.
4. Clarity and Reproducibility: The paper is well-organized, with detailed descriptions of the model, datasets, and evaluation metrics, enabling reproducibility.
Weaknesses and Suggestions:
1. Evaluation Metrics: While AUC is a standard metric, the dominance of AUC in fixation prediction could be questioned. Metrics like log-likelihood under the priority map may provide complementary insights. The authors should justify their choice of AUC as the primary evaluation metric.
2. Uncertainty Measures: The paper lacks uncertainty quantification (e.g., standard error) for mean AUC scores. Including these would strengthen claims of significant differences between RRSVM and SDR.
3. Human Data Upper Bound: Reporting split-half AUC for human fixation data would establish a natural upper bound for model performance and assess data sufficiency.
4. Performance Variability: The model shows performance drops on certain categories (e.g., sofa). The authors should explore the relationship between classification and fixation prediction performance to understand these discrepancies better.
5. Writing Overlap: Section 2 shows similarities with Wei and Hoai's CVPR paper. Revisions are necessary to ensure distinctiveness and avoid concerns of self-plagiarism.
6. Model Details: The regions searched by RRSVM (e.g., size, number, dimensionality reduction by SDR) require further clarification to enhance transparency.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper addresses a challenging and significant problem, advancing the state-of-the-art in fixation prediction.
- The approach is novel, biologically inspired, and demonstrates strong empirical performance.
- Technical concerns raised in reviews and rebuttals were adequately addressed.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Lack of uncertainty measures and alternative evaluation metrics weakens the robustness of the results.
- Writing overlap in Section 2 raises concerns about originality.
Recommendation:
Despite minor weaknesses, the paper's contributions to fixation prediction and its novel approach justify acceptance. Addressing the outlined issues in a revision would further strengthen its impact.
