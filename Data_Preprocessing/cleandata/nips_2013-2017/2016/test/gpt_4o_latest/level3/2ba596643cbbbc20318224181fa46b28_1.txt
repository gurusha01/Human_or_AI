The paper introduces a novel extension to the classical stochastic multi-armed bandit problem by incorporating a multi-fidelity framework, where each arm can be evaluated at varying levels of fidelity, trading off between cost and accuracy. The authors propose the Multi-Fidelity Upper Confidence Bound (MF-UCB) algorithm, which leverages low-cost, low-fidelity evaluations to eliminate suboptimal arms early, reserving expensive high-fidelity evaluations for promising candidates. Theoretical contributions include a regret analysis demonstrating that MF-UCB achieves better regret bounds than standard UCB in many scenarios, particularly when the number of arms is large and the fidelity hierarchy is well-structured. The paper also provides a regret lower bound, showing that MF-UCB is near-optimal under certain conditions. Empirical results on synthetic datasets corroborate the theoretical findings, showing significant improvements over naive UCB strategies.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Significance: The multi-fidelity bandit framework is a meaningful extension of the classical bandit problem, addressing practical scenarios such as online advertising and algorithm selection. The proposed MF-UCB algorithm is innovative and demonstrates clear advantages over existing methods.
2. Theoretical Contributions: The regret analysis is rigorous, with a clear comparison to UCB. The regret lower bound provides valuable insights into the near-optimality of MF-UCB.
3. Practical Relevance: The framework is well-motivated by real-world applications, such as online advertising and robotics, making the work significant for both theory and practice.
4. Empirical Validation: The experiments convincingly demonstrate the superiority of MF-UCB over UCB, aligning with the theoretical predictions.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity of Presentation: The paper suffers from a lack of clarity in explaining key results and assumptions. For instance, Assumption 1 on fidelity parameters appears artificial and is not well-justified, making it difficult to assess its general applicability.
2. Regret Definition: The multiplicative cost penalty used in the regret definition feels unnatural compared to an additive approach, which might align better with practical scenarios.
3. Algorithm Generality: The algorithm appears tailored to specific configurations of fidelity parameters (Î¶), and its applicability to broader settings is insufficiently discussed.
4. Technical Presentation: The technical results, particularly Theorem 2, are difficult to interpret due to dense notation and insufficient explanation. This could hinder reproducibility and understanding by a broader audience.
5. Lower Bound Gap: The gap between the regret lower bound and the algorithm's performance for certain arms (e.g., K(m)7) is acknowledged but not fully resolved, leaving room for improvement.
6. Minor Issues: The paper contains minor typos and notation inconsistencies, which detract from its overall polish.
Recommendation:
While the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of online learning and multi-armed bandits, the lack of clarity in key areas and the artificiality of some assumptions limit its impact. The strengths outweigh the weaknesses, but revisions are necessary to improve clarity, justify assumptions, and address the regret definition. I recommend acceptance with major revisions.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper tackles a novel and practically relevant problem.
- The proposed algorithm is innovative and theoretically sound.
- Empirical results strongly support the theoretical claims.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Lack of clarity in key results and assumptions.
- Artificiality of Assumption 1 and the regret definition.
- Limited discussion of the algorithm's general applicability.
With revisions addressing these issues, the paper could make a strong contribution to the conference.
