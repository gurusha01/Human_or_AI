The paper addresses the critical challenge of energy disaggregation, specifically estimating individual appliance power consumption from total household energy usage data. This is a significant problem in the domain of energy efficiency and sustainability, with applications in reducing utility costs and improving safety. The authors propose an innovative approach using an additive factorial Hidden Markov Model (FHMM) and introduce a novel inference framework that combines convex semidefinite relaxation, randomized rounding, and an efficient ADMM-based solver. This methodological advancement builds upon prior work, particularly Kolter and Jaakkola (2012), by replacing quadratic programming relaxations with tighter semidefinite relaxations, which are shown to yield superior results.
Strengths:  
The paper is technically sound and demonstrates a clear understanding of the problem domain. The proposed approach is well-motivated, leveraging the structure of FHMMs to develop a scalable and computationally efficient solution. The use of semidefinite programming (SDP) and randomized rounding is a novel combination in this context, and the authors effectively utilize ADMM to address the scalability challenges of SDP. The experimental validation is thorough, with results on both synthetic and real-world datasets (REDD) showing significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, including Kolter and Jaakkola (2012) and Zhong et al. (2014). The paper is well-written, logically structured, and accessible to readers unfamiliar with the domain, which enhances its clarity and reproducibility.
Weaknesses:  
Despite its strengths, the paper leaves a key question unanswered: how the number of appliances (M) is estimated in practice. This is a critical parameter in FHMMs, and its sensitivity to empirical evaluation is not explored. While the authors mention using a "generic model" to handle unregistered appliances, the practical implications of this approach are not fully detailed. Additionally, the computational cost of the proposed method, particularly the ADMM solver, is higher than competing methods, as noted in the real-world experiments. While the authors suggest that a C++ implementation could improve efficiency, this remains speculative. Finally, the paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of related work, particularly recent advances in deep learning-based NILM approaches, to better position its contributions within the broader literature.
Pro/Con Arguments for Acceptance:  
- Pro: The paper addresses a challenging and impactful problem, introduces a novel and technically rigorous method, and demonstrates clear empirical improvements.  
- Con: The practical aspects of estimating the number of appliances and the computational overhead of the method warrant further exploration.  
Conclusion:  
Overall, this paper makes a strong contribution to the field of energy disaggregation and advances the state of the art in FHMM inference. While some practical aspects remain underexplored, the methodological innovation and empirical results justify its acceptance. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the aforementioned concerns.
