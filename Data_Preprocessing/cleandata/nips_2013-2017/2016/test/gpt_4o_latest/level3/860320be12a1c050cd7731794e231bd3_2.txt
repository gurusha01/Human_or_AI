This paper introduces a graph-theoretic framework for analyzing Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architectures and proposes three measures of architectural complexity: recurrent depth, feedforward depth, and recurrent skip coefficient. These measures aim to quantify the over-time and local nonlinearities of RNNs, as well as their ability to propagate information across time steps. The authors rigorously define and prove the computability of these measures and validate their utility through experiments on tasks such as language modeling, sequential MNIST, and long-term dependency problems. The results demonstrate that higher architectural complexity, particularly increased recurrent depth and skip coefficients, correlates with improved performance on various tasks. This work builds on prior studies of RNN optimization and architecture design, offering a novel perspective on the role of architectural complexity in RNN performance.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Originality: The paper provides a fresh perspective on RNN architecture by introducing graph-theoretic measures of complexity. These measures (recurrent depth, feedforward depth, and recurrent skip coefficient) are well-motivated and address gaps in prior work, such as the lack of formal definitions for "depth" in RNNs.
2. Theoretical Rigor: The authors rigorously define the proposed measures and prove their computability, lending credibility to their framework.
3. Empirical Validation: The experimental results convincingly demonstrate the practical utility of the proposed measures. For example, the recurrent skip coefficient is shown to significantly improve performance on long-term dependency tasks.
4. Impact on RNN Design: The findings provide actionable insights for designing more effective RNN architectures, such as balancing recurrent and feedforward depth and leveraging skip coefficients for long-term dependencies.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity Issues: The paper suffers from several clarity problems. Figures 1(b) and 2 are difficult to interpret due to inconsistent notations, and the caption for Figure 2 is overly cryptic. These issues hinder the reader's ability to fully grasp the experimental setups and results.
2. Notation Errors: There are errors in notation, such as the use of "V" instead of "V_c" on line 71 and the incorrect subscript in the definition of unfolding. These should be corrected for precision.
3. Ambiguity in Definitions: The discussion of m > 1 (period number) adds unnecessary complexity without clear justification. A more detailed explanation of its necessity and implications would improve the paper.
4. Weight Constraints: The paper does not clarify whether the weight Ïƒ is allowed to be negative, which could lead to confusion in interpreting the graph-theoretic framework.
5. Limited Discussion of Trade-offs: While the paper highlights the benefits of increasing depth and skip coefficients, it does not adequately discuss the potential trade-offs, such as optimization challenges or computational overhead.
Recommendation:
This paper makes a significant contribution to the understanding of RNN architectures and their complexity. However, the clarity and presentation issues need to be addressed before publication. Specifically, the authors should revise the figures and captions for better interpretability, correct the notation errors, and provide a more detailed discussion of the necessity of m > 1 and the constraints on weights. Despite these weaknesses, the paper's theoretical and empirical contributions are strong, and I recommend acceptance after minor revisions.
