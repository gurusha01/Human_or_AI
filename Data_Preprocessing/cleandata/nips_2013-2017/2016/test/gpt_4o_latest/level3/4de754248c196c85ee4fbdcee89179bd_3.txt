The paper presents a novel and efficient approach to energy disaggregation, formulated as a binary quadratic program (BQP) and solved through a combination of convex relaxations, semidefinite programming (SDP), and randomized rounding. The authors propose a scalable variant of the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) tailored to the problem's large-scale and block-structured nature. Their method demonstrates superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art technique by Kolter & Jaakkola (2012), both in synthetic and real-world datasets.
Strengths:
1. Technical Soundness: The paper is technically robust, with a well-justified methodology. The relaxation of the BQP into a convex problem (Equation 7) and further into an SDP (Equation 8) is a principled approach. The use of randomized rounding to recover binary variables is well-grounded in optimization literature.
2. Scalability: The proposed ADMM variant is a significant contribution, addressing the computational challenges of solving large-scale SDP problems. This scalability is critical for practical applications like energy disaggregation, where datasets can involve millions of variables.
3. Experimental Validation: The method is rigorously evaluated on both synthetic and real-world datasets (REDD). The results show consistent improvements in load disaggregation accuracy, with a notable reduction in normalized disaggregation error and better precision-recall metrics compared to competing methods.
4. Clarity and Self-Containment: The paper is well-written and self-contained, providing sufficient background on factorial HMMs, SDP relaxations, and ADMM. The inclusion of algorithmic details (e.g., Algorithm 1 and 2) makes the methodology reproducible.
5. Significance: The work addresses a critical problem in energy efficiency and safety, with potential applications in smart homes and energy monitoring systems. The proposed method advances the state of the art in NILM and could inspire further research in scalable optimization for FHMMs.
Weaknesses:
1. Organization: The paper's organization could be improved. For instance, the transition between sections is abrupt, and some details (e.g., the derivation of ADMM updates) are relegated to appendices, which disrupts the flow for readers.
2. Computational Overhead: While the method is scalable, the reported runtime (5 hours for real-world data) is significantly higher than competing methods. Although the authors suggest that a C++ implementation could improve efficiency, this remains speculative.
3. Minor Errors: There are minor typographical issues, such as "L75 indicator function" and "yet.Kolter" (should be "yet. Kolter"). Additionally, the notation in Equations 1 and 2 (K â†’ K_i) could be clarified.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper introduces a novel and scalable solution to a challenging optimization problem, with clear improvements over prior work.
- The methodology is rigorous and has broader applicability beyond NILM, potentially benefiting other FHMM inference problems.
- The experimental results are compelling, demonstrating both theoretical and practical significance.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The computational overhead could limit practical adoption unless the implementation is optimized.
- The organization and presentation of the paper could be refined for better readability.
Recommendation:
I recommend acceptance of this paper, as its contributions to scalable optimization for energy disaggregation are significant and well-supported by theoretical and experimental evidence. However, the authors should address the organizational issues and provide more details on potential runtime optimizations in the final version.
