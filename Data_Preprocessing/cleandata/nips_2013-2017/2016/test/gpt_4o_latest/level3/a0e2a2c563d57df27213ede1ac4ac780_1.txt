The paper introduces the Sparse Diverse Region Classifier (SDR), an extension of the Region Ranking SVM (RRSVM), which incorporates the biologically inspired "Inhibition of Return" mechanism using non-maximum suppression (NMS). This addition enforces diversity in the selected regions, making SDR a promising model for predicting human visual attention during search tasks. The authors evaluate SDR on three datasets (POET, MIT900, PET) across single-target, absent-target, and multiple-target scenarios, using the AUC-Judd metric to compare model-generated priority maps with human fixation density maps. The results demonstrate a 4% improvement in fixation prediction over the baseline RRSVM, with SDR achieving state-of-the-art performance in several cases.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Biological Plausibility: The incorporation of the "Inhibition of Return" mechanism into RRSVM is a novel and biologically plausible approach that bridges computational models and human visual attention mechanisms.
2. Performance Gains: SDR outperforms strong baselines like R-CNN and AnnoBoxes in predicting human fixations, particularly in animal-related classes, where it shows significant advantages.
3. Reproducibility and Clarity: The paper is well-organized, with clear experimental protocols and detailed implementation descriptions, facilitating reproducibility.
4. Cross-Dataset Evaluation: The use of multiple datasets and diverse scenarios strengthens the empirical evidence for SDR's effectiveness.
Weaknesses:
1. Baseline Limitations: The choice of R-CNN as a baseline is suboptimal, given its reliance on outdated Selective Search and its focus on object detection rather than fixation prediction. Similarly, AnnoBoxes' reliance on bounding box centers does not align well with fixation points, limiting the strength of comparisons.
2. Empirical Evidence Gaps: While SDR shows promise, comparisons with more recent and relevant methods, such as Li et al. (arXiv:1506.06343), are missing. This omission weakens the claim of state-of-the-art performance.
3. Parameter Analysis: The lack of an ablation study to evaluate the impact of key parameters, such as the NMS overlap threshold and Gaussian blur kernel width, limits insights into SDR's robustness and sensitivity.
4. Center Bias Concerns: Although the authors address center bias, its potential influence on results, especially for the POET dataset, remains a concern.
5. Unclear Positioning: The paper does not clearly position its contributions relative to existing work, and the conclusions lack depth in discussing implications and future directions.
Recommendation:
The paper presents a promising method with clear advancements in fixation prediction. However, it requires revisions before publication. Specifically, the authors should:
1. Strengthen empirical comparisons by including more relevant baselines and recent methods.
2. Conduct an ablation study to analyze parameter sensitivity.
3. Clarify the paper's positioning relative to related work and provide more actionable conclusions.
Pro Arguments:
- Novel and biologically inspired approach.
- Strong performance gains on multiple datasets.
- Clear and reproducible methodology.
Con Arguments:
- Weak baselines and limited empirical comparisons.
- Lack of parameter analysis and unclear positioning.
With revisions addressing these issues, the paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field.
