This paper investigates the architectural complexity of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) by introducing three novel measures: recurrent depth (dr), feedforward depth (df), and recurrent skip coefficient (s). These measures aim to quantify the nonlinear transformations and information flow in RNNs, providing a theoretical framework for analyzing and designing RNN architectures. The authors validate their framework through experiments on five datasets, offering insights into the effects of dr, df, and s on RNN performance, particularly for tasks involving long-term dependencies.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Importance: The proposed measures address a critical gap in understanding RNN architectures, offering a graph-theoretic perspective that complements existing work on optimization and functional units. This is a valuable contribution to the field, particularly for designing RNNs tailored to specific tasks.
2. Theoretical Rigor: The paper provides formal definitions and proofs for the proposed measures, ensuring their well-definedness and computability. This mathematical rigor strengthens the validity of the contributions.
3. Empirical Validation: The experiments explore the practical implications of dr, df, and s, demonstrating their relevance for improving RNN performance on diverse tasks, including long-term dependency problems. The results on datasets like PennTreebank, text8, and sequential MNIST are particularly compelling.
4. Potential Impact: The proposed measures could guide future RNN design, offering a systematic approach to balancing architectural complexity and task requirements.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity and Organization: The paper is difficult to follow due to excessive use of symbols, dense mathematical formulations, and unclear definitions. Key concepts such as dr, df, and s are introduced in a highly technical manner, which may alienate readers unfamiliar with graph theory. A table summarizing key symbols and moving some definitions to the supplementary material would improve readability.
2. Experimental Analysis: While the experiments are extensive, the results in Table 1 show minimal performance differences between some RNN variants. The authors should clarify whether these differences are statistically significant or attributable to random initialization. Additionally, Table 2 comparisons are confusing due to inconsistent model naming (e.g., RNN(tanh) vs. RNN(stanh)), which requires better explanation.
3. Minor Presentation Issues: Figure captions are unclear, and Figure 2 would benefit from a vertical line for better visual separation. These issues detract from the overall presentation quality.
Recommendation:
This paper addresses an important and underexplored problem, proposing reasonable and theoretically sound measures for RNN architectural complexity. However, its clarity and experimental analysis require significant improvement. I recommend conditional acceptance, provided the authors address the following:
1. Simplify the presentation by summarizing key symbols in a table and moving detailed proofs to the appendix.
2. Clarify the statistical significance of experimental results and ensure consistent model comparisons.
3. Improve figure captions and visualizations for better accessibility.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Novel and theoretically rigorous contributions to RNN architecture analysis.
- Empirical results demonstrate practical relevance of the proposed measures.
- Potential to guide future research and RNN design.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Poor clarity and organization hinder accessibility.
- Experimental results lack sufficient explanation and statistical rigor.
- Minor presentation issues detract from the paper's impact.
With revisions, this paper could make a strong contribution to the field.
