This paper introduces a novel multi-fidelity variant of the stochastic K-armed bandit problem, formalized as a multi-fidelity bandit problem. The authors propose MF-UCB, a new algorithm that leverages cheaper, biased approximations (lower fidelities) to reduce the cost of exploration while maintaining strong theoretical guarantees on regret. The paper provides a comprehensive theoretical analysis, including regret bounds and a lower bound, and validates the approach through simulations.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Originality: The multi-fidelity bandit problem is a fresh and practical extension of the classical K-armed bandit framework. The authors address a real-world challenge where observations at different fidelities come with varying costs and biases, which has applications in domains like online advertising, algorithm selection, and robotics. The proposed MF-UCB algorithm is a novel adaptation of the classical UCB algorithm to this setting.
   
2. Theoretical Contributions: The paper rigorously derives regret bounds for MF-UCB, demonstrating that it achieves better regret compared to naive strategies like standard UCB. The inclusion of a lower bound further strengthens the theoretical foundation, showing that MF-UCB is near-optimal under certain conditions.
3. Empirical Validation: Simulations illustrate the practical benefits of MF-UCB, confirming its ability to outperform standard UCB by effectively using lower fidelities to eliminate suboptimal arms. The results align with the theoretical insights, adding credibility to the approach.
4. Clarity and Presentation: The paper is well-organized and clearly written, with detailed explanations of the algorithm, theoretical results, and experimental setup. The illustrative examples and partitioning of arms into fidelity-based sets enhance understanding.
Weaknesses:
1. Assumptions and Generality: The analysis relies on specific assumptions, such as the decay of fidelity biases (Î¶(m)) and the regularity condition (Assumption 1). While these assumptions are reasonable, their necessity limits the generality of the approach. The authors acknowledge this but do not explore alternative scenarios where these assumptions may not hold.
2. Practical Limitations: The paper focuses on a specific notion of regret that assumes all fidelities provide meaningful rewards. However, in some applications (e.g., simulations without real-world rewards), this assumption may not hold. The authors briefly mention such settings in the conclusion but do not provide concrete solutions or extensions.
3. Gap in Lower Bound Tightness: The regret bound for MF-UCB does not match the lower bound for certain arms (e.g., those in K(m)7). While the authors explain this gap and leave it as an open problem, addressing it would strengthen the theoretical contribution.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper addresses a practical and underexplored problem, introducing a novel algorithm with strong theoretical and empirical support.
- Theoretical results are detailed and include both upper and lower bounds, showcasing the near-optimality of the approach.
- The simulations effectively validate the proposed method, demonstrating its superiority over standard UCB.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The reliance on specific assumptions limits the general applicability of the results.
- The gap between the upper and lower bounds for certain arms highlights an unresolved theoretical issue.
- Practical extensions to settings with fidelity-specific rewards or penalties are only briefly mentioned, leaving room for further exploration.
Recommendation:
Overall, this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of multi-armed bandits by introducing and analyzing the multi-fidelity setting. Its strengths in novelty, theoretical rigor, and empirical validation outweigh the identified weaknesses. I recommend acceptance, with the suggestion that the authors address the limitations and explore broader applications in future work.
