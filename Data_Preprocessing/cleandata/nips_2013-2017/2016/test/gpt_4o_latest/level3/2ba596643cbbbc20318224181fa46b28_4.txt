The paper introduces the Multi-fidelity Multi-armed Bandit (MF-MAB) framework, a novel extension of the classical stochastic bandit problem, where arms can be sampled at varying fidelity levels with associated costs. The authors propose the MF-UCB algorithm, which leverages lower-cost, lower-fidelity approximations to eliminate suboptimal arms and reserves higher-cost, higher-fidelity evaluations for promising candidates. The paper provides a regret analysis for MF-UCB, demonstrating its near-optimality under certain conditions, and complements this with a theoretical lower bound. Empirical results on synthetic problems show that MF-UCB outperforms the standard UCB algorithm, highlighting its practical potential.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Relevance: The introduction of the multi-fidelity bandit framework is a significant contribution, addressing practical scenarios where cost-efficient approximations are available. This is an important extension to the classical bandit problem, with potential applications in fields like online advertising, algorithm selection, and resource-constrained optimization.
2. Algorithmic Contribution: The MF-UCB algorithm is well-motivated and builds on established UCB techniques while adapting them to the multi-fidelity setting. The use of lower fidelities to reduce exploration costs is a compelling idea.
3. Theoretical Rigor: The regret analysis and the derivation of a lower bound are strong theoretical contributions. The authors also provide insights into the conditions under which MF-UCB outperforms standard UCB.
4. Empirical Validation: Numerical simulations convincingly demonstrate the superiority of MF-UCB over UCB, with clear visualizations of fidelity usage and regret trends.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity and Organization: The paper suffers from poor organization and unclear notation. Definitions, such as that of $s$, are scattered and difficult to locate, making the paper challenging to follow. The introduction of notations could benefit from a dedicated section for clarity.
2. Misleading Example: The use of online advertising as a motivating example is problematic. The reference to non-stationarity in this context is irrelevant and detracts from the focus of the paper.
3. Regret Analysis Concerns: The regret analysis assumes that the optimal policy always favors the arm with the highest mean, regardless of cost. This assumption may oversimplify real-world scenarios where cost-effectiveness is critical.
4. Missing Sample Complexity Analysis: A sample complexity (or cost complexity) analysis would be more relevant in the multi-fidelity context, as it would provide insights into the trade-off between fidelity levels and cost.
5. Writing Style: The text is verbose and unwieldy in parts, which detracts from readability. Streamlining the exposition and improving the flow would significantly enhance the paper.
Recommendation:
While the paper makes a valuable contribution to the field, its weaknesses in clarity, organization, and the choice of examples detract from its overall quality. A stronger focus on sample complexity analysis and improved presentation would make the work more impactful. I recommend acceptance with major revisions, as the core idea is novel and significant, but the execution needs refinement.
Arguments Pro Acceptance:
- Novel framework with practical relevance.
- Strong theoretical and empirical contributions.
- Potential to inspire further research in multi-fidelity optimization.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Poor clarity and organization hinder comprehension.
- Misleading example and oversimplified regret analysis.
- Lack of sample complexity analysis, which is critical for the setting.
In summary, the paper has substantial merit but requires significant revisions to address its shortcomings.
