This paper investigates the dynamic regret of multi-armed bandit (MAB) and expert problems in nonstationary stochastic environments, introducing a novel parameter, Λ, to measure the total statistical variance of reward distributions. The authors analyze the interplay between Λ, Γ (number of distribution changes), and V (cumulative drift), providing a comprehensive framework for understanding regret in both full-information and bandit settings. The paper makes significant contributions by proposing algorithms with theoretical regret guarantees and establishing matching lower bounds, offering a nuanced view of the problem's complexity.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Scope: The introduction of Λ as a parameter to capture statistical variance is an innovative contribution that bridges the gap between adversarial and stochastic settings. The paper provides a unified framework for analyzing regret in nonstationary environments, which is both timely and relevant.
2. Theoretical Rigor: The regret bounds for the proposed algorithms are well-supported by theoretical analysis, and the matching lower bounds in Section 4 provide strong evidence of the tightness of the results. The contrast between the bandit and full-information settings is particularly insightful.
3. Algorithmic Contributions: Algorithm 3, a parameter-free full-information algorithm, is a highlight due to its simplicity and practical appeal. Its regret bounds, analyzed in Theorems 3.4 and 3.5, are competitive and demonstrate the algorithm's robustness.
4. Clarity of Results: The paper clearly delineates the achievable regret bounds for different parameter regimes, offering a comprehensive landscape of the problem. The inclusion of a summary table (Appendix A) is helpful for readers.
Weaknesses:
1. Practicality of Algorithms: Algorithms 1 and 2 assume prior knowledge of parameters like Γ, Λ, and V, which may limit their applicability in real-world scenarios. While Algorithm 3 addresses this issue, extending parameter-free approaches to the bandit setting would enhance the paper's impact.
2. Scaling of Λ: The claim that regret is "constant" with respect to time in the full-information setting is misleading, as Λ typically scales with T. This requires clarification to avoid confusion.
3. Parameter Γ: While Γ is a useful measure, the reviewer suggests exploring alternative metrics, such as the number of optimal arm changes, which could provide additional insights into the problem's complexity.
4. Explicit Constants: The regret bounds lack explicit constants, which would improve the interpretability and practical utility of the results.
Recommendation:
This paper makes a strong theoretical contribution to the study of dynamic regret in nonstationary environments, advancing the state of the art. While there are some limitations in practical applicability and clarity, the strengths outweigh the weaknesses. The reviewer recommends acceptance, with minor revisions to address the scaling of Λ and to include explicit constants in the regret bounds.
