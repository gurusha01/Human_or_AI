The paper introduces the Homotopy Smoothing (HOPS) algorithm, a novel approach for solving structured non-smooth optimization problems. The key innovation lies in dynamically adjusting the smoothing parameter to achieve faster convergence in early iterations and improved approximations later. This homotopy strategy builds on Nesterov's smoothing technique but introduces a stage-wise reduction of the smoothing parameter, combined with warm-starting, to achieve a lower iteration complexity of \( \tilde{O}(1/\epsilon^{1-\theta}) \), where \( \theta \) captures the local sharpness of the objective function. This is a significant improvement over existing methods and represents the first theoretical complexity guarantee for such an approach.
Strengths:
1. Theoretical Contribution: The paper provides a rigorous complexity analysis for HOPS, establishing its superiority over existing methods like Nesterov's smoothing and primal-dual approaches. The use of the local error bound condition to justify the improved complexity is well-grounded and generalizes to a broad class of non-smooth problems.
2. Clarity of Explanation: Section 4.2 and Figure 1 are particularly effective in illustrating the homotopy method and the role of the local sharpness parameter \( \theta \). These explanations make the technical aspects more accessible.
3. Practical Relevance: The experimental results demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness across diverse tasks, including classification, image denoising, and matrix decomposition. The introduction of PD-HOPS further enhances practical usability by automating the choice of iterations per stage.
Weaknesses:
1. Experimental Analysis: While the experiments show promising results, the lack of error measures such as standard deviations and confidence intervals undermines the reliability of the reported performance gains. This omission makes it difficult to assess the robustness of the algorithm.
2. Parameter Sensitivity: The paper does not provide an empirical analysis of how the choice of the homotopy smoothing parameter \( b \) impacts convergence speed. This is a critical omission, as \( b \) plays a central role in the algorithm's performance.
3. Minor Clarity Issues: The paper does not sufficiently clarify the choice of \( b \) in experiments or the precise meaning of "optimal value" in the context of the duality gap. Addressing these would improve the paper's accessibility.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper makes a strong theoretical contribution by improving iteration complexity for a broad class of non-smooth problems.
- The proposed algorithm is practical and demonstrates significant performance improvements in experiments.
- The explanations and theoretical insights are clear and well-organized.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The experimental section lacks rigor in presenting error measures, which weakens the empirical validation of the claims.
- The absence of parameter sensitivity analysis leaves a gap in understanding the algorithm's practical behavior.
Recommendation: Accept with minor revisions. The paper is a strong contribution to the field, but the authors should address the experimental weaknesses and clarify the role of the smoothing parameter \( b \).
