This paper presents a rigorous graph-theoretic framework to analyze Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architectures, introducing three novel architectural complexity measures: recurrent depth, feedforward depth, and recurrent skip coefficient. These measures aim to quantify the nonlinear transformations and information flow within RNNs, providing theoretical insights and practical guidelines for designing effective architectures. The authors validate their framework through experiments on various tasks, demonstrating the relevance of these measures in improving RNN performance, particularly for long-term dependency problems.
Strengths:
1. Theoretical Contributions: The paper offers a well-defined graph-theoretic framework for RNN architectures, addressing a gap in the literature by formalizing the concept of "depth" in RNNs. The proposed measures—recurrent depth, feedforward depth, and recurrent skip coefficient—are mathematically rigorous, computable, and intuitively linked to RNN behavior.
2. Empirical Validation: The experiments convincingly demonstrate that increasing recurrent depth and feedforward depth can improve performance on short-term tasks, while increasing the recurrent skip coefficient significantly enhances performance on long-term dependency tasks. This provides practical value for RNN design.
3. Clarity of Results: The paper systematically compares architectures with varying complexity measures, offering clear evidence of the impact of these measures on tasks like language modeling, sequential MNIST, and synthetic benchmarks (e.g., adding and copying problems).
4. Novel Insights: The distinction between recurrent depth and feedforward depth is particularly insightful, as it highlights the limitations of traditional notions of "depth" in RNNs. The recurrent skip coefficient provides a new perspective on the role of skip connections in mitigating vanishing/exploding gradients.
Weaknesses:
1. Limited Applicability: While the experiments are thorough, the tasks are somewhat narrow in scope. Adding experiments on speech recognition or other real-world sequential tasks would strengthen the paper's applicability and broaden its impact.
2. Mathematical Notation: Minor errors in mathematical notations on lines 59, 155, and 167 should be corrected for clarity and precision.
3. Figure 1 Caption: The caption of Figure 1 lacks a brief explanation of how the measures ($dr$, $df$, and $s$) are computed, which could improve accessibility for readers unfamiliar with the framework.
4. Optimization Challenges: The paper briefly mentions optimization issues for architectures with very large recurrent or feedforward depths but does not explore these challenges in detail. A discussion on practical strategies to address these issues would be valuable.
Recommendation:
This paper makes a significant theoretical and practical contribution to the understanding of RNN architectures and their complexity. Its rigorous framework and empirical validation are strengths, though the scope of experiments could be expanded. I recommend acceptance, contingent on addressing the minor corrections and providing additional clarity in the figures and discussion.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- Novel and rigorous theoretical framework.
- Empirical evidence supporting the utility of proposed measures.
- Practical guidelines for RNN design.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- Limited experimental scope.
- Minor issues with clarity and notation.
Overall, this paper advances the state of the art in RNN architecture analysis and provides a foundation for future research in this area.
