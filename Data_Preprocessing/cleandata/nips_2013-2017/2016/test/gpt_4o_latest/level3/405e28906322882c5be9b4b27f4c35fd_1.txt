This paper investigates dynamic regret in multi-armed bandit and expert problems within non-stationary stochastic environments, introducing a novel parameter, Λ, to capture the total statistical variance of loss distributions. The authors analyze the interplay between Λ, Γ (number of distribution changes), and V (total drift), presenting algorithms with regret bounds and proving matching lower bounds. Key contributions include the demonstration that, even with constant Γ, V, and Λ, regret in the bandit setting grows with T, while constant regret is achievable in the full-information setting under certain conditions.
Strengths:
1. Theoretical Contributions: The paper provides a comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding dynamic regret in non-stationary environments. The introduction of Λ as a measure of variance adds a new dimension to the analysis, bridging the gap between stochastic and adversarial settings.
2. Regret Bounds: The derivation of regret bounds, particularly the sharp contrast between bandit and full-information settings, is a significant contribution. The matching lower bounds further solidify the theoretical rigor.
3. Algorithm Design: The proposed algorithms, including parameter-free variants, are well-motivated and address practical concerns regarding parameter knowledge.
4. Proof Correctness: The proof of Theorem 4.1 is verified to be correct, and the constructed environment is clarified as oblivious, addressing concerns raised during the rebuttal.
Weaknesses:
1. Novelty and Contextualization: While the introduction of Λ is noteworthy, the novelty is somewhat diluted by insufficient discussion of prior work, such as Jadbabaie et al. (2015), which also considers variance in dynamic regret. The relationship between Λ and prior complexity measures is not adequately clarified.
2. Citations and Writing: The paper lacks critical citations, such as the UCB-V algorithm by Audibert et al. (2009), and the writing is unclear in places. The motivations for the proposed complexity measures, particularly Λ, are not compellingly presented.
3. Connection to Related Work: The paper does not sufficiently explore connections to tracking/shifting bounds or related work in information theory, such as coding piecewise stationary sources. Similarly, reductions to sleeping expert problems, which are relevant, are not discussed.
4. Practical Relevance: While the theoretical results are strong, the practical implications of the proposed algorithms are limited, as they often require knowledge of parameters like Λ, Γ, and V.
Recommendations:
For publication, the paper requires substantial improvements in contextualizing its contributions within existing literature. The authors should explicitly clarify the novelty of Λ compared to prior measures and discuss its practical relevance with compelling examples. Missing citations and unclear writing must also be addressed. Additionally, exploring connections to related work, such as sleeping expert reductions and information theory, would strengthen the paper's impact.
Decision:
Borderline Reject. While the theoretical contributions are strong, the lack of novelty discussion, missing citations, and unclear writing hinder the paper's overall quality. Addressing these issues in a revised submission could make it a strong candidate for acceptance.
