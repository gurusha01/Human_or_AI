The paper presents a refined optimization framework for learning additive factorial Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), with a specific focus on energy disaggregation applications. The authors propose a novel approach that combines semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations, randomized rounding, and a scalable Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) solver. Their method is evaluated against state-of-the-art baselines on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating significant improvements in performance.
Strengths:  
The technical quality of the work is solid, with a well-grounded theoretical foundation and rigorous experimental validation. The proposed SDP relaxation and randomized rounding approach represents a meaningful advancement over prior methods, particularly in addressing the scalability challenges associated with factorial HMMs. The authors also provide a detailed comparison with existing methods, such as those by Kolter and Jaakkola (2012) and Zhong et al. (2014), and demonstrate substantial improvements in terms of precision, recall, and normalized disaggregation error. The societal impact of this work is potentially high, as energy disaggregation can lead to significant energy savings, increased safety, and greater consumer awareness of energy usage. Furthermore, the authors effectively addressed concerns about novelty, scalability, and comparisons during the rebuttal phase, strengthening the paper's overall contribution.
Weaknesses:  
While the proposed method is an improvement, the originality is moderate, as it builds upon existing techniques like SDP relaxations and ADMM. The novelty lies primarily in the specific combination of these methods and their application to energy disaggregation. Additionally, the paper's presentation, while generally clear, requires a thorough grammatical review to improve readability and polish. The computational cost of the proposed method, as noted in the experiments, is higher than some baselines, with a runtime of 5 hours compared to 5 minutes for competing methods. Although the authors suggest that an optimized implementation could address this, the current implementation may limit practical adoption.
Pro Acceptance Arguments:  
1. Significant improvement in performance over state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets.  
2. Solid technical contributions, especially in addressing scalability challenges in factorial HMMs.  
3. High societal impact, with potential applications in energy efficiency and safety.  
4. Rigorous experimental evaluation and effective rebuttal addressing key concerns.
Con Acceptance Arguments:  
1. Moderate originality due to reliance on existing techniques.  
2. High computational cost compared to baselines.  
3. Presentation issues, including grammatical errors, which detract from the paper's clarity.
Recommendation:  
I recommend acceptance of this paper, as its technical contributions and societal relevance outweigh its limitations. However, I strongly encourage the authors to address the grammatical issues and provide a clearer discussion of the computational trade-offs in the final version.
