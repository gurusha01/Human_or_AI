This paper introduces a novel extension of the classical multi-armed bandit problem by incorporating a "multi-fidelity" framework, where each arm can be evaluated at varying levels of fidelity. Lower-fidelity evaluations are less costly but introduce bias in the reward estimates. The authors propose a new algorithm, MF-UCB, which adapts the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) approach to this setting by adjusting confidence intervals to account for the bias introduced by lower fidelities. The theoretical analysis includes regret bounds that suggest MF-UCB outperforms standard UCB in many scenarios, and simulations demonstrate significant empirical improvements. However, the work has notable limitations, including unclear parameter choices in simulations and weak connections to real-world applications.
Strengths:
1. Novelty: The paper introduces an innovative formalism for multi-fidelity bandits, addressing a practical issue in scenarios where high-fidelity evaluations are expensive. This is a meaningful extension of the bandit literature.
2. Algorithm Design: MF-UCB is a natural and well-motivated adaptation of UCB to the multi-fidelity setting. The algorithm effectively leverages cheaper, biased evaluations to reduce costs while maintaining competitive regret.
3. Theoretical Contributions: The regret bounds derived are insightful and demonstrate the potential benefits of the multi-fidelity approach. The lower bound analysis further strengthens the theoretical rigor of the work.
4. Empirical Results: The simulations show that MF-UCB achieves 3-4x better regret compared to standard UCB, highlighting the practical utility of the proposed method.
Weaknesses:
1. Theoretical Complexity: The regret bounds, while theoretically sound, are difficult to interpret and lack intuitive clarity. This limits their practical utility for practitioners.
2. Simulation Concerns: The parameter choices in the simulations are not well-justified, raising concerns about the generalizability of the results. It is unclear whether the observed performance gains hold across a broader range of settings.
3. Modeling Assumptions: The decision to model low fidelity as introducing bias rather than variance is partially convincing but does not universally apply to all motivating examples. This limits the scope of the framework.
4. Weak Real-World Connections: The paper's motivating applications, such as online advertising and algorithm selection, are not convincingly tied to the proposed model. For instance, the practical goals and constraints in these applications are not clearly articulated.
Pro/Con Arguments for Acceptance:
Pro:
- The paper addresses a relevant and underexplored problem in the bandit literature.
- The proposed algorithm is well-motivated and demonstrates strong empirical performance.
- The theoretical analysis is rigorous and provides valuable insights into the multi-fidelity setting.
Con:
- The regret bounds are overly complex and lack interpretability.
- The weak justification for parameter choices in simulations undermines the empirical results.
- The real-world applicability of the model is not convincingly demonstrated.
Recommendation:
While the paper has clear strengths in terms of novelty and theoretical contributions, the weaknesses in interpretability, empirical generalizability, and real-world relevance cannot be overlooked. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions, contingent on the authors addressing the concerns about parameter justification and providing stronger connections to practical applications. This work has the potential to make a meaningful contribution to the field, but some refinements are necessary to maximize its impact.
