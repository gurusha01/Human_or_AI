Review of "Incorporating Inhibition of Return into Region Ranking SVM for Visual Attention Modeling"
This paper extends the Region Ranking SVM (RRSVM) framework by incorporating the biologically plausible mechanism of Inhibition of Return (IoR) to model visual attention. The authors propose a Sparse Diverse Regions (SDR) classifier that emphasizes non-uniform regions of visual space, aligning with salient areas for classification. By integrating IoR, the model avoids re-attending to nearby regions, effectively enhancing visual search. The paper demonstrates the model's physiological consistency and competitive performance in predicting human gaze fixations across three visual search tasks, while maintaining classification accuracy. The authors also highlight failure cases, providing insights into the model's limitations.
Strengths:
1. Biological Framing: The incorporation of IoR adds a biologically plausible mechanism to RRSVM, making the model more aligned with human visual attention processes. This is a meaningful contribution to bridging computational vision and cognitive science.
2. Empirical Validation: The model achieves state-of-the-art results in predicting human gaze fixations, with significant improvements over baseline methods. The experiments are well-designed, covering diverse datasets and search conditions (single-target, target-absent, and multi-target).
3. Transparency: The authors explicitly discuss scenarios where the model underperforms, such as failures in attending to multiple instances or distractions from text and faces. This transparency aids in understanding the model's strengths and limitations.
4. Incremental Novelty: While the novelty is incremental, the integration of IoR and the focus on sparse, diverse region selection add value to the RRSVM framework, particularly in the context of visual attention modeling.
Weaknesses:
1. Limited Biological Plausibility: Despite the IoR mechanism, the overall implementation of RRSVM remains primarily computational, limiting its ability to provide deeper biological insights. For example, the model does not incorporate other known factors influencing human attention, such as bottom-up saliency or scene context.
2. Center Bias: The datasets used, particularly POET, exhibit a strong center bias. While the authors address this concern through additional analyses, it raises questions about the generalizability of the results to less-biased datasets.
3. Incremental Contribution: The novelty of the work is modest, as it primarily builds upon existing RRSVM methods. While the IoR mechanism is a valuable addition, it does not represent a significant departure from prior work.
4. Clarity: The paper is dense, with technical details that may overwhelm readers unfamiliar with RRSVM. Simplifying the presentation of the optimization framework and experimental setup could improve accessibility.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper provides a meaningful extension to RRSVM by incorporating IoR, yielding competitive results in visual attention modeling.
- The experiments are thorough, and the results are well-supported by quantitative evidence.
- The work contributes to understanding the intersection of computational vision and biological attention mechanisms.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The biological plausibility of the model remains limited, and the contribution is incremental.
- The reliance on center-biased datasets may limit the generalizability of the findings.
- The paper could benefit from clearer exposition and a broader discussion of related work in saliency modeling.
Recommendation:
This paper is a solid contribution to the field of visual attention modeling, particularly for its integration of IoR into RRSVM. While the novelty is incremental, the results are compelling, and the work bridges computational and biological perspectives. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions, focusing on improving clarity and addressing the limitations of biological plausibility and dataset bias.
