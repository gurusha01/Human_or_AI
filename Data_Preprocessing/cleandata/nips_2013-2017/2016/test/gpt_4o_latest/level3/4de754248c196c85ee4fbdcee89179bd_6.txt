The paper presents a method for energy disaggregation (NILM) by combining semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation, randomized rounding, and an Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) approach. Building on the work of Kolter & Jaakkola (2012), the authors propose a scalable solution to the inference problem in additive factorial hidden Markov models (FHMMs). The method demonstrates superior accuracy in both synthetic and real-world datasets compared to existing approaches, such as structured variational inference and prior quadratic programming-based methods.
Strengths:  
The paper addresses an important problem in NILM, which has practical implications for energy efficiency and safety. The proposed combination of SDP relaxation and randomized rounding is well-motivated, and the inclusion of a scalable ADMM solver tailored to the problem's block-diagonal structure is a notable contribution. The experimental results convincingly demonstrate the method's superiority in terms of accuracy, with significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real datasets. The authors also provide detailed comparisons and metrics, such as normalized disaggregation error, precision, and recall, which enhance the credibility of their claims. The paper is generally well-written and organized, making it accessible to readers familiar with optimization and NILM.
Weaknesses:  
The primary weakness of the paper lies in its lack of academic novelty. While the combination of SDP relaxation, randomized rounding, and ADMM is effective, these techniques are well-established, and the paper does not introduce fundamentally new concepts. Furthermore, the claims of scalability and computational efficiency are not fully substantiated. Although the authors discuss the scalability of their ADMM solver, they do not provide a formal computational complexity analysis or demonstrate results on larger datasets beyond the REDD dataset. The implementation is also slower compared to competing methods, which undermines the claim of computational efficiency. Additionally, the conclusion section is too brief and does not adequately reflect the broader implications or limitations of the work. Important figures and tables are relegated to supplementary material, which detracts from the readability of the main text.
Recommendations:  
1. Expand the conclusion to discuss the broader impact of the work and its limitations, such as the computational trade-offs.  
2. Include a computational complexity analysis and demonstrate scalability on larger datasets to strengthen the claims of efficiency.  
3. Move critical figures and tables from the supplementary material to the main manuscript.  
4. Address minor expression errors and formatting issues to improve clarity.  
Arguments for Acceptance:  
- The method achieves state-of-the-art performance in NILM tasks, which is a significant practical contribution.  
- The paper is well-organized and provides detailed experimental validation.  
Arguments Against Acceptance:  
- The work lacks novelty, as it primarily combines existing techniques.  
- Claims of scalability and efficiency are not fully supported.  
In summary, while the paper makes a strong empirical contribution to NILM, its lack of novelty and incomplete support for scalability claims may limit its impact. Acceptance should depend on the conference's emphasis on practical versus theoretical contributions.
