The paper presents a novel structured regression model designed to infer voxel-scale neural connectivity using viral tracing data. The model incorporates nonnegativity, spatial smoothness, low-rank assumptions, and ambiguity-handling masks to address the challenges of incomplete data and the high dimensionality of the problem. While the individual components of the model—such as non-negative linear regression, spatial smoothing priors, and low-rank factorization—are well-established in the literature, their combination and application to mesoscale neural connectivity is both innovative and well-executed. The authors demonstrate the efficacy of their approach through synthetic data experiments and real-world applications using the Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas, achieving significant improvements over existing regional models.
Strengths:  
The paper is technically sound and provides a clear and thorough presentation of the methodology. The inclusion of synthetic examples and real-world applications strengthens the validity of the proposed model. The use of a matrix completion loss to handle missing data and a smoothing spline penalty to regularize the solution is particularly well-suited to the problem of neural connectivity mapping. The low-rank factorization is a practical addition, enabling scalability to large datasets while maintaining high predictive accuracy. The results, including a 69% reduction in voxel-scale prediction error compared to regional models, highlight the significance of this work. The supplementary materials, including code and visualization resources, further enhance reproducibility and accessibility.
Weaknesses:  
While the paper is strong overall, there are a few areas for improvement. First, the probabilistic perspective is underexplored; incorporating latent variable priors or addressing the limitations of the Gaussian noise model could further enhance the model's robustness. Second, the spherical covariance assumption, while computationally advantageous, may limit the realism of the results and warrants a more detailed discussion. Finally, the readability of Figure 3 labels is suboptimal and should be improved for clarity.
