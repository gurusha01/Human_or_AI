The paper addresses the problem of learning Bayesian networks optimally under ancestral constraints, a type of non-decomposable constraint that is critical for encoding cause-and-effect relationships. By extending the structure learning framework of Chen et al. [2015, 2016], the authors propose a novel MaxSAT-based approach that significantly improves the efficiency of structure learning compared to traditional ILP-based methods. The key innovation lies in inferring decomposable constraints from ancestral constraints, enabling the use of efficient oracles for decomposable scores. Empirical results demonstrate orders-of-magnitude runtime improvements over ILP-based systems, particularly as the number of variables increases or when ancestral constraints are incorporated.
Strengths:
1. Technical Soundness and Quality: The paper is technically rigorous, providing a clear theoretical foundation for the proposed approach. The authors demonstrate soundness and completeness in pruning the search space and provide a detailed explanation of how decomposable constraints are inferred from non-decomposable ones. The empirical evaluation is thorough, comparing the proposed method against a well-established ILP-based system (GOBNILP) across various datasets and configurations.
   
2. Significance: The results are highly significant, showing dramatic runtime improvements, which make the approach scalable to larger networks. The ability to incorporate ancestral constraints effectively is a valuable contribution, as it enables the integration of expert knowledge into Bayesian network learning, potentially reducing the need for large datasets.
3. Originality: The paper builds on prior work by Chen et al. but introduces novel techniques for handling non-decomposable constraints. The use of MaxSAT to infer ordering constraints is particularly innovative and demonstrates a clever adaptation of existing tools to a challenging problem.
4. Clarity: The paper is well-organized and clearly written. The authors provide sufficient background on Bayesian networks, ancestral constraints, and existing methods, making the work accessible to readers familiar with the field. The experimental setup and results are presented in a detailed and transparent manner.
Weaknesses:
1. Generality of Results: While the empirical results are impressive, they are limited to specific datasets and benchmarks. It would be beneficial to evaluate the approach on additional real-world datasets to demonstrate its broader applicability.
   
2. Complexity of Implementation: The proposed method involves multiple components, including the EC tree, MaxSAT solver, and an oracle for decomposable scores. While the paper provides theoretical guarantees, the practical complexity of implementing and tuning these components may pose challenges for practitioners.
3. Limited Discussion of Limitations: The paper does not explicitly discuss potential limitations of the approach, such as scenarios where the inferred decomposable constraints might not significantly reduce the search space or where the MaxSAT solver may struggle with scalability.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper addresses a challenging and important problem in Bayesian network learning.
- It demonstrates substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods, advancing the field significantly.
- The theoretical contributions and empirical results are both strong and well-supported.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The practical complexity of the approach may limit its adoption.
- The evaluation could be expanded to include more diverse datasets and real-world applications.
Recommendation:
Overall, this paper makes a strong scientific contribution by addressing a critical limitation in Bayesian network learning and providing a highly efficient solution. While there are minor concerns about generality and implementation complexity, these do not detract significantly from the paper's merits. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the discussion of limitations and practical considerations.
