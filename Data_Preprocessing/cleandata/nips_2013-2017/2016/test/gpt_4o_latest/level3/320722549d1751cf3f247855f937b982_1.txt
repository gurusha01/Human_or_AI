The paper presents a novel framework for parameter-free algorithms by interpreting them as coin-betting strategies aimed at maximizing rewards. This interpretation unifies and extends existing methods for Online Linear Optimization (OLO) over Hilbert spaces and Learning with Expert Advice (LEA), offering both theoretical and practical advancements. The authors introduce a betting algorithm based on the Krichevsky-Trofimov (KT) estimator and coin-betting potential functions, which are then generalized to broader settings. The proposed algorithms are validated through experiments on real-world datasets, demonstrating their efficacy and simplicity.
Strengths:
1. Quality: The paper is technically sound, with rigorous theoretical analysis and empirical validation. The authors provide clear regret bounds for their algorithms, which match or improve upon existing results. The use of the KT estimator and coin-betting potentials is well-justified, and the connection to parameter-free algorithms is both elegant and insightful.
2. Clarity: The paper is well-organized and written in a manner that is accessible to readers familiar with online learning. The reductions from coin betting to OLO and LEA are explained step-by-step, and the algorithms are presented in a clear and concise manner. Suggestions for improvement could include a more detailed discussion of the experimental setup and results.
3. Originality: The coin-betting interpretation is a novel and intuitive approach to parameter-free algorithms, providing a unifying perspective on existing methods. The framework also enables the design of new algorithms, such as the KT-based algorithms for OLO and LEA, which achieve optimal regret bounds with minimal computational overhead.
4. Significance: The results are significant for the field of online learning, as they address the challenge of parameter tuning in adversarial settings. The proposed algorithms are not only theoretically optimal but also practical, as evidenced by their strong empirical performance. The simplicity of the algorithms makes them appealing for real-world applications, and the framework has the potential to inspire further research in this area.
Weaknesses:
1. While the theoretical contributions are substantial, the experimental evaluation could be expanded to include more diverse datasets and comparisons with additional baselines.
2. The requirement of knowing the number of rounds \(T\) in advance for certain algorithms, though mitigated by the doubling trick, could be a limitation in some applications.
3. The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of related work, particularly in contrasting the proposed framework with other parameter-free approaches.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper introduces a novel and intuitive framework that unifies and extends existing methods for parameter-free online learning.

Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The experimental evaluation could be more comprehensive, and the discussion of related work could be expanded.
- The reliance on knowing \(T\) in advance for some algorithms may limit their applicability in certain scenarios.
Conclusion:
Overall, this paper makes a strong contribution to the field of online learning by providing a novel framework for parameter-free algorithms and demonstrating its effectiveness through both theory and experiments. The strengths of the paper outweigh its minor weaknesses, and I recommend its acceptance.
