The paper introduces a novel visual attentional method that leverages a Region Ranking SVM (RRSVM) classifier to recognize image categories using a sparse set of regions. This approach is biologically inspired, incorporating the Inhibition of Return (IOR) mechanism to promote diversity in selected regions, which is particularly beneficial for multi-object detection tasks. The use of deep neural networks (VGG16) for feature extraction ensures robust representation learning, and the proposed Sparse Diverse Regions (SDR) classifier achieves competitive results in both single-object and multi-object visual search tasks. The paper bridges computer vision and behavioral science by demonstrating that its computational mechanisms align with human visual attention processes.
Strengths:
1. Novelty: The integration of IOR into the RRSVM framework is innovative, as it enforces diversity in region selection, mimicking human visual attention. This is a meaningful contribution to both computer vision and cognitive science.
2. Performance: The SDR classifier achieves state-of-the-art results in predicting human gaze fixations and performs well in visual search tasks across multiple datasets. Its ability to predict human attention without using object location annotations is particularly impressive.
3. Biological Plausibility: By incorporating IOR, the model provides a biologically inspired perspective on visual attention, which could inspire further interdisciplinary research.
4. Comprehensive Evaluation: The paper evaluates the method across diverse datasets and conditions (single-target, target-absent, and multiple-target), demonstrating its robustness and generalizability.
Weaknesses:
1. Inconsistent Feature Extractors: The experiments (e.g., Table 1) use inconsistent feature extractors across methods, making it difficult to isolate the contribution of RRSVM. A fair comparison requires all methods to use the same feature extractor.
2. Sensitivity Analysis: While the IOR mechanism is central to the model, the paper lacks a detailed sensitivity analysis of IOR-related parameters. The suppression area significantly impacts multi-object prediction accuracy, and failure cases (e.g., Figure 3) highlight the need for further exploration.
3. Center Bias: The POET dataset exhibits a strong center bias, which may inflate performance metrics. While the authors address this concern, additional experiments on less biased datasets would strengthen the claims.
4. Clarity: The paper is dense and could benefit from clearer organization, particularly in the experimental section. For instance, separating the analysis of single-target and multi-target conditions more distinctly would improve readability.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:
- Pro: The paper introduces a novel, biologically inspired mechanism that advances the state of the art in visual attention modeling and multi-object detection. Its interdisciplinary approach and strong empirical results make it a valuable contribution.
- Con: The lack of consistent feature extractors and sensitivity analysis weakens the interpretability of the results. Additionally, the reliance on center-biased datasets raises questions about the generalizability of the findings.
Recommendation: Accept with minor revisions. The paper is a strong contribution to the field, but addressing the issues of feature extractor consistency and IOR parameter sensitivity would significantly enhance its impact.
