This paper addresses the challenging problem of estimating class priors in positive-unlabeled (PU) learning settings, particularly under the presence of noise in positive labels, a factor often overlooked in prior work. The authors propose a novel approach that transforms high-dimensional data into a single dimension using a non-traditional classifier, followed by density estimation. This transformation circumvents the curse of dimensionality, which is a significant limitation in existing methods. The theoretical contributions, particularly Theorems 1 and 2, provide valuable insights into the preservation of class priors during the univariate transformation, which is a key strength of the paper.
The manuscript is well-written, with clear explanations and practical summaries of complex proofs, making it accessible to a broad audience. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on benchmark datasets, showcasing its robustness and practicality. However, the use of regression datasets in the benchmarks is questionable, as classification problems would be more appropriate for evaluating the proposed method. Replacing these datasets could strengthen the empirical validation.
While the paper claims to be the first to address noisy PU data, this assertion is disputable, as prior work exists in this area. The authors should provide a more comprehensive discussion of related work to clarify how their approach differs and advances the state of the art. Additionally, the practical implementation details of the non-traditional classifier, such as handling poor performance, transformation methods, and hyperparameter optimization, are insufficiently discussed. Addressing these gaps would enhance the reproducibility and applicability of the method.
In terms of originality, the paper introduces a novel combination of techniques—explicit noise modeling and univariate transformations—that is both theoretically grounded and practically relevant. However, the lack of a thorough comparison with prior noisy PU learning methods slightly diminishes its novelty. The significance of the work lies in its potential to improve PU learning in real-world, high-dimensional, noisy settings, making it a valuable contribution to the field.
Pros:  
- Novel approach to addressing noise in PU learning.  
- Avoids the curse of dimensionality through univariate transformations.  
- Well-written with clear theoretical insights and proofs.  
- Promising benchmark results demonstrating practical effectiveness.  
Cons:  
- Overstated claim of being the first to address noisy PU learning.  
- Insufficient practical details for implementation.  
- Use of regression datasets in benchmarks is unnecessary.  
Overall, this paper is a strong contribution to the field, but it would benefit from clarifications on prior work, practical implementation details, and improved experimental design.
