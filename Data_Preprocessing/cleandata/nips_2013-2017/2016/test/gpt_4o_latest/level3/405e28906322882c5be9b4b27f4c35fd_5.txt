The paper investigates dynamic regret in nonstationary stochastic environments for multi-armed bandit and experts problems, introducing a novel parameter \(\Lambda\) to complement existing measures \(\Gamma\), \(V\), and \(T\). This addition allows for a more nuanced analysis of problem complexity, bridging gaps between adversarial and stochastic settings. The authors derive regret bounds that reveal intriguing contrasts between bandit and full-information settings, particularly highlighting how \(\Lambda\) influences achievable regret. Notably, the paper demonstrates that constant regret is achievable in full-information settings under specific conditions, while bandit settings retain a dependency on \(T\).
Strengths
1. Novel Contribution: The introduction of \(\Lambda\) provides a fresh perspective on nonstationarity, enabling a deeper understanding of dynamic regret. This extends prior work that only considered \(\Gamma\) or \(V\) alongside \(T\), making the results more comprehensive.
2. Theoretical Rigor: The paper provides both upper and lower bounds for regret, ensuring the results are tight or nearly tight. The inclusion of matching lower bounds strengthens the theoretical contribution.
3. Clarity and Organization: The paper is well-written and logically structured, making complex ideas accessible. The inclusion of Table 1 in Appendix A is particularly helpful for summarizing results.
4. Impact on Literature: The results offer valuable insights into the interplay of \(\Lambda\), \(\Gamma\), \(V\), and \(T\), which could inspire further research on parameter-dependent algorithms and practical applications.
Weaknesses
1. Practical Limitations: Many proposed algorithms require prior knowledge of parameters like \(\Gamma\), \(V\), and \(\Lambda\), which is often unrealistic in real-world scenarios. While a parameter-free algorithm is proposed, its regret bounds are slightly weaker, limiting practical applicability.
2. Redundancy in Theorem 4.1: The argument in Lines 318–320 appears redundant, as the implication \(\sqrt{VT} \leq \sqrt[3]{\Lambda VT}\) is direct. This could be streamlined for conciseness.
3. Notational Inconsistencies: Minor inconsistencies (e.g., Lines 205, 304–309) detract from the paper's polish and should be addressed.
4. Highlighting Parameter Dependency: While Table 1 is useful, it could be improved by explicitly marking bounds that require additional parameter knowledge, aiding readers in distinguishing practical versus theoretical results.
Open Questions
The paper raises an intriguing question about whether \(\Lambda\) and other parameters could improve classical regret results against the best fixed arm. Addressing this could further unify the stochastic and adversarial frameworks.
Recommendation
This paper makes a significant theoretical contribution to the study of dynamic regret in nonstationary environments. While practical limitations exist, the novelty and rigor of the results outweigh these concerns. I recommend acceptance, with minor revisions to address clarity issues and improve the presentation of practical implications.
