The paper addresses the problem of optimal Bayesian network structure learning under non-decomposable ancestral constraints by projecting these constraints into decomposable edge and topological ordering constraints. This novel approach leverages the EC tree search space and an oracle for decomposable scores, significantly improving the efficiency of structure learning. The authors demonstrate that their method outperforms existing approaches, such as those based on integer linear programming (ILP), by orders of magnitude in computational efficiency.
Strengths:
1. Novelty: The paper introduces a unique method for handling non-decomposable ancestral constraints by projecting them into decomposable constraints, which is a significant contribution to the field. This approach bridges the gap between non-decomposable constraints and existing decomposable score-based methods.
2. Clarity: The paper is well-written and provides clear explanations of both theoretical concepts and experimental results. Section 5, which details the projection of constraints, is particularly well-articulated and central to the paper's contribution.
3. Empirical Validation: The experimental results convincingly demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach, particularly when compared to ILP-based methods. The use of diverse Bayesian network benchmarks and varying problem settings (e.g., dataset size, number of variables, proportion of constraints) adds robustness to the evaluation.
4. Significance: The work addresses a critical challenge in Bayesian network learning and has the potential to influence future research in structure learning with background knowledge.
Weaknesses:
1. Generalizability: A key concern is the limited scope of performance improvements demonstrated in Table 3, which primarily focuses on EC trees. The lack of significant results for other methods, such as ILP, raises questions about the broader applicability of the approach.
2. Sensitivity to Constraints: The easy-hard-easy pattern observed in Table 2 suggests that the method's performance is highly sensitive to the number of ancestral constraints. This sensitivity could limit its practical utility, as the optimal number of constraints may not be known a priori.
3. Comparative Analysis: Table 2 lacks a direct comparison of EC tree results with the ILP approach, which would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the relative strengths and weaknesses of the proposed method.
4. Focus on EC Trees: The inclusion of Section 4.1 on BN graphs seems unnecessary and detracts from the focus on EC trees and the A* algorithm, which are more relevant to the experimental context.
Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Provide a direct comparison of EC tree results with ILP in Table 2 to better contextualize the performance improvements.
2. Drop Section 4.1 on BN graphs and expand the discussion of EC trees and the A* algorithm in the experimental setup.
3. Discuss strategies for tuning the number of ancestral constraints to mitigate the sensitivity observed in Table 2.
4. Explore the generalizability of the approach to other structure learning frameworks beyond EC trees.
Recommendation:
While the paper presents a novel and efficient approach to structure learning under ancestral constraints, the concerns about generalizability and sensitivity should be addressed to strengthen its impact. I recommend acceptance, provided the authors address the aforementioned weaknesses and suggestions.
