The paper presents a novel framework for parameter-free algorithms in online convex optimization (OCO) and learning with expert advice (LEA), leveraging reductions to a coin betting problem. This approach is both innovative and impactful, as it unifies and generalizes prior work while introducing new algorithms with optimal regret guarantees and simplicity in implementation.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Generalization: The reduction to coin betting is a fresh perspective that provides a unified framework for parameter-free algorithms in OLO and LEA. By using the Krichevsky-Trofimov (KT) estimator, the authors achieve parameter-free algorithms that match or improve upon existing results in terms of regret bounds and computational efficiency.
2. Technical Soundness: The paper is technically rigorous, with clear derivations and proofs. The regret bounds for both OLO in Hilbert spaces and LEA are optimal and well-supported by theoretical analysis.
3. Clarity and Simplicity: The proposed algorithms are elegant and simple, especially compared to prior work. The use of coin betting potentials provides an intuitive way to design and analyze parameter-free algorithms.
4. Significance: The work addresses a fundamental problem in online learning and has the potential to influence future research in parameter-free optimization. The empirical results further validate the practical relevance of the proposed methods.
Weaknesses:
1. Intuition of Reduction: While the reduction to coin betting is mathematically sound, its intuition, particularly for LEA, is not immediately clear. The authors could elaborate further on the conceptual connection between coin betting and online learning.
2. Parameter-Free Assumption: The algorithms assume that gains or losses are bounded by 1. It is unclear how the framework handles scenarios where the bounds are unknown or different. This raises questions about the universality of the "parameter-free" claim.
3. Losses vs. Gains Transformation: The transformation from losses to gains is not discussed in detail. Its implications for both OLO and LEA could be explored further to clarify its impact on the algorithms' performance.
4. Minor Issues: The manuscript contains minor issues, such as typos, unclear equivalences in Lemma 1, and edge cases in certain results. These should be addressed for better clarity and completeness.
Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Provide a more detailed discussion of the intuition behind the coin betting reduction, particularly for LEA.
2. Address the handling of unknown bounds on gains or losses and clarify whether the parameter-free property holds universally.
3. Discuss the transformation from losses to gains and its implications in greater depth.
4. Fix minor issues, including typos, unclear equivalences, and edge cases, and provide earlier examples of potentials to aid understanding.
Recommendation:
This paper makes a significant contribution to the field of online learning and optimization. Its novel framework, technical rigor, and practical relevance make it a strong candidate for acceptance. However, addressing the above weaknesses and suggestions would further strengthen the paper. I recommend acceptance, contingent on minor revisions to improve clarity and address open questions.
