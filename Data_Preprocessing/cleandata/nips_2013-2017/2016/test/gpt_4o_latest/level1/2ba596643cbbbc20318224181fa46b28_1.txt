This paper introduces the Multi-Fidelity Upper Confidence Bound (MF-UCB) algorithm, a novel approach to the stochastic K-armed bandit problem where each arm has multiple fidelity levels, each providing increasingly accurate but costly approximations of the highest fidelity outcome. The authors formalize the multi-fidelity bandit setting, propose a cost-weighted notion of regret, and demonstrate that MF-UCB leverages lower fidelities to eliminate suboptimal arms efficiently, reserving higher fidelity evaluations for promising candidates. The paper provides theoretical guarantees, including regret bounds and near-optimality under certain conditions, and supports these findings with simulations.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Originality: The multi-fidelity bandit framework is a fresh perspective on the classical bandit problem, addressing practical scenarios where cost-efficient approximations are available. This work extends the applicability of bandit algorithms to domains like online advertising, algorithm selection, and robotics.
2. Theoretical Contributions: The paper rigorously derives regret bounds for MF-UCB and compares them to the classical UCB algorithm. The authors also provide a lower bound, demonstrating that MF-UCB is near-optimal in most cases.
3. Practical Relevance: The proposed framework is well-motivated by real-world applications, such as online advertising and clinical trials, where cost considerations are critical.
4. Empirical Validation: The simulations convincingly show that MF-UCB outperforms naive UCB strategies, particularly in scenarios with large numbers of arms and high fidelity costs.
5. Clarity of Algorithm: The MF-UCB algorithm is well-described, with clear intuition behind its design and switching criteria between fidelities.
Weaknesses:
1. Assumptions and Limitations: The paper relies on strong assumptions, such as the decay of fidelity biases (Î¶(m)) and well-behaved distributions satisfying specific concentration inequalities. These assumptions may limit the algorithm's applicability in more complex or noisy settings.
2. Gap in Lower Bound Matching: While MF-UCB achieves the lower bound for most arms, it falls short for certain arms (K(m)7) due to its conservative switching criteria. The authors acknowledge this gap but leave its resolution as an open problem.
3. Limited Real-World Experiments: Although the simulations are insightful, the paper lacks experiments on real-world datasets, which would strengthen its practical impact.
4. Regret Definition: The chosen definition of regret, which focuses on the highest fidelity rewards, may not align with all practical applications. For instance, in scenarios like clinical trials, lower fidelity outcomes might have different implications, as noted by the authors in the conclusion.
Arguments for Acceptance:
- The paper introduces a novel and practically relevant framework, extending the classical bandit setting in a meaningful way.
- The theoretical contributions are significant, with rigorous analysis of regret bounds and near-optimality.
- The empirical results support the theoretical claims and demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness.
Arguments Against Acceptance:
- The reliance on strong assumptions and the unresolved gap in the lower bound matching could limit the algorithm's robustness and generality.
- The lack of real-world experiments leaves questions about the algorithm's practical performance.
Recommendation:
Overall, this paper makes a strong contribution to the field of bandit algorithms and is well-suited for NIPS. While certain limitations exist, they are clearly acknowledged, and the work opens up new avenues for research. I recommend acceptance, with minor revisions to address the potential for broader applicability and real-world validation.
