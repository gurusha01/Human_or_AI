The paper presents a novel extension to the Region Ranking SVM (RRSVM) model by incorporating the biologically plausible mechanism of Inhibition of Return (IoR), resulting in a Sparse Diverse Regions (SDR) classifier. The authors claim two main contributions: (1) demonstrating that RRSVM and SDR achieve state-of-the-art performance in predicting human gaze fixations during visual search tasks, despite being trained solely on image-level labels without object localization data, and (2) showing that incorporating IoR improves fixation prediction accuracy without compromising classification performance. The work bridges behavioral and computer vision research, offering a computational perspective on visual attention mechanisms.
Strengths:
1. Novelty and Significance: The paper introduces a biologically inspired mechanism (IoR) into the RRSVM framework, enhancing its ability to predict human attention. This is a significant contribution to both computer vision and cognitive science, as it provides a computational model that aligns with human visual processing.
2. Experimental Rigor: The authors evaluate their model on three datasets (POET, PET, MIT900) under diverse conditions (single-target, target-absent, and multi-target), demonstrating consistent improvements in fixation prediction (e.g., AUC scores improving from 0.81 to 0.85 with SDR).
3. Practical Relevance: The model achieves competitive results without requiring object localization annotations, which are expensive and labor-intensive to obtain. This makes the approach scalable and practical for real-world applications.
4. Clarity of Results: The paper provides thorough comparisons with strong baselines, such as RCNN and CAM, and even methods with access to bounding box annotations (e.g., AnnoBoxes). SDR outperforms these baselines, showcasing its robustness.
5. Acknowledgment of Limitations: The authors discuss failure cases (e.g., distractions like text or faces) and the impact of center bias, providing a balanced evaluation of their approach.
Weaknesses:
1. Limited Novelty in Core Model: While the incorporation of IoR is innovative, the underlying RRSVM model is not new, and the paper relies heavily on prior work [29]. The novelty primarily lies in the extension rather than the core methodology.
2. Center Bias Concerns: Although the authors address center bias, the reliance on datasets like POET, which exhibit strong center bias, raises questions about the generalizability of the results to less-biased datasets.
3. Limited Integration of Other Attention Mechanisms: While IoR is incorporated, the model does not account for other known factors influencing human attention, such as bottom-up saliency or scene context, which could further enhance its predictive power.
4. Reproducibility: While the paper provides implementation details, some critical parameters (e.g., Gaussian blur kernel width) are tuned on validation sets without explicit guidelines, potentially hindering reproducibility.
Pro and Con Arguments for Acceptance:
Pros:
- Strong empirical results demonstrating state-of-the-art performance.
- Biologically inspired approach that bridges cognitive science and computer vision.
- Practical advantages due to the lack of reliance on object localization annotations.
Cons:
- Limited novelty in the core model.
- Potential overfitting to center-biased datasets.
- Lack of integration of additional attention mechanisms.
Recommendation:
I recommend acceptance of this paper, as it presents a meaningful contribution to the field by introducing a biologically inspired mechanism that improves fixation prediction and offers insights into human visual attention. However, the authors should address the concerns regarding center bias and explore the integration of other attention-related factors in future work.
