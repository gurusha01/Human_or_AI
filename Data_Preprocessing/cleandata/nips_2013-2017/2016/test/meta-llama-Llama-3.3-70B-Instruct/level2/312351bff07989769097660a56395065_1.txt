This paper introduces the Neural Transducer, a novel sequence-to-sequence model that can produce output sequences incrementally as input data arrives. The model is designed to address the limitation of traditional sequence-to-sequence models, which require the entire input sequence to be available before generating output. The Neural Transducer achieves this by conditioning the output sequence on the partially observed input sequence and the partially generated sequence.
The paper presents a clear and well-structured introduction to the problem, related work, and the proposed model. The authors provide a detailed description of the model architecture, including the encoder, transducer, and attention mechanisms. The paper also presents experimental results on a toy task and the TIMIT phoneme recognition task, demonstrating the effectiveness of the Neural Transducer.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The introduction of a novel model that addresses a significant limitation of traditional sequence-to-sequence models
* A clear and well-structured presentation of the model architecture and experimental results
* Demonstrated effectiveness of the model on a toy task and a real-world speech recognition task
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The model requires careful tuning of hyperparameters, such as the block size and number of layers, to achieve good results
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the model's performance on longer sequences and its ability to generalize to new tasks
* The comparison to previous sequence-to-sequence models could be more comprehensive, including a discussion of the trade-offs between different models
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of sequence-to-sequence modeling and has the potential to be useful for a range of applications, including speech recognition and online translation systems.
