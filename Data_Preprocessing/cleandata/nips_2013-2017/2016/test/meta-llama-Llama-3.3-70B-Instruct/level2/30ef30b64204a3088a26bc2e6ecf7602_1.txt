This paper proposes a novel unsupervised loss function that takes advantage of the stochastic nature of techniques such as randomized data augmentation, dropout, and random max-pooling in convolutional neural networks (ConvNets). The loss function minimizes the difference between the predictions of multiple passes of a training sample through the network, which leads to better generalization and stability in testing time. The authors evaluate the proposed method on several benchmark datasets, including MNIST, SVHN, NORB, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet, using two different ConvNet implementations: cuda-convnet and sparse convolutional networks.
The main claims of the paper are that the proposed unsupervised loss function can improve the accuracy of ConvNets when there is a limited set of labeled data available, and that it can be combined with any supervised loss function to achieve state-of-the-art results on various benchmark datasets. The authors support these claims with extensive experimental results, demonstrating that the proposed loss function can significantly improve the accuracy of ConvNets on multiple datasets, especially when the number of labeled samples is small.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the proposed method and its experimental evaluation.
