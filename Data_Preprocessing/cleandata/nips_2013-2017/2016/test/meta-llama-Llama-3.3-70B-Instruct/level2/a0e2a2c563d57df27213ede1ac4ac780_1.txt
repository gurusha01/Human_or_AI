This paper proposes a novel approach to predicting human visual attention in visual search tasks by incorporating biologically plausible mechanisms into a classification model. The main claim of the paper is that the learned region sparsity and diversity in the proposed model, called Sparse Diverse Regions (SDR) classifier, can predict human attention in visual search tasks. The authors support this claim by conducting experiments on three different datasets and demonstrating that SDR outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in predicting human fixations.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise overview of the proposed approach and its relation to previous work. The experiments are thoroughly described, and the results are presented in a clear and easy-to-understand manner. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the results, including a discussion of the limitations of the proposed approach and potential avenues for future work.
The strengths of the paper include the novelty of the proposed approach, the thoroughness of the experiments, and the clarity of the writing. The authors also provide a detailed discussion of the limitations of the proposed approach, including the potential impact of center bias on the results.
The weaknesses of the paper include the lack of a clear explanation of how the proposed approach can be used in practice, and the limited scope of the experiments. The authors only evaluate the proposed approach on three datasets, and it is unclear how well the approach will generalize to other datasets and tasks.
Overall, I believe that this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of computer vision and visual attention. The proposed approach is novel and well-motivated, and the experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in predicting human fixations. I would recommend accepting this paper for publication, with some minor revisions to address the limitations and weaknesses mentioned above.
Arguments pro acceptance:
