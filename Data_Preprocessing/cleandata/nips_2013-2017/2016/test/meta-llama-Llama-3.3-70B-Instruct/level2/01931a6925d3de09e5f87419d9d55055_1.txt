This paper introduces a novel probability distribution, the Locally Adaptive Normal Distribution (LAND), which generalizes the normal distribution to a Riemannian manifold setting. The authors propose a maximum likelihood estimation scheme for the LAND, combining gradient-based optimization with Monte Carlo integration. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the LAND in modeling complex data distributions, including synthetic and real-world data, such as EEG measurements of human sleep stages.
The main claims of the paper are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors provide a clear and concise introduction to Riemannian geometry and its application to manifold learning, making the paper accessible to a broad audience. The proposed LAND model is shown to outperform traditional Gaussian mixture models in capturing non-linear structures in the data.
