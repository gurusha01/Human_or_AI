This paper proposes a novel framework for studying exploration-exploitation trade-offs in the stochastic K-armed bandit setting, where cheaper approximations to the desired experiment are available. The authors introduce the concept of multi-fidelity bandits, where each arm has multiple fidelities, each providing a biased estimate of the highest fidelity. They develop a new algorithm, MF-UCB, which adapts the classical Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) strategy to this multi-fidelity setting.
The paper's main claims are: (1) MF-UCB achieves better regret than naive UCB strategies that ignore the multi-fidelity information, and (2) MF-UCB is nearly optimal under certain conditions. The authors support these claims with theoretical analysis, providing an upper bound on the regret of MF-UCB and a lower bound on the regret of any strategy in this setting.
The paper's strengths include:
* A clear and well-motivated problem formulation, with a thorough discussion of the related work and the novelty of the approach.
* A well-designed algorithm, MF-UCB, which intuitively uses the lower fidelities to eliminate suboptimal arms and reserves the higher fidelity plays for arms with high expected reward.
* A thorough theoretical analysis, including an upper bound on the regret of MF-UCB and a lower bound on the regret of any strategy in this setting.
The paper's weaknesses include:
* The assumption that the lower fidelities provide biased estimates of the highest fidelity, which may not always be the case in practice.
* The lack of experimental evaluation on real-world problems, which would help to demonstrate the practical effectiveness of the approach.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper presents a novel and well-motivated problem formulation, with a clear and thorough discussion of the related work.
* The proposed algorithm, MF-UCB, is well-designed and intuitively appealing, with a thorough theoretical analysis that supports its effectiveness.
* The paper provides a lower bound on the regret of any strategy in this setting, which helps to establish the near-optimality of MF-UCB.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The assumption that the lower fidelities provide biased estimates of the highest fidelity may not always be realistic, which could limit the applicability of the approach.
* The lack of experimental evaluation on real-world problems may make it difficult to assess the practical effectiveness of the approach.
Overall, I recommend accepting this paper, as it presents a novel and well-motivated problem formulation, a well-designed algorithm, and a thorough theoretical analysis. However, I suggest that the authors consider addressing the limitations of the approach, such as the assumption about the lower fidelities and the lack of experimental evaluation, in future work.
