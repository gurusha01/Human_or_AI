This paper proposes a novel approach to learning Bayesian networks optimally, subject to background knowledge in the form of ancestral constraints. The authors leverage a recently proposed framework for optimal structure learning based on non-decomposable scores, which can accommodate ancestral constraints. They show how to empower an oracle for learning structures using decomposable scores by passing it decomposable constraints inferred from ancestral constraints.
The paper's main claims are: (1) the proposed approach can efficiently learn Bayesian networks with ancestral constraints, and (2) it outperforms existing approaches based on integer linear programming (ILP). The authors support these claims through empirical evaluations on standard Bayesian network benchmarks, demonstrating that their approach is orders-of-magnitude faster than ILP-based systems.
The paper's strengths include:
* A clear and well-motivated problem statement, highlighting the importance of ancestral constraints in practice
* A sound and complete method for pruning the EC tree based on ancestral constraints
* An efficient algorithm for inferring decomposable edge and ordering constraints from ancestral constraints
* Empirical evaluations demonstrating the approach's efficiency and scalability
However, there are some limitations and potential areas for improvement:
* The paper assumes that the ancestral constraints are provided as input, without discussing how to obtain them in practice
* The empirical evaluations are limited to a specific set of benchmarks and may not generalize to other domains
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with other existing approaches, such as constraint programming (CP)
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of Bayesian network structure learning, and its approach has the potential to be useful in practice. The authors demonstrate a good understanding of the problem and the relevant literature, and their empirical evaluations provide strong evidence for the approach's effectiveness.
