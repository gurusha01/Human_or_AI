This paper presents a novel approach to designing optimization algorithms by casting the design process as a learning problem. The authors propose using a recurrent neural network (RNN) to learn an update rule that can be used to optimize a given objective function. The learned optimizer is shown to outperform state-of-the-art optimization methods on a variety of tasks, including simple convex problems, training neural networks, and styling images with neural art.
The paper's main claim is that the design of an optimization algorithm can be cast as a learning problem, allowing the algorithm to learn to exploit structure in the problems of interest in an automatic way. The authors support this claim through a series of experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness of their learned optimizer on different tasks.
