This paper presents a novel approach to energy disaggregation, a crucial task in home appliance monitoring, by developing a scalable and computationally efficient method based on factorial Hidden Markov Models (FHMMs). The authors propose a semidefinite relaxation combined with randomized rounding to solve the inference problem in FHMMs, which significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, related work, and their approach. The technical sections are detailed and easy to follow, with a good balance between mathematical derivations and intuitive explanations. The experimental results are thorough and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on both synthetic and real-world datasets.
The strengths of the paper include:
1. Novel approach: The authors propose a new and innovative approach to energy disaggregation, which combines semidefinite relaxation and randomized rounding to solve the inference problem in FHMMs.
2. Scalability: The proposed method is designed to be scalable and can handle large-scale problems, making it suitable for real-world applications.
3. Experimental results: The authors provide extensive experimental results, including comparisons with state-of-the-art algorithms, which demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
1. Computational complexity: While the proposed method is designed to be scalable, the computational complexity of the ADMM algorithm may still be a concern for very large-scale problems.
