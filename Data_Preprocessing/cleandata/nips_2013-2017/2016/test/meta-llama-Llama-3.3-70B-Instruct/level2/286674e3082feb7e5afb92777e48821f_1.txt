This paper proposes a framework for clustering graphs without assuming that the data comes from a specific model, such as the Stochastic Block Model (SBM) or its extensions. The authors provide "correctness" guarantees that depend on the statistics of the data, which can be checked. The framework ties in with the existing model-based framework, and the authors show that they can exploit results in model-based recovery to strengthen the results in that area of research.
The main claims of the paper are: (1) a generic theorem that provides a blueprint for obtaining model-free guarantees for clustering, and (2) instantiations of this theorem for the SBM and Preference Frame Model (PFM) models. The authors also provide experimental evaluations of their framework on several datasets, including simulated and real-world networks.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem and their approach. The technical sections are also well-organized, and the authors provide detailed proofs of their results. The experiments are thorough and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.
The strengths of the paper include: (1) the proposal of a novel framework for model-free clustering, (2) the provision of theoretical guarantees for the correctness of the clustering results, and (3) the demonstration of the effectiveness of the framework on several datasets.
The weaknesses of the paper include: (1) the assumption that the data can be represented as a graph, which may not always be the case, and (2) the reliance on spectral clustering algorithms, which may not always be the best choice for clustering.
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of network science and clustering, and the results have the potential to be widely applicable. The authors demonstrate a good understanding of the relevant literature and provide a clear and concise presentation of their results.
