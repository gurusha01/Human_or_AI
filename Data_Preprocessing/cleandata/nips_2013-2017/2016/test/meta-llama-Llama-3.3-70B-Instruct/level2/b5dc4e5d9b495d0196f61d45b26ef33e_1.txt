This paper proposes a novel homotopy smoothing (HOPS) algorithm for solving a family of non-smooth optimization problems. The main claim of the paper is that HOPS achieves a lower iteration complexity of Õ(1/1−θ) with θ ∈ (0, 1] for obtaining an ε-optimal solution under a mild local error bound condition.
The support for this claim comes from a combination of theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors provide a detailed analysis of the HOPS algorithm, including its convergence properties and iteration complexity. They also compare the performance of HOPS with other state-of-the-art algorithms, such as Nesterov's smoothing algorithm and the primal-dual method, on several benchmark problems.
The paper is well-written and clearly organized, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments and understand the contributions of the paper. The authors also provide a thorough review of related work, which helps to contextualize their contributions and demonstrate the significance of their results.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to balance theoretical rigor with practical relevance. The authors provide a detailed theoretical analysis of the HOPS algorithm, but they also demonstrate its effectiveness on real-world problems through extensive experiments. This makes the paper appealing to both theoretical and practical researchers in the field.
In terms of usefulness, the HOPS algorithm has the potential to be widely applicable in many areas of machine learning and optimization. The algorithm is designed to handle non-smooth optimization problems, which are common in many applications, such as sparse learning and robust optimization. The authors also demonstrate the effectiveness of HOPS on several benchmark problems, which suggests that it could be a valuable tool for practitioners.
The paper reflects a good understanding of the field and the relevant literature. The authors provide a thorough review of related work and demonstrate a clear understanding of the key concepts and techniques in the field. They also make connections to other areas of research, such as the Kurdyka-Łojasiewicz property, which helps to broaden the scope of the paper and demonstrate its relevance to a wider audience.
The novelty of the paper lies in its ability to improve upon existing algorithms for non-smooth optimization problems. The authors demonstrate that HOPS achieves a lower iteration complexity than other state-of-the-art algorithms, which makes it a significant contribution to the field. The paper also provides new insights into the properties of non-smooth optimization problems and the behavior of the HOPS algorithm, which could be useful for future research.
In terms of completeness, the paper provides a detailed analysis of the HOPS algorithm and its properties. The authors also provide extensive experimental results, which help to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm in practice. However, some of the proofs and technical details are relegated to the supplement, which may make it difficult for some readers to follow the arguments.
The limitations of the paper are acknowledged by the authors, who note that the HOPS algorithm requires a careful choice of parameters and may not be suitable for all types of non-smooth optimization problems. However, the authors also provide guidance on how to choose the parameters and demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm on several benchmark problems.
Overall, this is a strong paper that makes a significant contribution to the field of optimization. The authors provide a detailed analysis of the HOPS algorithm and demonstrate its effectiveness on several benchmark problems. The paper is well-written and clearly organized, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments and understand the contributions of the paper.
