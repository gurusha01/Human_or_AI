This paper presents a novel technique for running Nesterov's smooth minimization in phases with increasingly better strongly convex regularizers, achieving faster convergence for certain optimization problems. The method builds upon previous work, introducing the topic gently and making it accessible to readers. The authors provide a lemma bounding norm distance to sublevel sets, allowing for warm starts and better convergence under a local error bound condition. This "homotopy" method is a significant contribution to the field of optimization.
The paper's strengths include its clear and well-organized writing style, making it a pleasure to read and understand. The authors provide a thorough introduction to Nesterov's smoothing trick, allowing readers to easily follow the development of the homotopy method. The theoretical analysis is sound, and the claims are well-supported by the provided lemmas and proofs.
However, there are some weaknesses to consider. The reviewer suggests analyzing the iteration bound for optimizing specific problems, such as Hoffman's bound and cone programming, to confirm the claimed linear convergence. Additionally, the paper's claim of achieving linear convergence for LP using a first-order method may not be entirely new, and the authors should carefully analyze problem parameters before making such claims.
Arguments pro acceptance include the paper's originality, as it presents a novel combination of familiar techniques, and its significance, as it addresses a difficult problem in a better way than previous research. The paper is also well-written and clearly organized, making it easy to follow and understand.
Arguments con acceptance include the need for further analysis of the iteration bound and the potential lack of novelty in the claim of achieving linear convergence for LP. However, overall, the paper is a significant contribution to the field of optimization, and with some revisions to address the mentioned weaknesses, it has the potential to be a strong addition to the conference program.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, as it is technically sound and well-supported by theoretical analysis. The paper is also clear and well-organized, making it easy to follow and understand. The originality and significance of the paper are also notable, as it presents a novel approach to optimization and addresses a difficult problem in a better way than previous research.
