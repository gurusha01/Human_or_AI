This paper introduces a novel homotopy smoothing (HOPS) algorithm for solving a family of non-smooth optimization problems. The algorithm combines Nesterov's smoothing technique with a homotopy strategy, which starts from a relatively large smoothing parameter and gradually decreases it to achieve a lower iteration complexity. The authors claim that HOPS achieves a lower iteration complexity of Õ(1/1−θ) with θ ∈ (0, 1] under a mild local error bound condition.
The paper is well-structured and provides a clear overview of the proposed algorithm and its theoretical guarantees. The authors also provide experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness of HOPS compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms. However, there are some areas that need improvement.
One of the main concerns is the lack of theoretical justification for the connection between sparsity and attention. The authors claim that HOPS can be used to investigate the relationship between sparsity and attention, but they do not provide any mathematical or experimental evidence to support this claim. Additionally, the addition of the inhibition of return mechanism seems ad-hoc and requires more substantial evidence to demonstrate its effectiveness.
The paper also lacks clarity in some sections, particularly in the description of the algorithm and its parameters. The authors use several variables and parameters without clearly defining them, which can make it difficult for readers to understand the algorithm and its implementation.
The experimental results are promising, but they are limited to a few datasets and problems. The authors should consider providing more extensive experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness of HOPS on a wider range of problems and datasets.
In terms of originality, the paper proposes a new algorithm that combines existing techniques in a novel way. However, the idea of using a homotopy strategy to improve the convergence of optimization algorithms is not new, and the authors should provide more context and comparison to existing work in this area.
Overall, the paper has some strengths, particularly in its clear structure and experimental results. However, it also has some weaknesses, including the lack of theoretical justification for the connection between sparsity and attention, the ad-hoc addition of the inhibition of return mechanism, and the limited experimental results. With some revisions to address these concerns, the paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of optimization and machine learning.
