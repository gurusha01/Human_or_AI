This paper proposes a novel framework for clustering graphs without assuming that the data comes from a specific model, such as the Stochastic Block Model (SBM) or its extensions. The authors provide a generic theorem that guarantees the correctness of a clustering algorithm without relying on model assumptions. The theorem states that if a clustering fits the data well with respect to a model, then any other clustering that also fits the data well will be close to the original clustering. The authors instantiate this theorem for the SBM and Preference Frame Model (PFM) and provide theoretical guarantees for the results of model-based clustering algorithms.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem and their approach. The technical sections are also well-organized, and the proofs are detailed and easy to follow. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in providing model-free guarantees for clustering.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel framework for clustering graphs without model assumptions, which is a significant contribution to the field.
* The provision of theoretical guarantees for the results of model-based clustering algorithms, which is essential for understanding the performance of these algorithms.
* The instantiation of the generic theorem for the SBM and PFM, which demonstrates the applicability of the framework to different models.
* The experimental evaluation, which shows the effectiveness of the proposed framework in providing model-free guarantees for clustering.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The assumption that the data fits the model well, which may not always be the case in practice.
* The reliance on the eigengap of the Laplacian matrix, which may not be robust to noise or perturbations in the data.
* The lack of comparison with other clustering algorithms or frameworks, which makes it difficult to assess the performance of the proposed framework relative to existing methods.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the authors provide a significant contribution to the field of clustering graphs. The proposed framework has the potential to be widely applicable and to provide valuable insights into the performance of clustering algorithms. However, further research is needed to address the limitations of the framework and to compare its performance with other existing methods.
