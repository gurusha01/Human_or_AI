This paper introduces a novel homotopy smoothing algorithm, HOPS, for solving non-smooth optimization problems with a lower complexity than O(1/e). The HOPS method dynamically changes the smoothing parameter to achieve speedups in early iterations and better approximations in later iterations. The paper provides the first theoretical guarantee of the complexity of the homotopy smoothing method, explaining the algorithm in sections 3 and 4 with helpful illustrations in Figure 1.
The strengths of the paper include its originality, as it proposes a new algorithm that improves upon existing methods. The paper is also well-written and clearly explains the algorithm and its theoretical guarantees. The experimental results in Section 5 demonstrate the effectiveness of HOPS in comparison with Nesterov's smoothing algorithm and the primal-dual style of first-order methods.
However, there are some weaknesses to the paper. The experimental results lack measures of error such as standard deviation or confidence intervals to support claims of significant differences in algorithm speeds. Additionally, the choice of homotopy smoothing parameter (b) affects the speed of convergence, but this is not experimentally demonstrated in the paper. The computation of the duality gap is also unclear, as it seems to rely on knowing the optimal value, which may not be necessary for evaluating the algorithm's performance.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The paper is also clear and well-organized, making it easy to follow. The originality of the paper is high, as it proposes a new algorithm that improves upon existing methods. The significance of the paper is also high, as it addresses a difficult problem in a better way than previous research and advances the state of the art in a demonstrable way.
Arguments for acceptance include:
* The paper proposes a new algorithm that improves upon existing methods
* The paper provides the first theoretical guarantee of the complexity of the homotopy smoothing method
* The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of HOPS in comparison with other algorithms
Arguments against acceptance include:
