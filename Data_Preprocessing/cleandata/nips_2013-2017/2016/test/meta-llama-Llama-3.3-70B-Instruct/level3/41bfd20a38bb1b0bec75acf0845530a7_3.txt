This paper proposes a novel approach to energy disaggregation, a crucial task in home appliance monitoring, by utilizing a scalable and computationally efficient method based on factorial Hidden Markov Models (FHMMs) and semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation combined with randomized rounding. The authors tackle the challenging problem of estimating the energy consumption of individual appliances over time given the total energy consumption signal of a household. 
The paper is well-structured, starting with a clear introduction to the problem and its significance, followed by a detailed description of the proposed method, including the system model, SDP relaxation, and randomized rounding. The authors also provide an efficient algorithm for inference in FHMMs and a scalable ADMM solver for large-scale, sparse block-structured SDP problems.
The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method, labeled as ADMM-RR, over state-of-the-art algorithms, including the structured variational inference (SVI) method, the method of Kolter and Jaakkola (KJ), and the method of Zhong et al. (ZGS). The results show that ADMM-RR consistently outperforms its competitors in both synthetic and real-world datasets, achieving better precision and recall in estimating which appliances are 'on' at any given time and smaller error in assigning power consumption to different appliances.
The strengths of the paper include its novel approach to energy disaggregation, efficient algorithm for inference in FHMMs, and scalable ADMM solver. The authors also provide a thorough evaluation of their method, including comparisons with state-of-the-art algorithms and detailed results on precision, recall, and error.
However, there are some weaknesses and potential areas for improvement. The paper assumes that the number of appliances and their corresponding HMMs are known, which might not always be the case in real-world scenarios. Additionally, the authors mention that their implementation is purely Matlab-based and takes 5 hours to finish, which might be a limitation for large-scale applications. An optimized C++ version of the method could potentially achieve a significant speed-up.
In terms of originality, the paper combines existing techniques, such as SDP relaxation and randomized rounding, in a novel way to tackle the energy disaggregation problem. While the individual components of the method might not be entirely new, the authors' approach to integrating them and applying them to the specific problem of energy disaggregation is innovative and contributes to the field.
The significance of the paper lies in its potential to improve the accuracy and efficiency of energy disaggregation, which is a crucial task in home appliance monitoring. The proposed method could be useful in various applications, such as load monitoring, energy efficiency, and smart grid management.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and detailed description of their method and results. The proposed approach is novel and efficient, and the experimental results demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art algorithms.
