This paper proposes a novel method for inferring the connectivity map between voxels of a template brain using viral injections that trace neuron anatomy. The authors refine the connectivity inference routine of a previously released dataset from the Allen Institute, proposing a reasonable approach to infer connectivity. The method combines a matrix completion loss for missing data, a smoothing spline penalty to regularize the problem, and optionally, a low rank factorization.
The paper is well-written and clearly organized, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments. The introduction provides a good background on the importance of studying neural connectivity and the challenges of obtaining high-resolution connectivity maps. The authors also provide a clear explanation of their method, including the mathematical formulation and the optimization algorithm used to solve the problem.
The strengths of the paper include the novelty of the approach, the thorough evaluation of the method using synthetic and real data, and the potential impact of the research on the field of neuroscience. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method in improving cross-validated predictions over the current state of the art and unveiling spatial patterning of connectivity.
However, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement. The smoothness constraint may oversimplify complicated neuroanatomy, and the linear model assumes fluorescence grows linearly with injection sites, which could be discussed further for clarity. Additionally, the formation of a template brain from composite data of many brains should be explained in more detail. The paper could also benefit from more precise language, avoiding vague expressions such as "the number of voxels in the brain".
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, originality, and significance. The paper is technically sound, well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results, and provides a complete piece of work. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of the work. The paper is clearly written, well-organized, and adequately informs the reader. The approach is novel, and the paper provides a unique combination of familiar techniques. The related work is adequately referenced, and the paper advances the state of the art in a demonstrable way.
