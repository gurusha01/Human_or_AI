This paper proposes a novel homotopy smoothing (HOPS) algorithm for solving a family of non-smooth optimization problems. The algorithm achieves a lower iteration complexity of Õ(1/ 1−θ) with θ ∈ (0, 1] under a mild local error bound condition. The paper provides a thorough analysis of the algorithm, including its convergence guarantee and iteration complexity.
The paper is well-written and easy to follow. The authors provide a clear introduction to the problem and the proposed algorithm, and the analysis is thorough and well-explained. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, showing that it converges consistently faster than existing algorithms, especially when the optimality gap is small.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to handle non-smooth optimization problems with a broad range of applications, including machine learning, image processing, and cone programming. The authors also provide a detailed comparison with existing algorithms, including Nesterov's smoothing algorithm and the primal-dual method, which helps to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed algorithm.
However, there are a few areas where the paper could be improved. Firstly, the authors could provide more discussion on the choice of the hyper-parameters, such as the smoothing parameter µ and the number of iterations t. While the authors provide some guidance on how to choose these parameters, more experimentation and analysis could be helpful to provide a clearer understanding of how these parameters affect the performance of the algorithm.
Secondly, the authors could provide more comparison with other existing algorithms, such as the restarted subgradient method, which has been shown to have a similar iteration complexity to the proposed algorithm. This would help to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed algorithm.
Finally, the authors could provide more discussion on the potential applications of the proposed algorithm, beyond the examples provided in the paper. This could help to demonstrate the broader impact and potential of the algorithm, and provide more motivation for future research in this area.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets all the requirements, including quality, clarity, originality, and significance. The paper is well-written, easy to follow, and provides a clear and thorough analysis of the proposed algorithm. The experimental results are convincing, and the paper provides a good comparison with existing algorithms. Overall, the paper is a strong contribution to the field of optimization and machine learning, and is suitable for publication at NIPS.
