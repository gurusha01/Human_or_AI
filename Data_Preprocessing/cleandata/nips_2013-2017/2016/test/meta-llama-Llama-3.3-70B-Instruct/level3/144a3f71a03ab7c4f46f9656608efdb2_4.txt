This paper proposes a novel approach to learning Bayesian networks optimally, subject to non-decomposable ancestral constraints. The authors introduce a method to project these constraints onto decomposable edge and topological ordering constraints, which can be used to empower an oracle for searching the EC tree. The paper is well-written, clearly illustrating the work in both theoretical and experimental parts, making it easy to understand the proposed approach.
The novelty of the paper lies in the introduction of a way to project non-decomposable ancestral constraints to edge and topological ordering constraints, which are decomposable. This allows decomposable-score-based structure learning approaches to incorporate domain knowledge and improve learning efficiency. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through empirical evaluations, showing that it is orders-of-magnitude more efficient than alternative frameworks, such as those based on integer linear programming.
However, there are some concerns about the generalization ability of the proposed approach. The projection of ancestral constraints only improves the performance of EC trees, but not the ILP approach. Additionally, the comparison between EC trees and ILP approach is incomplete, as Table 2 only shows the results of the structural Hamming distance from the EC trees, lacking a direct comparison with the ILP approach.
The paper also exhibits an easy-hard-easy pattern as the proportion of ancestral constraints increases, suggesting that the effect of reducing the EC tree search space is sensitive to the amount of incorporated domain knowledge. To improve the paper's clarity and focus, it is suggested to drop section 4.1 and spend more time explaining EC trees and the A* algorithm in the EC tree settings.
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of Bayesian network structure learning, and the proposed approach has the potential to be useful in practice. However, further work is needed to address the concerns about generalization ability and to provide a more comprehensive comparison with other approaches.
