This paper proposes a new framework for studying the dynamic regret of multi-armed bandit and experts problems in non-stationary stochastic environments. The authors introduce a new parameter Λ, which measures the total statistical variance of the loss distributions over time, and investigate its interaction with other parameters such as Γ, which counts the number of times the distributions change, and V, which measures the distance the distributions deviate over time.
The paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the regret landscape in terms of these parameters, and proposes several algorithms with matching upper and lower bounds. The results show that the regret bounds depend on the interplay between Λ, Γ, V, and T, and that the authors' algorithms can achieve significant improvements over existing methods in certain scenarios.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of their methods and results. The technical contributions are significant, and the paper provides a thorough analysis of the problem, including a discussion of the related work and a comparison with existing methods.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The introduction of a new parameter Λ, which provides a new perspective on the problem and allows for a more nuanced analysis of the regret bounds.
* The proposal of several algorithms with matching upper and lower bounds, which demonstrates the authors' understanding of the problem and their ability to design effective solutions.
* The comprehensive analysis of the regret landscape, which provides a detailed understanding of the interplay between the different parameters and their impact on the regret bounds.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The optimization process of the new loss function is not clearly explained, which may raise questions about the implementation and its effect on the network's speed and convergence.
* The accuracy of the new method on the ImageNet ILSVR task is significantly lower than current state-of-the-art methods, which may be a concern for its practical application.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of their methods and results. The technical contributions are significant, and the paper provides a thorough analysis of the problem. However, the optimization process and the accuracy of the method on certain tasks may require further clarification and improvement.
