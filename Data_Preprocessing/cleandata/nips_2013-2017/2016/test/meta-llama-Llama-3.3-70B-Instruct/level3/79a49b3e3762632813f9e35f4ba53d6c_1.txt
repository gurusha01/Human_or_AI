This paper proposes a method for estimating class prior given labeled and noisy positive samples, building upon an existing approach for clean positive samples. The authors develop a classification algorithm that is robust to noise in the positive labels and effective for high-dimensional data. The paper's technical analysis of identifiability issues is thorough, and the proposed algorithms show good performance compared to existing methods.
However, I question the novelty of the work, as it closely follows previous research with some natural extensions. The paper's distinction between the scenario considered and the general asymmetric label noise setting is not clearly discussed, and more comparison to other methods for asymmetric label noise, such as those proposed by Sanderson and Scott, and Ramaswamy et al., would be beneficial.
The paper is well-organized, but some minor improvements could be made, such as clarifying notation, reorganizing proofs, and providing more detail on the suggested algorithm. I also found Figure 1 to be unclear in its relationship to the probabilistic model, and more explanation is needed. Additionally, I noticed a potential connection between equation (12) and a result from Ward et al. (2009), which could be explored further.
In terms of the conference guidelines, I evaluate the paper based on the criteria of quality, clarity, originality, and significance. The paper is technically sound, with well-supported claims and a complete piece of work. However, the originality of the work is questionable, and more discussion is needed to distinguish it from previous contributions. The paper is clearly written, but some improvements can be made to enhance clarity. The significance of the results is important, as it addresses a difficult problem in a better way than previous research, but more comparison to other methods is needed to demonstrate its advancement of the state of the art.
