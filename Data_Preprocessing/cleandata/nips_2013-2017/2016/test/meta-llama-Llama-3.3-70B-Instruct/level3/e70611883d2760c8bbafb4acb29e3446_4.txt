This paper presents a comprehensive study on the dynamic regret of multi-armed bandit and experts problem in non-stationary stochastic environments. The authors introduce a new parameter Λ, which measures the total statistical variance of the loss distributions over T rounds of the process, and investigate its impact on the regret. They also examine the interaction between Λ and other parameters, such as Γ, which counts the number of times the distributions change, and V, which measures how far the distributions deviate over time.
The paper provides several key contributions. First, it shows that in the full-information setting, a regret of about √ΓΛ + Γ can be achieved, which is independent of T. In contrast, in the bandit setting, the dependency on T is unavoidable, and a lower bound of the order of √ΓT exists. Second, the paper presents a bandit algorithm that achieves a regret of about 3√ΛV T + √V T, which recovers the V^1/3T^2/3 regret bound of previous work when Λ is at most of the order of T. Third, the authors propose a full-information algorithm that works for both switching and drifting distributions, achieving regret bounds that are close to optimal.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their results. The technical proofs are thorough and well-organized, making it easy to follow the arguments. The paper also provides a comprehensive review of related work, highlighting the differences and similarities between the proposed approach and existing methods.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to provide a unified framework for analyzing the regret of multi-armed bandit and experts problem in non-stationary stochastic environments. The introduction of the new parameter Λ and the investigation of its impact on the regret provide new insights into the problem. The paper also provides a range of algorithms and regret bounds, making it a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the field.
However, there are some areas where the paper could be improved. For example, the authors could provide more discussion on the practical implications of their results and how they can be applied to real-world problems. Additionally, the paper could benefit from more experimental evaluations to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets all the requirements.
