This paper proposes a novel homotopy smoothing (HOPS) algorithm for solving a family of non-smooth optimization problems. The algorithm builds upon Nesterov's smoothing technique and accelerated proximal gradient descent, and achieves an improved iteration complexity of Õ(1/1−θ) under a local error bound condition. The paper also introduces a primal-dual version of the algorithm, which does not require hand-tuning of parameters and achieves improved iteration complexity for small values of epsilon.
The paper is well-written and provides a clear explanation of the algorithm and its theoretical guarantees. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of HOPS and its primal-dual version, showing significant improvements over state-of-the-art algorithms such as Nesterov's smoothing and first-order primal-dual methods.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposed algorithm achieves an improved iteration complexity under a mild local error bound condition, which is a significant contribution to the field of non-smooth optimization.
* The paper provides a clear and detailed explanation of the algorithm and its theoretical guarantees, making it easy to follow and understand.
* The experimental results are thorough and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in various applications.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes that the proximal mapping of the non-smooth function g can be computed efficiently, which may not be the case in all applications.
* The paper does not provide a clear explanation of how to choose the smoothing parameter mu and the number of iterations t, which may require hand-tuning in practice.
* The paper does not compare the proposed algorithm with other state-of-the-art algorithms, such as the restarted subgradient method, which may have similar performance.
Overall, the paper is well-written and provides a significant contribution to the field of non-smooth optimization. The proposed algorithm has the potential to be widely used in various applications, and the experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness.
