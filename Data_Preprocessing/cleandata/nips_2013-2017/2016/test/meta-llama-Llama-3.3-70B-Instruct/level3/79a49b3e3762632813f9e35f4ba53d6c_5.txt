This paper proposes a novel approach to estimate class prior probabilities using positive and unlabeled examples with label noise, achieving better results than competing methods. The algorithm assumes each distribution to be a mixture of two based distributions and jointly learns all parameters, with sufficient and necessary conditions proven for identifiability of class priors. The paper performs well on a wide range of datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method.
The strengths of the paper include its technical soundness, with well-supported claims and a complete piece of work. The authors are careful in evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of their approach. The paper is also well-organized and clearly written, providing enough information for the expert reader to reproduce its results. The proposed method is novel and differs from previous contributions, with related work adequately referenced.
However, there are some weaknesses that need to be addressed. The paper lacks a clear motivation for why estimating class prior probabilities is an important problem to solve, making it difficult to recommend for acceptance. The reviewer is also unsure of the practical impact and real-world applications of the proposed method. Additionally, the condition for identifiability seems extremely strong and unlikely to occur in practice, which raises concerns about the strength of the theorems. The proposed method relies on density estimation, which can be difficult in high dimension, and the experimental datasets are low-dimensional, unlike many real-world applications.
Arguments pro acceptance include the paper's technical soundness, novelty, and effectiveness on a wide range of datasets. Arguments con acceptance include the lack of clear motivation, uncertainty about practical impact, and concerns about the strength of the theorems. After re-reading the paper and authors' feedback, the reviewer raised their score but still has concerns about the potential impact and real-world applications of the algorithm. Overall, the paper is a good scientific contribution to the field, but its significance and potential for real-world applications need to be further demonstrated.
