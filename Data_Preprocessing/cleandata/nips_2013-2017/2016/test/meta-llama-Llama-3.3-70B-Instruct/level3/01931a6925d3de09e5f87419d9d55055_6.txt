This paper presents a novel homotopy smoothing (HOPS) algorithm for solving a family of non-smooth optimization problems. The authors combine Nesterov's smoothing technique with a homotopy strategy to achieve a lower iteration complexity of Õ(1/ 1−θ) under a mild local error bound condition. The paper is well-structured and provides a clear explanation of the algorithm and its theoretical guarantees.
The technical quality of the paper is sound, with well-explained manifold techniques and clever algorithms. The authors provide a comprehensive analysis of the local error bound condition and its relationship to other types of conditions, such as the Kurdyka-Łojasiewicz property. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of HOPS in comparison to other state-of-the-art algorithms.
However, the paper has some clarity issues, particularly with notation. The authors could benefit from further explanation and clarification of certain points, such as the overloading of the Sigma notation and the choice of sigma parameter. Additionally, the evaluation of the method is limited, with questions raised about over-fitting and the choice of sigma parameter. The comparison to other methods is not comprehensive, particularly in high-dimensional data.
The novelty of the paper lies in combining previous work and providing an algorithm for estimating parameters, but the potential impact is unclear due to limitations in the evaluation and comparison to other methods. The paper provides an interesting and useful extension of the normal distribution, adapting to local manifold structure by combining work in metric estimation, computing geodesic distances, and learning distributions.
Overall, the paper is well-written and provides a significant contribution to the field of non-smooth optimization. However, the authors could improve the clarity and comprehensiveness of the paper to make it more accessible to a wider audience.
