This paper proposes a novel homotopy smoothing (HOPS) algorithm for solving a family of non-smooth optimization problems. The algorithm achieves a lower iteration complexity of Õ(1/1−θ) with θ ∈ (0, 1] under a mild local error bound condition. The paper is well-written, and the theory is sound. The experiments on both artificial and real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
The strengths of the paper include its ability to achieve a lower iteration complexity than existing methods, such as Nesterov's smoothing algorithm, and its applicability to a broad family of non-smooth optimization problems. The paper also provides a clear and detailed analysis of the algorithm's convergence properties.
However, the paper lacks novelty compared to existing work, specifically Simo-Serra & al.[19]. The introduction does not clearly highlight the differences between the proposed method and existing work, which is only referenced in the conclusion. The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with existing methods and a clearer explanation of the advantages of the proposed approach.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The paper is also well-organized and clearly written, making it easy to follow.
The originality of the paper is limited by its similarity to existing work. While the proposed algorithm achieves a lower iteration complexity, the underlying ideas and techniques are not significantly new. The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the relationships between the proposed method and existing work.
The significance of the paper lies in its ability to provide a faster and more efficient algorithm for solving non-smooth optimization problems. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, and the theoretical analysis provides a clear understanding of the algorithm's convergence properties.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel algorithm with a lower iteration complexity than existing methods.
