This paper proposes a novel method for energy disaggregation in home appliance monitoring using factorial Hidden Markov Models (FHMMs). The authors develop a scalable and computationally efficient algorithm that combines convex semidefinite relaxations, randomized rounding, and a scalable Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) to solve the resulting semidefinite program. The method is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating its superiority over state-of-the-art algorithms.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem of energy disaggregation and the limitations of existing methods. The technical sections are detailed and well-organized, making it easy to follow the development of the algorithm. The experimental results are thorough and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to tackle large-scale problems, which is a significant challenge in energy disaggregation. The authors' use of ADMM and randomized rounding enables them to solve problems with millions of variables, making their method scalable and practical. The paper also provides a detailed comparison with other state-of-the-art methods, which helps to establish the superiority of the proposed approach.
However, there are some areas where the paper could be improved. Firstly, the authors could provide more insight into the choice of hyperparameters and the sensitivity of the algorithm to these parameters. Additionally, the paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the algorithm and its scalability to even larger problems.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets all the criteria for a good scientific paper. It is technically sound, well-written, and provides a clear contribution to the field of energy disaggregation. The authors have also demonstrated the significance of their work through thorough experimental evaluations.
