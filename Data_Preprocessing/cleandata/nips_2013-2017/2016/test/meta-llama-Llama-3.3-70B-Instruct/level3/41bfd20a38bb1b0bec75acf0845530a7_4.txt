This paper proposes a novel approach to address the problem of energy disaggregation in home appliance monitoring. The authors develop a scalable and computationally efficient method based on a semidefinite relaxation combined with randomized rounding to solve the inference problem in factorial Hidden Markov Models (FHMMs). The method is shown to outperform the state-of-the-art algorithms in experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets.
The paper is well-structured and clearly written, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments and understand the technical details. The introduction provides a good background on the problem of energy disaggregation and the current state of the art, while the methodology section presents the authors' approach in a clear and concise manner. The experimental results are thorough and well-presented, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to tackle large-scale problems, which is a significant challenge in the field of energy disaggregation. The authors' use of a semidefinite relaxation combined with randomized rounding allows them to solve problems with a huge number of variables, making their method scalable and efficient. The paper also provides a detailed analysis of the results, including a comparison with other state-of-the-art methods, which helps to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach.
However, there are some areas where the paper could be improved. For example, the authors could provide more details on the implementation of their method, including the choice of parameters and the computational resources required. Additionally, the paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the limitations of the proposed method and potential avenues for future research.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets all the requirements. The authors provide a clear summary of the main ideas and relate them to previous work in the field. The paper is well-organized, and the authors provide enough information for the reader to reproduce the results. The paper also demonstrates originality and significance, as it proposes a novel approach to address a challenging problem in the field of energy disaggregation.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication. The authors have made a significant contribution to the field of energy disaggregation, and their method has the potential to be widely adopted in practice. With some minor revisions to address the areas mentioned above, the paper has the potential to be a strong contribution to the conference.
