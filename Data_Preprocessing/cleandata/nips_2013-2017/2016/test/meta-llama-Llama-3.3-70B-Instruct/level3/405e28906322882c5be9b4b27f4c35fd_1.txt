This paper studies the dynamic regret of multi-armed bandit and experts problem in non-stationary stochastic environments. The authors introduce a new parameter Î›, which measures the total statistical variance of the loss distributions, and investigate its effect on the regret bounds. They provide algorithms with upper bound guarantees and prove matching lower bounds for both bandit and full-information settings.
The paper's contribution to existing work is the consideration of the variance of random losses, but it is not entirely clear how this work differs from previous contributions, such as Jadbabaie et al. The authors could have done a better job of citing and discussing related work, particularly in the context of non-stationary stochastic environments.
The writing of the paper needs to be improved dramatically, with missing references and unclear motivation for the complexity measures used. The connection to tracking and shifting bounds is not well-explained, and the authors could have related their switching results to the large body of work done in information theory on coding piecewise stationary sources.
Despite these criticisms, the paper shows potential, and with substantial improvements, it could be a valuable contribution to the field. The authors have provided a thorough analysis of the regret bounds, and their algorithms seem to be well-designed. However, the paper requires significant revisions to address the issues mentioned above.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper provides a thorough analysis of the regret bounds in non-stationary stochastic environments.
* The authors have designed algorithms with upper bound guarantees and proved matching lower bounds.
* The consideration of the variance of random losses is a novel contribution to the field.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The paper lacks clarity and coherence, with missing references and unclear motivation for the complexity measures used.
* The connection to related work is not well-explained, and the authors could have done a better job of citing and discussing previous contributions.
* The writing of the paper needs to be improved dramatically to make it accessible to a wider audience.
Overall, I would recommend revising and resubmitting the paper to address the issues mentioned above. With significant improvements, this paper could be a valuable contribution to the field of online learning and decision-making.
