This paper proposes a novel approach to energy disaggregation using factorial Hidden Markov Models (FHMMs) and semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation combined with randomized rounding. The authors develop an efficient algorithm for inference in FHMMs, which significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of their approach. The introduction provides a good background on the problem of energy disaggregation and the current state of the art. The authors also provide a thorough review of the related work in the field.
The technical contributions of the paper are significant. The authors propose a novel SDP relaxation of the FHMM inference problem, which is tighter than the quadratic programming relaxation used in previous work. They also develop a scalable ADMM method that utilizes the special block-diagonal-like structure of the SDP relaxation, which provides a good initialization for randomized rounding.
The experimental results are impressive, with the proposed algorithm outperforming the state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the results, including the precision and recall of estimating which appliances are 'on' at any given time, as well as the error in assigning the power consumption to different appliances.
The paper has some minor weaknesses. The notation is sometimes heavy, and the reader may need to refer to the notation section frequently. Additionally, some of the technical details, such as the derivation of the ADMM updates, are relegated to the appendix, which may make it difficult for some readers to follow.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the technical contributions are significant. The experimental results are impressive, and the authors provide a detailed analysis of the results. The paper is a valuable contribution to the field of energy disaggregation and FHMM inference.
