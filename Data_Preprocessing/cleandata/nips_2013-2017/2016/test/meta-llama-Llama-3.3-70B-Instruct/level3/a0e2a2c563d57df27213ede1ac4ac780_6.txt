This paper introduces a novel homotopy smoothing (HOPS) algorithm for solving a family of non-smooth optimization problems. The algorithm achieves a lower iteration complexity of Õ(1/ 1−θ) with θ ∈ (0, 1] for obtaining an -optimal solution under a mild local error bound condition. The paper is well-written, and the experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of HOPS.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposed HOPS algorithm has a lower iteration complexity than existing algorithms, such as Nesterov's smoothing algorithm, for solving non-smooth optimization problems.
* The paper provides a thorough analysis of the algorithm, including a proof of the iteration complexity and a discussion of the local error bound condition.
* The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of HOPS on several tasks, including linear classification, image denoising, and low-rank and sparse matrix decomposition.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The algorithm requires a careful choice of the smoothing parameter and the number of iterations, which can be challenging in practice.
* The paper assumes that the local error bound condition holds, which may not be true for all problems.
* The experiments are limited to a few tasks, and it is unclear how well the algorithm will perform on other tasks.
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of non-smooth optimization and provides a useful algorithm for solving a family of important problems. The results are well-supported by theory and experiments, and the paper is well-written and easy to follow.
