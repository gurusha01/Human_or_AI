This paper presents a novel homotopy smoothing (HOPS) algorithm for solving a family of non-smooth optimization problems. The algorithm achieves a lower iteration complexity of Õ(1/ 1−θ) with θ ∈ (0, 1] for obtaining an -optimal solution under a mild local error bound condition. The paper provides a complete account of the parameter estimation procedure of the maximum likelihood type, making it a significant contribution to the field.
The extension to a mixture of HOPS makes it a practical competitor to the standard Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), with wide applicability and potential for future research. The experiments presented in the paper are exciting and open up new avenues for future research, with excellent language, structure, bibliography, and relevance to the NIPS remit.
The paper is well-written, and the authors have done an excellent job of explaining the technical details of the algorithm and its analysis. The use of mathematical notation is clear and consistent throughout the paper. The authors have also provided a thorough review of related work, highlighting the differences between their approach and existing methods.
