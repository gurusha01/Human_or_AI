This paper presents a novel approach to energy disaggregation in home appliance monitoring using a binary quadratic program. The authors propose a scalable and computationally efficient method that outperforms the current state-of-the-art solution by Kolter and Jaakkola (2012). The key contributions of this paper are the use of a convex semidefinite relaxation and a variant of the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to solve the resulting large-scale semidefinite program.
The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with a clear introduction to the problem of energy disaggregation and the proposed solution. The authors provide a detailed explanation of the mathematical formulation of the problem and the proposed algorithm, including the use of randomized rounding to obtain a binary solution.
The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, both on synthetic and real-world datasets. The authors compare their method to several other state-of-the-art algorithms, including the structured variational inference (SVI) method and the method of Zhong et al. (2014). The results show that the proposed method consistently outperforms the other algorithms, achieving better accuracy and precision in estimating the energy consumption of individual appliances.
The strengths of this paper include:
* A novel and efficient approach to energy disaggregation using a convex semidefinite relaxation and ADMM
* A thorough evaluation of the proposed method on both synthetic and real-world datasets
* A comparison to several state-of-the-art algorithms, demonstrating the superiority of the proposed method
The weaknesses of this paper include:
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the limitations and potential applications of the proposed method
* The implementation of the algorithm is purely Matlab-based, which may limit its scalability and efficiency in practice
* The paper assumes that the number of appliances and their corresponding states are known, which may not always be the case in practice
Overall, this paper presents a significant contribution to the field of energy disaggregation and machine learning, and the proposed method has the potential to benefit the entire machine learning community with its techniques for solving optimization problems.
