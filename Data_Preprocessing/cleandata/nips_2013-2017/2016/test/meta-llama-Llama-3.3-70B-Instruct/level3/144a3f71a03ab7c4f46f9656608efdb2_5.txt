This paper proposes a novel framework for clustering graphs without assuming that the data comes from a specific model, such as the Stochastic Block Model (SBM) or its extensions. The authors provide a generic theorem that guarantees the correctness of a clustering algorithm without relying on model assumptions. The theorem states that if a clustering fits the data well with respect to a model, then any other clustering that also fits the data well will be close to the original clustering.
The paper focuses on two specific models: the SBM and the Preference Frame Model (PFM). For each model, the authors provide a model estimation algorithm and a goodness of fit measure. They then instantiate the generic theorem for each model, providing bounds on the distance between two clusterings that fit the data well.
The results are significant, as they provide a way to validate clustering algorithms without relying on model assumptions. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through experiments on various datasets, including simulated and real-world graphs. The experiments show that the proposed framework can provide stable clustering results, even when the data does not fit the assumed model well.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their framework and results. The technical proofs are relegated to the supplement, making the paper easy to follow for non-experts. The authors also provide a thorough discussion of related work and potential extensions of their framework.
Strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel framework for model-free clustering validation
* The provision of specific results for the SBM and PFM models
* The demonstration of the effectiveness of the framework through experiments
* The clear and concise writing style
Weaknesses of the paper include:
* The reliance on specific models (SBM and PFM) for the instantiation of the generic theorem
* The potential for the bounds to be loose or not informative in certain cases
* The lack of exploration of other potential models or clustering algorithms
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of clustering and community detection, and the results have the potential to be widely applicable. The authors demonstrate a good understanding of the technical aspects of the problem and provide a clear and well-organized presentation of their work.
