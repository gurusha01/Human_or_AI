This paper proposes a novel approach to learning Bayesian networks optimally, subject to ancestral constraints, which are non-decomposable and pose a challenge for traditional learning methods. The authors utilize a search space called the EC tree, designed for structure learning with non-decomposable scores, and employ an oracle that optimizes decomposable scores. They also introduce a method to infer decomposable constraints from non-decomposable ancestral constraints, which can be used to empower the oracle and improve the efficiency of structure learning.
The paper is well-organized and clearly written, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments and understand the technical details. The introduction provides a good background on Bayesian network structure learning and the challenges posed by ancestral constraints. The technical sections are thorough and well-explained, with a clear description of the EC tree, the oracle, and the method for inferring decomposable constraints.
The experimental evaluation is comprehensive and well-designed, comparing the proposed approach to an ILP-based system and demonstrating its efficiency and scalability. The results show that the proposed approach is orders-of-magnitude faster than the ILP-based system, especially for larger numbers of variables. The authors also evaluate the impact of introducing ancestral constraints on the efficiency of search and the scalability of the approach, providing valuable insights into the behavior of the method.
The strengths of the paper include:
* A novel and efficient approach to learning Bayesian networks with ancestral constraints
* A well-designed and comprehensive experimental evaluation
* A clear and well-organized presentation of the technical details
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The method relies on an oracle that optimizes decomposable scores, which may not always be available or efficient
* The approach may not be applicable to very large networks or complex ancestral constraints
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of Bayesian network structure learning and provides a valuable tool for researchers and practitioners working with ancestral constraints. The approach is well-motivated, technically sound, and empirically evaluated, making it a strong candidate for acceptance.
