This paper introduces a novel framework for clustering graphs without assuming that the data comes from a specific model, such as the Stochastic Block Model (SBM) or its extensions. The authors propose a "model-free" approach, which provides guarantees for the correctness of the clustering results based on the statistics of the data. The framework is instantiated for the SBM and Preference Frame Model (PFM), and the authors provide theoretical guarantees for the stability of the clustering results.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem and their approach. The technical sections are also well-organized, and the proofs are rigorous and easy to follow. The authors also provide a thorough discussion of the related work and the significance of their contributions.
The main strengths of the paper are:
* The introduction of a novel framework for model-free clustering, which has the potential to be applied to a wide range of clustering problems.
* The provision of theoretical guarantees for the stability of the clustering results, which is a significant contribution to the field.
* The instantiation of the framework for the SBM and PFM, which demonstrates the applicability of the approach to specific models.
However, there are also some weaknesses:
* The paper assumes that the clustering algorithm used is spectral clustering, which may not be the best choice for all clustering problems.
* The authors do not provide a thorough comparison with existing model-based clustering approaches, which would be useful to understand the advantages and limitations of their approach.
* Some of the technical results, such as the bounds on the perturbation of the clustering, may be difficult to interpret and apply in practice.
Overall, I believe that this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of clustering and community detection, and it has the potential to be influential in the development of new clustering algorithms and techniques. However, some of the technical results may require further refinement and interpretation to be widely applicable.
