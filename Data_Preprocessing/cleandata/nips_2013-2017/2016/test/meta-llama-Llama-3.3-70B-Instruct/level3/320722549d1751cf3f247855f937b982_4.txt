This paper proposes a novel approach to solving the problem of learning spatially refined mesoscale connectivity from neural tracing experiments. The authors develop a new inference algorithm that combines matrix completion loss, a smoothing penalty, and low rank factorization to assimilate sparse connectivity data into complete, spatially explicit connectivity maps. The algorithm is designed to tackle the challenges of underdetermination, missing data, and size of the unknown connectivity matrix.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their approach. The use of mathematical notation and equations is appropriate, and the figures and tables are well-organized and easy to understand. The authors also provide a thorough discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of their approach, as well as its potential limitations and applications.
One of the key strengths of the paper is its ability to provide a high-resolution connectivity map of the mouse visual system. The authors demonstrate that their algorithm is significantly more predictive than current state-of-the-art approaches, which assume regions to be homogeneous. The use of a low rank version of the algorithm also allows for a significant reduction in the number of unknowns, making it potentially applicable to whole-brain connectivity mapping.
However, there are some potential limitations to the approach. The authors assume that the mesoscale connectivity is smoothly varying in space, which may not always be the case. Additionally, the algorithm requires a significant amount of computational resources, which may limit its applicability to larger datasets.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of their work. The paper is also well-organized, and the writing is clear and concise.
The originality of the paper is high, as it proposes a novel combination of familiar techniques to tackle a challenging problem in neuroscience. The authors provide a clear explanation of how their approach differs from previous contributions and adequately reference related work.
The significance of the paper is also high, as it addresses a difficult problem in neuroscience and provides a unique solution. The paper has the potential to advance the state of the art in neuroscience and provide new insights into the organization of brain connectivity.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication. The strengths of the paper, including its technical soundness, clarity, originality, and significance, outweigh its weaknesses. The paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of neuroscience and provides a unique solution to a challenging problem.
