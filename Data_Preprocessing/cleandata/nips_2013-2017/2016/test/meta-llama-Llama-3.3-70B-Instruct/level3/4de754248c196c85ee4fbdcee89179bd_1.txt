This paper presents a novel approach to energy disaggregation, a crucial task in non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM), using an additive factorial Hidden Markov Model (HMM). The authors propose a scalable and computationally efficient method to estimate the energy consumption of individual appliances in a household from the total energy consumption time series measurements. The key contributions of this paper include the development of a convex semidefinite relaxation, randomized rounding, and an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to solve the resulting optimization problem.
The paper is well-written, self-contained, and provides a clear explanation of the complex solution. The authors demonstrate the efficacy of their approach on both synthetic and real-world datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art algorithms. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves better performance in terms of normalized disaggregation error, precision, and recall.
The strengths of this paper include:
1. Novel approach: The authors propose a new approach to energy disaggregation using an additive factorial HMM, which is a significant contribution to the field.
2. Scalability: The proposed method is scalable and can handle large datasets, making it suitable for real-world applications.
3. Efficient optimization: The authors develop an efficient optimization algorithm using convex semidefinite relaxation, randomized rounding, and ADMM, which is a significant improvement over existing methods.
However, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement:
1. Estimation of the number of appliances: The authors do not provide a clear explanation of how to estimate the number of appliances, which is a crucial parameter in the model.
2. Computational complexity: Although the proposed method is scalable, it still requires significant computational resources, which may be a limitation for real-time applications.
3. Comparison to other methods: While the authors compare their method to other state-of-the-art algorithms, a more comprehensive comparison to other existing methods would be beneficial.
In terms of the conference guidelines, this paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, originality, and significance. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the technical details. The proposed approach is novel and significant, and the experimental results demonstrate its efficacy.
