This paper proposes a novel approach to predicting human visual attention in visual search tasks by incorporating the biologically plausible mechanism of Inhibition of Return into a learned region sparsity model. The authors extend the Region Ranking SVM (RRSVM) model to create a Sparse Diverse Regions (SDR) classifier, which selects a sparse and diverse set of regions to make a classification decision. The SDR classifier is trained on image-level labels without object location annotations and achieves state-of-the-art performance in predicting human gaze fixations on three different visual search tasks.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their approach. The experimental evaluation is thorough, and the results are impressive, with the SDR classifier outperforming other strong models for predicting human attention. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the results, including a discussion of the center bias effect and its impact on the performance of the SDR classifier.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to bridge the gap between computer vision and behavioral studies of visual attention. The authors provide a compelling argument for the importance of incorporating attention mechanisms into computer vision models, and their approach has the potential to improve our understanding of human visual processing.
However, there are some limitations to the paper. One of the main concerns is the lack of comparison to other state-of-the-art models for predicting human attention. While the authors provide a comparison to some baseline models, it would be useful to see a more comprehensive comparison to other models in the field. Additionally, the authors could provide more analysis of the results, including a discussion of the limitations of the SDR classifier and potential avenues for future work.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, and significance. The paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by experimental results. The writing is clear and concise, and the paper is well-organized. The approach is novel and has the potential to make a significant impact in the field of computer vision and behavioral studies of visual attention.
