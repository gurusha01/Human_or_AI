This paper proposes a novel approach to modeling visual attention by incorporating the biologically plausible mechanism of Inhibition of Return into a learned region sparsity model. The model, called Sparse Diverse Regions (SDR), is trained on image-level labels without object location annotations and achieves state-of-the-art performance in predicting human gaze fixations on three different visual search tasks.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the model and its components. The experiments are thorough, and the results are impressive, with SDR outperforming other methods in predicting human attention. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the results, including a discussion of the center bias effect and its impact on the performance of the model.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to bridge the gap between computer vision and behavioral studies of visual attention. The authors demonstrate that the core mechanisms driving high model performance in a search task also predict how humans allocate their attention in the same tasks. This has significant implications for our understanding of human visual processing and could lead to the development of more effective computer vision models.
However, there are some areas where the paper could be improved. For example, the authors could provide more details on the implementation of the model, including the specific architecture and hyperparameters used. Additionally, the authors could explore the use of other attention mechanisms, such as bottom-up saliency or scene context, to further improve the performance of the model.
