This paper proposes a new optimization algorithm based on homotopy smoothing, which achieves an eps gap towards the optimal objective value in O(1/eps^(1-\theta)\log(1/\eps)) iterations. The authors build upon existing work, such as Zhang et al.'s 2012 paper on sigma-strongly convex functions and smoothing multivariate performance measures. The analysis in the paper is similar to existing work on locally strongly convex optimization, and the KL condition used is also known as the Polyak-Lojasiewicz or gradient dominated condition.
The paper is technically sound, with well-supported claims and a clear structure. However, the results presented are not particularly novel or original, as most of the ideas and techniques have been explored in previous work. The authors could have provided more concrete justifications for the significance of the proposed algorithm, as the current results lack a clear demonstration of its importance or potential impact.
In terms of quality, the paper is well-written and easy to follow, with a clear explanation of the proposed algorithm and its analysis. The authors are careful in evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of their work, but could have provided more context and comparison to existing work. The paper is a complete piece of work, but its significance and originality are limited.
The clarity of the paper is good, with a well-organized structure and clear explanations. However, the authors could have provided more intuition and motivation for the proposed algorithm, as well as more detailed comparisons to existing work. The originality of the paper is limited, as the problems and approaches are not new, and the paper does not provide a novel combination of familiar techniques.
In terms of significance, the results presented are not particularly important or impactful, as they do not address a difficult problem in a significantly better way than previous research. The paper does not advance the state of the art in a demonstrable way, and the proposed algorithm may not be widely used or built upon by other researchers. Overall, while the paper is technically sound and well-written, its lack of novelty and originality limits its significance and impact.
