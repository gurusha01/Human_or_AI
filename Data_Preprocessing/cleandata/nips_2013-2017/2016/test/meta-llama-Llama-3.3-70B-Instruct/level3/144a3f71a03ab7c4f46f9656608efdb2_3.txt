This paper proposes an efficient method for incorporating ancestral constraints into the process of learning optimal Bayesian networks from data. The approach involves translating ancestral constraints into ordering constraints, which can then be used to prune the search space and improve the efficiency of the learning process. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through empirical evaluations, showing that it can be orders-of-magnitude more efficient than alternative frameworks, such as those based on integer linear programming.
The paper tackles a novel problem with no standard solution, and the proposed approach is well-motivated and clearly explained. The use of a MaxSAT solver to map ancestral constraints to ordering constraints is a key innovation, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of the rules and constraints used in this process.
However, there are some limitations and potential issues with the approach. For example, the comparison against the Gobnilp algorithm may not be entirely fair, as Gobnilp is not designed to tackle this specific problem. Additionally, the setting may be somewhat artificial, and more general causal discovery algorithms may be more suitable for real-world applications.
The paper also has some minor issues with notation, terminology, and clarity, such as unclear rules and inconsistent terminology. Furthermore, the approach may not be practical for real-world scenarios where only a few ancestral constraints are given, and these constraints may not significantly reduce the search space.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper is well-written and easy to follow, with clear explanations of the technical concepts and a thorough analysis of the results. The authors provide a detailed comparison with previous work and demonstrate the significance of their contributions. However, the paper's results may not be spectacular or groundbreaking, with a novelty score of 3 and an impact score of 2.
Overall, the paper is a solid contribution to the field, and the proposed approach has the potential to be useful in certain applications. However, the authors could improve the paper by addressing the limitations and potential issues mentioned above, and by providing more detailed analysis and evaluation of the approach in real-world scenarios.
