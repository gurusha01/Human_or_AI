This paper presents a novel approach to learning Bayesian networks optimally, subject to ancestral constraints. The authors propose a graph-theoretic framework, called the EC tree, which is capable of handling non-decomposable scores and constraints. They also introduce a method for inferring decomposable constraints from non-decomposable ancestral constraints, which can be used to empower an oracle for searching the EC tree.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their approach. The technical content is sound, and the experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The results show that the authors' approach is orders-of-magnitude faster than existing methods, such as ILP-based systems, for learning Bayesian networks with ancestral constraints.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel graph-theoretic framework for learning Bayesian networks with non-decomposable scores and constraints.
* The introduction of a method for inferring decomposable constraints from non-decomposable ancestral constraints, which can be used to empower an oracle for searching the EC tree.
* The demonstration of the effectiveness of the proposed approach through experiments, which show that it is orders-of-magnitude faster than existing methods.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes that the reader is familiar with the basics of Bayesian networks and graph theory, which may make it difficult for non-experts to follow.
* The experiments are limited to a specific set of benchmarks, and it is not clear how the approach would perform on other datasets.
* The paper does not provide a detailed comparison with other existing methods for learning Bayesian networks with ancestral constraints.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their approach. The technical content is sound, and the experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. However, the paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with other existing methods and a broader range of experiments.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel approach to learning Bayesian networks optimally, subject to ancestral constraints.
* The approach is shown to be orders-of-magnitude faster than existing methods, such as ILP-based systems.
* The paper provides a clear and concise explanation of the technical content.
Arguments against acceptance:
* The paper assumes that the reader is familiar with the basics of Bayesian networks and graph theory, which may make it difficult for non-experts to follow.
* The experiments are limited to a specific set of benchmarks, and it is not clear how the approach would perform on other datasets.
* The paper does not provide a detailed comparison with other existing methods for learning Bayesian networks with ancestral constraints.
Recommendations for improvement:
* Provide a more detailed comparison with other existing methods for learning Bayesian networks with ancestral constraints.
* Conduct a broader range of experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on different datasets.
* Consider providing a more detailed explanation of the technical content, including the basics of Bayesian networks and graph theory, to make the paper more accessible to non-experts.
