This paper presents a classification algorithm for estimating posterior distributions from positive-unlabeled data, with a focus on robustness to noise in the positive labels and effectiveness in high-dimensional data. The authors build upon the methodology of Jain et al., 2016, and improve upon it by handling noisy positives, as demonstrated through simulations. The paper's main contribution is the development of two practical classification algorithms that explicitly model the noise in the positive labels and utilize univariate transforms built on discriminative classifiers.
The strengths of the paper include its ability to handle noisy positives and its effectiveness in high-dimensional data. The authors provide a clear and well-organized presentation of their work, making it easy to follow and understand. The paper also provides a good overview of the related work in the field, although it would benefit from a comparison to a recent work [1*] that also improves upon Jain et al., 2016.
However, the paper's novelty and technicality are limited compared to Jain et al., 2016, due to its similarity in methodology. The proofs presented in the paper seem to be a straightforward extension of the previous work, and the authors could have provided more insight into the significance of their contributions.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, as it is technically sound and well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The paper is also clear and well-organized, making it easy to understand and follow. However, the originality of the paper is limited, and the authors could have provided more context and comparison to other recent works in the field. The significance of the paper is important, as it addresses a difficult problem in a better way than previous research and provides a unique approach to handling noisy positives in positive-unlabeled data.
