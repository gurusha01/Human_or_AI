This paper proposes a novel classification algorithm for estimating posterior distributions from positive-unlabeled data, which is robust to noise in the positive labels and effective for high-dimensional data. The authors build upon previous work in this area, addressing the limitations of existing algorithms that often perform poorly on real-world, high-dimensional data contaminated with noise. The key contribution of this paper is the development of two practical classification algorithms that explicitly model the noise in the positive labels and utilize univariate transforms built on discriminative classifiers.
The paper is technically sound, with a clear and well-organized presentation. The authors provide a thorough theoretical development, including proofs that the univariate transforms preserve the class prior, enabling estimation in the univariate space and avoiding kernel density estimation for high-dimensional data. The algorithms proposed are novel and constitute an important step towards the widespread use of robust classification algorithms for positive-unlabeled data.
One of the strengths of this paper is its ability to address a difficult problem in a better way than previous research. The authors provide a unique approach to modeling noise in positive labels and utilize univariate transforms to improve the robustness of the algorithm. The paper is also well-written, with clear explanations and adequate references to related work.
However, there are some areas that require further discussion and comparison to related works. For example, the authors could provide more insight into how their algorithm compares to other existing methods in terms of computational efficiency and accuracy. Additionally, the paper could benefit from more detailed experiments on real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.
In terms of originality, the paper presents a novel combination of familiar techniques, including discriminative classifiers and univariate transforms. The authors also provide a unique theoretical development, which advances the state of the art in this area. The significance of this work is evident, as it addresses a challenging problem in machine learning and provides a practical solution that can be used by practitioners and researchers.
Overall, I would argue in favor of accepting this paper, as it presents a significant contribution to the field of machine learning. The paper is well-written, technically sound, and provides a novel solution to a difficult problem. With some minor revisions to address the areas mentioned above, this paper has the potential to make a significant impact in the field.
