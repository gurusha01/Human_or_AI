This paper proposes a novel homotopy smoothing (HOPS) algorithm for solving a family of non-smooth optimization problems. The algorithm achieves a lower iteration complexity of Õ(1/ 1−θ) with θ ∈ (0, 1] for obtaining an -optimal solution under a mild local error bound condition. The paper provides a thorough analysis of the algorithm, including its convergence guarantee and iteration complexity.
The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with clear explanations of the algorithm and its analysis. The authors provide a detailed comparison with existing algorithms, including Nesterov's smoothing algorithm and the primal-dual method, and demonstrate the effectiveness of HOPS through experimental results on three different tasks.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel algorithm with a formal guarantee on iteration complexities
* A thorough analysis of the algorithm, including its convergence guarantee and iteration complexity
* Experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of HOPS compared to existing algorithms
However, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement:
* The paper assumes a local error bound condition, which may not hold for all problems. It would be useful to discuss the applicability of this condition and provide examples of problems where it holds.
* The choice of the parameter sigma in the Gaussian kernel used to define locality is not thoroughly discussed and requires robustness tests to understand its influence on the results.
* The paper would benefit from visual results using intrinsic estimators, which are shown to outperform GMM in the supplementary material, and an analysis of the computational complexity of HOPS vs. intrinsic estimators.
* The consideration of mixtures of LANDs is an interesting application, as data is rarely generated by one component, and this aspect would be worth expanding.
Overall, the paper is well-written and provides a significant contribution to the field of non-smooth optimization. With some revisions to address the weaknesses and areas for improvement, the paper has the potential to be a strong contribution to the conference.
