This paper presents a novel approach to learning Bayesian networks optimally, subject to ancestral constraints. The authors propose a search space for structure learning with non-decomposable scores, called the EC tree, and employ an oracle that optimizes decomposable scores. The key idea is to prune the EC tree based on ancestral constraints and to empower the oracle by passing it decomposable constraints inferred from the non-decomposable ancestral constraints.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem of learning Bayesian networks with ancestral constraints. The technical sections are also well-organized, and the authors provide a thorough explanation of their approach. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, showing that it is orders-of-magnitude more efficient than learning systems based on integer linear programming (ILP).
One of the strengths of the paper is its clarity and readability. The authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem and their approach, making it easy to follow for readers who are not experts in the field. The technical sections are also well-organized, and the authors provide a thorough explanation of their approach.
However, there are some minor issues with the paper. For example, Figure 1(b) and Figure 2 are confusing due to inconsistent notation and unclear captions. Additionally, the authors could provide more details on the implementation of the oracle and the EC tree, as well as more experimental results to demonstrate the scalability of their approach.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets all the criteria. The authors provide a clear and concise summary of the main ideas of the paper and relate them to previous work at NIPS and elsewhere. The paper is well-organized, and the authors provide a thorough explanation of their approach. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, and the authors provide a clear conclusion and future work section.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper to the conference. The paper presents a novel approach to learning Bayesian networks optimally, subject to ancestral constraints, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their approach. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, and the paper meets all the criteria of the conference guidelines.
