This paper presents a novel approach to inferring neural connectivity from viral tracing data using a structured regression model. The model combines non-negativity constraints, spatial smoothness regularization, low-rank assumptions, and a mask to handle ambiguity. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on synthetic data and real-world applications, including the Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas data for the visual system.
The paper is well-written, and the presentation of the model, synthetic examples, and real-world applications is clear. The use of a Gaussian noise model and spherical covariance may be simplistic, but the authors justify these assumptions as necessary simplifications. The paper's approach and results are notable, and the authors provide a thorough evaluation of their method, including a comparison to existing regional models.
The strengths of the paper include its ability to handle incomplete and noisy data, its scalability to large datasets, and its ability to provide spatially explicit connectivity maps. The authors also provide a low-rank version of their algorithm, which achieves significant compression of the data while maintaining accuracy.
However, there are some minor issues that need to be addressed. For example, the labels in Figure 3 are illegible, which makes it difficult to fully understand the results. Additionally, the authors could provide more discussion on the potential limitations of their approach and the implications of their results for our understanding of neural connectivity.
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of neural connectivity inference and has the potential to advance our understanding of brain function and organization. The authors provide a thorough evaluation of their method, and the results are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results.
