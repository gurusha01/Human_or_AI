This paper proposes a novel technique for estimating a weights matrix related to brain neural connectivity by combining multiple machine learning tools. The technique has the potential to be extremely important for neuroscientists, offering significant contributions to the field of neuroscience. 
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear explanation of their method, which combines a matrix completion loss for missing data, a smoothing spline penalty to regularize the problem, and optionally, a low rank factorization. The authors demonstrate the consistency of their estimator using synthetic data and then apply it to newly available Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas data for the visual system. The results show that the algorithm is significantly more predictive than current state-of-the-art approaches, which assume regions to be homogeneous.
The strengths of the paper include its novelty, technical soundness, and clarity. The authors provide a thorough explanation of their method, including the mathematical formulation and the optimization algorithm used to solve the problem. The paper is well-organized, and the authors provide sufficient background information to make the paper accessible to readers who are not experts in the field.
One of the weaknesses of the paper is that the authors do not provide a detailed comparison with other existing methods for estimating brain neural connectivity. While they mention that their algorithm is more predictive than current state-of-the-art approaches, they do not provide a thorough analysis of the differences between their method and others.
Another potential weakness is that the authors do not discuss the limitations of their method. For example, they assume that the mesoscale connectivity is smoothly varying in space, but they do not discuss how this assumption may affect the accuracy of their results.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear explanation of their method. The results are promising, and the paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of neuroscience.
