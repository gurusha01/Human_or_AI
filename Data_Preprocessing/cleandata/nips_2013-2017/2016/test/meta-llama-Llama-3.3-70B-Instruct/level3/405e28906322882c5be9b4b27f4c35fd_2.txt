This paper proposes a novel approach to video prediction in non-stationary environments, where the distribution of data may change over time. The authors introduce a method to partition sequences into intervals with stationary distributions, and investigate the impact of parameters measuring the difference between consecutive distributions and total statistical variance on dynamic pseudo-regret in full-information and bandit settings.
The work is well-motivated and novel, addressing a key challenge in online learning. However, some results are difficult to evaluate, and the presentation could be improved in several places. For instance, the notation used in certain sections is unclear, and the derivation of specific formulas could be more transparent. Additionally, the choice of algorithmic parameters and the limitations of the approach, such as only discussing the case of two actions, could be more thoroughly explored.
The paper raises several technical questions and concerns, including the interpretation of symbolic notation and the use of exponential weighted averages. The references provided are incomplete, and a more comprehensive comparison to related work, such as "Tracking the Best Expert" and "Switching Portfolios", would strengthen the paper.
The paper ends abruptly, and a more detailed discussion and comparison to related work would be beneficial. Furthermore, the clarity and logic of certain sections, such as the use of exponential weighted averages, could be improved. The paper's limitations, such as only discussing the case of two actions, should be more explicitly acknowledged and addressed.
Overall, the paper has potential, but requires revisions to address the technical concerns and improve the presentation. The strengths of the paper include its novel approach to video prediction and its potential applications in online learning. However, the weaknesses, such as the lack of clarity in certain sections and the incomplete references, need to be addressed to make the paper more convincing.
