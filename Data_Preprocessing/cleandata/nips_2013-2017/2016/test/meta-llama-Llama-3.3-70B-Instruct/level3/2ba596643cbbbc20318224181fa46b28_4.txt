This paper proposes a novel framework for clustering graphs without assuming that the data comes from a specific model, providing "correctness" guarantees based on the statistics of the data. The authors introduce a generic theorem that can be instantiated for different model classes, such as the Stochastic Block Model (SBM) and the Preference Frame Model (PFM). The framework is based on the idea that if a clustering fits the data well, then any other clustering that also fits the data well will be a small perturbation of the original clustering.
The paper provides a thorough analysis of the framework, including a detailed description of the notation, background on graphs and clusterings, and a presentation of the main theorems. The authors also provide an experimental evaluation of the framework on several datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in providing model-free guarantees for clustering.
The strengths of the paper include its originality, technical soundness, and clarity. The authors provide a clear and well-organized presentation of the framework, and the proofs of the theorems are rigorous and well-explained. The experimental evaluation is also thorough and provides valuable insights into the performance of the framework.
However, there are some weaknesses to the paper. The notation can be confusing at times, and some of the definitions are not clearly explained. Additionally, the paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the related work and how the proposed framework compares to existing methods. The authors also mention that the framework can be used in conjunction with existing model-based recovery guarantees, but this is not fully explored in the paper.
In terms of significance, the paper makes an important contribution to the field of community detection in networks. The proposed framework provides a new way of thinking about clustering, one that is based on the statistics of the data rather than on a specific model. This has the potential to be widely applicable and to provide more robust and reliable clustering results.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication. The authors have made a significant contribution to the field, and the paper is well-written and well-organized. With some minor revisions to address the weaknesses mentioned above, the paper has the potential to be a valuable addition to the literature on community detection in networks.
