This paper proposes a novel approach to image classification and visual attention prediction by introducing a Sparse Diverse Region Classifier (SDR) method. The SDR method incorporates the concept of "Inhibition of Return" to promote diversity in region selection, which is inspired by the biological mechanism of human visual attention. The authors evaluate their method on various datasets and scenarios, demonstrating a performance boost of approximately 4% compared to the Region Ranking SVM (RRSVM) method.
The paper is well-organized and clearly written, making it easy to follow and understand the proposed method and experimental results. The authors provide a thorough analysis of their approach, including comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods, such as R-CNN and AnnoBoxes. However, I have some concerns regarding the choice of baselines, as R-CNN may not be a strong baseline due to its weaknesses and differences in task objectives. Additionally, the comparison with AnnoBoxes may not be entirely fair, as it exploits more information and its advantage is reduced due to its simplistic approach.
One of the strengths of the paper is the thorough evaluation of the proposed method on various datasets and scenarios, including single-target present, target absent, and multiple-target attention conditions. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the SDR method in predicting human visual attention, with significant improvements over other methods. However, I would like to see more experiments to evaluate the effect of parameters on performance and more concrete conclusions drawn from the results.
To further strengthen the paper, I recommend considering additional comparisons with existing work, such as the method from Li et al., and revising the baselines to provide a more comprehensive evaluation. Furthermore, the authors could explore the application of their method to other tasks, such as object detection and segmentation, to demonstrate its broader applicability.
In conclusion, while the paper presents a promising approach to image classification and visual attention prediction, it is still at a premature stage for publication. With further refinement, experimentation, and analysis, the authors can strengthen their work and provide more convincing evidence for the effectiveness of their proposed method. I encourage the authors to revise and improve their work, addressing the concerns and suggestions outlined above, to increase its impact and contribution to the field.
