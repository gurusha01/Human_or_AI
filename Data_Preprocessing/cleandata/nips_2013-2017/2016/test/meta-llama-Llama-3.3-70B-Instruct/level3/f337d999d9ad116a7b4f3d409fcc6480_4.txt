This paper presents a novel approach to estimating neural connectivity in the mouse brain's visual cortex at a finer level, using a regularized multivariate regression method. The authors apply this method to real data from the Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas and demonstrate improved performance over coarser regional level results. The method's novelty is somewhat limited due to similarities with existing matrix/tensor completion methods, but it extends previous work by solving the problem at a finer voxel level.
The paper's strengths include its ability to handle incomplete and missing data, as well as its scalability to larger datasets. The authors also provide a thorough evaluation of their method, including comparisons to other approaches and an analysis of the results. The use of a low-rank factorization to compress the connectivity matrix is also a notable contribution, as it enables the method to be applied to larger datasets.
However, there are some weaknesses to the paper. The authors could provide more context and background on the problem of neural connectivity estimation, as well as a clearer explanation of the limitations and potential biases of their approach. Additionally, the paper could benefit from more detailed comparisons to other methods, including a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of each approach.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, and significance. The authors provide a clear and well-organized presentation of their method and results, and the paper is well-written and easy to follow. The method is also significant, as it has the potential to advance our understanding of neural connectivity and its role in brain function.
