This paper proposes a novel approach to learning Bayesian networks optimally, subject to background knowledge in the form of ancestral constraints. The authors utilize a search space called the EC tree, which is designed for structure learning with non-decomposable scores, and employ an oracle that optimizes decomposable scores. The key insight is to empower the oracle by passing it decomposable constraints inferred from the non-decomposable ancestral constraints.
The paper is well-written and provides a clear overview of the problem, the proposed approach, and the experimental evaluation. The authors demonstrate that their approach is orders-of-magnitude more efficient compared to learning systems based on integer linear programming (ILP). The experiments are thorough and well-designed, and the results are presented in a clear and concise manner.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to handle non-decomposable constraints, which is a challenging problem in Bayesian network structure learning. The authors propose a sound and complete method for pruning the EC tree based on ancestral constraints, which is a significant contribution to the field.
However, there are some areas that require improvement. The experiments presented in the paper are confusing, particularly in regards to the comparisons made between different approaches in Tables 1 and 3. A direct comparison between the original EC approach and the new work combined with EC is missing, which would be more informative than the provided comparisons.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The paper is well-organized, and the writing is clear and concise. The authors provide a thorough review of the related work and demonstrate a good understanding of the problem and the proposed approach.
In terms of originality, the paper proposes a novel approach to learning Bayesian networks with ancestral constraints, which is a significant contribution to the field. The authors combine existing techniques in a new and innovative way, and the proposed approach has the potential to impact the field of Bayesian network structure learning.
In terms of significance, the paper addresses an important problem in Bayesian network structure learning, and the proposed approach has the potential to improve the efficiency and accuracy of learning Bayesian networks with ancestral constraints. The paper demonstrates that the proposed approach can scale to larger networks and can handle a significant number of variables, which is a significant advantage over existing approaches.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, but with some revisions to address the concerns mentioned above. The paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of Bayesian network structure learning, and with some revisions, it can be even stronger.
