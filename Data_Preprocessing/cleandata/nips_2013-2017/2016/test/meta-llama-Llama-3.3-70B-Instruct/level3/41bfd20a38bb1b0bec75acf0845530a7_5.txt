This paper proposes a novel approach to energy disaggregation, a crucial task in home appliance monitoring, by leveraging a scalable and computationally efficient method based on factorial Hidden Markov Models (FHMMs) and semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation combined with randomized rounding. The authors tackle the challenging problem of estimating the energy consumption of individual appliances over time given the total energy consumption signal of a household.
The paper's main strengths lie in its ability to address the limitations of existing methods, such as quadratic programming, by introducing a tighter SDP relaxation that leads to better approximate solutions. The authors also develop a novel ADMM solver that efficiently handles large-scale, sparse block-structured SDP problems, making their approach scalable and practical for real-world applications.
The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method, dubbed ADMM-RR, over state-of-the-art algorithms, including the structured variational inference (SVI) method and the methods of Kolter and Jaakkola (KJ) and Zhong et al. (ZGS). The evaluation on both synthetic and real-world datasets shows that ADMM-RR consistently outperforms its competitors in terms of normalized disaggregation error, precision, and recall.
However, there are some areas that require further clarification and improvement. For instance, the authors could provide more details on the computational complexity of their approach and compare it to existing methods. Additionally, the paper could benefit from a more thorough discussion on the choice of hyperparameters, such as the number of iterations and the step-size value, and their impact on the algorithm's performance.
In terms of originality, the paper presents a novel combination of techniques, including SDP relaxation, randomized rounding, and ADMM, to tackle the energy disaggregation problem. The authors also contribute to the development of a scalable and efficient algorithm for FHMM inference, which has broader implications for other applications involving large-scale integer quadratic programming.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the authors demonstrate a good understanding of the underlying mathematical concepts and their application to the energy disaggregation problem. The results are promising, and the approach has the potential to make a significant impact in the field.
