This paper proposes a novel approach to predicting human visual attention in visual search tasks by incorporating the biologically plausible mechanism of Inhibition of Return into a learned region sparsity model. The authors extend the Region Ranking SVM (RRSVM) model to create a Sparse Diverse Regions (SDR) classifier, which selects a sparse and diverse set of regions to make a classification decision. The SDR classifier is evaluated on three visual search tasks and achieves state-of-the-art results in predicting human gaze fixations, even though it is trained only on image-level labels without object location annotations.
The paper is well-written and clearly explains the background, methodology, and results. The authors provide a thorough review of related work and discuss the limitations of existing approaches. The experimental results are impressive, and the comparison to other methods is thorough. The paper also provides a good discussion of the implications of the results and potential future directions.
However, there are some limitations to the paper. The authors could have provided more analysis of the results and discussed the potential reasons for the success of the SDR classifier. Additionally, the paper could have benefited from more visualizations of the results, such as examples of the priority maps generated by the SDR classifier.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets the criteria for quality, clarity, and significance. The paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by experimental results. The paper is clearly written, and the organization is logical. The results are significant, and the paper has the potential to make a substantial impact on the field of computer vision and visual attention.
