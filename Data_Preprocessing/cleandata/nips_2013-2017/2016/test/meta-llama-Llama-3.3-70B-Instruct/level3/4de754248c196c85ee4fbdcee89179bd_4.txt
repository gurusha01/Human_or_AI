This paper proposes a novel approach to energy disaggregation, a crucial task in non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM), by formulating it as an integer quadratic programming optimization problem and applying semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation and randomized rounding. The authors claim that their method outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms, including the one proposed by Kolter and Jaakkola (2012), in terms of accuracy and scalability.
The paper is well-structured, and the authors provide a clear introduction to the problem of energy disaggregation and the existing approaches. The proposed method is thoroughly explained, and the experimental results are presented in a detailed and comprehensive manner. The use of synthetic and real-world datasets (REDD) adds credibility to the claims made by the authors.
However, there are some concerns that need to be addressed. Firstly, the experimental study lacks a comparison of running times between the proposed algorithm and the state-of-the-art methods. This is a crucial aspect, as the authors claim that their method is scalable and computationally efficient. Providing a detailed comparison of running times would strengthen the paper's claims.
Secondly, the choice of Kolter and Jaakkola (2012) as the state-of-the-art is questionable, given that other papers published after 2012 are mentioned in the introduction. The authors should justify why they consider Kolter and Jaakkola (2012) as the state-of-the-art, despite the existence of more recent works.
Thirdly, the paper has some minor issues, such as unclear notation and section titles, which need to be addressed for clarity and accuracy. For example, the notation used in Section 3.1 is not clearly explained, and the section title "SDP Relaxation and Randomized Rounding" could be more descriptive.
Lastly, the authors should provide more insights into the practical applications of their method and its potential impact on the field of energy disaggregation. While the paper provides a thorough technical explanation of the proposed method, it lacks a discussion on the broader implications and potential uses of the approach.
In conclusion, the paper proposes a novel approach to energy disaggregation and provides promising experimental results. However, the authors need to address the concerns mentioned above to strengthen their claims and provide a more comprehensive and convincing paper.
