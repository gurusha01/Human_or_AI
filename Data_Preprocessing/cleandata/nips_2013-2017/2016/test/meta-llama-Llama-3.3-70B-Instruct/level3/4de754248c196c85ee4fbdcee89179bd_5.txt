This paper proposes a novel machine learning approach to estimate whole-brain neural connectivity at the voxel scale using viral tracing experiments. The authors develop a nonnegative spline regression algorithm that combines a matrix completion loss for missing data, a smoothing spline penalty to regularize the problem, and an optional low-rank factorization. The method is applied to the Allen Institute Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas data for the visual system, and the results show that it significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches, reducing the mean squared error by 69% and 67% at the voxel and regional scales, respectively.
The paper is technically sound, and the methodology is well-motivated and clearly explained. The use of a smoothing penalty to regularize the problem is particularly effective in capturing the spatially organized projections to higher visual areas. The low-rank version of the algorithm is also shown to be effective in compressing the connectivity map while maintaining a high level of accuracy.
The strengths of the paper include its novelty, technical soundness, and significance. The approach is new and has the potential to reveal detailed features of connectivity at the mesoscale, which could unlock cell-type specific connectivity and microcircuit organization throughout the brain. The results are also significant, as they demonstrate the efficacy of the method in improving cross-validated predictions and unveiling spatial patterning of connectivity.
However, there are some weaknesses and concerns. One major concern is the lack of a study on the computational complexity of the proposed method, which should be included in the final paper version. Additionally, the paper's technical nature makes it more suitable for a poster presentation rather than a full presentation.
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel and technically sound approach to estimating whole-brain neural connectivity at the voxel scale.
* The results show significant improvements over current state-of-the-art approaches.
* The method has the potential to reveal detailed features of connectivity at the mesoscale.
Arguments con acceptance:
* The lack of a study on the computational complexity of the proposed method is a significant concern.
* The paper's technical nature may make it more suitable for a poster presentation rather than a full presentation.
Overall, I recommend accepting the paper, but with the condition that the authors address the concern about computational complexity and provide a clear explanation of the method's scalability.
