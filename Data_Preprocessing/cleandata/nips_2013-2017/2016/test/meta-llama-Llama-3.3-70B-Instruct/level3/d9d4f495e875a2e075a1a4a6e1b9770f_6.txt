This paper proposes a novel approach to predicting human visual attention by incorporating the biologically plausible mechanism of Inhibition of Return into a learned region sparsity model. The authors demonstrate that their model, called Sparse Diverse Regions (SDR), achieves state-of-the-art performance in predicting human fixations on various visual search tasks, outperforming other strong baselines. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their approach, as well as a thorough evaluation of their model on multiple datasets.
The strengths of this paper include its novel approach to predicting human visual attention, its thorough evaluation on multiple datasets, and its ability to outperform other strong baselines. The authors also provide a clear and concise explanation of their approach, making it easy to understand and follow. Additionally, the paper highlights the potential of using computer vision models to predict human visual attention, which is an important area of research with many applications.
However, there are some weaknesses to the paper. One of the main limitations is the lack of clarity in the figures showing the model's predictions, which makes it difficult to understand the results. The authors could benefit from providing supplementary material, such as videos, to support their results. Additionally, the paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the center bias effect and its impact on the results.
