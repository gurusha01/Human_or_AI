This paper proposes a refined optimization method for learning additive factorial Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) with a focus on energy disaggregation applications. The authors demonstrate solid technical quality in their approach, which combines convex semidefinite relaxations, randomized rounding, and a scalable Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) to solve the resulting semidefinite program efficiently.
The method is compared to baseline approaches on both synthetic and real-world datasets, showing substantial improvements over existing methods. The presentation is clear, but some minor grammatical errors were noted, which do not detract from the overall quality of the paper.
The work has high potential societal impact, as energy efficiency is a critical issue in modern society. However, the originality of the work is ranked lower due to existing research in this direction, particularly the work of Kolter and Jaakkola (2012). The authors effectively addressed reviewer concerns about novelty and scalability in their rebuttal, including a comparison with previous results.
The paper's strengths include its ability to handle large-scale problems, its improved performance over existing methods, and its potential applicability to other FHMM inference problems. The weaknesses include the need for further optimization to improve computational efficiency and the reliance on heuristics for handling unknown or unmodeled appliances.
Arguments for acceptance include:
* The paper presents a significant improvement over existing methods in energy disaggregation applications.
* The approach is scalable and can handle large-scale problems, making it suitable for real-world applications.
* The authors demonstrate a good understanding of the technical challenges and provide a clear and well-structured presentation.
Arguments against acceptance include:
* The originality of the work is somewhat limited due to existing research in this direction.
* The computational efficiency of the method could be improved further, which may limit its applicability in practice.
* The reliance on heuristics for handling unknown or unmodeled appliances may not be suitable for all scenarios.
Overall, the paper presents a well-written and technically sound contribution to the field of energy disaggregation and FHMM inference. With some minor revisions to address grammatical errors and further optimization to improve computational efficiency, the paper has the potential to make a significant impact in the field.
