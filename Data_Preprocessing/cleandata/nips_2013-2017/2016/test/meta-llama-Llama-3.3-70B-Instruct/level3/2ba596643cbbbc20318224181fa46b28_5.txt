This paper proposes a novel framework for clustering graphs without assuming that the data comes from a specific model, providing "correctness" guarantees based on the statistics of the data. The authors introduce a generic theorem that states if a clustering fits the data well with respect to a model, then any other clustering that also fits the data well will be close to the original clustering. The paper instantiates this theorem for the Stochastic Block Model (SBM) and Preference Frame Model (PFM), providing model-free guarantees for these models.
The paper is well-written, and the presentation is clear and easy to understand. The authors provide a thorough background on graphs, clusterings, and block models, making the paper accessible to readers who may not be familiar with these topics. The main theorems and propositions are well-explained, and the proofs are relegated to the supplement, which is a good practice.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The introduction of a novel framework for model-free clustering guarantees, which is a significant contribution to the field.
* The instantiation of the generic theorem for SBM and PFM, providing model-free guarantees for these models.
* The use of elementary and direct proof techniques, which makes the paper more accessible to a broader audience.
* The experimental evaluation, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed framework on various datasets.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes that the data is represented as a graph, which may not be the case for all types of data.
* The model-free guarantees provided by the paper may not be as strong as those provided by model-based approaches, which can make stronger assumptions about the data-generating process.
* The paper does not provide a clear comparison with existing work on model-based clustering, which would be helpful in understanding the significance of the proposed framework.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the proposed framework is a significant contribution to the field of clustering. The model-free guarantees provided by the paper are a useful addition to the existing literature on clustering, and the experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed framework.
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper introduces a novel framework for model-free clustering guarantees, which is a significant contribution to the field.

Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, as it provides a significant contribution to the field of clustering and introduces a novel framework for model-free clustering guarantees. However, the authors should address the weaknesses mentioned above, such as providing a clear comparison with existing work on model-based clustering and discussing the limitations of the proposed framework.
