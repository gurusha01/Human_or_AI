This paper presents a novel approach to modeling visual attention by incorporating the biologically plausible mechanism of Inhibition of Return into a learned region sparsity model. The resulting model, called Sparse Diverse Regions (SDR), is able to predict human fixations in visual search tasks with high accuracy, even when the target object is absent or multiple targets are present. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of SDR on three different datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in predicting human attention.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their approach. The experimental results are thorough and well-presented, with a detailed analysis of the performance of SDR on different datasets and conditions. The authors also provide a thoughtful discussion of the limitations of their approach and potential directions for future work.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to bridge the gap between computer vision and cognitive science, providing a new perspective on visual attention mechanisms. The authors' use of a classification model to predict human fixations is innovative and demonstrates the potential for machine learning models to inform our understanding of human visual processing.
However, there are some areas for improvement. The presentation of data in section 4.2 could be improved, with clearer formatting and more detailed explanations of the results. Additionally, the authors could provide more context about the datasets used and the specific challenges of each dataset.
