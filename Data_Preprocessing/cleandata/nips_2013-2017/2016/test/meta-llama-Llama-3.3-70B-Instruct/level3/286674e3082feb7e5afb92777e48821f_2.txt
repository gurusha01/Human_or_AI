This paper presents a novel framework for clustering graphs without assuming that the data comes from a specific model, such as the Stochastic Block Model (SBM) or Preference Frame Model (PFM). The authors propose a generic theorem that provides guarantees for the correctness of clustering results based on the statistics of the data, rather than relying on model assumptions. The paper also establishes a property of equivalence between different measures of distance of clusterings for network data, providing both theoretical and experimental validations.
The strengths of the paper include its novelty, clarity, and potential applications in detecting clusterability. The authors provide a well-written and well-organized manuscript that clearly explains the core ideas and technical contributions. The paper builds upon recent works in network literature, and the theoretical parts are simple extensions of well-known results.
The weaknesses of the paper include the fact that the results are not always informative, and the bounds provided by the theorems may not be tight. Additionally, the paper assumes that the data is sampled from a graph, which may not always be the case in practice.
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The paper presents a novel and interesting approach to clustering graphs without model assumptions.
* The authors provide a clear and well-organized manuscript that is easy to follow.
* The paper has potential applications in detecting clusterability and provides a new perspective on the problem.
* The theoretical contributions are sound and well-supported by experimental results.
Arguments con acceptance:
* The results may not be informative in all cases, and the bounds provided by the theorems may not be tight.
* The paper assumes that the data is sampled from a graph, which may not always be the case in practice.
* The paper may benefit from additional experimental evaluations and comparisons with existing methods.
Overall, I recommend accepting the paper, as it presents a novel and interesting approach to clustering graphs without model assumptions, and the authors provide a clear and well-organized manuscript that is easy to follow. However, the authors should be encouraged to address the weaknesses of the paper, such as providing tighter bounds and evaluating the method on a wider range of datasets.
