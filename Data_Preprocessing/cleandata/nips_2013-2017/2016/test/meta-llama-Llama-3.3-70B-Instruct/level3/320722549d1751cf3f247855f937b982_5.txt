This paper presents a novel machine learning approach to infer spatially explicit, voxel-scale connectivity maps of the brain from viral tracer data. The authors propose a nonnegative spline regression method that combines a matrix completion loss for missing data, a smoothing spline penalty to regularize the problem, and optionally, a low rank factorization. The method is applied to the Allen Institute Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas data for the visual system, and the results show that it outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches, reducing the voxel and regional mean squared error by 69% and 67%, respectively.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the methodology and the results. The use of a smoothing penalty to regularize the problem is a key innovation, as it allows the method to capture spatially organized projections to higher visual areas. The low rank version of the algorithm is also an important contribution, as it achieves a roughly 23Ã— compression of the original data while maintaining a high level of accuracy.
The strengths of the paper include the novelty of the approach, the clarity of the writing, and the thoroughness of the evaluation. The authors provide a detailed comparison with existing methods and demonstrate the superiority of their approach. The use of synthetic data to test the method is also a strength, as it allows the authors to evaluate the method's performance in a controlled setting.
One potential weakness of the paper is the lack of intuition on how to construct the smoothing penalty. The authors provide a clear explanation of the mathematical formulation, but it is not entirely clear how the choice of the smoothing penalty affects the results. Additionally, the paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the limitations of the method and potential avenues for future research.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of the work. The paper is clearly written, well-organized, and provides enough information for the expert reader to reproduce the results.
The originality of the paper is high, as it presents a novel combination of familiar techniques to tackle a challenging problem in neuroscience. The related work is adequately referenced, and the authors provide a clear explanation of how their approach differs from previous contributions.
The significance of the paper is also high, as it addresses a difficult problem in neuroscience and provides a unique solution. The results have the potential to advance the state of the art in brain connectivity mapping and provide new insights into the organization of the brain. The paper provides unique data, unique conclusions on existing data, and a unique theoretical or pragmatic approach, making it a valuable contribution to the field.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper for publication. The minor comments and suggestions for improvement include clarifying the definition of the learning rate, explaining the domain of a function, and providing additional steps for certain calculations. However, these are minor issues that do not affect the overall quality of the paper.
