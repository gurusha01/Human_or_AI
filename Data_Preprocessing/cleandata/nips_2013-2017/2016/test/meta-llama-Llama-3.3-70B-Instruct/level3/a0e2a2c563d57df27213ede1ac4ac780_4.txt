This paper proposes a visual attentional method based on a Region Ranking SVM (RRSVM) classifier that recognizes image categories using a sparse set of regions and extracts visual features using a deep neural network (VGG16). The method incorporates a biological mechanism, Inhibition of Return (IOR), to detect multi-objects in an image, achieving competitive results on visual search tasks of single and multi-objects. The paper presents a significant contribution to the field of computer vision and visual attention, demonstrating that a classification model trained only on image-level annotations can predict human attention in visual search tasks.
The strengths of the paper include its ability to predict human attention in various visual search tasks, including single-target present, target absent, and multiple-target attention. The results show that the proposed method, Sparse Diverse Regions (SDR), outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, including RCNN and CAM, in predicting human attention. The paper also provides a thorough analysis of the results, including an examination of the center bias effect and the use of shuffled AUC (sAUC) to evaluate the performance of the models.
However, there are some weaknesses in the paper. One major concern is the lack of sensitivity analysis on IOR-related parameters, which can affect the prediction accuracy of multi-objects at different scales and explain some failure examples. Additionally, the experiment in Table 1 is flawed as it uses different feature extractors across methods, making it unclear whether the contribution comes from the RRSVM classifier or the feature extractor.
In terms of quality, the paper is technically sound, and the claims are well-supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The paper is also well-organized and clearly written, making it easy to follow. However, the paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the failure cases and a discussion of the limitations of the proposed method.
The originality of the paper lies in its ability to bridge the gap between computer vision and visual attention, demonstrating that a classification model can be used to predict human attention in visual search tasks. The paper also provides a unique perspective on visual attention mechanisms, showing how the inclusion of attention-based mechanisms can improve computer vision techniques.
The significance of the paper lies in its potential to advance the state of the art in visual attention and computer vision. The proposed method has the potential to be used in various applications, including image captioning, object detection, and human-computer interaction. The paper also raises important questions about the relationship between computer vision and visual attention, highlighting the need for further research in this area.
