This paper proposes a novel approach to studying the dynamic regret of multi-armed bandit and experts problems in non-stationary stochastic environments. The authors introduce a new parameter Λ, which measures the total statistical variance of the loss distributions over time, and investigate its interaction with other parameters such as Γ, which counts the number of times the distributions change, and V, which measures the distance the distributions deviate over time.
The technical contribution of the paper is strong, and the writeup is clear and easy to understand. The authors provide a comprehensive empirical evaluation, which demonstrates the effectiveness of their approach. However, the evaluation could be improved by comparing the proposed approach to other kernel learning techniques, such as standard MKL or a Gaussian kernel with optimized bandwidth.
The paper's results provide a big picture of the regret landscape in terms of the parameters Λ, Γ, V, and T, in both full-information and bandit settings. The authors propose algorithms with upper bound guarantees and prove their matching lower bounds, which is a significant contribution to the field.
Here are the arguments pro and con acceptance:
Pros:
* The paper proposes a novel approach to studying dynamic regret in non-stationary stochastic environments.
* The technical contribution is strong, and the writeup is clear and easy to understand.
* The empirical evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
* The paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the regret landscape in terms of the parameters Λ, Γ, V, and T.
Cons:
* The evaluation could be improved by comparing the proposed approach to other kernel learning techniques.
* The paper assumes that the parameters Γ, V, and Λ are known, which may not be the case in practice.
* The proposed algorithms may not be practical for large-scale problems due to their computational complexity.
Overall, I recommend accepting the paper, as its technical contribution and comprehensive analysis make it a significant addition to the field. However, the authors should consider addressing the cons mentioned above in future work.
