This paper presents a novel approach to predicting future video frames based on an agent's action in an unsupervised manner. The method combines LSTM, dynamic neural advection, and spatial transformers to predict pixel motion, allowing the model to generalize to unseen objects. The authors evaluate their approach on a new dataset of robots manipulating objects and the Human3.6M dataset, demonstrating excellent performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.
The paper's strengths include its ability to predict long-range video sequences, its robustness to novel objects, and its interpretability through the use of object-centric representations. The authors also provide a thorough evaluation of their method, including comparisons to prior work and ablation studies.
However, there are some concerns regarding the quality of the predicted still images, which become blurry quickly, limiting the utility of the approach. Additionally, the use of LSTM for prediction is not novel, and the architecture choice could be improved with additional LSTM layers or alternative methods like differentiable long-term memory. The dynamic neural advection component also lacks clarity, particularly regarding the motion parameterization and the value of M.
To improve the paper, the authors could provide more mathematical details on the architecture, including the motion prediction modules and the composition of object motion predictions. This would help readers understand the modeling assumptions, limitations, and reproduce the results. Furthermore, the authors could explore ways to improve the quality of the predicted images, such as using more advanced loss functions or incorporating additional information, like depth or segmentation masks.
