This paper proposes a novel approach to learning Bayesian networks optimally, subject to ancestral constraints, which are non-decomposable and pose a challenge for traditional learning methods. The authors utilize a search space called the EC tree, designed for structure learning with non-decomposable scores, and employ an oracle that optimizes decomposable scores. They also introduce a method to prune the EC tree based on ancestral constraints and show how to empower the oracle by passing it decomposable constraints inferred from the non-decomposable ancestral constraints.
The paper is well-structured and clearly written, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments. The technical content is sound, and the authors provide a thorough explanation of the proposed approach, including the necessary mathematical formulations and theoretical justifications. The empirical evaluation is also comprehensive, comparing the proposed approach to an ILP-based system and demonstrating its efficiency and scalability.
However, there are some areas that could be improved. Firstly, the authors could provide more context and motivation for the problem of learning Bayesian networks with ancestral constraints. While they mention the importance of ancestral constraints in practice, a more detailed discussion of their applications and the challenges they pose would be helpful. Secondly, the paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the experimental results, including a discussion of the limitations and potential biases of the evaluation methodology. Finally, the authors could consider providing more insights into the potential extensions and future directions of their work, including potential applications to other areas of machine learning and artificial intelligence.
In terms of the conference guidelines, the paper meets most of the criteria. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear summary of the main ideas and their relation to previous work. The technical content is sound, and the authors provide a thorough evaluation of their approach. However, the paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed approach, as well as a more explicit comparison to other related work in the field.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, as it presents a novel and well-motivated approach to learning Bayesian networks with ancestral constraints. The technical content is sound, and the empirical evaluation is comprehensive. With some minor revisions to address the areas mentioned above, the paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence.
