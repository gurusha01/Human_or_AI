This paper proposes a novel approach to solving composite optimization problems with non-smooth functions, focusing on a specific structure of the function f. The main result, Thm 5, shows that the number of iterations needed to optimize smoothed versions of the function is dependent on the Local Error Bound (LEB) condition, leading to linear convergence for certain functions. The paper discusses various conditions that result in LEB conditions, including KL property and hinge loss ERM, and provides experimental results comparing to other first-order methods.
The technical quality of the paper is sound, with well-written proofs and explanations. However, there are some minor issues, such as a typo and unclear sketch of Thm 5. The paper's novelty lies in its new rates under the proposed setting, which are non-trivial and have potential to spur further research into methods adaptive to data-dependent parameters.
The strengths of the paper include its ability to achieve a convergence rate of O(eps^(theta-1)) under certain conditions and its provision of experimental results comparing to other first-order methods. However, the impact of the paper could be stronger if it considered computational complexity for ERM problems and focused on representative performance, rather than reporting the best performance among arbitrary settings.
In terms of clarity and presentation, the paper could be improved, particularly in the sketch of Thm 5 and the explanation of the induction. Some minor errors, such as typos, should also be corrected.
