This paper proposes an interesting idea that sparse and diverse features learned by Region Ranking SVM (RRSVM) can predict visual saliency. The authors incorporate the biologically plausible mechanism of Inhibition of Return into RRSVM, which imposes diversity on the selected regions. The paper is well-organized and well-written, and the experiments are designed to test the hypothesis that these mechanisms of sparsity and diversity relate to visual attention.
The strengths of the paper include its ability to achieve state-of-the-art results in predicting the locations of human gaze fixations, even though the model is trained only on image-level labels without object location annotations. The authors also provide a thorough analysis of the results, including a comparison with other methods and an examination of the center bias effect.
However, there are some weaknesses to the paper. One major concern is the lack of significant evidence to prove the proposed method's superiority over the simple center bias model. The authors acknowledge this issue and attempt to address it by using the shuffled AUC criterion and comparing the priority maps produced by SDR and Center Bias. However, more work is needed to fully address this concern.
To strengthen the paper, the authors should consider using the shuffled AUC criterion for performance comparison to handle center bias and compare their method with existing methods, such as those from references [R3] and [R4]. Additionally, the authors could improve their criterion by comparing selected region positions directly with eye fixation points using the metric introduced in [R5]. This would provide stronger evidence for the proposed method's effectiveness.
Overall, the paper presents an interesting idea and provides some promising results, but more work is needed to fully establish the proposed method's superiority over other approaches. The authors should address the concerns mentioned above and provide more comprehensive comparisons with existing methods to strengthen the paper.
