This paper proposes a novel homotopy smoothing (HOPS) algorithm for solving a family of non-smooth optimization problems. The algorithm achieves a lower iteration complexity of Õ(1/ 1−θ) with θ ∈ (0, 1] under a mild local error bound condition. The paper is well-structured and provides a clear overview of the problem, related work, and the proposed algorithm.
The idea of using a homotopy strategy to improve the convergence rate of the smoothing algorithm is interesting and novel. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the algorithm and establish its theoretical guarantee on the iteration complexity. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of HOPS in comparison with state-of-the-art algorithms.
However, there are some areas that need improvement. The paper could benefit from more detailed explanations of the local error bound condition and its relationship to other types of conditions. Additionally, the authors could provide more insights into the choice of the smoothing parameter and the number of iterations per stage.
The clarity of the paper is generally good, but there are some minor issues. For example, the notation could be more consistent throughout the paper, and some of the equations could be formatted more clearly.
In terms of originality, the paper proposes a new algorithm and provides a novel analysis of its convergence rate. The authors also provide a thorough review of related work and demonstrate the effectiveness of their algorithm in comparison with existing methods.
The significance of the paper lies in its ability to provide a faster convergence rate for a family of non-smooth optimization problems. The algorithm has the potential to be applied to a wide range of problems in machine learning, statistics, and other fields.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper with minor revisions. The authors should address the minor issues mentioned above and provide more detailed explanations of the local error bound condition and its relationship to other types of conditions.
