This paper proposes a novel approach to estimating class priors in a positive and unlabeled setting, accounting for false positives and utilizing a non-traditional classifier to transform data to a single dimension. The authors claim to be the first to address this variant of learning from positive and unlabeled data, but a review of prior work reveals that similar approaches have been explored in the past, contradicting this claim. 
The paper's technical soundness is demonstrated through benchmarks, which show promising results. However, the use of a non-traditional classifier raises questions about its potential for overfitting or underfitting, and the authors could provide more practical details on hyperparameter optimization and cross-validation setup. Additionally, the use of regression datasets in the benchmark is questionable, and replacing them with other classification problems could make the evaluation more relevant.
The manuscript is well-written and easy to follow, with useful insights from theorem 1 and 2. However, the proofs are involved and heavy on notation, which may hinder understanding for some readers. The paper's originality is somewhat diminished by the existence of prior work, but the combination of techniques and the focus on high-dimensional data with noise in the positive labels is a notable contribution.
The significance of the results is evident, as the paper addresses a difficult problem in a better way than previous research. The proposed algorithms have the potential to be widely used in practice, and the theoretical development provides a solid foundation for future work. 
Arguments pro acceptance include the paper's technical soundness, clarity, and significance, as well as its potential to advance the state of the art in classification algorithms for positive-unlabeled data. Arguments con acceptance include the lack of originality due to prior work, the need for more practical details on the non-traditional classifier, and the questionable use of regression datasets in the benchmark. Overall, the paper is a good scientific contribution to the field, and with some revisions to address the mentioned concerns, it has the potential to be a strong addition to the conference program.
