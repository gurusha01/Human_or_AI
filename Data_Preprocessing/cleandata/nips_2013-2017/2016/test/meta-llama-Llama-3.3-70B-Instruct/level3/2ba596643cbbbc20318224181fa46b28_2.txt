This paper proposes a novel framework for clustering graphs without assuming that the data comes from a specific model, providing "correctness" guarantees based on the statistics of the data. The authors introduce a Generic Theorem that establishes conditions under which a clustering can be considered "correct" and provide instantiations of this theorem for the Stochastic Block Model (SBM) and Preference Frame Model (PFM). The paper is well-written, and the theoretical contributions are significant, with nice insights and solid proofs.
The strengths of the paper include its ability to provide model-free guarantees for clustering, which is a unique contribution to the field. The authors also demonstrate how their framework can be used to obtain model-free guarantees for existing model-based clustering algorithms, such as spectral clustering. The experimental evaluation is thorough, and the results are promising, showing that the proposed framework can provide stable clustering guarantees for various datasets.
However, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement. The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the practical applicability of the algorithm and the limitations of the framework. Additionally, the use of up-to-a-multiplicative-constant signs in the paper can be misleading, and using exact inequalities could improve clarity. The supplementary materials contain typos and errors that need to be corrected to improve readability.
