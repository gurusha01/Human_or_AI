This paper presents a novel approach to predicting human gaze fixations during visual search tasks by incorporating a simple diversity mechanism into the Region Ranking SVM (RRSVM) model. The resulting model, called Sparse Diverse Regions (SDR), achieves state-of-the-art results in predicting human gaze fixations, outperforming other methods that rely on object detectors and annotated bounding boxes. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of SDR in three different visual search tasks: single-target present, target absent, and multiple-targets present.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the RRSVM model and its extension to SDR. The experimental results are thorough and well-presented, with a detailed analysis of the performance of SDR compared to other methods. The authors also provide a thoughtful discussion of the limitations of their approach and potential directions for future work.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to bridge the gap between computer vision and cognitive science, demonstrating how computational models can be used to understand human visual attention. The authors provide a compelling argument for the importance of incorporating attention mechanisms into computer vision models, and their results show that this can lead to significant improvements in performance.
However, there are a few areas where the paper could be improved. Firstly, the authors could provide more information on the regions searched by RRSVM, including their size, number, and dimensionality reduction achieved by the SDR region selection function. This would help to provide a better understanding of how the model is working and why it is effective.
Additionally, the authors could consider calculating the split-half AUC for human data to determine if the models' performance exceeds human capabilities. This would provide a more robust evaluation of the model's performance and help to establish its validity.
The use of AUC as a metric for fixation prediction is also questionable, and the authors could consider using alternative metrics such as log-likelihood of human data under the priority map. This would provide a more nuanced understanding of the model's performance and its ability to capture the underlying mechanisms of human visual attention.
Finally, the writing in section 2 is similar to another paper, and the authors could revise the language to be more distinctive and original. This would help to improve the overall clarity and readability of the paper.
Overall, this is a strong paper that makes a significant contribution to the field of computer vision and cognitive science. With some revisions to address the areas mentioned above, it has the potential to be an excellent paper that advances our understanding of human visual attention and its relationship to computational models.
