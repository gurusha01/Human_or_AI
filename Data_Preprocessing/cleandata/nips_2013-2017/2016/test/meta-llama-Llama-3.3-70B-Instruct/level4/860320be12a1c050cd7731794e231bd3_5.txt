This manuscript presents an in-depth examination of the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture, introducing key metrics such as recurrent depth (dr), feedforward depth (df), and skip coefficient (s). The authors conduct a comprehensive comparison of various RNN variants across these metrics on five benchmark datasets and tasks. The paper aims to establish theoretical and quantitative guidelines for RNN design tailored to specific problems, addressing a crucial and challenging topic. The proposed metrics of dr, df, and s appear well-reasoned, and the experimental approach to comparing RNN variants is thorough. However, the presentation is overly complex, making the paper difficult to follow. Despite the simplicity of the underlying concepts, the text is laden with symbols and definitions that often appear without prior explanation or definition, such as the introduction of "s" in Figure 1's caption on Page 3, which is only defined later on Page 5. This necessitates manual searches for symbol meanings, hindering the reading experience. I strongly advise the authors to streamline the paper by eliminating unnecessary symbols and using clear, straightforward language. Including a table at the beginning to summarize key symbols and their meanings would be beneficial. Additionally, relocating certain definitions and lemmas to supplementary materials could significantly enhance the paper's clarity and impact. Several questions regarding the experiments arose: 1. The performance differences among models in Table 1 are minimal (e.g., 1.84 vs. 1.83), prompting questions about the variance in performance of the same model with different initializations. Would repeating the experiment yield contrary conclusions? Furthermore, although BPC is explained in the text, including "Bit-Per-Character" in the caption would improve accessibility for less familiar readers. 2. Table 2 presents conflicting best performance values for MNIST (87.8 in the top-left table vs. 98.1 in the bottom-left table), which seems to result from comparing different models (RNN(tanh) vs. RNN(stanh)). It would be more straightforward to compare RNN(stanh) models with varying s in the top-left table; please clarify this decision. 3. A minor suggestion is to add a vertical line to Figure 2 to distinguish between the left and right sub-figures. In summary, while this paper tackles an interesting and important problem, its current form is unclear and sometimes confusing, necessitating further refinement to meet NIPS acceptance standards.
