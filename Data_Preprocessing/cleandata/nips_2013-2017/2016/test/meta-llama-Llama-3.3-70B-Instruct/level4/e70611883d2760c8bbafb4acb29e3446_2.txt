The authors introduce a novel supervised kernel learning approach utilizing random features, which originates from a kernel alignment problem and is substantiated by thorough theoretical examinations. They provide empirical results that demonstrate the method's efficacy. The technical aspects of the contribution are robust, and the presentation is well-organized and easy to follow. Although the empirical evaluation is extensive and covers a wide range of scenarios, there is still potential for enhancement. To further solidify the proposed method's advantages, it would be beneficial to compare it with established techniques, such as multiple kernel learning (MKL) that employs a linear combination of numerous Gaussians with varying parameters, or other kernel learning methods. Additionally, incorporating a baseline that utilizes a Gaussian kernel with a bandwidth optimized through model selection techniques, such as cross-validation, would strengthen the argument in favor of the proposed approach.
