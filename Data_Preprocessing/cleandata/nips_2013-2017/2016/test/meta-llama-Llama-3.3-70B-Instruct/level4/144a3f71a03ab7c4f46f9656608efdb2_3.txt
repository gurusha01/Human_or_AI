This paper presents an efficient approach to incorporating ancestral constraints into the discovery of optimal Bayesian networks from data. By translating a set of ancestral constraints into a maximal set of ordering constraints, the authors utilize a score-based learning algorithm based on the EC tree, as introduced by Chen et al. in 2015. The results are compared to a modified version of the ILP-based Gobnilp algorithm, demonstrating significant outperformance in the given setting. The paper is reasonably well-written and clearly explained, although the solution is conceptually straightforward. The problem addressed is novel and of interest to a specialist audience, as optimal BN learning with ancestral constraints lacks a standard solution, earning a novelty score of 3. However, the setting is somewhat artificial, as ancestral relations often call for more general causal discovery algorithms that account for unobserved confounders, resulting in an impact score of 2. 
The approach involves translating hard-to-use ancestral constraints into sets of ordering constraints that can be more easily expressed in terms of absent edges, fitting decomposable scores. A MaxSAT solver ensures that all implied ancestral constraints are made explicit. Nevertheless, some rules, such as those in lines 257-261, appear incomplete or strange. For instance, the premise in acyclicity rule 3 is symmetric, but the conclusion is not, and rule 4 seems to exclude certain types of ancestral constraints. Additionally, in practice, only a few ancestral constraints are typically given, which may not significantly reduce the search space. 
The comparison to Gobnilp with added linear constraints appears impressive, but Gobnilp is not designed to tackle this specific problem. A more meaningful alternative would be to compare the performance to a greedy algorithm like GES, assuming the ancestral constraints align with the optimal model. This would provide a better indication of the method's efficiency, as greedy algorithms cannot guarantee optimality but can offer a more relevant comparison. 
Minor details include the distinction between a standard oracle and an omniscient oracle (line 30), the clarification of "empower the oracle" (line 38), and the mention of optimizing as minimizing (line 90). Furthermore, Theorem 1 should clearly state that the indicated set of constraints satisfied by CPDAG P on the EC tree is a subset of the constraints satisfied by the full DAG G. Theorem 3 seems unlikely to lead to many positive edge implications given sparse ancestral constraints, and the notation in line 267 is not easily recognizable as capturing 'acyclic'. Finally, for reasonable-sized graphs, 10%-25% ancestral constraints would already imply extensive knowledge of the target graph, which is not typical in practice.
