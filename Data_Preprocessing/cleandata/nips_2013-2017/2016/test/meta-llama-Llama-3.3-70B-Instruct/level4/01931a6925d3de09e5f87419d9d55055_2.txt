This concise paper presents a significant extension of the traditional multivariate normal density by substituting the Euclidean metric with a locally adaptive Riemannian metric, yielding a generalized normal distribution tailored to manifold learning with broad applicability, as demonstrated by the experimental results. Notably, it provides a concise and comprehensive overview of a maximum likelihood-based parameter estimation procedure. The introduction of a mixture of LANDS enhances its practicality, positioning it as a viable alternative to the commonly used Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). The reported experiments are intriguing and pave the way for extensive future research. The language, structure, bibliography, and relevance to the NIPS scope are all of high quality.
