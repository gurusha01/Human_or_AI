The manuscript examines a non-smooth optimization problem characterized by a composite objective function, where the first component exhibits an explicit max structure. By integrating Nesterov's smoothing technique with acceleration and leveraging Yang and Lin's recent findings [23], the authors propose a homotopy-based method that achieves a convergence rate potentially surpassing O(1/ε). The actual convergence rate is contingent upon the error bound parameter θ, and the paper provides illustrative examples of functions that satisfy this error bound condition. The manuscript is well-structured and readable, employing familiar concepts and proof techniques from convex optimization in an elegant manner. This presentation appears to yield the first analysis of Nesterov smoothing and acceleration that achieves a faster convergence rate than O(1/ε) for non-smooth functions, relying on the local error bound property. The authors establish connections between this class of functions and other properties commonly studied in convex optimization, including local strong convexity and the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz property. However, a more in-depth discussion of these connections and comparisons with related works, such as [1,2], would be beneficial. A concern arises regarding the impact of knowing the constants c and θ on the algorithm's performance, as prior knowledge of these constants seems crucial for its application. The authors should elaborate on how these constants can be estimated or in which scenarios it is reasonable to assume knowledge of them. The discussion in Section 4.4 regarding the primal-dual version of the algorithm addressing this issue is not convincing and warrants significant expansion. Additional considerations for the authors include: 
- Clarifying the comment on line 75 by referencing Definition 4 and the subsequent remark to address ambiguity.
- Acknowledging the inspiration of the proofs from [23].
- Justifying the non-standard notation for the dual norm.
- Enhancing Equation (11) by repositioning the quantifier.
- Discussing the dimension independence of the constant c in practical applications.
- Correcting the statement on line 231, as the minimum of F(x) is a scalar and does not have an epigraph.
- Revising the example on lines 240-242, as the function may not necessarily be locally strongly convex, and considering whether it satisfies condition (10) instead.
- Defining the term "o-minimal structure" on line 252.
