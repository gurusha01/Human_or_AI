This paper explores a novel multi-armed bandit setting, where a learner can choose to play an arm at one of $M$ available fidelities. Each higher fidelity offers a more accurate approximation of the rewards but incurs a greater cost. By leveraging lower, cheaper fidelities to eliminate suboptimal arms and reserving higher, more expensive fidelities for a subset of promising arms, a strategy may outperform the standard UCB algorithm, which neglects these fidelity characteristics. This setting has potential applications in online advertising, where displaying ads for a short duration can approximate long-term click-through rates while minimizing costs. The authors propose a new regret definition, develop an algorithm with accompanying theoretical analysis (including a regret lower bound), and conduct simulations. The analysis presents novel insights. However, it assumes prior knowledge of each $\varepsilon^{(m)}$, the deviation of the $m$th fidelity mean from the highest fidelity mean. A critical question arises: how can these values be determined in practice, such as in online advertising applications? Is it possible to relax this assumption? Several minor corrections are also suggested: 
1) In lines 326, 357, and 386, "arm $k \in H^{(m)}$" should be corrected to "arm $k \in K^{(m)}$".
2) In line 343, the argument "$\Beta{k^\ast,t} \leq s$" should be corrected to "$\Beta{k^\ast,t} \leq \mu_{\ast}$".
3) In line 345, $\gamma$ should be specified as $\gamma^{(m)}$.
4) In lines 346-347, the inequalities should be corrected to use "$\geq$" instead of "$\leq$".
5) In line 384, the summation over $k$ should be corrected to sum over all $k$ "below" $K^{(m)}$ instead of "above".
6) In line 407, $\delta^{(m)}$ should be corrected to $\delta^{(M)}$, and the term $\mu_{\ast} \kappa \lambda^{(m)}$ should be corrected to $\kappa \lambda^{(m)}$.
7) In line 431, the condition "$l \ge m$" should be corrected to "$l \ge p$".
8) In line 440, equation (17) should be corrected to use "$l \geq p$" instead of "$l \geq m$".
9) In line 450, $P(A{n,3})$ should be corrected to $P(A{n,2})$.
