A Bayesian classification method is presented for estimating positive-only labels, which is particularly well-suited for noisy applications. The authors provide theoretical results that demonstrate key properties of their approach, and conduct empirical studies to support their claims. The theoretical analysis of the problem setup is thorough and well-tailored, appearing to be correct, although a line-by-line verification of the proofs was not feasible due to time constraints. However, the univariate transformation section lacks innovation and may not be ideal for handling large datasets, as it is unclear how much information is lost through this approach, making it challenging to justify to practitioners. The authors assert that their method is robust to noise and effective for high-dimensional data, with theoretical justifications and empirical results in Table 2 supporting this claim, although the comparisons are inconsistent and potentially saturated with noise. The proposed technique performs well, winning 19 out of 36 times and being significant 12 times, but is also significantly outperformed 11 times. The authors are commendable for presenting both dominant and non-dominant results, and for providing appropriate comparisons to other works. Overall, the approach appears to be a reliable choice. Nevertheless, a significant weakness of the paper is the lack of practical evaluation of the algorithm's scalability with respect to the number of samples, such as the computational time required for the Shuttle data. The authors acknowledge susceptibility to the curse of dimensionality, but a more detailed analysis of this issue is expected, and its absence from the paper is notable, particularly given the claims made about this property.
