This manuscript presents a novel perspective on parameter-free algorithms, revealing their inherent characteristic as coin-betting with maximal reward. The approach commences with a betting algorithm utilizing the Krichevsky-Trofimov estimator and a coin-betting potential function, subsequently extending to online learning optimization in Hilbert Space and learning from expert advice. The proposed algorithm's efficacy is validated through experiments on real-world datasets. The paper offers a fresh insight into parameter-free algorithms, conceptualizing them as coin-betting with maximal reward, which in turn enables the development of new algorithms for online convex optimization and learning with experts. The manuscript is well-structured, allowing readers to easily comprehend the content. Overall, this work is comprehensive and contributes novel interpretations to the field.
