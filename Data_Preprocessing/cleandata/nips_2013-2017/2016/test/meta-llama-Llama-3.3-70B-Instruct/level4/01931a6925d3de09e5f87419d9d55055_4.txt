This paper introduces the Locally Adaptive Normal Distribution as a potential alternative to Gaussian Mixture Models, leveraging Riemannian Manifolds as its foundation. The authors develop a Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) estimator for the distribution's parameters and assess its performance through experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets. The manuscript is well-structured, exhibiting robust theoretical underpinnings and thorough experimental analysis. Nevertheless, in comparison to the work by Simo-Serra et al. [19], the novelty of the proposed approach appears somewhat limited. A significant oversight is the lack of clear differentiation between the proposed method and current state-of-the-art techniques from the outset, with the introduction failing to reference [19] and thereby not adequately contextualizing the contributions of this work until the conclusion.
