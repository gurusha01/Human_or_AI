The authors present a methodology for estimating energy consumption in residential settings, leveraging an additive factorial hidden Markov model-based system. Notably, they introduce an additional constraint to the objective function, enabling the model to account for abrupt changes in power consumption levels, thus enhancing upon prior implementations. This paper offers a compelling and technically robust approach to addressing the critical issue of energy consumption management. Initially, I was impressed by the study's novelty, a sentiment reinforced by reviewer comments and author feedback. However, a key concern, also raised by other reviewers, pertains to the necessity of a comprehensive analysis on the computational complexity of the proposed method. Although the authors address this in their rebuttal, I firmly believe that a detailed examination should be incorporated into the paper's final version, given the problem's complexity. Ultimately, due to the paper's technical nature, I think a poster presentation would be a more suitable format for showcasing this work.
