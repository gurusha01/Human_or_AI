The formulation presented by Rahimi and Recht [21] for binary classification problems has been modified and extended in equation (6), where the incorporation of \(\hat{q}\) distinguishes it from equation (5). Notably, \(\hat{q}\) is derived as a solution to equation (4), which itself addresses a binary classification problem, albeit without the inclusion of a regularizer. While the modifications introduced here do not significantly deviate from the original approach by Rahimi and Recht [21], they yield an improvement in generalization error compared to [21]. Furthermore, the computational efficiency of the proposed method is comparable. Overall, the introduced modification proves to be useful, offering enhanced performance without compromising computational speed.
