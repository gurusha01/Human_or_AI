This paper establishes a connection between various clustering distances, focusing on network models such as the Preference Frame Model (PFM) and Stochastic Block Model (SBM), and demonstrates a locally convex-like property for clustering. It is proven that any two clusterings that equally accurately estimate the parameters of the model fitted to the network data are also proximal in terms of misclassification distance measures. The paper presents an interesting property of clusterings in network data, specifically the equivalence between different clustering distance measures. Both theoretical and experimental validations are provided to support the paper's claims. Although the results are novel, similar research has recently emerged in the network literature, such as the works of Peng, Sun, and Zanetti (COLT, 2015) and Chao, Lu, Ma, and Zhou (Arxiv, 2015). The theoretical components of the paper are straightforward extensions of established results. While the paper mentions potential applications in detecting clusterability, formal results in this regard are not included. The paper is well-structured and effectively conveys its core concepts in a clear and concise manner.
