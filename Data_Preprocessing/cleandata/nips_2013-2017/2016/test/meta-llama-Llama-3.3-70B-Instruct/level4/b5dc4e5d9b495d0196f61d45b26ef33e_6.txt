The authors present a novel optimization algorithm leveraging homotopy smoothing, which achieves an epsilon gap towards the optimal objective value in O(1/eps^(1-\theta)  log(1/eps)) iterations. However, upon reviewing the existing literature, it appears that most of the results in this paper are either already established or represent straightforward extensions of known findings. For instance, Zhang et al. (2012) demonstrated that for sigma-strongly convex functions, an iteration complexity of O(eps^{-1/2}  sigma^{-1}) can be attained. Furthermore, the analysis by Zhang et al. (2012) can be naturally extended to locally strongly convex optimization, yielding a result identical to that presented in this paper on Line 237 of Page 7, as seen in their work "Smoothing Multivariate Performance Measures" (JMLR, http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume13/zhang12d/zhang12d.pdf). Additionally, the KL condition mentioned on Line 243 of Page 7 is equivalent to the Polyak-Lojasiewicz or gradient-dominated condition, which has been utilized in numerous papers to relax strong convexity. To strengthen their contribution, I recommend that the authors provide more substantive justifications for the significance and novelty of their proposed algorithm.
