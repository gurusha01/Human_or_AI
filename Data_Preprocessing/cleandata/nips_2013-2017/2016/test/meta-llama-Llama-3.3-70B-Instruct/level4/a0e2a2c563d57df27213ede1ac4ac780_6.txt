This manuscript presents a novel approach that adapts the Region Ranking SVM to create a visually attentive model with biological plausibility. The Region Ranking SVM's focus on a limited number of non-uniform regions in visual space for classification suggests that these areas are most relevant for saliency detection. By selecting a fixation order based on the RRSVM and incorporating an inhibition of return mechanism, the model enables visual search to prioritize attention to crucial areas while reducing the likelihood of revisiting nearby regions that have already been attended to. The results demonstrate behavior consistent with physiological observations, as well as performance comparable to or surpassing that of similar techniques. The authors also provide a nuanced discussion of the algorithm's limitations, which is essential for understanding the strengths and weaknesses of this work and laying the groundwork for future research. The paper is well-structured, and the experiments are comprehensive, well-designed, and clearly explained. In terms of originality, while the RRSVM is the primary driver of this work, the incorporation of inhibition of return and the positioning of the research within a physiological context (including the results) enhance the value of the study. A potential limitation of the RRSVM's implementation is its lack of biological plausibility, which may have hindered a more in-depth investigation of the entire framework for a deeper understanding of biological visual search. Nevertheless, considering the conceptual framework and experimental methodology/results in isolation, this work contributes meaningfully to our understanding of biological visual attention, providing valuable insights that can inform future studies.
