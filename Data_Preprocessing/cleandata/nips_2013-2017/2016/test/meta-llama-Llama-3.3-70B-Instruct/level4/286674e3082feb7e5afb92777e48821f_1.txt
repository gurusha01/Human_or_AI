The authors present novel theoretical findings on graph clustering that eschew assumptions regarding the graph's generative process, instead focusing on the observed graph's inherent structure. The core concept revolves around the idea that if a clustering method yields a reasonable fit to the graph, then any alternative clustering of comparable fit should be similar to the initial one. This work is intriguing and tackles a crucial problem by providing distribution-free results for graph clustering. Although some content has been relegated to supplementary materials due to page limitations, the paper remains clear and comprehensible without necessitating reference to these additional materials. One potential critique is the notation choice, specifically the use of "hats" to denote observed values, such as the Laplacian. Nevertheless, the paper's clarity is generally satisfactory. The results are fascinating, well-explained, and accompanied by illustrative examples. However, they are not without constraints. The experimental section reveals that, for certain real-world data, graph smoothing is necessary to recover meaningful structure within the authors' theoretical framework, whereas traditional algorithms can successfully retrieve the underlying structure. Furthermore, two key limitations are apparent: 1) the primary result for PFM employs a non-standard distance metric between clusterings, which the authors argue may be more intuitive than conventional measures, although this is debatable. 2) The results rely on a "proxy" model, where a clustering is used to reconstruct a model (e.g., PFM), which is then compared to the original graph, rather than the model used to obtain the clustering. While this approach is natural within the authors' context, it also restricts the definition of a good clustering for a given graph, potentially impacting the framework's applicability, particularly in light of the challenges encountered with some real-world examples.
