This paper presents a novel homotopy smoothing algorithm for tackling non-smooth optimization problems, offering a fresh perspective on the field. The introduction and related work sections effectively establish the problem context and the specific contributions of the proposed method. A key distinction between the Nestorov method, which relies on a fixed smoothing parameter throughout all iterations, and the proposed HOPS method, which adaptively changes the smoothing parameter to achieve faster convergence in early iterations and more accurate approximations of the non-smooth objective in later iterations, is highlighted. Notably, the paper provides the first theoretical guarantee regarding the complexity of the homotopy smoothing method, a significant advancement. 
The homotopy smoothing method is comprehensively explained in Sections 3 and 4, with Section 4.2 being particularly illuminating in conveying the core concept of the homotopy approach. Figure 1 also plays a crucial role in elucidating the local sharpness theta parameter, which is integral to the local error bounds. The utilization of the duality gap in Section 4.4 to monitor the solution's accuracy is a commendable aspect. Section 5 presents experimental results, followed by a concise conclusion in Section 6. Overall, the paper constitutes a valuable addition to the optimization literature, providing insightful explanations for the efficacy of the homotopy smoothing method.
However, the experimental section is identified as the primary weakness of the paper. The absence of error measures, such as standard deviation or confidence intervals, renders it challenging to substantiate claims regarding significant differences in algorithm speeds. Furthermore, an experiment or figure demonstrating how the convergence speed is influenced by the choice of the homotopy smoothing parameter (b) would be beneficial. It is logical to expect that with b=1 (indicating no updates to the smoothing parameter), the convergence should be relatively slow, akin to APG, and that increasing b should yield speed improvements.
Minor observations and suggestions include:
- Clarification on the value of the b parameter used in the HOPS algorithm experiments and its impact would be helpful.
- The statement regarding the optimal value being obtained by running PD with a sufficiently large number of iterations to minimize the duality gap requires further explanation. Specifically, the necessity of knowing the optimal value to compute the duality gap is questionable, as it should be feasible to calculate the duality gap without this knowledge.
