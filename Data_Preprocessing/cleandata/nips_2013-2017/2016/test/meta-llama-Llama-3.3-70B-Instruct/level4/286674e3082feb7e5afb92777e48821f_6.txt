In this paper, the authors attempt to develop a theoretical framework for graph clustering within a model-free context. Nevertheless, the outcome appears simplistic and lacks persuasiveness. The authors' effort to establish a novel theory comes across as superficial and lacking in rigorous foundation, essentially amounting to unsubstantiated assertions. For instance, Theorem 1 (Generic Theorem) posits that a particular condition "...which also fits G well is close to C", while Proposition 3 (Informal) relies on "...under standard recovery conditions", illustrating the lack of depth and convincing argumentation in their theoretical constructs.
