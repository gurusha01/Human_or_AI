This manuscript introduces a novel, intuitive framework for designing parameter-free algorithms by reducing the problem to betting on the outcomes of an adversarial coin, thereby providing a new perspective on parameter-free algorithms as coin-betting algorithms. This interpretation not only uncovers the underlying common structure among existing parameter-free algorithms but also facilitates the development of new algorithms. The authors support their theory with empirical evaluations. The key strengths of this paper include: 1. The proposal of an innovative framework for designing parameter-free algorithms, characterized by its simplicity and lack of tunable parameters. 2. The demonstration, both theoretically and experimentally, that the proposed algorithm either surpasses or equals the performance of previous algorithms in terms of regret guarantee and per-round complexity.
