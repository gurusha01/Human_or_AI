This manuscript proposes that the sparse and diverse features extracted by RRSVM can also predict visual saliency, and experiments were conducted to validate this hypothesis. The idea that RRSVM's features, initially learned for classification, can predict visual saliency is intriguing and warrants further exploration. The paper is well-structured and clearly written. However, a significant limitation is the lack of substantial evidence demonstrating the superiority of the proposed method over the simple center bias model. To strengthen the paper, the following experiments and comparisons are recommended: 
1. Utilizing the shuffled AUC (sAUC) criterion, as described in [R1, R2], for performance comparison, which is specifically designed to address center bias.
2. Comparing the proposed method with those presented in [R3, R4] could provide more robust evidence.
3. An alternative approach to enhance the evaluation criterion is to directly compare the positions of selected regions with eye fixation points using the metric introduced in [R5].
