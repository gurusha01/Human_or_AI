This manuscript introduces a novel optimization approach, leveraging a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to learn optimal parameter updates at each iteration, thereby replacing traditional hand-crafted update rules such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and RMSProp. By adopting a learned update rule, the proposed LSTM optimizer outperforms conventional optimizers on a range of tasks, including quadratic functions, MNIST, and Neural Art. The learning curve exhibits significantly improved results compared to traditional methods, making this a groundbreaking optimizing technique. The paper is well-structured and engaging, with clear explanations that facilitate easy comprehension. However, several questions arise that the authors may wish to address: 
1. What are the computational costs associated with implementing the LSTM optimizer, considering that the learned update rule entails more complex calculations than SGD, potentially leading to increased training time?
2. While the authors provide loss values over iterations in the results section, it would be beneficial to include the final accuracy to offer a more comprehensive understanding of the optimizer's performance.
3. Given that the experimental results are primarily based on relatively simple tasks, it is essential to investigate the generalizability of this method to more complex deep networks, such as ResNet, on large-scale datasets, and to discuss potential challenges in training such models using the proposed optimizer.
