This manuscript investigates the problem of energy disaggregation load monitoring, formulating it as an integer quadratic programming optimization problem and applying standard SDP relaxation and randomized rounding techniques. While the theoretical contributions of this paper are somewhat incremental, my primary concerns lie with the experimental study: (1) Given that the real dataset (REDD) utilized in this study is identical to that employed by Kolter & Johnson (KJ), a comparison of the experimental results reveals a discrepancy. The precision and recall reported in KJ (averaging 87.2% and 60.3% across 7 appliances) surpass those of the proposed algorithm in this paper (as presented in Table 1), which seems unusual and suggests potential issues with one of the results. (2) The experimental study lacks a comparison of running times, which is essential considering the paper's objective of developing a scalable and computationally efficient method, as stated in the introduction. Without knowledge of the tested dataset's size, it is unclear why directly solving SDP is infeasible in this context. Regarding related work (introduction, second paragraph), several papers published after 2012 (e.g., Zhong et al., 2014) are mentioned, making it necessary to clarify why KJ is considered the state-of-the-art. Minor issues include: -- Line 75, the meaning of \(I{s{t,i}} = s\) is unclear. -- The title of Section 6, "Synthetic Data Set," could be improved for clarity.
