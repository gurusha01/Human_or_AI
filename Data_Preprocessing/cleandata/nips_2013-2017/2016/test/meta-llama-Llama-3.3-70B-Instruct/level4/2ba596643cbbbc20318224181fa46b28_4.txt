The authors introduce a novel framework known as Multi-fidelity Multi-armed Bandit, where arms can be sampled at varying levels of fidelity, each associated with a specific cost. Lower-cost, low-fidelity samples are drawn from a distribution that approximates the highest fidelity distribution. The authors propose an algorithm that adapts to sequences of available approximations and costs, providing regret analysis and a lower bound for the problem. Numerical simulations on synthetic problems demonstrate the proposed algorithm's superiority over UCB. Although the framework is intriguing and has potential for impact with further development, its current state renders it unsuitable for publication. Several concerns arise: 
1. The introduction of notations is confusing due to their dispersed nature, making definitions difficult to locate. For instance, the definition of $s$ is not found until a page after its initial use and is subsequently underutilized throughout the paper.
2. The use of advertising as an example is misleading in certain contexts, particularly when correlations are made between display time and non-stationarity, which is outside the paper's scope. Considering an alternative example might be beneficial (as suggested in point 4).
3. Justifying the regret analysis in this context is challenging. Typically, regret analysis involves maximizing long-term gain and identifying the arm with the optimal reward-to-cost ratio. However, the optimal policy here always favors the arm with the highest mean, regardless of associated costs, potentially obscuring the costs of unnecessary low-fidelity sampling.
4. Conducting a sample complexity analysis (or cost complexity analysis in this case) could be valuable in the context of Multi-fidelity Multi-armed Bandits. This could be motivated by the product testing phase in new product development, where the goal is to identify the best product with high probability while minimizing testing costs before mass production. Companies often rely on low-fidelity approximations due to regulatory, contractual, and facility constraints before accessing advanced and costly tests.
5. Certain parts of the text are cumbersome and could benefit from revision to enhance clarity and flow. Refining the paper to make it more concise and readable would be advantageous.
