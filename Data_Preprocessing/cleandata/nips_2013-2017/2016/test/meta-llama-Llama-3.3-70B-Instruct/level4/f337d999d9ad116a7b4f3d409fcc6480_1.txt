This manuscript proposes a novel structured regression framework for inferring neural connections from viral tracing data, integrating a non-negativity constraint, spatial smoothness regularization, low-rank assumption, and an injection site ambiguity mask. The model, built upon a non-negative linear regression foundation, effectively leverages observed tracer data to deduce underlying connectivity patterns. Although the individual model components have been explored in other structured regression contexts, this work presents a comprehensive and skillfully executed application to a compelling problem. The underlying model, y = Wx + η, where η follows a spherical Gaussian distribution, assumes a non-negative weight matrix W, drawn from a spatially smooth prior. Optionally, incorporating a low-rank assumption into the weight model can significantly enhance memory efficiency for large-scale problems. While the model's components, including non-negative regression and low-rank constraints, are well-established, their combination and application to a real-world scientific problem are noteworthy. The model presentation, synthetic examples, and real-world applications, including supplementary materials, are exceptionally clear. However, considering a probabilistic perspective could reveal potential extensions and connections to existing research, such as the work by Jonas and Kording, who addressed a similar connectomics problem using a probabilistic generative model with latent variables. Adopting a similar approach could provide a prior for the weight matrix. Additionally, the Gaussian noise model and spherical covariance assumption may not accurately reflect the non-negativity of fluorescence observations, and discussing these simplifications would be beneficial. The use of the orthogonal projector PΩ appears to be a complex way to describe summing the loss function over observable voxels. Minor suggestions include improving the legibility of Figure 3's labels. Overall, the work presents a valuable contribution to the field, and addressing these points could further enhance its impact.
