This manuscript proposes an efficient approximate solution to the energy disaggregation problem for home appliance monitoring, formulated as a binary quadratic program, as given in equation (2). The authors first relax this equation into a convex problem, denoted as (7), by introducing additional variables. This is further relaxed into a semidefinite programming (SDP) problem with continuous variables, resulting in problem (8). To solve this large-scale SDP, they suggest employing a variant of the alternating direction method of multipliers. The binary variables are then recovered through a randomized rounding process. The proposed approach demonstrates superiority over the previous method by Kolter & Jaakkola (2012) in terms of accuracy metrics for load disaggregation solutions. The paper is well-structured, largely self-contained, and easy to follow, representing a substantial contribution to the field. However, the overall organization could be enhanced, as evidenced by the absence of certain subsections, such as 1.2, 3.2, and 4.2, following their respective predecessors. A notable aspect of the paper is the overarching methodology used to address the initial optimization problem, which has the potential to benefit the broader machine learning community. Minor corrections include revising "K" to "K_i" in the indicator function equations 1 and 2 (L75), and adding a period after "yet" before "Kolter" (L189).
