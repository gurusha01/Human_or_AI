This paper builds upon the work of Rahimi and Recht on random features for kernel machines by introducing an efficient optimization technique for kernel learning. The empirical results demonstrate the approach's efficacy. Although the mathematical derivations can be challenging to track in some areas, the crucial components appear to be logically sound. The heuristic aspects of the method clearly impact its efficiency, yet their influence has not been assessed. The performance comparison is limited to the preceding method with three distinct kernels, and it would be beneficial to see how the proposed approach fares against other established efficient methods, given the claim of its broad superiority.
