This manuscript presents a method for transforming non-decomposable ancestral constraints into decomposable constraints, thereby enabling decomposable-score-based structure learning approaches to leverage domain knowledge and enhance learning efficiency. The primary innovation of this work is outlined in section 5, where the authors propose a technique to project non-decomposable ancestral constraints onto edge and topological ordering constraints, which are decomposable. The paper is well-structured and effectively conveys the authors' contributions through both theoretical explanations and experimental results. However, several concerns and suggestions warrant consideration: 
i. The results in Table 3 indicate that projecting ancestral constraints improves the performance of EC trees but not the ILP approach, raising questions about the generalizability of this method to other learning approaches. Given that the main contribution of this paper involves deriving decomposable constraints from non-decomposable ancestral constraints, demonstrating the effectiveness of these constraints in enhancing the performance and efficiency of a learning approach that originally cannot handle non-decomposable constraints would strengthen the argument.
ii. Table 2 exhibits an easy-hard-easy pattern in EC tree performance as the proportion of ancestral constraints increases. This phenomenon suggests that the impact of reducing the EC tree search space with ancestral constraints may be highly sensitive to the amount of incorporated domain knowledge, particularly when compared to the ILP approach. Consequently, careful tuning of the number of ancestral constraints may be necessary to achieve optimal performance.
iii. While Table 2 provides results on the structural Hamming distance for EC trees, a comparison with the ILP approach is lacking. 
iv. A minor suggestion is to reconsider the emphasis on the BN graph in section 4.1, as the experimental section focuses primarily on the application of ancestral constraints to EC trees. Instead, allocating more space to elucidate EC trees and the A* algorithm within the context of EC trees could enhance the clarity and relevance of the presentation.
