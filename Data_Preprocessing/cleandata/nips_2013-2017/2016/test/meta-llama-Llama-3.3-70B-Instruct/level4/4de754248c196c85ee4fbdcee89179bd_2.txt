This paper presents an enhanced optimization approach for additive factorial Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), driven by its potential application in energy disaggregation. A comprehensive comparison with existing baseline methods is conducted using both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating the method's efficacy. The technical aspects of the paper appear to be of high quality. While the overall presentation is clear, a thorough review for grammatical errors is recommended. The work has significant potential for societal impact. However, the originality is somewhat diminished due to the substantial body of existing research in this area. Nonetheless, the experimental results indicate notable advancements over current methods, positioning this work as a considerable improvement upon the state-of-the-art. The authors' rebuttal effectively addresses concerns raised by reviewers regarding the novelty and scalability of their approach, as well as the comparison to the findings of Kolter and Jaakkola (2012), thereby strengthening their proposal.
