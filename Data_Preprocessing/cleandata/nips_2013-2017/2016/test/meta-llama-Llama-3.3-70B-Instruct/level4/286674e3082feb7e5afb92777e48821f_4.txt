This paper proposes a general framework for providing theoretical guarantees on the stability of clustering algorithms, specifically focusing on the distance between two clusterings that fit the data well. The stability is quantified by the distance between the original clustering C and any other clustering C' that also fits the data well. The authors demonstrate the applicability of this framework to two specific block models, namely the PFM and SBM, and show that all relevant quantities can be computed explicitly from the data. Furthermore, the stability results are used to derive exact recovery guarantees for these models.
However, the simulation results suggest that either the chosen goodness-of-fit measure or the conditions of the theorems may render the results less useful in practice. Several concerns arise from the presentation of the results, including the treatment of PFM and SBM as distinct cases, despite PFM encompassing DC-SBM, which in turn includes SBM. The use of different estimators, such as the Laplacian for PFM and the adjacency matrix for SBM, and the presentation of results in terms of weighted ME for PFM and ME for SBM, raises questions about the comparability of these results.
Several technical questions are also raised, including the definition of the term < M', M >F in Proposition 10, and the formulation of Assumption 5, specifically whether it involves ||L^{hat}^2 - L^2||F or ||L^{hat} - L||_F^2. The intuition behind squaring the Laplacians in the former case is not clear.
The paper primarily focuses on disjoint clusters, and it is unclear whether the techniques presented can be extended to other models, such as hierarchical clustering, for which spectral clustering is known to be effective. The evaluation metric and estimators considered are limited to clusterings with the same number of clusters, which may not always be the case in practice.
The related work section appears to be incomplete, omitting several model-free results, such as "Clustering with Spectral Norm and the k-means Algorithm" and "Clustering under Perturbation Resilience". The notion of stability considered in this work and its relation to existing stability measures, such as perturbation of centers for two clusterings, is not clearly discussed.
The simulation results for PFM indicate that very small perturbations can significantly affect the model fit, which may limit the practical usefulness of the guarantees. The conditions for the SBM guarantee appear to be difficult to satisfy, which is unfortunate. Several minor points, including missing axis labels in Figure 1, inconsistent notation, and the potential for reorganizing certain sections, are also noted. Overall, while the paper presents an interesting framework for stability guarantees in clustering, several clarifications and extensions are necessary to fully appreciate its contributions.
