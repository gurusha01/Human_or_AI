The authors propose a methodology that utilizes a set of predefined ancestral constraints to guide the heuristic for an exhaustive search algorithm. However, the experimental design was somewhat perplexing. The comparison in Table 1 between the integration of the new approach with existing methods EC and GOB, denoted as (EC + new work) and (GOB + new work'), was not entirely clear. If interpreted correctly, Table 3 appears to contrast EC and GOB directly, although this interpretation may be incorrect. It would be more intuitive to explicitly compare the performance of (EC + new work) to EC alone, as the relative improvement of GOB with the new work, despite being noteworthy, may not suffice to surpass EC, given its significant superiority over GOB; thus, (EC + new work) would still be the preferable choice even if GOB benefited more substantially from the integration of the new methodology.
