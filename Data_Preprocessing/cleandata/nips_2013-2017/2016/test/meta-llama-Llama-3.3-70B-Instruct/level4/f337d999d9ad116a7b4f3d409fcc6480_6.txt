This manuscript presents a methodology for constructing a connectivity map between voxels of a template brain by leveraging multiple viral injections to trace neuronal anatomy. The utilization of viral approaches in connectomics has experienced significant growth over the past decade, with notable contributions such as the dataset released by the Allen Institute. The authors build upon this foundation by refining the connectivity inference protocol initially proposed. The suggested approach appears reasonable, and the method outlined for inferring connectivity is sound. The results demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses the baseline approach, which assumes homogeneous connectivity within brain regions, thereby representing a relaxation of this baseline assumption. This methodology holds value in elucidating primary connectivity patterns, akin to diffusion MRI. However, the imposition of a smoothness constraint may somewhat undermine the complexity of neuroanatomical structures. Further discussion on the linear model assumption, where fluorescence is presumed to increase linearly with the number of injection sites, would be beneficial. Additionally, clarification on how the composite data from multiple brains is integrated to form a template brain would enhance understanding. It is also recommended to avoid simplistic expressions, such as referencing "the number of voxels in the brain," to ensure precision and accuracy in the presentation.
