This paper addresses the constrained optimization problem of learning Bayesian networks from local scores with ancestral constraints, utilizing a branch-and-bound search approach where the nodes in the search tree are represented by CPDAGs. The search process involves moving from one CPDAG to another by selecting a parent set for a Bayesian network variable not present in the initial CPDAG, incorporating sensible symmetry breaking techniques. The search is further guided by an A* approach, leveraging the URLearning system to provide a heuristic, although the specifics of this integration are not detailed in the paper but can be found in an earlier publication. 
Given the ancestral constraints, the search tree can be pruned based on certain conditions, with Lemma 3 in the supplementary material being a crucial result. However, the proof of Lemma 3 is not entirely clear, particularly the statement regarding the EC tree edge generation rules implying the presence of a specific edge. Additionally, the concept of implied constraints, referred to here as "projected constraints," allows for further pruning by implying constraints on edges based on a set of ancestral constraints. The authors also infer constraints on permissible topological orderings, termed "ordering constraints," although the methodology behind this inference is not fully explained. 
The approach to inferring these ordering constraints involves stating that if one variable is not an ancestor of another, one can choose to add a constraint specifying their order. This process aims to infer as many consistent ordering constraints as possible without over-constraining, using a MAXSAT approach for the inference. Experimental evaluations are conducted, varying the number of variables, data points, and ancestral constraints, and comparing the performance with the GOBNILP system. The results show the current system to be significantly faster than GOBNILP. 
However, it's noted that GOBNILP's performance issues might stem from its general difficulty in handling a large number of parent sets rather than specifically from dealing with ancestral constraints. Furthermore, the encoding of ancestral constraints in the comparison is based on a MAXSAT formulation from an earlier work, which might not be the most efficient for an ILP system like GOBNILP. A potentially more effective formulation could involve using binary variables to represent ancestral relationships directly, along with constraints linking these variables to the existing formulation, potentially leading to a tighter linear relaxation and better performance. 
The paper would be strengthened by comparing against a more sensible formulation of ancestral constraints for GOBNILP or by including a comparison with other relevant methods, such as the approach by van Beek and Hoffmann, which has been shown to outperform GOBNILP in some cases and could potentially be adapted to accommodate ancestral constraints. The omission of such comparisons and the use of a potentially suboptimal formulation for GOBNILP weaken the paper's conclusions regarding its relative performance.
