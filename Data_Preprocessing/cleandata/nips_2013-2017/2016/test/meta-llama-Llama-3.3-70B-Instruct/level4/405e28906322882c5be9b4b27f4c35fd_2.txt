In a stationary environment where the distribution remains constant over time, a skilled online player can select the optimal option with high confidence. However, in non-stationary settings, the distribution may change as time progresses. The authors of this paper address this challenge by dividing sequences into Γ intervals, each with its own stationary distribution. They introduce a parameter V to represent the difference in means between consecutive distributions and use Λ to measure the total statistical variance of the distributions. The paper explores how different values of Γ, Λ, and V impact dynamic pseudo-regret in both full-information and bandit settings. 
The work is well-motivated and investigates the interesting problem of tracking dynamic regret in non-stationary stochastic environments. The paper is well-written and generally accessible to those without prior experience in online learning or the specific topics discussed. The contribution appears novel and significant. Nevertheless, there are areas where the presentation could be improved, and some results are challenging to evaluate.
Several clarifications are needed: 
1. The meaning of at in l{t,a_t} (Line 115) is unclear.
2. Theorem 2.1 is presented without discussion, making its purpose uncertain.
3. The use of equidistant intervals in Algorithm 1 may not be suitable for distributions with varying interval lengths, potentially affecting the regret bound (as noted in Note 1, page 4).
4. The derivation of formula (2) on Line 147 is not provided.
5. The definition of N on Line 162 is missing.
6. The formula for B on Lines 174-175 lacks explanation.
7. There is an inconsistency in symbolic interpretation, such as expert k or arm k, on Lines 186 and 190.
8. On Page 6, Line 215, it seems a ln ln T factor is hidden, and the distinction between switching and drifting distributions is not clear, with Γ considered for switching and V for drifting.
9. Page 5, Section 3.3, is difficult to understand, particularly the meanings of w{t,k} and m{t,k}, which appear to relate to exponential weighted averages, but the formula (6) and the section's logic are confusing.
10. The discussion in Section 4 is limited to K=2 actions, which seems restrictive, and the paper concludes abruptly. The references are incomplete, notably missing highly related works such as "Tracking the Best Expert" by Mark Herbster, Manfred K. Warmuth, and "Switching Portfolios" by Yoram Singer (1998), which could be used for comparison with the current model and results.
