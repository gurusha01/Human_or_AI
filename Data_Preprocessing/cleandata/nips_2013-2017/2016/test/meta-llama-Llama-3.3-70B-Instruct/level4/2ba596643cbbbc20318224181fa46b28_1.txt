The paper proposes a model for multi-armed bandit problems that incorporates a 'fidelity' component, where the learner selects an arm and its corresponding fidelity level from a finite set, resulting in a stochastic reward with a mean within a known error margin. The fidelity levels are associated with varying costs, with higher fidelity pulls being more expensive. The authors formulate the problem as maximizing a notion of net reward and introduce a new algorithm, which they claim can outperform the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm operating at high fidelity levels. They also provide a lower bound for the regret of their proposed algorithm. In my opinion, the paper explores an intriguing and relevant problem, namely, the tradeoff between information, cost, and reward in online learning, specifically in stochastic bandits. This study has the potential to serve as a benchmark for future improvements. Although the paper appears to be technically sound, a significant limitation is the lack of clear explanations for its results and assumptions. The definition of regret used in the paper seems unconventional, as it penalizes resource consumption multiplicatively rather than additively. The authors' example of ad display motivates their definition, but it may not be universally applicable. It would be interesting to investigate what happens when the cost of suitable fidelity observations is factored into the total reward or regret additively. The introduction of Assumption 1 appears artificial and opaque, as it imposes constraints on the fidelity parameters provided to the learner. It is unclear why the authors expect this assumption to hold in general learning problems. Furthermore, if the error margins do not decay as rapidly as required by Assumption 1, it would be beneficial to know if there is a general method for selecting a subsequence of fidelities that satisfies the assumption and, consequently, the results. Although the authors claim that the assumption is not crucial, it seems to be used in the proofs, and my primary concern is whether it influences the algorithm's design and performance in a critical manner. The algorithm's design appears to be tailored to perform well for specific error margin configurations, but the justification for why these configurations are optimal is missing. Additionally, the gap in the lower bound warrants further investigation and potentially a re-design of the proposed strategy. Interpreting the main result (Theorem 2, the regret bound for MF-UCB) and comparing it to UCB (at the highest fidelity, although this is not explicitly stated) is challenging due to the highly technical presentation. The relative gain or loss of MF-UCB seems to depend on parameters that are, in turn, dependent on a complex sequence of sets. A more explicit explanation would greatly enhance the authors' argument. Overall, while the paper begins by considering an interesting learning model, it rapidly becomes unclear when presenting the results. Minor errors include typos on lines 56, 126, and 179, where a period is unnecessary, and set notation would be more suitable for defining certain parameters.
