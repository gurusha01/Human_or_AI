This manuscript proposes a solution to the problem of estimating class prior probabilities using only positive and unlabeled examples, which may contain label noise. Although the experimental results demonstrate superior performance compared to existing methods, the paper lacks a compelling motivation for addressing this problem, making it challenging for me to recommend acceptance. I acknowledge my limited expertise in this area and am open to being persuaded by the authors or other reviewers. 
The paper addresses the challenge of determining the prior probability of a positive example when only positively labeled and unlabeled examples are available, with the added complexity of potential mislabeling. The algorithm assumes that each distribution is a mixture of two base distributions with different mixture weights and jointly learns the parameters using either Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) or AlphaMax, an unfamiliar method to me. The authors also establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the identifiability of class priors and demonstrate the superiority of their models on various datasets.
I have mixed feelings about this paper, as it is technically sound, with clear theorems, proposed methods, and abundant experiments. However, I have several concerns that lean me towards rejection, although I am willing to reconsider if proven wrong. Firstly, the paper fails to provide a convincing justification for the importance of the problem it aims to solve, despite mentioning molecular biology and social networks as potential application domains. The lack of a clear argument for how improved class prior approximation can lead to practical solutions is problematic, as it limits the paper's potential to enable new results.
Furthermore, the theorems seem weak, particularly the condition for identifiability, which appears overly strong and unlikely to occur in practice. This condition requires the existence of a point where one density is zero and the other is positive, which is rare, especially when dealing with empirical distributions. As a result, I question the significance of these theorems in advancing our understanding of the problem.
Additionally, the proposed method relies on density estimation, a challenging task in high-dimensional spaces, as acknowledged in the abstract. The experimental datasets are predominantly low-dimensional (d < 128), which contrasts with molecular biology applications where dimensionality is typically much higher.
After re-examining the paper in response to the authors' feedback, I realized that I had overlooked a crucial component that enables the reduction of the original dimension to a unidimensional problem. I apologize for the oversight and have adjusted my score accordingly. Nevertheless, I still struggle to see the specific real-world problems where this algorithm would provide value, which maintains my low score for potential impact. As this remains my primary concern, I am inclined towards rejection, although I will not strongly advocate for it due to my limited confidence in this area.
