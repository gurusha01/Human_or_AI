This paper presents a novel approach for estimating class priors in a positive and unlabeled setting, taking into account the presence of false positives, a common issue in practice that is often overlooked in existing research. To mitigate the curse of dimensionality, the proposed method employs a non-traditional classifier to transform the data into a single dimension, followed by density estimation. The benchmark results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach. The manuscript is well-structured and easy to follow, with the authors providing a clear summary of the practical implications of each proof, which enhances the readability and flow of the text. The insights gained from Theorems 1 and 2 are particularly noteworthy. However, there are a few aspects that require clarification: 
- The claim that this is the first approach to address noisy positive and unlabeled data (lines 57-58 and 312-314) is not entirely accurate, as prior work, such as [1], has explicitly addressed this variant of learning from positive and unlabeled data. Furthermore, learning from noisy positives and unlabeled data can be considered a subset of learning with label noise, for which numerous methods are available, as reviewed in [2]. Therefore, the assertion that the proposed method is the first to tackle this specific task is not supported. 
- The methodology relies on a non-traditional classifier to transform the data into a single dimension, but it is unclear how the performance of this classifier affects the overall approach, particularly in cases of overfitting, underfitting, or trivial solutions. Additionally, the process of using the non-traditional classifier for dimensionality reduction, including any cross-validation setup and hyperparameter optimization, should be more thoroughly explained. 
- The inclusion of regression datasets in the benchmark seems unnecessary and may be replaced with additional classification problems to strengthen the evaluation.
