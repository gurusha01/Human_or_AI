This manuscript employs a regularized multivariate regression approach to tackle the intriguing task of reconstructing the neural connectivity of the mouse brain's visual cortex at a finer scale, involving the estimation of a large sparse coefficient matrix. The experimental results on real data demonstrate enhanced performance compared to coarser regional level analyses. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Upon reviewing the rebuttal and comments from fellow reviewers, I have revised my evaluation. The primary contribution of this paper lies in its application of regularized regression to a fascinating neuroscientific problem, specifically estimating mouse brain connectivity maps. The authors build upon the work presented in [17] by addressing the issue at a finer voxel level, corresponding to a larger regression coefficient matrix (5000x5000). However, from a modeling perspective, the approach essentially constitutes a smoothing penalized multivariate linear regression model for the least squares problem, bearing resemblance to numerous existing matrix/tensor completion methods, which somewhat limits its novelty. The experimental section is notable for the absence of comparisons with other methods, leaving uncertainty regarding the proposed method's relative performance. To strengthen the manuscript, I recommend the inclusion of additional algorithms and baseline comparisons to provide a more comprehensive evaluation.
