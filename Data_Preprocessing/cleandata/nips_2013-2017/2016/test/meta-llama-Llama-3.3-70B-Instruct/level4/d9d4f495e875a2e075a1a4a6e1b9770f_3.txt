The paper presents a novel framework for long-range video prediction by forecasting motion, deviating from conventional methods that explicitly reconstruct subsequent frames from the model's internal state. A key limitation of traditional approaches is their need to internally manage appearance information, which is unnecessarily complex since this information is already available in the current input frame. In contrast, the proposed method focuses on learning physical concepts related to motion, utilizing a deep network to output convolutional filters or affine transformation matrices applied to the current frame. The approach also accommodates conditional inputs, such as actions or states of a robot interacting with the environment. 
Overall, the paper is well-motivated and clearly written, with most aspects being readily understandable. However, the specifics of the 'tiling' operation for integrating action/input states could be further elucidated. Conceptually, it might have been beneficial to distinguish the model's action-conditioned aspect more clearly, as the interaction motivation could have been more pronounced by initially focusing solely on motion prediction. This would have made the contributions of prediction and action-conditioning more discernible. The model bears some resemblance to the Dynamic Filter Networks proposed by Luc van Gool's group, and another relevant reference is the work on forecasting from static images using variational autoencoders from CMU.
A more in-depth analysis of the method's limitations would be valuable. For instance, the predictions seem to work well for the robot arm's movement but result in blurry objects, particularly non-rigid ones. This could be attributed to the use of reconstruction loss in pixel space during training; exploring a GAN-type loss might yield improvements. Furthermore, the approach of generating predictions directly in pixel space, while interpretable, may not be the most efficient or reasonable choice. Predicting a compact code for subsequent frames could be more practical, considering model capacity and potential applications of this predictive framework.
