The authors have enhanced the RRSVM image classification model by incorporating a straightforward diversity mechanism, resulting in state-of-the-art performance in predicting human gaze fixation locations during visual search. As a non-expert in vision research, I believe this paper warrants acceptance due to its innovative approach, exceptional results, and clear presentation. To further improve the work, I suggest the following: 
1. It would be beneficial to report the split-half AUC for the human data, as this could indicate whether additional data collection is necessary. Moreover, the human AUC could serve as a natural upper bound for model AUC, providing a benchmark for evaluation.
2. Providing a measure of uncertainty for the mean AUCs of RRSVM and SDR, such as standard error of the mean obtained through multiple validation sets, would help establish the significance of the difference between their scores.
3. I am curious as to why the field predominantly uses AUC as the metric for fixation prediction, rather than alternative measures like log-likelihood of human data under the priority map.
4. The writing in Section 2 bears resemblance to Section 3.1 of the original CVPR paper on RRSVM by Wei and Hoai. If the authors are not the same, it would be advisable to rephrase the content to make it more distinctive.
5. As an outsider to the field of computer vision, I would appreciate more detailed information on the regions searched by RRSVM, including their size, possible variations, and the dimensionality reduction achieved by the SDR region selection function Psi.
6. Table 1 reveals a performance decline for all models on certain items, such as "and sofa." Given that the base RRSVM also experiences a performance hit in classification, it would be interesting to explore the relationship between classification and fixation prediction, including whether good classification is a prerequisite for accurate fixation prediction.
After reviewing the other assessments and the authors' rebuttal, which adequately addresses the technical concerns raised, I remain in support of accepting this paper.
