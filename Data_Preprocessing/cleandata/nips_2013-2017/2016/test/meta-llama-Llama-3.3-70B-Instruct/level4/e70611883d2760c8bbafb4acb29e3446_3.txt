This study introduces an approach to accelerate kernel learning by leveraging random features (RF), outperforming existing methods such as structured kernel composition based on alignment metrics and joint kernel composition optimization via empirical risk minimization. The proposed approach optimizes kernel compositions using explicit RF maps, rather than full kernel matrices, resulting in higher efficiency. The method consists of two stages: firstly, efficient kernel learning using RF, and secondly, utilizing the optimized features associated with the learned kernel in a standard supervised learning framework to compute an estimator. The authors establish the consistency of the learned kernel and provide generalization guarantees for the learned estimator. Empirical evaluations are also presented, including a toy example illustrating the learned features with a suboptimal initial kernel guess, an experiment on a high-dimensional dataset demonstrating superior predictive performance and sparse representation, and a performance comparison on benchmark datasets showing comparable test accuracies at reduced computational cost relative to the standard RF approach. The proposed approach is highly innovative and interesting, with the concept of utilizing random features to accelerate kernel alignment being particularly noteworthy. The paper is well-structured and written, with a principled organization, and the authors provide a thorough theoretical analysis guaranteeing the consistency of the learned kernel and the generalization properties of the resulting estimator. The experimental section effectively visualizes the method, demonstrating its application in identifying sparse features in high-dimensional spaces and comparing the accuracy and computational time of the proposed method on three benchmark datasets, highlighting promising practical applications. To further enhance the study, evaluating the method on additional benchmark datasets, such as those used in [18], would be beneficial. Minor revisions are suggested, including clarifying notation and addressing formatting issues, such as introducing or modifying $W$ and $W^k$ to highlight their relationship with $w^i$, correcting optimization terminology, and adding missing punctuation. Additionally, the figure depicting optimized random features could be improved by providing a clearer explanation for the clustering of $w^k$ around specific points, and the algorithm and figure formatting could be refined for better readability.
