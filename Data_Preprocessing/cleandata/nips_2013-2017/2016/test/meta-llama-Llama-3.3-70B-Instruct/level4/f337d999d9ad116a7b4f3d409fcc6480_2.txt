This manuscript enhances the precision and granularity of linear models applied to neural projection tracing experiments by incorporating a smoothness prior, thereby refining the accuracy of the results. Furthermore, the implementation of a low-rank approximation to the connectivity matrix yields significant memory efficiencies. The text is exceptionally clear and concise, making it readily accessible to readers. The proposed methodology appears to be straightforward to implement and demonstrates substantial performance enhancements over preceding region-based approaches. As such, in my opinion, this method has the potential to be highly beneficial to practitioners, particularly if the accompanying code is made publicly available following publication. 
After considering the authors' rebuttal, I would like to express my appreciation for their thoughtful response and the overall quality of the manuscript. My sole minor recommendation is that the authors reconsider the title, potentially rephrasing it to position the technical terminology at the end, such as "High-resolution neural connectivity inference from incomplete tracing data via nonnegative spline regression," to enhance clarity and readability.
