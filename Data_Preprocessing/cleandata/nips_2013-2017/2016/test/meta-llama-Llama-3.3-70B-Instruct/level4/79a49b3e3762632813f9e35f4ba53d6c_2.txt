This paper proposes algorithms for estimating class priors and posteriors using noisy positive and unlabeled data, building upon the methodology outlined in Jain et al. (2016), which was previously limited to the case of pure positives. The authors demonstrate improvements over Jain et al. (2016) through simulations. However, there are two key areas that require attention: 
1. The paper fails to cite recent work [1], which achieves improvements over Jain et al. (2016). Incorporating a comparison to [1] in both theoretical and simulation-based analyses would be beneficial to contextualize the proposed methodology's performance. 
2. Given the foundation laid by Jain et al., the novelty and technical sophistication of the proofs presented seem somewhat limited. A more comprehensive evaluation against recent advancements, such as [1*] by Harish G. Ramaswamy, Clayton Scott, and Ambuj Tewari, titled "Mixture Proportion Estimation via Kernel Embedding of Distributions" from ICML 2016, would strengthen the paper's contributions.
