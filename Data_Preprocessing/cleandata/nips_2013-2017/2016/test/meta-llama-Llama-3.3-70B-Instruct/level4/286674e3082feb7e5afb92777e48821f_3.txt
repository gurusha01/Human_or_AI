This manuscript proposes a collection of algorithms designed for graph-based clustering, as well as a method to assess the similarity between two distinct cluster assignments. However, while the algorithms are well-defined, the underlying rationale and the justification for presenting them as a series of discrete algorithms are not adequately clarified. Essentially, these algorithms are adapted from existing methodologies, with the primary innovation being the introduction of specific constraints towards the end of the presentation.
