This paper introduces an inhibition of return mechanism into the region sparsity model and explores its connection to visual attention, a topic that has been studied previously, such as in the work by Hou, Harel, and Koch (PAMI 2012). Although the authors propose a link between sparsity and attention, they lack theoretical foundations to support this claim, making the relationship appear somewhat superficial. Incorporating inhibition of return into attention models is a promising idea, but its current implementation seems ad-hoc and would benefit from further elaboration, potentially through mathematical derivations or experimental validations. For instance, experimental results comparing the model's performance with and without this mechanism would provide a more convincing demonstration of its effectiveness. Sections 2 and 3 appear disconnected from the rest of the paper and bear a resemblance to reference [29]; reorganizing and reframing these sections to better align with the context of visual attention would be beneficial. The authors have designed several task paradigms, which is a positive aspect. However, the qualitative figures do not clearly showcase the strengths of the new approach in these contexts. The test stimuli are simplistic, featuring one or two objects in relatively isolated scenes, making it unclear whether the model's accuracy is due to the straightforward nature of these stimuli. More comprehensive experimental demonstrations on complex scenes, along with a detailed discussion, would be expected. Furthermore, the visualization of the maps could be improved, as the current heatmap obscures the original stimuli and human fixations to a significant extent.
