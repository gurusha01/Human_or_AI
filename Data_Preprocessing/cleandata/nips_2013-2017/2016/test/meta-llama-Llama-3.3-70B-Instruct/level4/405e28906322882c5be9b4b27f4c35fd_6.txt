This paper examines the concept of regret in sequential prediction within nonstationary environments, introducing a parameter Λ that represents the variance of loss distributions throughout the process. The study delves into the impact of Λ on prediction regret, particularly its interaction with other distributional measures such as the frequency of distribution changes and deviation over time. A key contribution is the derivation of a regret lower bound. While the paper shows promise, its incompleteness is notable, and the inclusion of experimental results to validate the proposed algorithms would significantly enhance the robustness and reliability of the theoretical findings. However, several areas require improvement: the abstract lacks clarity and needs revision; symbols and parameters are not adequately defined, leading to confusion about their context within equations and algorithms, a issue also present in the introduction. Specifically, on page 2, line 44, the UCB is referenced without definition. Overall, the paper's clarity needs substantial improvement. Furthermore, the bibliography could be enhanced by incorporating existing literature on best expert tracking, which would provide a more comprehensive framework for the research presented.
