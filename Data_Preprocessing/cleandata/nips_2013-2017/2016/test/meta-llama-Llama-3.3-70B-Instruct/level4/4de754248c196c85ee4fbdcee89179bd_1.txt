This manuscript explores the challenge of estimating individual appliance power consumption in a household based on time-series data of total energy usage. The authors propose an additive factorial HMM model to address this issue, leveraging techniques such as convex semidefinite relaxation, random rounding, and an efficient ADMM approach to derive estimates. The method's effectiveness is validated using simulated data. The paper presents an interesting problem and is well-structured, with a complex solution that is broken down into logical, sequential stages, making it accessible even to readers unfamiliar with the specific domain. The authors' explanation is clear and self-contained. However, one aspect that remains unclear is the methodology used to estimate the number of appliances, which could be elaborated upon in Section 5. Additionally, an analysis of the sensitivity of this estimation during empirical evaluation would provide further insight, enhancing the overall understanding of the proposed approach.
