This manuscript addresses the challenge of determining the optimal configuration of a Bayesian network. Specifically, it demonstrates how to integrate non-decomposable constraints, including ancestral constraints, into the structure learning framework established by Chen et al. in their 2015 and 2016 works. The empirical assessment of the proposed method, compared to ILP-based approaches, reveals significant improvements of several orders of magnitude. By reformulating the problem as a MaxSAT problem with tailored constraints, the authors achieve notable results. Although my familiarity with this specific approach is limited, the empirical findings, particularly the runtime comparisons, appear to be substantially impressive, showcasing a reduction in runtime by multiple orders of magnitude compared to existing alternative methods.
