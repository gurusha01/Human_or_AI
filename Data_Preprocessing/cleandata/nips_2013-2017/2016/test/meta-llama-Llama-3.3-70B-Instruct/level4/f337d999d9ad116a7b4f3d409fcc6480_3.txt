The authors propose a innovative approach to determining structural connectivity in the brain, leveraging sparse retrograde labeling experiments. Their methodology integrates a matrix completion loss function, a smoothing penalty to ensure spatial consistency in the recovered connectivity, and a low-rank approximation, which enhances the method's scalability for comprehensive brain maps. The approach is validated using synthetic data and applied to the publicly available Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas, where it demonstrates superior performance compared to current state-of-the-art methods. The research addresses a critical and intriguing challenge: accurately inferring mesoscale anatomical connectivity from brain tracing experiments, which are limited in number, have a high number of free parameters in the connectivity matrix, and are susceptible to artifacts induced by the injection process itself. The authors present a sophisticated method that effectively mitigates these challenges through a meticulously designed optimization problem. They assume spatial smoothness in the connectivity matrix, a premise supported by the retinotopic organization of the visual cortex, from which their data originates. To counter experimental artifacts at the injection site, they utilize a projection operator akin to those employed in matrix projection techniques. Furthermore, they extend their optimization procedure to facilitate a low-rank representation of the connectivity matrix, potentially enabling the model to accommodate larger datasets. The manuscript is well-structured and accessible, with the authors thoroughly justifying their modeling decisions using synthetic data with known ground truth. Ultimately, they present compelling results on real data, outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches.
