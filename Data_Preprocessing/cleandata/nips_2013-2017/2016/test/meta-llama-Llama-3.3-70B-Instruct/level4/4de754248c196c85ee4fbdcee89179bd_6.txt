This manuscript presents a novel approach to enhance the approximate solution for energy disaggregation, also known as non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM), building upon the foundational work of Kolter & Jaakkola (2012) that utilized an additive factorial HMM to model energy consumption patterns. By integrating a Semi-Definite Programming (SDP) relaxation with randomized rounding, as per Park & Boyd (2015), and applying the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) outlined by Boyd (2010), the authors' proposed method demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methodologies. Notably, the simulation results showcase the method's outstanding accuracy, underscoring its potential. However, a critical assessment reveals that the manuscript falls short in terms of academic novelty and originality, as the proposed methodology essentially combines previously established techniques without introducing groundbreaking concepts. The authors claim that their algorithm is scalable and computationally efficient, yet they fail to provide a detailed analysis of its computational complexity or supportive experimental results, which is a significant oversight. To bolster the manuscript's credibility, it would be essential to demonstrate the method's effectiveness in terms of computational complexity, potentially through comparative analyses of execution times with existing methods or experiments utilizing large-scale datasets. From a technical standpoint, the manuscript is well-structured and effectively conveys the essential information. Nevertheless, there are minor errors in expression that require correction, specifically in the title of section 6 and its subsection, as well as on lines 75 and 223. Furthermore, considering the space constraints, it would be beneficial to incorporate crucial figures or tables directly into the manuscript rather than relegating them to supplementary materials. Lastly, the conclusion section is succinct to a fault and would benefit from expansion to more comprehensively summarize the manuscript's key findings and implications.
