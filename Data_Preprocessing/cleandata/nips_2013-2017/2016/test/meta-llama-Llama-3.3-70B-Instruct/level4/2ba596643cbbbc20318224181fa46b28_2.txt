This paper presents a novel multi-arm bandit framework where each arm can be drawn with varying accuracies, or fidelities, and the cost of pulling an arm increases with the desired accuracy. The regret is defined as the product of the cost and the traditional pseudo-regret. The authors propose the MF-UCB algorithm to address this setting and provide both an upper and a lower bound on the cumulative pseudo-regret of this algorithm. The main body of the paper is well-structured and clearly written. However, the supplementary materials, which contain most of the proofs, are marred by numerous typos and minor, easily correctable errors that can confuse the reader, as outlined in the list below. Correcting these errors would significantly enhance the paper's readability. Furthermore, the use of up-to-a-multiplicative-constant notation may be misleading, as constants can actually depend on parameters; for instance, Theorem 2 includes a factor ρ, a parameter of the algorithm, hidden within the constant. Utilizing the exact inequalities, as detailed in the supplementary materials, could improve the clarity of the results. From a practical standpoint, the applicability of this algorithm to real-world problems is not immediately clear, particularly because the strategy of MF-UCB, which uses low-accuracy pulls to eliminate suboptimal arms, may suffer from inaccurate estimations of ζ (the fidelity accuracy). A discussion on the practical limitations and potential strategies to overcome them would be beneficial. Theoretically, this paper offers valuable insights into the problem, along with interesting theorems and solid proofs. Overall, this work represents a significant and interesting contribution.
