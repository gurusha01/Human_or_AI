This paper presents a visual attentional approach utilizing a RRSVM classifier, which identifies image categories based on a sparse set of regions. The visual features are extracted using the VGG16 deep neural network. To facilitate the detection of multiple objects within an image, the paper incorporates a biological mechanism known as Inhibition of Return (IOR) into the RRSVM's optimization objective, promoting diversity during the training process. The proposed method yields competitive results in visual search tasks involving both single and multiple objects. While the adoption of IOR is reasonable, it would be beneficial to include a sensitivity analysis of IOR-related parameters, as the suppression area's impact on the prediction accuracy of multi-objects at varying scales is noteworthy and could potentially explain some of the failure cases depicted in Figure 3. Furthermore, an issue arises with the experiment outlined in Table 1, where the proposed SDR relies on VGG16 as a feature extractor and RRSVM as a classifier. Given that the novelty of this work lies in the RRSVM classifier rather than the feature extractor, experiments should ideally be conducted using the same feature extractor across all compared methods. However, since RCNN and CAM employ different feature extractors, the distinct contribution of RRSVM remains unclear, warranting a more controlled comparison to accurately assess its impact.
