This paper presents a novel approach to addressing the classical problems of learning with expert advice (LEA) and online linear optimization (OLO) over Hilbert space by reducing them to the coin-betting problem. Utilizing an existing coin-betting protocol, the authors derive parameter-free algorithms for both problems, with the new LEA algorithm achieving a reduced regret compared to previous ones, and the new OLO algorithm matching the regret bound of an existing algorithm. However, a potential error is identified in the proof of Lemma 14, specifically in the second inequality following line 430, which should be revised from ≥ to ≤ due to the property ln(1+x) ≤ x - (1 - ln(2))x^2. Despite this, it is speculated that Lemma 14 remains correct, albeit in need of a revised proof. Assuming the correction of this bug, the paper is deemed interesting due to its innovative approach to designing online algorithms by establishing a connection to the coin-betting problem. This connection enables the conversion of an existing coin-betting protocol into novel algorithms for LEA and OLO, which are parameter-free, eliminating the need for parameter tuning and thereby strengthening the paper. The paper's clarity and readability are also notable. Two potential weaknesses are observed: the complexity and unintuitiveness of the potential function, which may limit its applicability and versatility compared to approaches like mirror-descent algorithms, and the focus on the unconstrained version of the OLO problem, leaving uncertainty about the adaptability of the presented ideas to the more general constrained OLO problem over any convex feasible set.
