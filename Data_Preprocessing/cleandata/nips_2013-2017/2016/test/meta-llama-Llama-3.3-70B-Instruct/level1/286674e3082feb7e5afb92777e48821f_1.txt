This paper proposes a framework for clustering graphs without assuming that the data comes from a specific model, such as the Stochastic Block Model (SBM) or its extensions. The authors provide "correctness" guarantees that depend on the statistics of the data, which can be checked. The framework ties in with the existing model-based framework, and the authors show that they can exploit results in model-based recovery to strengthen the results in that area of research.
The paper's main contribution is the development of a generic theorem that provides a blueprint for obtaining model-free guarantees for clustering algorithms. The theorem states that if a clustering C fits the data G well with respect to a model M, then any other clustering C' that also fits G well will be close to C. The authors instantiate this theorem for the cases of the SBM and the Preference Frame Model (PFM), providing specific guarantees for these models.
The paper's strengths include its ability to provide model-free guarantees for clustering algorithms, which is a significant departure from the traditional model-based approach. The authors also provide a clear and well-organized presentation of their framework and results, making it easy to follow their arguments. The experimental evaluation of the framework on various datasets is also a strong aspect of the paper, demonstrating the practical applicability of the authors' approach.
However, there are some weaknesses to the paper. One potential limitation is that the guarantees provided by the framework may not always be informative, as the authors acknowledge. Additionally, the framework may not be applicable to all types of data or clustering algorithms, and the authors do not provide a clear discussion of the limitations of their approach.
In terms of originality, the paper's contribution is significant, as it provides a new framework for clustering graphs without assuming a specific model. The authors also provide new results for the SBM and PFM models, which are important contributions to the field.
The significance of the paper's results is also high, as they have the potential to impact the field of community detection in networks. The authors' framework provides a new way of thinking about clustering algorithms, and their results could lead to the development of new algorithms and techniques for clustering graphs.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and well-organized presentation of their framework and results. The paper's strengths outweigh its weaknesses, and it is a significant contribution to the field of community detection in networks.
