This paper proposes a novel approach to learning Bayesian networks optimally, subject to background knowledge in the form of ancestral constraints. The authors leverage a recently proposed framework for optimal structure learning based on non-decomposable scores, which can accommodate ancestral constraints. The key idea is to empower an oracle that optimizes decomposable scores by passing it decomposable constraints inferred from non-decomposable ancestral constraints.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem of learning Bayesian networks with ancestral constraints. The technical sections are also well-organized, and the authors provide a thorough explanation of their approach, including the EC tree search space and the method for pruning the search space based on ancestral constraints.
The empirical evaluation is also thorough, and the authors compare their approach to a state-of-the-art ILP-based system, demonstrating significant improvements in efficiency. The results show that the proposed approach can scale to larger problem sizes and is more efficient than the ILP-based approach, especially when the number of variables increases.
The strengths of the paper include:
* A novel and efficient approach to learning Bayesian networks with ancestral constraints
* A thorough empirical evaluation that demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach
* A clear and concise writing style that makes the paper easy to follow
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The approach relies on an oracle that optimizes decomposable scores, which may not always be available or efficient
* The method for inferring decomposable constraints from ancestral constraints may not always be accurate or complete
* The empirical evaluation is limited to a specific set of benchmarks and may not generalize to other problem domains
Overall, I would rate this paper as a strong accept. The proposed approach is novel and efficient, and the empirical evaluation demonstrates its effectiveness. While there are some limitations to the approach, the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their method and its potential applications.
