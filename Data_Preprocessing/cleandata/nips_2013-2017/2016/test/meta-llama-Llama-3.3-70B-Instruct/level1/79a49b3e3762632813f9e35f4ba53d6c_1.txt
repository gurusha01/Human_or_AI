This paper proposes a novel classification algorithm for estimating posterior distributions from positive-unlabeled data, with a focus on robustness to noise in the positive labels and effectiveness in high-dimensional data. The authors build upon previous work in this area, which has largely been theoretical and struggled to perform well on real-world, high-dimensional data. The key contribution of this paper is the development of two practical classification algorithms that explicitly model the noise in the positive labels and utilize univariate transforms built on discriminative classifiers.
The paper is technically sound, with a clear and well-organized presentation of the theoretical development and algorithms. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of their approach, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. The paper is well-written and provides enough information for an expert reader to reproduce the results.
The originality of the paper lies in its novel combination of familiar techniques, specifically the use of univariate transforms to preserve the class prior and avoid kernel density estimation for high-dimensional data. The authors adequately reference related work and demonstrate a clear understanding of the current state of the art in this area.
The significance of the paper is high, as it addresses a difficult problem in a better way than previous research. The proposed algorithms have the potential to be widely used in practice, particularly in applications where positive-unlabeled data is common and noise in the positive labels is a concern. The paper advances the state of the art in a demonstrable way, providing a unique theoretical and pragmatic approach to classification from positive-unlabeled data.
