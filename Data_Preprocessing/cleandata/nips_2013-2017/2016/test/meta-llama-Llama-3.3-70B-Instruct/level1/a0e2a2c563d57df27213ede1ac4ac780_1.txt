This paper proposes a novel approach to predicting human visual attention in visual search tasks by incorporating biologically plausible mechanisms into a learned region sparsity model. The authors extend the Region Ranking SVM (RRSVM) model to include Inhibition of Return, which imposes diversity on the selected regions, and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in predicting human gaze fixations on three different visual search tasks.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise overview of the background and related work in the field. The technical contributions of the paper are significant, and the experiments are thorough and well-designed. The results show that the proposed Sparse Diverse Regions (SDR) classifier outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, including those that use object detectors and annotated bounding boxes.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposal of a novel and biologically plausible approach to predicting human visual attention
* The demonstration of state-of-the-art performance on three different visual search tasks
* The thorough and well-designed experiments
* The clear and concise writing style
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The potential for center bias in the POET dataset, which may affect the results
* The lack of comparison to other methods that incorporate center bias and other factors affecting search
* The limited analysis of the failure modes of the SDR classifier
Arguments for acceptance:
* The paper proposes a novel and significant contribution to the field of computer vision and visual attention
* The results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on three different visual search tasks
* The paper is well-written and easy to follow
Arguments against acceptance:
* The potential for center bias in the POET dataset may affect the results
* The lack of comparison to other methods that incorporate center bias and other factors affecting search
* The limited analysis of the failure modes of the SDR classifier
Overall, I believe that the paper is a strong contribution to the field and deserves to be accepted. However, I would like to see the authors address the potential center bias issue and provide more analysis of the failure modes of the SDR classifier in future work.
