This paper presents a novel framework for designing parameter-free algorithms for online linear optimization (OLO) over Hilbert spaces and learning with expert advice (LEA). The authors introduce a new interpretation of parameter-free algorithms as coin betting algorithms, which reveals the common hidden structure of previous parameter-free algorithms for both OLO and LEA. The paper also provides reductions from coin betting to OLO over Hilbert spaces and LEA, which are novel and optimal.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The introduction of a new and intuitive framework for designing parameter-free algorithms, which provides a unified view of previous algorithms and allows for the design of new ones.
* The provision of reductions from coin betting to OLO over Hilbert spaces and LEA, which are novel and optimal.
* The presentation of new algorithms for OLO and LEA, which achieve optimal worst-case upper bounds on the regret.
* The empirical evaluation of the algorithms, which shows that the theoretical difference between classic online learning algorithms and parameter-free ones is real and not just theoretical.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes that the reward vectors are bounded, which may not be the case in all scenarios.
* The paper does not provide a clear comparison with other state-of-the-art algorithms for OLO and LEA.
* The empirical evaluation is limited to a few datasets and may not be representative of all possible scenarios.
Arguments pro acceptance:
* The paper presents a novel and intuitive framework for designing parameter-free algorithms, which is a significant contribution to the field.
* The reductions from coin betting to OLO over Hilbert spaces and LEA are novel and optimal, which provides a new perspective on the problem.
* The new algorithms presented in the paper achieve optimal worst-case upper bounds on the regret, which is a significant improvement over previous algorithms.
Arguments con acceptance:
* The paper assumes that the reward vectors are bounded, which may not be the case in all scenarios.
* The paper does not provide a clear comparison with other state-of-the-art algorithms for OLO and LEA, which makes it difficult to evaluate the significance of the contribution.
* The empirical evaluation is limited to a few datasets and may not be representative of all possible scenarios.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of online learning, and the strengths of the paper outweigh the weaknesses. The introduction of a new framework for designing parameter-free algorithms and the provision of novel and optimal reductions from coin betting to OLO over Hilbert spaces and LEA make the paper a valuable addition to the field.
