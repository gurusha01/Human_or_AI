This paper presents a novel approach to learning a kernel in a supervised manner using random features. The authors extend the randomized-feature approach to learn a kernel via its associated random features, providing an efficient optimization problem that learns a kernel in a supervised manner. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, related work, and their proposed approach.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The authors provide a thorough review of related work, highlighting the limitations of existing approaches and the benefits of their proposed method.
* The proposed approach is efficient and scalable, making it suitable for large-scale datasets.
* The authors provide theoretical guarantees on the consistency and generalization performance of their method, which is a significant contribution to the field.
* The empirical evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, showing competitive results with state-of-the-art methods on several benchmark datasets.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The paper assumes a user-defined kernel as input, which may not always be available or suitable for the problem at hand.
* The optimization problem (4) is a discrete approximation to a heuristic kernel alignment problem, which may not always converge to the global optimum.
* The authors do not provide a detailed comparison with other kernel learning methods, which would be useful to understand the strengths and limitations of their approach.
