This paper proposes a novel homotopy smoothing (HOPS) algorithm for solving a family of non-smooth optimization problems. The main idea of HOPS is to start with a relatively large smoothing parameter and gradually decrease it in a stage-wise manner, using the solution from the previous stage as a warm-start for the next stage. The authors show that HOPS achieves a lower iteration complexity of Õ(1/ε^{1-θ}) compared to the existing state-of-the-art algorithms, where θ ∈ (0, 1] captures the local sharpness of the objective function around the optimal solutions.
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem and the proposed algorithm. The theoretical analysis is rigorous, and the authors provide a detailed proof of the iteration complexity of HOPS. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of HOPS in comparison with other state-of-the-art algorithms.
The strengths of the paper include:
* The proposed HOPS algorithm is novel and achieves a better iteration complexity than existing algorithms.
* The theoretical analysis is rigorous and provides a clear understanding of the algorithm's behavior.
* The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of HOPS in practice.
The weaknesses of the paper include:
* The algorithm requires a careful choice of the smoothing parameter and the number of iterations at each stage, which can be challenging in practice.
* The paper assumes that the local error bound condition holds, which may not be true for all problems.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the proposed algorithm is novel and effective. The theoretical analysis is rigorous, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of HOPS in practice.
