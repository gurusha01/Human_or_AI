The author provide a new framework called Multi-fidelity Multi-armed bandit. In this problem, arms can be sampled with different level of fidelity and a cost is associated to each one. While having a lower cost, low fidelity samples are drawn from a distribution approximating the highest fidelity distribution. They provide an algorithm adapting to the sequences of available approximations and cost, its regret analysis and a lower bound of the problem. They provide numerical simulation on synthetical problems where the proposed algorithm outperform UCB. The proposed framework is interesting and if more developed can be impactful. However in this state, I found the paper unfit for publication. 1/ Introductions of the notations are quite confusing, they are very dispersed and makes their definitions hard to find. Per example, I did not find what is $s$ (after the rebuttal, it appears that $s$ is defined 1 page after its first use and is then barely used in the rest of the paper). 2/ The use of the advertising as example is misleading at some points. At many places, correlations with the display time of an ads and non stationarity are made. Non stationarity is out of context in this paper. It may be a good idea to use another example (see 4/). 3/ I find hard to justify the regret analysis in this setting. A regret analysis involves to maximize a gain in the long run and thus to find the arm with the best ratio reward/cost. Here the optimal policy is always the arm with the highest mean, whatever the associated cost is. Thus, the optimal policy is weakened by the obligation of sampling the best arm at lower fidelity level. This may hide the cost of sampling low levels when it is not needed. 4/ A sample complexity analysis (here more a cost complexity) may be useful in the context of Multi-fidelity Multi-armed bandits. It can be motivated by the testing phase of prototypes for the conception of new products. The goal is to find with high probability the best product while minimizing the cumulated cost of the test phase before mass production. As companies are bounded by regulations, contracts and existing facilities they are obligated to use low-fidelity approximations before accessing to advanced and costly tests. 5/ I also found some parts of the text unwieldy. It may be worth to make a pass on the paper to make it more streamlined.
