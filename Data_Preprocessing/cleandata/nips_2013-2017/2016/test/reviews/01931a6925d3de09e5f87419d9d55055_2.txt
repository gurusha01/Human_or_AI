This brief paper extends the common multivariate normal density by replacing the Euclidean metric with a locally adaptive Riemannian metric. The result is a generalization of the normal distribution to the manifold learning setting with wide applicability (as illustrated by the reported experients) This brief paper extends the common multivariate normal density by replacing the Euclidean metric with a locally adaptive Riemannian metric. The result is a generalization of the normal distribution to the manifold learning setting with wide applicability (as illustrated by the reported experients) Importantly, it provides, very sinthetically, a complete account of a parameter estimation procedure of the maximum likelihood type. The extension to a mixture of LANDS makes it particularly practical as a 'competitor' to the now standard GMM. The experiments are (at least for this reviewer) quite exciting and open a wide avenue for future research. Language, estructure, bibliography and relevance to the NIPS remit are excellent.
