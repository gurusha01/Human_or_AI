The paper presents a new intuitive framework to design parameter-free algorithms based on a reduction to betting on outcomes of an adversarial coin. The method shows a new interpretation of parameter-free algorithms as coin-betting algorithms, which reveals the common hidden structure of previous parameter-free algorithms and also allows the design of new algorithms. The paper has also run an empirical evaluation to demonstrate the theory. strengths of the paper: 1. The paper has proposed a novel framework to design parameter-free algorithms. The proposed method is simple with no parameters to be tuned. 2. They have both demonstrated in theory and experiments that the proposed algorithm improve or match previous results in terms of regret guarantee and per-round complexity.
