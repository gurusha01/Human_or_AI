A Bayesian classification routine is provided for estimation of positive only labels primary suited for applications with noise. Theoretical results are provided to demonstrate important properties of their approach. Empirical studies are performed. Theoretically, the analysis provided for the problem setup is complete and tailored appropriately to the problem. It all seems correct but admittedly I did not work through the proofs line-by-line due to time constraints. The univariate transformation section on the other hand is not that innovative. This type of approach is less than ideal for dealing with large data. It is unclear how much information is really lost with this type of approach and such mechanisms are difficult to justify to practitioners. The authors claim that their approach will be robust to noise and effective for high dimensional data. The robustness claim seems to be justified theoretically, and I think the authors make a strong case for this overall. The empirical results in Table 2 also help this case, but it is hard to know for certain. Although the proposed technique wins a lot, the row to row (and even column to column) comparisons are just all over the place (Laplace distribution only). Perhaps it is saturated with too much noise. On the real results, the approach wins 19 out of 36 times and is significant 12 of those times but is also significantly beaten 11 times. I like that the authors showed both times where they were dominant and where they were not (for example, the concrete data could have been removed but wasn't). Comparisons to other work are also appropriate. All and all their approach seems to be a safe bet. The weakness of the paper is that the authors provide little practical assessment on how the algorithm scales up with n. E.g., How long did the Shuttle data take. They just mention they are susceptible to the curse of dimensionality and note that others are as well. A much more detailed analysis of this issue is expected in this venue,the paper claims this property, but this analysis in the appropriate depth was missing from the paper.
