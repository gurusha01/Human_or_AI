The paper proposes a visual attentional methods based on a RRSVM classifier. RRSVM recognizes image category using a sparse set of regions. The visual features is extracted using a deep neural network (VGG16). To detect multi-objects in an image, a biological mechanism IOR is added into the optimization objective of the RRSVM to encourage diversity during training. The method achieves competitive results on visual serach tasks of single object and multi objects. The IOR adopted by the paper is reasonable, but sensitivity analysis on IOR related parameters should be provided as the supression area will affect the prediction accuracy of multi-objects at different scales. This may also explain some failure examples as shown in Figure 3. Another issue is about the experiment in Table 1. The proposed SDR is basded on a VGG16 as a feature extractor and a classifier RRSVM, and the novelty of this paper lies in the classifier RRSVM instead of feature extractor. Therefore, the experiments should be carried on by using the same feature extractor across all methods. However, RCNN and CAM use different feature extractors. So the contribution of RRSVM is not clear.
