This paper improves the accuracy and resolution of linear models fitted to neural projection tracing experiments, by adding a smoothness prior. Additionally, low rank approximation to the connectivity matrix enables memory savings. The paper is very easy to read. Also, the suggested method seems straightforward to implement, and significantly improves performance of previous region-based method. Therefore, to the best of my knowledge, the method should be useful to practitioners, especially if the code is released after publication. %% After authors' rebuttal %% I thank the authors for the rebuttal and very nice paper. My only minor suggestion is that the authors change the title so that the technical jargon appears in the end, e.g. "High resolution neural connectivity extracted from incomplete tracing data using nonnegative spline regression"
