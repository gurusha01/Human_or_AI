The authors present a novel method for identifying structural connectivity in the brain on the basis of sparse retrogade labeling experiments. The method they use combines a matrix completion loss, a smoothing penalty that enforces spatial homogeneity in the recovered structural connectivity, and a low rank approximation of the data which promises to make the method scalable to full brain maps. The method is tested on synthetic data, and applied to publicly available data from the Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas, on which it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. The authors tackle a relevant and interesting problem: how best to infer anatomical connectivity at the mesoscale from brain tracing experiments, when the number of tracing experiments that can be performed is low, the number of free parameters in the connectivity matrix is a priori high, and experiments suffer from artifacts directly caused by the injection themselves. They present an elegant method that takes into account those three difficulties by means of a well-designed optimization problem. They make an assumption of spatial smoothness for the connectivity matrix that is well justified by the retinotopic organization of the visual cortex, from which the data they use comes. They address the issue of experimental artifacts at the site of injection by using a projection operator similar to those used in matrix projection techniques. They provide an extension of their optimization procedure that allows for a low-rank representation of the connectivity matrix. This extension could be used to scale the model to larger data. The paper is well written and easy to follow. The authors carefully demonstrate the various modeling choices they made on synthetic data for which ground truth is known. They conclude by providing results on real data, for which they significantly outperform the state of the art.
