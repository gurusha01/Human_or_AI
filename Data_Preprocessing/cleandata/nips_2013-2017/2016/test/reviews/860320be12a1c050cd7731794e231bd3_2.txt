This paper provides 3 measures of complexity for RNNs. They then show experimentally that these complexity measures are meaningful, in the sense that increasingly complexity seems to correlated with better performance. Update: In line 71, there is a V without a subscript. I think it should be Vc. --- I like this paper, but some figures need better explanation. Figure 1(a) is quite clear, as it corresponds to definitions 2.1 and 2.2. However, Figure 1(b) and Figure 2 are using a different notation and it took me quite some time to decode. The caption for Figure 2 "We only plot the hidden states within 1 time step (which also have a period of 1)" is too cryptic to be very helpful. In particular arrows now indicate nonlinear transformations, including implicit input/output nodes. It's particularly confusing in 2a because, without only 2 time slices, it looks like the cyclic representation rather than the unrolled representation (except for the lack of cycles). Next, and I guess you probably won't want to change this, but it seems like your definitions and explanations get significantly heavier and more complicated to allow for m > 1, with very little indication of benefit: If we only allowed RNNs with m=1, would the set of RNNs actually change? Or does the use of m > 1 just make explicit one particular type of structure an RNN can have? If so, what's so special about the period number that we want to call that out in particular? In any case, a sentence or two of discussion to address these questions would be beneficial, I think. Small notes: -In the definition of unfolding, in the definition of V{un}, I think you want a subscript of c on the V? - In the definitions, don't we want to prevent the weight sigma from being negative?
