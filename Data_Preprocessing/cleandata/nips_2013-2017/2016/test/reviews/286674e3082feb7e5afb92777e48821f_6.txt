In the paper the authors try to come up with a theory which works for graph clustering in model free framework. However, the result is naive and unconvincing. In the paper the authors try to come up with a theory which works for graph clustering in model free framework. However, the result is naive and unconvincing. The authors pretend to construct a new theory but theit theory is just a naive handwaving. Just to give a couple of examples: Theorem 1 (Generic Theorem) ... "which also fits G well is close to C" ... Proposition 3 (Informal) ... "under standard recovery conditions" ...
