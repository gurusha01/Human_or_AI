This paper aims a variant of the classical stochastic K-armed bandit problem where the cheap approximations to each arm is available. The authors formalise this problem as a multi-fidelity bandit problem. The theoretical results on regret bound are provided. Simulations are performed to demonstrate the effect of multi-fidelity. The presentation is easy to understand. Simulations demonstrate the effect of MF bandit method. There are sufficient theoretical analysis on the lower bound of the proposed method, which shows the theoretical improvement.
