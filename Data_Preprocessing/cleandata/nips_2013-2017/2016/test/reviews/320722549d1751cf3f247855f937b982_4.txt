In this paper, the authors provide a new approach for solving the classical problem of learning with expert advice (LEA) as well as the problem of online linear optimization (OLO) over Hilbert space. The idea is to reduce these two problem to another classical problem, the coin-betting problem. Then based on an existing coin-betting protocol, the authors are able to obtain parameter-free algorithms for these two problems. The new algorithm for the LEA problem achieves a smaller regret than previous ones, while the new algorithm for the OLO problem matches the regret bound of an existing one. There seems to be a mistake in the proof of Lemma 14, so we are not sure about the correctness of Corollaries 5&6. More precisely, the second inequality below line 430 does not hold: it should be \leq instead \geq because \ln(1+x) \leq x-(1-\ln(2))x^2. Our guess is that Lemma 14 is still correct, but the proof needs to be rewritten. Assuming that the bug can indeed be fixed, we find the paper interesting since it provides a new approach for designing online algorithms. This is achieved by establishing a somewhat unexpected connection to another classical problem, the coin-betting problem, which has a long history of works itself. With the help of such a connection, the authors are able to convert an existing coin-betting protocol into new algorithms for the LEA problem and the OLO problem. The resulting algorithms are parameter free, which means that no parameter tuning is needed, and this adds to the strength of this paper. In addition, the paper is well-written and easy to follow in general. Two possible weakness we find are the following. First, the potential function used by this paper seems rather complex and unintuitive, which may limit its impact. It is not clear if it is easy to design different potential functions to yield different online algorithms, just as what the mirror-descent algorithm can provide. Next, the OLO problem for which the new algorithm works is the unconstrained version, instead of the more popular constrained one. It is not clear if the ideas developed in this paper can be used to solve the more general OLO problem over any convex feasible set.
