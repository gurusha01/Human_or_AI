This paper describes an online sequence-to-sequence model that emits output incrementally as it processes blocks of an input sequence. The map from block input to output is governed by a standard sequence-to-sequence model with additional state carried over from the previous block. Alignment of the two sequences is approximated by a dynamic program using a greedy local search heuristic. Experimental results are presented for phone recognition on TIMIT. An incremental transducer is a natural extension of sequence-to-sequence models. Experimental results on TIMIT indicate that this model can be effectively optimized. I would guess that this model, or future iterations of it, will find lots of applications to data streams. A minor nitpick: the two tables in section 4.2 with two rows each seem a little tacky. Is there a better way to present this data? Also, column 1 of table 2 is empty.
