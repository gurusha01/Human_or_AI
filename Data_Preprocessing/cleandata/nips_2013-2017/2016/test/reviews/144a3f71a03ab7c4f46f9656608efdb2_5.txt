This paper considers the problem of finding an optimal Bayesian network configuration. In particular the authors show how to incorporate non-decomposable constraints (and in particular ancestral constrains) into the structure learning approach of Chen et al. [2015, 2016]. Empirical evaluation of the proposed approach against ILP based approaches shows orders of magnitude improvements. The authors rephrase the problem as a MaxSAT problem with specific constraints. While my expertise in with this approach is limited the results (runtime comparison) seem quite impressive. Specifically the authors show a runtime reduction by orders of magnitude relative to alternative methods.
