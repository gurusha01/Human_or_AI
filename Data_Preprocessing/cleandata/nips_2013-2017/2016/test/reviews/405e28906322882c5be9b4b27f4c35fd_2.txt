In the stationary setting, with the same distribution for all time steps, a good online player can choose the optimal one with a high confidence. But in the non-stationary world, the distribution may drift as time evolves. In this paper, the authors partition the se-quences into \Gamma intervals, with each interval having a station-ary distribution. They also introduce a parameter V to denote the difference between the means of consecutive distributions and use Λ to measures the total statistical variance of the distributions. The paper try to discuss how the different \Gamma ,Λ and V affect the dynamic pseudo-regret, in both full-information and bandit set-tings. The work is well motivated and investigates an interesting problem of tracking the dynamic regret of sequential prediction in the non-stationary stochastic environment. This paper was well-written and generally comprehensible to someone without experience in the on-line learning or the prior work dis-cussed here. The contribution seems to be novel and significant. There were a few places where the presentation could be improved, and some of the results were difficult to evaluate. 1. Line 115: what does at mean in l{t,at}? 2. The theorem 2.1 appeared with no discussion. Why did you give out theorem 2.1 here? 3. Algorithm1: why does you use the equidistant interval for [(m-1)B+1,mB]? The distribution may have different lengths of interval. Are you sure that the different partitions will not affect your regret bound (from you Note.1 in page4)? 4. Line 147: How to get the formula (2)? 5. Line 162: What is N? 6. Line 174-175: How to get the formula of B? 7. Line 186&190: The symbolic interpretation should be coincident, such as expert k or arm k? 6. Page6,Line 215 : hides a ln ln T factor? What is the difference of Switching distribution and drifting distribution? Just consider \Gamma for switching and V for drifting? 7. Page5: Actually, it is hard to understand from Sec3.3. What does w{t,k} and m_{t,k} mean? It seems like Exponential weighted average. How can we get the formula (6). The logic of this section is very confusing. 8. Page7-Sec4: They only discuss the actionss of K=2, which I think it is an appeared limitation here. The paper ended in haste. The references are uncomplete. The following two papers are highly related with this paper: "Tracking the Best Expert "-Mark Herbster, Manfred K. Warmuth and Switching Portfolios Yoram Singer 98. The author can compare your model and result with them.
