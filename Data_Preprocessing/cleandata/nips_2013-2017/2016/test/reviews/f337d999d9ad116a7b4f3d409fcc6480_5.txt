The paper describes a technique for estimating a weights matrix, corresponding to brain neural connectivity. The technique combines several machine learning tools. The result may be of extreme importance to neuroscientists. This is entirely out of my area, and my review relates only to the technical contribution in terms of the novelty of the proposed algorithm.
