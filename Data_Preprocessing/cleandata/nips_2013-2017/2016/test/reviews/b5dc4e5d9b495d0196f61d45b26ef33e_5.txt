The paper considers a non-smooth optimization problem with a composite objective, the first part of which is given by an explicit max structure. By combining Nesterov's smoothing and acceleration with Yang and Lin's recent result [23], the authors propose a homotopy method which converges at a rate potentially faster than O(1/\epsilon). The actual rate depends on the error bound parameter \theta, and the paper gives some examples of functions for which the error bound holds. The paper is well written and easy to read. It uses familiar ideas and proof techniques from convex optimization, but presents them in an elegant way, resulting in what seems to be the first analysis of Nesterov smoothing and acceleration that gives a faster rate than O(1/\epsilon) for non-smooth functions. The result relies on the local error bound property. The authors make a connection between this class and other properties of functions commonly studied in convex optimization, such as local strong convexity, and the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz property. I would have liked to see these and other connections further discussed, and I encourage the authors to compare their work to some other related works such as [1,2]. Another concern is how knowledge of the constants c and theta affects the performance of the algorithm. Prior knowledge of these constants seems essential for applying the algorithm, and the authors should discuss how they can be estimated, or in which applications it is reasonable to assume knowledge of these constants. Section 4.4 hints that the primal-dual version of the algorithm can solve this problem, but this is not convincing and the discussion should be significantly expanded. Below are additional comments that I encourage the authors to consider: - The comment on line 75 (it can be made sharp by some transformation) is ambiguous. To clarify, you should refer to Definition 4 and the following remark. - The proofs seem to be heavily inspired from [23]. This should be acknowledged. - The notation for the dual norm is not standard, is there a particular reason for this? - Equation (11) can be improved by moving the quantifier to the beginning. - In applications, discuss whether the constant c is typically dimension independent. - Line 231, minx F(x) has a polyhedral epigraph: this statement does not make sense to me, since minx F(x) is a scalar, and has no epigraph. - The example Line 240-242: this function is not necessarily locally strongly convex, if x^ - x \in Null(A) then ||x - x^|| > 0 but F(x) - F(x^*) = 0. Perhaps the authors meant that this function satisfies condition (10) - Define what o-minimal structure means (line 252) [1] Zhi-Quan Luo and Paul Tseng, Error bounds and convergence analysis of feasible descent methods: a general approach.
