Rahimi and Recht[21] formulation for binary classification problem is extended to (6). In (6), \hat{q} is inserted compared to (5). The \hat{q} is a solution of (4). (4) is also binary classification problem, but not include the regularizer. There are not so much difference between Rahimi and Recht[21] But the generalisation error is better than[21]. Also computational speed is not but. The proposed modification is useful.
