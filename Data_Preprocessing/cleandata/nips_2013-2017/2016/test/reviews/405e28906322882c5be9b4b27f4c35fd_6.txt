The paper investigates on the regret of sequential prediction in nonstationary environments. A parameter Λ has been introduced, denoting the variance of the loss distributions over the process. The paper presents a study on such parameter and how it affects the prediction regret. In particular, the interaction of Λ with other distribution measures, such as the number of times distributions change or distribution deviation over time, is investigated. A derivation of the regret lower bound is also shown. The paper looks promising but at the same time it seems to be incomplete. Experimental results proving the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms would give robustness and reliability to achieved theoretical results. Abstract is unclear and must be rewritten. Symbols and parameters are not well defined and it is not clear in which context (equations, algorithms,...) they are introduced. The same occurs in the introduction. In page 2, line 44, UCB is not defined. Overall, clearness must be improved. Bibliography must be improved as several works exist in the literature on best expert tracking.
