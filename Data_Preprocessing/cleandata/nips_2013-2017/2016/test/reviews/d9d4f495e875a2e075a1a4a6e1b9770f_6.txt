The authors propose a model that predicts pixels in video conditioned on the actions. The authors also plan to provide the dataset of 50k robot interactions as part of the contribution. They evaluate the model not only on the robot interaction dataset but also on human motion prediction. While the model is clear and the dataset creation part is clear the figures showing the predictions are very hard and it would have been great if the authors provided supplementary material of videos.
