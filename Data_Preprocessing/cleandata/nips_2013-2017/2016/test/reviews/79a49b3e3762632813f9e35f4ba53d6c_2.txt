The paper presents algorithms for estimating class priors as well as posteriors from noisy positives and unlabeled data. The paper closes follows the methodology in Jain et.al., 2016; however, that work was restricted to pure positives case. The improvements over jain et.al. are illustrated in the simulations. 1. Recent work [1] (see below) is not cited; whereas the authors of [1] achieve improvement over Jain et.al., 2016. I think it will be helpful if in theory and in simulations the proposed methodology is compare to [1]. 2. Given Jain et.al, the novelty and technicality in the proofs seems to be limited.
