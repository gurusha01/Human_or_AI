This paper proposes a new interpretation of parameter-free algorithms by showing the characteristic of these parameter-free algorithms to be coin-betting with maximal reward. It starts from using a betting algorithm based on the Krichevsky-Trofimov estimator with coin-betting potential function, and then generalizes it to online learning optimization over Hibert Space and Learning with expert advices. Real-world datasets also demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed algorithm. This paper provides novel understanding of parameter-free algorithms as coin-betting with maximal reward. Based on their understanding, several new algorithms for online convex optimization and learning with experts. The whole paper is well organized and readers can easily follow this paper. Overall, this is a complete work with novel interpretations.
