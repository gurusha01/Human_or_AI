The paper proposes refined optimization methods for learning additive factorial HMMs, motivated by the application to energy disaggregation. The method is compared to baseline approaches both on synthetic and real-world data sets. The technical quality seems very solid. Overall, the presentation is good, but the authors should do a check for grammatical errors. The potential societal impact of this work is high. I would rank the originality of lower, as there exists already quite a bit of work in this direction. The experiments suggest substantial improvements over existing methods, so I'd consider this a significant improvement over the state-of-the-art. In their rebuttal, the authors carefully addressed concerns by some of the reviewers about the novelty and scalability of their method, and the comparison with results obtained by Kolter and Jaakkola (2012).
