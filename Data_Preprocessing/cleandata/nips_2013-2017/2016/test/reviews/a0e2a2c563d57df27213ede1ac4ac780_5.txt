The paper adds to the region sparsity model an inhibition of return mechanism, and investigates the relationship of the new model with visual attention. Studies on sparsity and attention have been there for a while, e.g., Hou, Harel, and Koch (PAMI 2012). The authors claim the link of the two in the manuscript, yet failed to provide theoretical justifications, thus the link appears somewhat superficial in this work. It is a good idea to consider inhibition of return in attention models, yet the current addition looks ad-hoc. It would help if the authors could elaborate this part, with mathematics or experiments. For example, for the latter, I would expect experimental results showing with and without this mechanism for a direct comparison and demonstration of its effectiveness. Sections 2 and 3 are quite disconnected from the rest. In fact they look similar in form with ref [29]. I would suggest the authors to reformat and to fit in the current context, i.e., visual attention. The authors design and report several task paradigms, which are nice. The qualitative figures, however, did not explicitly show the strength of the new approach in these contexts. Test stimuli are simple, say with one or two objects in relatively isolated scenes. It is not clear whether the accuracy is achieved due to straightforward factors like they are object regions, or they are large objects. I would expect experiemental demonstrations on more complex scenes, and a more thorough discussion on this. I would change the visualization of the maps, the current heatmap blocks the original stimuli and the human fixations to quite a large extent.
