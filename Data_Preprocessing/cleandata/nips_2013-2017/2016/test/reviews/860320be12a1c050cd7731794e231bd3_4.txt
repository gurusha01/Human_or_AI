Three complexity measures of recurrent neural networks is proposed for recurrent neural networks. 1. recurrent depth; 2. feedforward depth; 3. recurrent skip coefficients. Experimental results on parsing, language modeling, program modeling, and image modeling evaluates the importance of these complexity measures on these applications. I think this paper provides a useful empirical evaluation on the effects of different complexity measures. The evaluation is very useful to the community.
