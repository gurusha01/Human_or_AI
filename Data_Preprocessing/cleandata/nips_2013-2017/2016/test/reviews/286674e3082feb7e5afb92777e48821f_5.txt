This paper provides very general concentration guarantees based on spectral clustering techniques for all types of community detection problems. They prove these guarantees for different generative models without having to use any of the parameters from those models. The work was interesting, relevant and advances a popular area of study in an important direction. This paper posed a very interesting question about the stability of solutions for the problem of community detection. They phrased and proved these results in great generality while also focusing and applying them to specific popular graphical models of interest. This paper was also very well written and a easy and enjoyable read. They explained the motivation behind almost all of the ways they chose to define error and make assumptions required for their proofs. The only real criticism I had while reading this paper, which the authors themselves even point out in their conclusion, is that these proofs did depend on spectral algorithms and results which are not tight and are even almost intractable for many of the most interesting community detection problems when graphs are very sparse. That being said, this was a great start into a field of stability results for community detection that I hope and expect to be progressed even further in the near future.
