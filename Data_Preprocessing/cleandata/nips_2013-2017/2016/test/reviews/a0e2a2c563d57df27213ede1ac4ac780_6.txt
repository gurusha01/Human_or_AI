This paper introduces a technique which modifies the Region Ranking SVM to become a biologically plausible visual attention attention model. Given that the Region Ranking SVM puts emphasis on a small amount of non-uniform regions of visual space to do its classification, it makes sense that those areas are most salient for classification. By choosing an fixation order based on the RRSVM and adding an inhibition of return mechanism, it allows visual search to maximally attend to areas of importance while decreasing the likelihood of attending to nearby already-attended areas. The results show physiologically-consistent behaviour and well as better or comparable results to other similar techniques. It also presents situations where the algorithm does not behave as well, which is very good to understand the benefits and limitations of this work such that future work can use this as a foundation. The paper is well-written and the experiments are useful, thorough, and well-explained. In terms of novelty, the RRSVM does the bulk of the work here and it is a straightforward progression to use the most important areas as fixation points for visual attention. However, the use of inhibition of return and positioning the work in a physiological domain (including the results) makes the work more valuable than just using the RRSVM. The lack of biological plausibility in the implementation of the RRSVM might be a reason that the entire framework is not investigated further for a more direct understanding of biological visual search. Ignoring the specifics of the implementation and the incremental nature of the work, and focusing on the concept and experimental method/results, this is useful to shine some light on biological visual attention.
