This paper presents an efficient approximate solution for the task of energy disaggregation for home appliance monitoring formulated as a binary quadratic program -- equation (2). First equation (2) is relaxed into a convex problem (7) by introducing new variables. Then, it is relaxed again as a SDP problem with continuous variables leading to problem (8). Also, they proposed to use a variant of alternating direction method of multipliers for solving this large SDP. Binary variable are then obtained via via randomized rounding. The proposed solution appear to be superior to the one previously proposed by Kolter & Jaakkola (2012) with respect to several measures quantifying the accuracy of load disaggregation solutions. The paper is well-written, almost self contained, easy to read and represents a significant piece of work. Its global organization could be improved since we have a subsection 1.1 without 1.2, a 3.1 without 3.2 and a 4.1 without 4.2. The interesting point of the paper is the global methodology used to solve the initial optimization problem. The whole Machine learning community would benefit from the techniques used in this paper. details/typos L75: in the indicator function equation 1 and 2: K -> K_i L189: yet.Kolter -> yet. Kolter
