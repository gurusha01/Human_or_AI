The paper proposes an alternative for the Gaussian Mixture Models, namely a Locally Adaptive Normal Distribution. The proposed distribution is based on Riemannian Manifolds. The paper proposes an MLE estimator for the parameters of the distribution, and evaluates the method using experiments on both artificial and real world data. The paper is well written, with sound theory and good experiments. However, compared with Simo-Serra & al.[19], the paper does not provide a potent novelty. The differences between the proposed method and the state-of-the-art is not well explained before the reader reaches the conclusion. These differences should have been made clear since the introduction (Note that ref [19] is absent from the introduction).
