The paper gives a relationship between different distances of clustering. The paper considers the network models such as Preference Frame Model (PFM) and Stochastic Block Model (SBM) and proves a locally convex-like property for clustering. It is shown that for any two clusterings, which estimate the parameters of the model fitted to the network data equally well, are also near each other in terms of mis-classification distance measures. The paper gives a nice property of clusterings in network data. The property of equivalence between the different measures of distance of clusterings for network data has been stated and proved in the paper. The paper gives both theoretical and experimental validations of the results stated in the paper. The results given in the paper are novel, but there has been recently some works of similar flavor in network literature like Peng, Sun and Zanetti (COLT, 2015), Chao, Lu, Ma, Zhou (Arxiv, 2015). The theoretical parts of the paper are also quite simple extensions of well-known results. As mentioned in the paper, the work can have some applications in detecting clusterability, but the formal results in that regard were not provided in the paper. The paper is well-written and explains the core ideas of the paper quite lucidly.
