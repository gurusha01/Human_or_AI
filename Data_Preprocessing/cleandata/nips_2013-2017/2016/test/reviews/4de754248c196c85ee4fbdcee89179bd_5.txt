The authors provide a method used to estimate the energy consumption in a domestic house. They propose a system based on an additive factorial hidden Markov model and, with respect to previous implementations, they add an additional constraint to the objective function to be minimized, in order to account sudden changes in the level of power consumption. The paper is really interesting and it propose a technical sound methodologies, which can be applied to tackle the important issue of managing energy consumption. I was already positive for what concerns the value of novelty in the presented study, comments of reviewers and authors feedback confirmed my position. My most serious concern at this point is the same raised from some reviewers, about providing a study on the computational complexity of the method proposed. Indeed, the authors discuss it in the rebuttal and I think it should be included in the final version of the paper. However, given the nature of the problem tackled, I believe a more formal study should be provided. Finally, the paper is quite technical and I believe a poster presentation would be much more suitable to present it.
