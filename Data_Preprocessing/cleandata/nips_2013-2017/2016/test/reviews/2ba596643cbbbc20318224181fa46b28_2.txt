This work introduces a new multi arm bandit setting where each arm can be drawn with different accuracies (or fidelities). The cost of pulling an arm increases with the desired accuracy, and the regret is defined as the product of the cost by the usual pseudo regret. The authors propose an algorithm which address this setting, MF-UCB, and provide an upper bound and a lower bound on the cumulative pseudo-regret of this algorithm. The main paper is clear and well written. However this is not the case of the supplementary materials, where most of the proofs are. they contain many typos and small, easily correctable errors which can confuse the reader (see below for a non exhaustive list). The correction of those errors would greatly increase the readability of the paper. Additionally, I think the up-to-a-multiplicative-constant signs used in the paper can be a bit misleading, as constants are not really constants : for instance in Theorem 2, there is a factor \rho (a parameter of the algorithm) which is hidden in the constant. Using the exact inequalities (which are written in the supplementary materials) could improve the clarity of the results. From a practical point of view, it is not clear to me that this algorithm can easily be applied to real life problems. For instance the strategy of MF-UCB (using low accurate pulls to eliminate greatly suboptimal arms) could suffer from inaccurate estimation of the \zeta (the fidelity accuracy). I think that a discussion on the practical limitation, and how to overcome them, would benefit this work From a theoretical perspective, this paper provides a nice insight into the problem, as well as interesting theorems and solid proofs. Overall I think that this work is a significant and interesting contribution.
