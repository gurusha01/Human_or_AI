This paper concerns a method to find the connectivity map between "voxels of a template brain" using several viral injections that trace the anatomy of the involved neurons. Such viral approaches to connectomics have gained popularity in the last ~10 years. Recently, the Allen Institute released one such dataset. Here, the authors refine the connectivity inference routine of that original paper. The paper suggests a reasonable approach and proposes a method to infer the connectivity. The results show that the proposed method outperforms the baseline, which assumes that connectivity is homogeneous within brain regions. In this sense, the proposed method is a relaxation of the baseline. I think this approach is valuable in revealing the major connectivity themes (similar to diffusion MRI). However, the smoothness constraint also somewhat defeats the purpose of the complicated neuroanatomy. It would be helpful to discuss the linear model: it assumes that the fluorescence grows linearly with the injection sites. In the original dataset, the composite data is obtained from many brains and a template brain is formed. This should be explained. More importantly, expressions such as "the number of voxels in the brain" should be avoided.
