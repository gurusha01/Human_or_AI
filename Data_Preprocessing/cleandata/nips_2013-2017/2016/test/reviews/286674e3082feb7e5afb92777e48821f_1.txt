The authors propose new theoretical results on graph clustering that do not make assumptions on the generation of the graph under study (the observed graph is not assumed to have been generated according to a specific generative model such as the stochastic block model). The main idea of the paper is that if a graph clustering method is able to discover a clustering that fits the graph reasonably (for a certain definition) then any other clustering that fits as well the graph should be close to the first one. This paper is very interesting and addresses in my opinion a very important problem by providing distribution free results for graph clustering. While some of the content has been moved to the supplementary materials due to the page number restriction of the conference, the paper is quite clear and can be read without referring to this additional content. I'm not convinced that the use of "hats" on the actual observation (e.g. \hat{L} for the observed Laplacian) is a good choice, but apart from this detail, the paper is reasonably clear. The results themselves are very interesting and well commented and illustrated. They are however not without limitations. As shown in the experimental part, on some real world data, the graph has to be smoothed in order for some structure to be recoverable (in the sense of the theoretical framework developed by the authors), whereas many classical algorithms are able to recover the ground truth structure. In addition, and maybe more importantly, two limitations appear: 1) the main result for PFM uses a non standard distance measure between clusterings. The authors argue that this measure might be seen as more natural than the classical one, but this is questionable. 2) the results are based on a form of "proxy" model, in the sense that from a clustering, a model (e.g. a PFM) is reconstructed and this model is compared to the original graph (rather than whatever model that was used to obtain the clustering). This is very natural in the context chosen by the authors, but this has also the effect of constraining strongly the notion of what is a good clustering for a given graph (here, this means that the graph is well approximated in the normalized Laplacian sense). This is obviously needed to obtain actual results, but one might wonder what are the impact of those restrictions especially considering the limitations faced by the framework on some real world examples.
