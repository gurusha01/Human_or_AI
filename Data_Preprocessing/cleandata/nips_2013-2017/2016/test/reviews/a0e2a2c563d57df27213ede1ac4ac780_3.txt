The authors augment a model of image classification, RRSVM, with a simple diversity mechanism, and achieve state-of-the-art results in predicting the location of human gaze fixations during visual search. Preface: I am not a vision researcher (either behavioral or computational). I think this paper is an accept -- the premise of using a classification model for predicting search fixations is clever, this achieves state of the art performance, and the work is clearly presented. Some suggestions for improvement: 1. What is the split-half AUC for the human data? If the models have higher AUC than this, it's probably a sign that you should collect more data. Conversely, the human AUC can provide a natural upper bound on model AUC -- assuming you have a reliable estimate of human AUC, it would be hard to fault you if your model AUC didn't exceed this. 2. Can you provide a measure of uncertainty for the mean AUCs of RRSVM and SDR? e.g., run these with different validation sets and report standard error of the mean; it would be nice to show that the 0.85 score of SDR is significantly different from the 0.81 score of RRSVM. 3. Out of curiosity: I take it on faith that AUC is the most widely used metric for fixation prediction, but why doesn't the field use something like log-likelihood of the human data under the priority map? 4. The writing in section 2 strikes me as pretty similar to section 3.1 of Wei and Hoai's original CVPR paper on RRSVM. If you are not actually Wei and Hoai, consider revising the language to be more distinctive. 5. As a non-computer-vision person, it would be helpful to know exactly what regions RRSVM searches over. Looking at Wei and Hoai, the regions appear to be rectangular but it's not clear how large/small they can be, how many possible regions there are, etc. Also, it would be helpful to know how much the SDR region selection function Psi reduces the dimensionality of the region space. 6. Table 1 shows that all the models take a performance hit on the and sofa items. Looking at Wei and Hoai, it appears that base RRSVM also takes a performance hit in classification -- is there something to say here about the relationship between classification and fixation prediction? (e.g., is good classification prediction necessary for good fixation prediction?) ----- Update: I read the other reviews and the rebuttal, which seems to adequately address the technical issues raised by reviewers, so I am still in favor of this paper.
