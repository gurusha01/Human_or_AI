The paper investigates the problem of estimating the power consumed by each appliances in a household from the time series measurements of total energy consumed. The authors solve the problem with an additive factorial HMM model and infer the estimates using a few clever tricks including casting it as a convex semidefinite relaxation, random rounding, and an efficient and scalable alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). They demonstrates its efficacy on a simulated data set. This paper tackles an intriguing problem and is well-written. Their solution, which is complex and contains several components, is explained in stages where each stage naturally follows from the previous one. Even for a reader not familiar with the problem domain, the paper is self-contained. After reading the paper, the one question that was unclear is how are the number of appliances estimated? Perhaps, the authors could elaborate on this in Section 5. It would also be useful to know how sensitive this choice is during the empirical evaluation.
