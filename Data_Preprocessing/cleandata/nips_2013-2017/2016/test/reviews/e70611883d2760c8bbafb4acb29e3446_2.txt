The authors present a supervised kernel learning method by random features. Starting from a kernel alignment problem, an efficient technique is developed and supported by theoretical analyses. They report on empirical results. The technical contribution is strong. Also the writeup is clear. The empirical evaluation however leaves room for improvement although it is already comprehensive in terms of the studied settings. Nevertheless, it would be interested to compare the proposed approach with, say, standard MKL using a linear combination of many Gaussians (differently parameterized) or some other kernel learning technique. Another baseline that I am missing would be a Gaussian kernel where the bandwidth has been optimized by model selection techniques (cross-validation). In my view this would strengthen the argument in favor of the proposed method.
