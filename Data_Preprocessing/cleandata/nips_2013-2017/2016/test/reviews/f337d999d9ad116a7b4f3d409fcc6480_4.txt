This paper applies a regularized multivariate regression method to an interesting task of recovering the neural connectivity of the visual cortex of the mouse brain at a finer level by estimating a large spare coefficient matrix. Experiment results on real data shows the improved performance over the results at the coarser regional level. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- I adjust the score after reading the rebuttal and comments of other reviewers. The main contribution of this paper is to apply regularized regression method to an interesting application from neural science, which estimates the connectivity maps of mouse brain. The author extends the work of [17] by solving the problem at a finer Voxel level which corresponds to a larger regression coefficient (5000x5000 matrix). However, from the viewpoint of modeling, it is just a smoothing penalized multivariate linear regression model for the least squares problem, which is very similar to many existing matrix/tensor completion methods, thus the novelty is rather limited. For experiments, the author didn't compare with any other methods, so we don't known whether the proposed method is good enough or not. I think more algorithms and baselines should be included in the comparison.
