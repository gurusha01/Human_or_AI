The manuscript presents a set of algorithms for clustering over graphs, and for testing whether two cluster assignments are similar. As mentioned above, although the algorithms themselves are clear, their motivation and the reason why they appear as a list of algorithms is not well explained. The algorithms themselves are modifications of existing ones, and the only novelty is the constraints presented at the end.
