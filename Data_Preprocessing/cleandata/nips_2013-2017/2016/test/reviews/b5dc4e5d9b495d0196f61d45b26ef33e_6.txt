The authors propose a new optimization algorithm based on a homotopy smoothing, which requires O(1/eps^(1-\theta)\log(1/\eps)) iterations to achieve an eps gap towards the optimal objective value. Based on my understanding of existing literature, most of the results in this paper are known or straightforward generalization of known results. For example: (1) Zhang et al. (2012) has shown that for sigma-strongly convex function, an iteration complexity of O(eps^{-1/2}sigma^{-1}). The analysis in Zhang et al. (2012) can be further extended to locally strongly convex optimization, which is identical to the result in this paper on Line 237 of Page 7. Zhang et al. (2012) Smoothing Multivariate Performance Measures. JMLR --http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume13/zhang12d/zhang12d.pdf (2) The KL condition on Line 243 of Page 7 is also known as the Polyak-Lojasiewicz, or gradient dominated condition. There have been quite a few papers, which used the PL condition to relax the strong convexity. I suggest the authors to give more concrete justifications of the significance of the proposed algorithm.
