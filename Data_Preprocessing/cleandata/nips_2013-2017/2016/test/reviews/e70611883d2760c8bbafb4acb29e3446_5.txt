The paper extended the random features for kernel machines work of Rahimi and Recht by developing an efficient optimization method allowing to learn a kernel. The empirical evaluations suggested its effectiveness. It's not quite straightforward to follow the exact steps of the math, but the key parts seem make sense. The heuristic part of the method obviously influence the efficiency, but it hasn't been evaluated. The performance comparison only involves the previous method with three different kernels. I'd also like to see what would be the results if it includes other known efficient methods, since the paper claims the its general superiority.
