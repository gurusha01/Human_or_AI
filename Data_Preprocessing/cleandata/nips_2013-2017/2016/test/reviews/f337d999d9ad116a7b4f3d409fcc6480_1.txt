This paper presents a structured regression model for inferring neural connectivity from viral tracing data. Combining a nonnegativity constraint, a spatial smoothness regularizer, a low-rank assumption, and a mask that handles ambiguity within the injection site, the authors derive a model that can leverage observed tracer data to infer the underlying connectivity. While the individual components of this model have been explored in other structured regression problems, this paper presents a thorough and well-executed application of these ideas to an interesting problem. The underlying model is a non-negative linear regression, y = Wx + \eta, where \eta is drawn from a spherical Gaussian model. The weight matrix, W, is assumed to be nonnegative and, in probabilistic terms, drawn from a spatially smooth prior. Optionally, a low-rank assumption may be incorporated into the weight model, which can dramatically improve memory efficiency for large-scale problems. While the individual components of this model (nonnegative regression, Laplacian regularized least squares, low-rank constraints) are well-studied, I think this is a nice combination and application of these techniques to a real-world, scientific problem. The presentation of the model, the synthetic examples, and the real world applications (and supplementary movies) are particularly clear. While it is certainly valid to directly construct a objective function that captures both the reconstruction error and the domain-specific constraints and inductive biases, I think a probabilistic perspective could elucidate a number of potential extensions and connections to existing work. For example, Jonas and Kording [1] tackle a similar connectomics problem by formulating a probabilistic generative model in terms of latent variables of each neuron. While the setup is somewhat different (theirs is an unsupervised modeling problem whereas yours is framed as a regression problem), one could imagine a similar set of latent variables serving as a prior for your weight matrix. Similarly, from a probabilistic perspective, the Gaussian noise model is not particularly realistic given that the fluorescence observations are nonnegative. Likewise, the spherical covariance seems likely to be a strong assumption. While these may justifiable and computationally advantageous simplifications, it is worth discussing. Finally, the orthogonal projector, P_{\Omega}, seems like a rather fancy way of saying that your loss function is only summing over observable voxels.
