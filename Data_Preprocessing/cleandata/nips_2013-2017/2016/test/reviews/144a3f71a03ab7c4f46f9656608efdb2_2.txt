The authors present a method that leverages a given set of ancestral constraints to inform the (admissible) heuristic for an exhaustive search algorithm. I found the experiments a bit confusing. Given the existing approaches of EC and GOB, Table 1 compares (EC + new work) to (GOB + new work'). If I understand this correctly, Table 3 is then comparing EC to GOB (or did I get this wrong?). It seems that it would make sense to do an explicit comparison between (EC + new work) and EC - although the (GOB + new work') vs GOB is interesting, it seems that EC is so much better than GOB that even if GOB benefited much more than EC from the new work, we would still want to go with (EC + new work).
