This paper proposed COCONET, which is a neural autoregressive model with convolution, to do music composition task. This paper also proposed to use blocked Gibbs sampling instead of the ancestral sampling of the original NADE model to generate better pieces of music. The experimental results showed that the NLL of COCONET is better than the other baselines and the human evaluation task by Amazon's Mechanical Turk illustrated that the model can generate compelling music.
In general, I think the paper is good. Using NADE based model with convolution operations on music generation tasks and using blocked Gibbs sampling contains some kind of novelty. However, the novelty of the paper is incremental, since the blocked Gibbs sampling for NADE model is already proposed by Yao et al., (2014) and the using NADE based model for music modeling has also been proposed by Boulanger-Lewandowski  et al., (2012).
