The paper presents a method to synthesize string manipulation programs based on a set of input output pairs. The paper focuses on a restricted class of programs based on a simple context free grammar sufficient to solve string manipulation tasks from the FlashFill benchmark. A probabilistic generative model called Recursive-Reverse-Recursive Neural Network (R3NN) is presented that assigns a probability to each program's parse tree after a bottom-up and a top-down pass. Results are presented on a synthetic dataset and a Microsoft Excel benchmark called FlashFill.
The problem of program synthesis is important with a lot of recent interest from the deep learning community. The approach taken in the paper based on parse trees and recursive neural networks seems interesting and promising. However, the model seems too complicated and unclear at several places (details below). On the negative side, the experiments are particularly weak, and the paper does not seem ready for publication based on its experimental results. I was positive about the paper until I realized that the method obtains an accuracy of 38% on FlashFill benchmark when presented with only 5 input-output examples but the performance degrades to 29% when 10 input-output examples are used. This was surprising to the authors too, and they came up with some hypothesis to explain this phenomenon. To me, this is a big problem indicating either a bug in the code or a severe shortcoming of the model. Any model useful for program synthesis needs to be applicable to many input-output examples because most complicated programs require many examples to disambiguate the details of the program.
Given the shortcoming of the experiments, I am not convinced that the paper is ready for publication. Thus, I recommend weak reject. I encourage the authors to address the comments below and resubmit as the general idea seems promising.
More comments:
I am unclear about the model at several places:
- How is the probability distribution normalized? Given the nature of bottom-up top-down evaluation of the potentials, should one enumerate over different completions of a program and the compare their exponentiated potentials? If so, does this restrict the applicability of the model to long programs as the enumeration of the completions gets prohibitively slow?
- What if you only use 1 input-output pair for each program instead of 5? Do the results get better?
- Section 5.1.2 is not clear to me. Can you elaborate by potentially including some examples? Does your input-output representation pre-supposes a fixed number of input-output examples across tasks (e.g. 5 or 10 for all of the tasks)?
Regarding the experiments,
- Could you present some baseline results on FlashFill benchmark based on previous work?
- Is your method only applicable to short programs? (based on the choice of 13 for the number of instructions)
- Does a program considered correct when it is identical to a test program, or is it considered correct when it succeeds on a set of held-out input-output pairs?
- When using 100 or more program samples, do you report the accuracy of the best program out of 100 (i.e. recall) or do you first filter the programs based on training input-output pairs and then evaluate a program that is selected?
Your paper is well beyond the recommended limit of 8 pages. please consider making it shorter.
