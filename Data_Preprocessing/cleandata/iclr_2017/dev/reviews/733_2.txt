The authors propose using an LSTM on a sequence of system calls to perform network intrusion detection (NIDS). The idea of using neural networks (in general) for NIDS is old [1]. The idea of using some sort of NN on top of a sequence of system calls for NIDS is published [2]. The idea of using LSTMs for NIDS is published [2]. The paper in [2] operates on counts of N-grams of system calls, rather than on the raw sequence, but that pre-processing does not seem "heavy" to me.
Overall, the proposed system works as well as other proposed NIDS system, and the paper checks portability (which is good).
But, on the con side, I don't see this paper as adding a lot to the state-of-the-art in NIDS. Nor does is the paper well-matched to ICLR. I didn't learn a lot about representations from this paper: many people have thrown LSTM at sequence problems.
Therefore, I think it's below threshold for ICLR. The authors may wish to submit to a security conference.
