This is a good paper with an interesting probabilistic motivation for weighted bag of words models.
The (hopefully soon) added comparison to Wang and Manning will make it stronger. 
Though it is sad that for sufficiently large datasets, NB-SVM still works better.
In the second to last paragraph of the introduction you describe a problem of large cooccurrence counts which was already fixed by the Glove embeddings with their weighting function f.
Minor comments:
"The capturing the similarities" -- typo in line 2 of intro.
"Recently, (Wieting et al.,2016) learned" -- use citet instead of parenthesized citation
