This paper presents a mathematical analysis of how information is propagated through deep feed-forward neural networks, with novel analysis addressing the problem of vanishing and exploding gradients in the backward pass of backpropagation and the use of the dropout algorithm. The paper is clear and well-written, the analysis is thorough, and the experimental results showing agreement with the model are very nice.
