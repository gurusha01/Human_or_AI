The authors present a novel approach to surprise-based intrinsic motivation in deep reinforcement learning. The authors clearly explain the difference from other recent approaches to intrinsic motivation and back up their method with results from a broad class of discrete and continuous action domains. They present two tractable approximations to their framework - one which ignores the stochasticity of the true environmental dynamics, and one which approximates the rate of information gain (somewhat similar to Schmidhuber's formal theory of creativity, fun and intrinsic motivation). The results of this exploration bonus when added to TRPO are generally better than standard TRPO. However, I would have appreciated a more thorough comparison against other recent work on intrinsic motivation. For instance, Bellemare et al 2016 recently achieved significant performance gains on challenging Atari games like Montezuma's Revenge by combining DQN with an exploration bonus, however Montezuma's Revenge is not presented as an experiment here. Such comparisons would significantly improve the strength of the paper.
