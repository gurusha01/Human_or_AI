This paper proposes a method to model time changing dynamics in collaborative filtering.
Comments:
1) The main idea of the paper is build upon similar to a previous work by the same group of author (Wang et.al KDD), the major difference appears to be change some of the latent factors to be RNN
2) The author describes a BPTT technique to train the model  
3) The author introduced time prediction as a new metric to evaluate the effectiveness of time dependent model. However, this need to be condition on a given user-item pair.
4) It would be interesting to consider other metrics, for example
- The switching time where a user changes his/her to another item 
- Jointly predict the next item and switching time. 
In summary, this is a paper that improves over an existing work on time dynamics model in recommender system. The time prediction metric is interesting and opens up interesting discussion on how we should evaluate recommender systems when time is involved (see also comments).
