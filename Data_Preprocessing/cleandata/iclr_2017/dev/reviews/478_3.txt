Pros : 
- New representation with nice properties that are derived and compared with a mathematical baseline and background
- A simple algorithm to obtain the representation
Cons :
- The paper sounds like an applied maths paper, but further analysis on the nature of the representation could be done, for instance, by understanding the nature of each layer, or at least, the first.
