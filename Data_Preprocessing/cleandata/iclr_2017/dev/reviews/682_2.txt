Based on previous work such as the stepped sigmoid units and ReLU hidden units for discriminatively trained supervised models, a Leaky-ReLU model is proposed for generative learning.
Pro: what is interesting is that unlike the traditional way of first defining an energy function and then deriving the conditional distributions, this paper propose the forms of the conditional first and then derive the energy function. However this general formulation is not novel to this paper, but was generalized to exponential family GLMs earlier.
Con: 
Because of the focus on specifying the conditionals, the joint pdf and the marginal p(v) becomes complicated and hard to compute.
On the experiments, it would been nice to see a RBM with binary visbles and leaky ReLu for hiddens. This would demonstrate the superiority of the leaky ReLU hidden units. In addition, there are more results on binary MNIST modeling with which the authors can compare the results to. While the authors is correct that the annealing distribution is no longer Gaussian, perhaps CD-25 or (Faast) PCD experiments can be run to compare agains the baseline RBM trained using (Fast) PCD.
This paper is interesting as it combines new hidden function with the easiness of annealed AIS sampling, However, the baseline comparisons to Stepped Sigmoid Units (Nair &Hinton) or other models like the spike-and-slab RBMs (and others) are missing, without those comparisons, it is hard to tell whether leaky ReLU RBMs are better even in continuous visible domain.
