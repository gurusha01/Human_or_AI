The authors proposed to use leaky rectified linear units replacing binary units in Gaussian RBM.  A sampling method was presented to train the leaky-ReLU RBM. In the experimental section, AIS estimated likelihood on Cifar10 and SVHN were reported.
 It's interesting for trying different nonlinear hidden units for RBM. However, there are some concerns for the current work.
 1. The author did not explain why the proposed sampling method (Alg. 2) is correct. And the additional computation cost (the inner loop and the projection) should be discussed.
 2. The results (both the resulting likelihood and the generative samples) of Gaussian RBM are much worse than what we have experienced. It seems that the Gaussian RBM were not trained properly.
 3. The representation learned from a good generative model often helps the classification task when there are fewer label samples. Gaussian RBM works well for texture synthesis tasks in which mixing is an important issue. The authors are encouraged to do more experiments in these two direction.
