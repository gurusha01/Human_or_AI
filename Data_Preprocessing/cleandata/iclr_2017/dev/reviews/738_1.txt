The findings of applying sparsity in the backward gradients for training LSTMs is interesting. 
But the paper seems incomplete without the proper experimental justification. Only the validation loss is reported which is definitely insufficient. Proper testing results and commonly reported evaluation criterion needs to be included to support the claim of no degradation when applying the proposed sparsity technique. 
Also actual justification of the gains in terms of speed and efficiency would make the paper much stronger.
