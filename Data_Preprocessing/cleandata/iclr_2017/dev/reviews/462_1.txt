This paper proposes a new idea to help defending adversarial examples by training a complementary classifier to detect them. The results of the paper show that adversarial examples in fact can be easily detected. Moreover, such detector generalizes well to other similar or weaker adversarial examples. The idea of this paper is simple but non-trivial. While no final scheme is proposed in the paper how this idea can help in building defensive systems, it actually provides a potential new direction. Based on its novelty, I suggest an acceptance.
My main concern of this paper is about its completeness. No effective method is reported in the paper to defend the dynamic adversaries. It could be difficult to do so, but rather the paper doesn't seem to put much effort to investigate this part. How difficult it is to defend the dynamic adversaries is an important and interesting question following the conclusions of this paper. Such investigation may essentially help improve our understanding of adversarial examples.
That being said, the novelty of this paper is still significant.
Minor comment:
The paper needs to improve its clarity. Some important details are skipped in the paper. For example, the paper should provide more details about the dynamic adversaries and the dynamic adversary training method.
