The paper seeks to predict user events (interactions with items at a particular point in time). Roughly speaking the contributions are as follows:
(a) the paper models the co-evolutionary process of users' preferences toward items
(b) the paper is able to incorporate external sources of information, such as user and item features
(c) the process proposed is generative, so is able to estimate specific time-points at which events occur
(d) the model is able to account for non-linearities in the above
Following the pre-review questions, I understand that it is the combination of (a) and (c) that is the most novel aspect of the paper. A fully generative process which can be sampled is certainly nice (though of course, non-generative processes like regular old regression can estimate specific time points and such too, so not sure in practice how relevant this distinction is).
Other than that the above parts have all appeared in some combination in previous work, though the combination of parts here certainly passes the novelty bar.
I hadn't quite followed the issue mentioned in the pre-review discussion that the model requires multiple interactions per userXitem pair in order to fit the model (e.g. a user interacts with the same business multiple times). This is a slightly unusual setting compared to most temporal recommender systems work. I question to some extent whether this problem setting isn't a bit restrictive. That being said I take the point about why the authors had to subsample the Yelp data, but keeping only users with "hundreds" of events means that you're left with a very biased sample of the user base.
Other than the above issues, the paper is technically nice, and the experiments include strong baselines and reports good performance.
