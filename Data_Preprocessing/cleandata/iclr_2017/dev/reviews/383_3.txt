Authors learn deep architectures on a few small vision problems using Q-learning and obtain solid results, SOTA results when limiting to certain types of layers and competitive against everything else. It would be good to know how well this performs when allowing more complex structures. Paper would be much more convincing on a real-size task such as ImageNet.
