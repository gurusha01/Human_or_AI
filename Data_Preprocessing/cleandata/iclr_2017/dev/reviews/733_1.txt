This paper presents an anomaly-based host intrusion detection method. LSTM RNN is used to model the system-call sequences and the averaged sequence likelihood is then used to determine anomaly, which is the attack. This paper also compares an ensemble method with two baselines as classification model.
+This is is well written and more of ideas are clearly presented.
+It demonstrates an interesting application of LSTM sequential modeling to HIDS problem
-The overall novelty is limited considering the major technical components like LSTM RNN and ensemble method are already established. 
-The contribution of the proposed ensemble method needs further evaluation because it is also possible to use ensemble ideas in kNN and kMC baselines.
