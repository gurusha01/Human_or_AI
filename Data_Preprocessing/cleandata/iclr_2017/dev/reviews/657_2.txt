The paper proposes a series of tricks for compressing fast (linear) text classification models. The paper is clearly written, and the results are quite strong. The main compression is achieved via product quantization, a technique which has been explored in other applications within the neural network model compression literature. In addition to the Gong et al. work which was cited, it would be worth mentioning Quantized Convolutional Neural Networks for Mobile Devices (CVPR 2016,
