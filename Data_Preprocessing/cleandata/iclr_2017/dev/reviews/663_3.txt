This paper presents a system approach to combine multiple modalities to perform classification in a practical scenario (e-commerce).
In general, I find the proposed approach in the paper sound and solid, but do not see novelty in the paper: feature fusion and decision time fusion are both standard practices in multi-modal analysis, and the rest of the paper offers no surprise in implementing such approaches. This seems to be a better fit for venues that focus more on production systems, and seems to be a bad fit for ICLR where the focus is more on research of novel algorithms and theories.
