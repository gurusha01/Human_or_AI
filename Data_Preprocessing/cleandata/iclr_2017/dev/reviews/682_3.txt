The authors propose a novel energy-function for RBMs, using the leaky relu max(cx, x) activation function for the hidden-units. Analogous to ReLU units in feed-forward networks, these leaky relu RBMs split the input space into a combinatorial number of regions, where each region defines p(v) as a truncated Gaussian. A further contribution of the paper is in proposing a novel sampling scheme for the leaky RBM: one can run a much shorter Markov chain by initializing it from a sample of the leaky RBM with c=1 (which yields a standard multi-variate normal over the visibles) and then slowly annealing c. In low-dimension a similar scheme is shown to outperform AIS for estimating the partition function. Experiments are performed on both CIFAR-10 and SVHN.
This is an interesting paper which I believe would be of interest to the ICLR community. The theoretical contributions are strong: the authors not only introduce a proper energy formulation of ReLU RBMs, but also a novel sampling mechanism and an improvement on AIS for estimating their partition function. 
Unfortunately, the experimental results are somewhat limited. The PCD baseline is notably absent. Including (bernoulli visible, leaky-relu hidden) would have allowed the authors to evaluate likelihoods on standard binary RBM datasets. As it stands, performance on CIFAR-10 and SVHN, while improved with leaky-relu, is a far cry from more recent generative models (VAE-based, or auto-regressive models). While this comparison may be unfair, it will certainly limit the wider appeal of the paper to the community. Furthermore, there is the issue of the costly projection method which is required to guarantee that the energy-function remain bounded (covariance matrix over each region be PSD). Again, while it may be fair to leave that for future work given the other contributions, this will further limit the appeal of the paper.
PROS:
Introduces an energy function having the leaky-relu as an activation function
Introduces a novel sampling procedure based on annealing the leakiness parameter
Similar sampling scheme shown to outperform AIS
CONS:
Results are somewhat out of date
Missing experiments on binary datasets (more comparable to prior RBM work)
Missing PCD baseline
Cost of projection method
