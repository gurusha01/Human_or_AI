The paper presents a few tricks to compress a wide and shallow text classification model based on n-gram features. These tricks include (1) using (optimized) product quantization to compress embedding weights (2) pruning some of the vocabulary elements (3) hashing to reduce the storage of the vocabulary (this is a minor component of the paper). The paper focuses on models with very large vocabularies and shows a reduction in the size of the models at a relatively minor reduction of the accuracy.
The problem of compressing neural models is important and interesting. The methods section of the paper is well written with good high level comments and references. However, the machine learning contributions of the paper are marginal to me. The experiments are not too convincing mainly focusing on benchmarks that are not commonly used. The implications of the paper on the state-of-the-art RNN text classification models is unclear.
The use of (optimized) product quantization for approximating inner product is not particularly novel. Previous work also considered doing this. Most of the reduction in the model sizes comes from pruning vocabulary elements. The method proposed for pruning vocabulary elements is simply based on the assumption that embeddings with larger L2 norm are more important. A coverage heuristic is taken into account too. From a machine learning point of view, the proper baseline to solve this problem is to have a set of (relaxed) binary coefficients for each embedding vector and learn the coefficients jointly with the weights. An L1 regularizer on the coefficients can be used to encourage sparsity. From a practical point of view, I believe an important baseline is missing: what if one simply uses fewer vocabulary elements (e.g based on subword units - see
