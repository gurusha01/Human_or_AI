Authors show that a contrastive loss for a Siamese architecture can be used for learning representations for planar curves. With the proposed framework, authors are able to learn a representation which is comparable to traditional differential or integral invariants, as evaluated on few toy examples.
The paper is generally well written and shows an interesting application of the Siamese architecture. However, the experimental evaluation and the results show that these are rather preliminary results as not many of the choices are validated. My biggest concern is in the choice of the negative samples, as the network basically learns only to distinguish between shapes at different scales, instead of recognizing different shapes. It is well known fact that in order to achieve a good performance with the contrastive loss, one has to be careful about the hard negative sampling, as using too easy negatives may lead to inferior results. Thus, this may be the underlying reason for such choice of the negatives? Unfortunately, this is not discussed in the paper.
Furthermore the paper misses a more thorough quantitative evaluation and concentrates more on showing particular examples, instead of measuring more robust statistics over multiple curves (invariance to noise and sampling artifacts).
In general, the paper shows interesting first steps in this direction, however it is not clear whether the experimental section is strong and thorough enough for the ICLR conference. Also the novelty of the proposed idea is limited as Siamese networks are used for many years and this work only shows that they can be applied to a different task.
