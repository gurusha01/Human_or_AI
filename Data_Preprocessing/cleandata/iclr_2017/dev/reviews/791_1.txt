This paper proposes an unsupervised training objective based on patch contrasting for visual representation learning using deep neural networks. In particular, the feature representations of the patches from the same image are encouraged to be closer than the those from different images. The distance ratios of positive training pairs are optimized. The proposed method are empirically shown to be effective as an initialization method for supervised training. 
Strengths:
- The training objective is reasonable. In particular, high-level features show translation invariance. 
- The proposed methods are effective for initializing neural networks for supervised training on several datasets. 
Weaknesses:
- The methods are technically similar to the "exemplar network" (Dosovitskiy 2015). Cropping patches from a single image can be taken as a type of data augmentation, which is comparable to the data augmentation of positive sample (the exemplar) in (Dosovitskiy 2015). 
- The paper is experimentally misleading.
The results reported in this paper are based on fine-tuning the whole network with supervision. However, in Table 2, the results of exemplar convnets (Dosovitskiy 2015) is from unsupervised feature learning (the network is not finetuned with labeled samples, and only a classifier is trained upon the features). Therefore, the comparison is not fair. I suspect that exemplar convnets (Dosovitskiy 2015) would achieve similar improvements from fine-tuning; so, without such comparisons (head-to-head comparison with and without fine-tuning based on the same architecture except for the loss), the experimental results are not fully convincing. 
Regarding the comparison to "What-where" autoencoder (Zhao et al, 2015), it will be interesting to compare against it in large-scale settings, as shown by Zhang et al, ICML 2016 (Augmenting Supervised Neural Networks with Unsupervised Objectives for Large-Scale Image Classification). Training an AlexNet is not very time-consuming with latest (e.g., TITAN-X level) GPUs. 
The proposed method seems useful only for natural images where different patches from the same image can be similar to each other.
