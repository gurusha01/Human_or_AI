This paper introduces a large-scale multi-model product classification system. The model consists of three modules, Image CNN (VGG 16 architecture), text CNN (Kim 2014) and decision-level fusion policies. The authors have tried several fusion methods: including policies taking inputs from text and image CNN probabilities; choose either CNN; average the predictions; end-to-end training. Experimental results show that text CNN alone works better than image CNN and multi-model fusion can improve the accuracy by a small margin. It is a little bit surprising that end-to-end feature level fusion works worse than text CNN alone. The writing is clear and there are a lot of useful practical experiences of learning large-scale model. However, I lean toward rejecting the paper because the following:
1) No other dataset reported. The authors haven't mentioned releasing the walmart dataset and it is going to be really hard to reproduce the results without the dataset. 
2) Technical novelty is limited. All the decision-level fusion policies have been investigated by some previous methods before. 
3) Performance gain is also limited.
