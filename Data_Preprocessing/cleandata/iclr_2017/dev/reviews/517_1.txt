I sincerely apologize for the late-arriving review. 
This paper proposes to frame the problem of structure estimation as a supervised classification problem. The input is an empirical covariance matrix of the observed data, the output the binary decision whether or not two variables share a link. The paper is sufficiently clear, the goals are clear and everything is well described. 
The main interesting point is the empirical results of the experimental section. The approach is simple and performs better than previous non-learning based methods. This observation is interesting and will be of interest in structure discovery problems. 
I rate the specific construction of the supervised learning method as a reasonable attempt attempt to approach this problem. There is not very much technical novelty in this part. E.g., an algorithmic contribution would have been a method that is invariant to data permutation could have been a possible target for a technical contribution. The paper makes no claims on this technical part, as said, the method is well constructed and well executed. 
It is good to precisely state the theoretical parts of a paper, the authors do this well. All results are rather straight-forward, I like that the claims are written down, but there is little surprise in the statements. 
In summary, the paper makes a very interesting observation. Graph estimation can be posed as a supervised learning problem and training data from a separate source is sufficient to learn structure in novel and unseen test data from a new source. Practically this may be relevant, on one hand the empirical results are stronger with this method, on the other hand a practitioner who is interested in structural discovery may have side constraints about interpretability of the deriving method. From the Discussion and Conclusion I understand that the authors consider this as future work. It is a good first step, it could be stronger but also stands on its own already.
