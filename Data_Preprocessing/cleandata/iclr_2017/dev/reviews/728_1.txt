The paper starts by pointing out the need for methods that perform both state and temporal representation learning for RL and which allow gaining insight into what is being learned (perhaps in order to allow a human operator to intervene if necessary). This is a very important goal from a practical point of view, and it is great to see research in this direction. For this reason, I would like to encourage the authors to pursue this further. However, I am not at all convinced that the current incarnation of this work is the right answer. Part of the issues are more related to presentation, part may require rethinking.
In order to get the "interpretability", the authors opt for some fairly specific ways of performing abstraction. For example, their skills always start In a single skill initiation state, and likewise end in one state. This seems unnecessarily restrictive, and it is not clear why this restriction is needed (other than convenience). Similarly, clustering is the basis for forming the higher level states, and there is a specific kind of clustering used here. Again, it is not clear why this has to be done via clustering as opposed to other methods. Ensuring temporal coherence in the particular form employed also seems restrictive. There is a reference to supplementary material where some of these choices are explained, but I could not find this in the posted version of the paper. The authors should either explain clearly why these specific choices are necessary, or (even better) try to think if they can be relaxed while still keeping interpretability. 
From a presentation point of view, the paper would benefit from formal definitions of AMDP and SAMDP, as well as from formal descriptions of the algorithms employed in constructing these representations (eg Bellman equations for the models, and update rules for the algorithms learning them). While intuitions are given, the math is not precisely stated. The overhead of constructing an SAMDP (computation time and space) should be clarified as well.
The experiments are well carried out and it is nice to have both gridworld experiments, where visualization are easy to perform and understand, as well as Atari games (gridworld still have their place despite what other reviewers might say). The results are positive, but because the proposed approach has many moving parts which rely on specific choices, significance and general ease of use are unclear at this point. Perhaps having the complete supplementary would have helped in this respect.
Small comment: The two lines after Eq 2 contain typos in the notation and a wrong sign in the equation.
