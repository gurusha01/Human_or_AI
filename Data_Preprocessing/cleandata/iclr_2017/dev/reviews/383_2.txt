The paper looks solid and the idea is natural. Results seem promising as well.
I am mostly concerned about the computational cost of the method. 8-10 days on 10 GPUs for relatively tiny datasets is quite prohibitive for most applications I would ever encounter.
 I think the main question is how this approach scales to larger images and also when applied to more exotic and possibly tiny datasets. Can you run an experiment on Caltech-101 for instance? I would be very curious to see if your approach is suitable for the low-data regime and areas where we all do not know right away how a suitable architecture looks like. For Cifar-10/100, MNIST and SVHN, everyone knows very well what a reasonable model initialization looks like.
If you show proof that you can discover a competitive architecture for something like Caltech-101, I would recommend the paper for publication.
Minor: 
- ResNets should be mentioned in Table
