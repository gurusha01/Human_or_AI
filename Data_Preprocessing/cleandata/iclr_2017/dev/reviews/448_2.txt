The paper expands a recent mean-field approximation of deep random neural networks to study depth-dependent information propagation, its phase-dependence and the influence of drop-out. The paper is extremely well written, the mathematical analysis is thorough and numerical experiments are included that underscore the theoretical results. Overall the paper stands out as one of the few papers that thoroughly analyses training and performance of deep nets.
