The paper presents a way to model the distribution of four-part Bach chorales using Convolutional Neural Networks. Furthermore it addresses the task of artificial music generation by sampling from the model using blocked Gibbs sampling and shows
The CNN model for the distribution seems very appropriate for the data at hand. Also the analysis of the proposed sampling schemes with the analogy between Gibbs sampling and human music composition are very interesting.
I am not too sure about the evaluation though. Since the reported likelihoods are not directly comparable to previous work, I have difficulties judging the quality of the quantitative results.  For the human evaluation I would like to see the data for the direct comparisons between the models. E.g. How did NADE vs. Bach perform. Also I find the question: 'what piece of music do you prefer' a stronger test than the question 'what piece is more musical to you' because I don't really know what 'musical' means to the AMT workers.
Finally, while I think the Bach Chorales are interesting musical pieces that deserve to be subject of the analysis but I find it hard to judge how well this modelling approach will transfer to other types of music which might have a very different data distribution.
Nevertheless, in conclusion, I believe this is an exciting model for an interesting task that produces non-trivial musical data.
