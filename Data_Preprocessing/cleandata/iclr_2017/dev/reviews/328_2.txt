This is a clearly written paper with a nice, if straightforward, result: RNNs can be good predictive models of neuron firing rates in the retina.
On the one hand, the primary scientific contribution seems to just be to confirm that this approach works. On this particular stimulus locked task the gains from using the RNN seemed relatively modest, and it hasn't yet taught us anything new about the biology.
On the other hand, this (along with the concurrent work of McIntosh et al.) is introducing neural network modeling to a field that isn't currently using it, and where it should prove very effective.
I think it would be very interesting to see the results of applying a framework like this one with LFP and other neurons as input and on a shorter discretization time scale.
I suspect followup work building on this proof of concept will be increasingly exciting.
Minor comments:
Sec 3.2:
I didn't understand the role of the 0.833 ms bins.
Use "epoch" throughout, rather than alternating between "epoch" and "pass through data".
Fig. 4 would be better with the x-axis on a log scale.
