This paper basically applies A3C to 3D spatial navigation tasks. 
- This is not the first time A3C has been applied to 3D navigation. In fact the original paper reported these experiments. Although the experimental results are great, I am not sure if this paper has any additional insights to warrant itself as a conference paper. It might make more sense as a workshop paper
-  Are the graphs in Fig 5 constructed using a single hyper-parameter sweep? I think the authors should report results with many random initializations to make the comparisons more robust
- Overall the two main ideas in this paper -- A3C and curriculums -- are not really novel but the authors do make use of them in a real system.
