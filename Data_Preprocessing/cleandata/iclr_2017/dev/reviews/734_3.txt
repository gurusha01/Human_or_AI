Summary:
This paper describes the use of variational autoencoders for multi-view representation learning as an alternative to canonical correlation analysis (CCA), deep CCA (DCCA), and multi-view autoencoders (MVAE). Two variants of variational autoencoders (which the authors call VCCA and VCCA-private) are investigated. The method's performances are compared on a synthetic MNIST dataset, the XRMB speech-articulation dataset, and the MIR-Flickr dataset.
Review:
Variational autoencoders are widely used and their performance for multi-view representation learning should be of interest to the ICLR community. The paper is well written and clear. The experiments are thorough. It is interesting that the performance of MVAE and VCCA is quite different given the similarity of their objective functions. I further find the analyses of the effects of dropout and private variables useful.
As the authors point out, "VCCA does not optimize the same criterion, nor produce the same solution, as any linear or nonlinear CCA". It would have been interesting to discuss the differences of a linear variant of VCCA and linear CCA, and to compare it quantitatively. While it might not make sense to use variational inference in the linear case, it would nevertheless help to understand the differences better.
The derivations in Equation 3 and Equation 13 seem unnecessarily detailed given that VCCA and VCCA-p are special cases of VAE, only with certain architectural constraints. Perhaps move to the Appendix?
In Section 3 the authors claim that "if we are able to generate realistic samples from the learned distribution, we can infer that we have discovered the underlying structure of the data". This is not correct, a model which hasn't learned a thing can have perfectly realistic samples (see Theis et al., 2016). Please remove or revise the sentence.
Minor:
In the equation between Equation 8 and 9, using notation N(x; g(z, theta), I) as in Equation 6 would make it clearer.
