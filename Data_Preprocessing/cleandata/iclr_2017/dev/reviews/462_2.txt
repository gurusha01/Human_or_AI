This paper explores an important angle to adversarial examples: the detection of adversarial images and their utilization for trainig more robust networks.
This takes the competition between adversaries and models to a new level. The paper presents appealing evidence for the feasibility of robustifying networks by employing the a detector subnetwork that is trained particularly for the purpose of detecting the adversaries in a terget manner rather than just making the networks themselves robust to adversarial examples.
The jointly trained primary/detector system is evaluated in various scenarios including the cases when the adversary generator has access to the model and those where they are generated in a generic way.
The results of the paper show good improvements with the approach and present well motived thorough analyses to back the main message. The writing is clear and concise.
