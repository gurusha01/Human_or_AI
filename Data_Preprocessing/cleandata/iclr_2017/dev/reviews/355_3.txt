This is a solid paper that applies A3C to Doom, enhancing it with a collection of tricks so as to win one of the VizDoom competitions. I think it is fair to expect the competition aspect to overshadow the more scientific approach of justifying every design decision in isolation, but in fact the authors do a decent job at the latter.
Two of my concerns have remained unanswered (see AnonReviewer2, below). 
In addition, the citation list is rather thin, for example reward shaping has a rich literature, as do incrementally more difficult task setups, dating back at least to Mark Ring's work in the 1990s. There has also been a lot of complementary work on other FPS games. I'm not asking that the authors do any direct comparisons, but to give the reader a sense of context in which to place this.
