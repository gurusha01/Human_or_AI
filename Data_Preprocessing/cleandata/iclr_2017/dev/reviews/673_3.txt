I find this paper not very compelling.  The basic idea seems to be that we can put a fast neighbor searcher into a memory augmented net to make the memory lookups scalable.  However, this was precisely the point of Rae et al.    There are a  number of standardized neighbor searchers; I don't understand why the authors choose to use their own (which they do not benchmark against the standards).   Moreover, they test on a problem where there is no clear need for (vector based) fast-nn, because one can use hashing on the text.     I also find the repeated distinction between "mips" and "nns" distracting; most libraries that can do one can do the other, or inputs can be modified  to switch between the problems; indeed the authors do this when they convert to the  "mcss" problem.
