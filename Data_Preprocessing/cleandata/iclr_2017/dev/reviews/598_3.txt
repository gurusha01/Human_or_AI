This submission proposes a letter-level decoder with a variation of the CTC approach they call ASG, where the blank symbol is dropped and replaced by letter repetition symbols, and where explicit normalization is dropped. Both the description of a letter-level model (though not novel), as well as the CTC-variant are interesting. 
The approach is evaluated on the LibriSpeech task. The authors claim that their approach is competitive. They compare their modelling variant ASG to CTC, but a comparison of the letter-level approach to available word-level results are missing. Compared to the results obtained in Panayotov et al. 2015, the performance obtained here seems only comparable to word-level GMM/HMM models, but worse than word-level hybrid DNN/HMM models, though Panayotov et al. also appled speaker adaptation, which was not done, as far as I can see. I suggest to add a comparison to Panyotov's results (in addition to mentioning Baidu's results on Librispeech, which are not comparable due to much larger amounts of training data), to allow readers to get a quantitative idea. As pointed out by the authors in the text, Baidu's GPU implementation for CTC is more aimed at larger vocabularies, therefore the comparison to GPU in Tables 1a-c do not seem to be helpful for this work, without further discussing the implementations.
You are using quite a huge analysis window (nearly 2s). Even though other authors also use windows up to 0.5s to 1s (e.g. MRASTA features), some comments on how you arrive at such a large window, and what advantages you observe for it, would be interesting.
The submission is well written, though more details on the experiences with using non-normalized (transition) scores and beam pruning would be desirable. Table 1 would be better readable if the units of the numbers shown in a/b/c would be shown within the tables, and not only in the caption.
Prior (partial) publications of this work (your NIPS end-to-end workshop paper) should clearly be mentioned/referenced.
What do you mean by transition "scalars"?
I do not repeat further comments here, which were already given in the pre-review period.
Minor comments:
 - Sec. 2.3, end of 2nd sentence: train properly the model -> train the model properly
   End of same paragraph: boostrap -> bootstrap (such errors should be avoided by performing an automatic spell check)
 - Sec. 2.3: Bayse -> Bayes
 - definition of logadd is wrong (see comment) - (applies also for your NIPS end-to-end workshop paper).
 - line before Eq. (3): all possible sequence of letters -> all possible sequences of letters (plural)
 - Sec. 2.4, first line: threholding -> thresholding (spell check..)
 - Figure 4: mention the corpus used here - dev?
A slightly more compressed version of this submission will be presented at the NIPS end-to-end workshop on Dec. 10, 2016. The NIPS submission seems to be a clear subset of this submission and should at least be mentioned in this paper.
When dropping the normalization of acoustic model scores, the range of scores obtained might vary and would have an effect on beam pruning and on its relation to the normalized LM scores. Did you analyse this?
Sec. 2.3: you use digits to label character repetitions. How do you handle numbers?
It seems that you use inconsistent notation - the variable 't' is used for different time scales: in Eq. (1) t represents strided time frames, whereas in x_t above it enumerates frames directly.
