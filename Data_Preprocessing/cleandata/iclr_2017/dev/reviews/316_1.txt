This paper addresses the problem of achieving differential privacy in a very general scenario where a set of teachers is trained on disjoint subsets of sensitive data and the student performs prediction based on public data labeled by teachers through noisy voting. I found the approach altogether plausible and very clearly explained by the authors. Adding more discussion of the bound (and its tightness) from Theorem 1 itself would be appreciated. A simple idea of adding perturbation error to the counts, known from differentially-private literature, is nicely re-used by the authors and elegantly applied in a much broader (non-convex setting) and practical context than in a number of differentially-private and other related papers. The generality of the approach, clear improvement over predecessors, and clarity of the writing makes the method worth publishing.
