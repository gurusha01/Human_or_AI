An interesting architecture that accumulates and continuously corrects mistakes as you see more and more of a video sequence.
Clarity: The video you generated seems very helpful towards understanding the information flow in your network, it would be nice to link to it from the paper.
 "Our model with hyperparameters optimized for KITTI underperforms the model of Finn et al. (2016), but outperforms the previous state-of-the-art model by Mathieu et al. (2016)."
 It is not clear how different are the train and test sequences at the moment, since standard benchmarks do not really exist for video prediction and each author picks his/her favorite. Underperforming Finn et al 206 at the H3.6m Walking videos is a bit disappointing.
