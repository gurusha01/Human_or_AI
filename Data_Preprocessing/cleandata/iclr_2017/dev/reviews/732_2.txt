It feels that this paper is structured around a shortcoming of the original paragraph vectors paper, namely an alleged inability to infer representation for text outside of the training data. I am reasonably sure that this is not the case. Unfortunately on that basis, the premise for the work presented here no longer holds, which renders most of the subsequent discussion void.
While I recommend this paper be rejected, I encourage the authors to revisit the novel aspects of the idea presented here and see if that can be turned into a different type of paper going forward.
