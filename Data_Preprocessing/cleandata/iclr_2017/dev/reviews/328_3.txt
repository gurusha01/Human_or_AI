This paper fits models to spike trains of retinal ganglion cells that are driven by natural images. I think the title should thus include the word "activity" at the end for otherwise it is actually formally incorrect.
Anyhow, this paper proposes more specifically a recurrent network for this time series prediction and compares it to what seems to be the previous approach of a generalized linear model. Overall the stated paradigm is that when one can predict the spikes well then one can look into the model and learn how nature does it. 
In general the paper sounds plausible, though I am not convinced that I learned a lot. The results in figure 2 show that the RNN model can predict the spikes a bit better. So this is nice. But now what? You have shown that a more complicated model can produce better fits to the data, though there are of course still some variations to the real data. Your initial outline was that a better predictive model helps you to better understand the neural processing in the retina. So tell us what you learned. I am not a specialist of the retina, but I know that there are several layers and recurrencies in the retina, so I am not so surprised that the new model is better than the GLM. 
It seems that more complicated recurrent models such as LSTM do not improve the performance according to a statement in the paper. However, comparisons on this level are also difficult as a more complex models needs more data. Hence, I would actually expect that more layers and even a more detailed model of the retina could eventually improve the prediction even further. 
I was also a bit puzzled that all the neurons in the network share all the same parameters (weights). While the results show that these simplified models can capture a lot of the spike train characteristics, couldn't a model with free parameters eventually outperform this one (with correspondingly more training data)?
