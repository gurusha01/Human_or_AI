In this paper a novel approach for anomaly detection is considered for the task of intrusion detection based on system call sequence.
The system call sequence is regarded as a language, and multiple lstm-rnn language models are trained and ensembled. 
Diversity in the ensemble is achieved by choosing different hyper parameters for each lstm-LM.
The combination of the LMs is done by averaging transformations of the likelihoods. 
I really like the fact that no attack data is used during training, and I like the LM and ensemble approach. 
The only high level drawbacks I have are the following, which might have a simple answer as I'm not an expert in this field:
- Relaying of system calls seems weak: If the attacker has access to some "normal" sequences of system calls, all she can fool the system by interleaving its malicious system calls with normal ones, in a way that will artificially raise the likelihood of the sequence. 
- A few lines covering other anomaly detection tasks, where RNNs are used, can be added to the introduction, to give a better idea about the novelty of the approach.
