The paper is straightforward, easy to read, and has clear results. 
Since all these parameterisations end up outputting torques, it seems like there shouldn't be much difference between them. There is a known function that convert from one representation to another (or at least to torques). Is it not possible that the only reason proportional control is a little better is that the tracking cost is a function of positions?
Would we get the same result if there was no reference-pose cost, only a locomotion cost?
Would we get the same result if the task was to spin a top? My guess is no. 
This work is interesting, but not likely to generalise to other scenarios, and in that sense is rather limited.
The video is nice.
