The proposed self supervised loss is formulated using a Siamese architecture and encourages patches from the same image to lie closer in feature space than a contrasting patch taken from a different, random image. The loss is very similar in spirit to that of Doersch et al. ICCV 2015 and Isola et al. ICLR 2016 workshop. It seems that the proposed loss is actually a simplified version of Doersch et al. ICCV 2015 in that it does not make use of the spatial offset, a freely available self supervised signal in natural images. Intuitively, it seems that the self-supervised problem posed by this method is strictly simpler, and therefore less powerful, than that of the aforementioned work. I would like to see more discussion on the comparison of these two approaches. Nevertheless the proposed method seems to be effective in achieving good empirical results using this simple loss. Though more implementation details should be provided, such as the effect of patch size, overlap between sampled patches, and any other important measures taken to avoid trivial solutions.
