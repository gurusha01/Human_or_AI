1. The hierarchical memory is fixed, not learned, and there is no hierarchical in the experimental section, only one layer for softmax layer.
2. It shows the 10-mips > 100-mips > 1000-mips, does it mean 1-mips is the best one we should adopt?
3. Approximated k-mips is worse than even original method. Why does it need exact k-mips? It seems the proposed method is not robust.
