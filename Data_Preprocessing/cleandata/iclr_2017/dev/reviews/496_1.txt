This paper proposes a new multiscale recurrent neural network, where each layer has different time scale, and the scale is not fixed but variable and determined by a neural network. The method is elegantly formulated within a recurrent neural network framework, and shows the state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks. The paper is well written.
Question) Can you extend it to bidirectional RNN?
