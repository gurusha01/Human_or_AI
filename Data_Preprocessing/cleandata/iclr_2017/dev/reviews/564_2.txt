I think the backbone of the paper is interesting and could lead to something potentially quite useful. I like the idea of connecting signal processing with recurrent network and then using tools from one setting in the other. However, while the work has nuggets of very interesting observations, I feel they can be put together in a better way. 
I think the writeup and everything can be improved and I urge the authors to strive for this if the paper doesn't go through. I think some of the ideas of how to connect to the past are interesting, it would be nice to have more experiments or to try to understand better why this connections help and how.
