Learning about the physical structure and semantics of the world from video (without supervision) is a very hot area in computer vision and machine learning.
In this paper, the authors investigate how the prediction of future image frames (inherently unsupervised) can help to deduce object/s structure and it's properties (in this case single object pose, category, and steering angle, (after a supervised linear readout step))
I enjoyed reading this paper, it is clear, interesting and proposes an original network architecture (PredNet) for video frame prediction that has produced promising results on both synthetic and natural images.
Moreover, the extensive experimental evaluation and analysis the authors provide puts it on solid ground to which others can compare.
The weaknesses:
- the link to predictive coding should be better explained in the paper if it is to be used as a motivation for the prednet model.
- any idea that the proposed method is learning an implicit `model' of the `objects' that make up the `scene' is vague and far fetched, but it sounds great.
Minor comment:
Next to the number of labeled training examples (Fig.5), it would be interesting to see how much unsupervised training data was used to train your representations.
