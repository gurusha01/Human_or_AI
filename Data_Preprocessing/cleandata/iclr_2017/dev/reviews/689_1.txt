This paper proposes a generative model for mixtures of basic local structures where the dependency between local structures is a tensor. They use tensor decomposition and the result of their earlier paper on expressive power of CNNs along with hierarchical Tucker to provide an inference mechanism. However, this is conditioned on the existence of decomposition. The authors do not discuss how applicable their method is for a general case, what is the subspace where this decomposition exists/is efficient/has low approximation error. Their answer to this question is that in deep learning era these theoretical analysis is not needed. While this claim is subjective, I need to emphasize that the paper does not clarify this claim and does not mention the restrictions. Hence, from theoretical perspective, the paper has flaws and the claims are not justified completely. Some claims cannot be justified with the  current results in tensor literature as the authors also mentioned in the discussions. Therefore, they should have corrected their claims in the paper and made the clarifications that this approach is restricted to a clear subclass of tensors.
If we ignore the theoretical aspect and only consider the paper from empirical perspective, the experiments the appear in the paper are not enough to accept the paper. MNIST and CIFAR-10 are very simple baselines and more extensive experiments are required. Also, the experiments for missing data are not covering real cases and are too synthetic. Also, the paper lacks the extension beyond images. Since the authors repeatedly mention that their approach goes beyond images, and since the theory part is not complete, those experiments are essential for acceptance of this paper.
