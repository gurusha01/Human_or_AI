This paper tackles the problem of multi-modal classification of text and images.
Pros:
- Interesting dataset and application.
Cons:
- The results are rather lacklustre, showing a very mild improvement compared to the oracle improvement. But perhaps some insights as to whether the incorrect decisions are humanly possible would help with significance of the results.
- Could have explored some intermediate architectures such as feature fusion + class probabilities with/without finetuning. There are no feature fusion results reported.
- No evaluation on standard datasets or comparison to previous works.
What is the policy learnt for CP-1? Given 2 input class probabilities, how does the network perform better than max or mean?
