Summary
The paper proposes a novel approach to learning the structure of undirected graphical models from observational data. The authors frame the problem of structure discovery as a learning problem, where a function is learned to map empirical covariance matrices to estimated graph structures. This approach allows for the incorporation of domain-specific knowledge and flexibility in modeling different types of graphs. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on various synthetic and real-world datasets, including genetics and neuroimaging data.
