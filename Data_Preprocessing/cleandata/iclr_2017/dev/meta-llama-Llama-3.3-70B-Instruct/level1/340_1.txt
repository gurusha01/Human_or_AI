The paper "Domain Transfer Network" presents a novel approach to transferring samples from one domain to another, while preserving the representation of a given function. The authors propose a compound loss function that combines a multiclass GAN loss, an f-preserving component, and a regularizing component to encourage the generator to map samples from the target domain to themselves. The method is applied to visual domains, including digits and face images, and demonstrates its ability to generate convincing novel images of previously unseen entities while preserving their identity.
I decide to accept this paper with two key reasons: (1) the approach is well-motivated and placed in the literature, and (2) the paper supports its claims with correct and scientifically rigorous results. The authors provide a clear and thorough explanation of the problem, the proposed method, and the experimental results, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the Domain Transfer Network (DTN) in various applications.
The supporting arguments for my decision include the fact that the authors have thoroughly reviewed the related work and have clearly explained the differences between their approach and existing methods. The experimental results are also impressive, demonstrating the ability of the DTN to generate high-quality images that preserve the identity of the input samples. Additionally, the authors have provided a detailed analysis of the contributions of each component of the loss function, which helps to understand the importance of each term in the overall performance of the method.
To improve the paper, I would suggest providing more details on the implementation of the DTN, such as the architecture of the generator and discriminator networks, and the hyperparameter settings used in the experiments. Additionally, it would be helpful to include more visual examples of the generated images, particularly for the face domain, to demonstrate the quality and diversity of the results.
I would like to ask the authors to clarify the following points: (1) How did they select the hyperparameters for the trade-off between the different loss terms, and (2) Can they provide more insights into the importance of the f-preserving component in the loss function, and how it affects the overall performance of the DTN? These questions would help to further understand the strengths and limitations of the proposed method and its potential applications in other domains.
