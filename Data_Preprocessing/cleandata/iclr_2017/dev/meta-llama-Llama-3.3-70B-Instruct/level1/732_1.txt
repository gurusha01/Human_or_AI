Summary
The paper proposes two novel models, Generative Paragraph Vector (GPV) and Supervised Generative Paragraph Vector (SGPV), which extend the Paragraph Vector (PV) model by introducing a complete generative process for texts. GPV allows for the inference of distributed representations for unseen texts, while SGPV incorporates text labels into the model to guide representation learning. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their models on five text classification benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results.
Decision
I decide to Accept this paper, with two key reasons: (1) the paper tackles a significant problem in natural language processing, namely the limitation of PV in inferring representations for unseen texts, and (2) the proposed models, GPV and SGPV, demonstrate superior performance over existing baselines on multiple benchmark datasets.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a clear motivation for the proposed models, highlighting the limitations of PV and the benefits of introducing a complete generative process. The authors also provide a thorough review of related work, positioning their models within the context of existing text representation learning methods. The experimental results are convincing, demonstrating the effectiveness of GPV and SGPV on various text classification tasks.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest the authors consider the following points: (1) provide more detailed analysis of the hyperparameter settings and their impact on the model performance, (2) explore the use of other probabilistic distributions for paragraph vectors and word vectors, as mentioned in the conclusion, and (3) consider applying their models to other NLP tasks, such as language modeling or machine translation, to demonstrate their broader applicability.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions: (1) How do the authors plan to address the potential issue of overfitting in the SGPV model, given its simplicity and the use of a small number of parameters? (2) Can the authors provide more insight into the choice of the multivariate normal distribution as the prior distribution for paragraph vectors, and how this choice affects the model's performance? (3) How do the authors envision the GPV and SGPV models being used in practice, particularly in scenarios where the amount of labeled data is limited?
