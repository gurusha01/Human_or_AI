The paper presents a novel approach to music composition using machine learning, specifically exploring the use of blocked Gibbs sampling as an analogue to the human composition process. The authors introduce COCONET, a convolutional neural network in the NADE family of generative models, and demonstrate its effectiveness in improving sample quality compared to traditional ancestral sampling methods. The paper claims to contribute to the field by providing a more human-like approach to music composition, and the results show promising improvements in sample quality.
Based on my review, I decide to Accept this paper, with the key reason being that the approach is well-motivated and supported by empirical results. The authors provide a clear explanation of the limitations of traditional ancestral sampling methods and demonstrate the effectiveness of their proposed blocked Gibbs sampling approach.
The paper provides strong evidence to support its claims, including visualizations of the composition process and comparisons with traditional methods. The use of blocked Gibbs sampling is well-justified, and the results show significant improvements in sample quality. The authors also provide a thorough analysis of the reasons behind the improved performance, attributing it to the better modeling of conditional distributions.
To further improve the paper, I would suggest providing more details on the implementation of the COCONET model and the blocked Gibbs sampling procedure. Additionally, it would be helpful to include more quantitative evaluations of the sample quality, such as metrics for evaluating the coherence and diversity of the generated music. I would also like to ask the authors to clarify how they plan to extend this approach to more complex music generation tasks, such as conditioned generation or multi-instrument composition. Furthermore, can the authors provide more insights into the computational cost of the blocked Gibbs sampling approach compared to traditional methods, and how this might impact the scalability of the approach?
