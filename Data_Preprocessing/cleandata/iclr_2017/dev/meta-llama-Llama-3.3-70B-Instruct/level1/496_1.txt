The paper proposes a novel multiscale approach, called the Hierarchical Multiscale Recurrent Neural Network (HM-RNN), which can capture the latent hierarchical structure in sequences by encoding temporal dependencies with different timescales using a novel update mechanism. The authors claim that their model can discover underlying hierarchical structure in sequences without using explicit boundary information. The paper evaluates the proposed model on character-level language modeling and handwriting sequence generation tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results on the Text8 dataset and comparable results to the state-of-the-art on the Penn Treebank and Hutter Prize Wikipedia datasets.
I decide to Accept this paper with two key reasons: (1) the paper tackles a specific and important problem in the field of recurrent neural networks, which is learning hierarchical and temporal representation, and (2) the approach is well-motivated and supported by empirical evidence, showing that the proposed model can discover latent hierarchical structure in sequences and achieve better generalization performance.
The paper provides a clear and detailed explanation of the proposed model, including the update mechanism and the boundary detection process. The authors also provide a thorough analysis of the results, including visualizations of the learned hierarchical structure and the update frequencies of the layers. The paper is well-organized, and the writing is clear and concise.
To improve the paper, I would suggest providing more detailed comparisons with other related works, such as the Clockwork RNN and the Hierarchical RNN. Additionally, it would be helpful to provide more analysis on the learned hierarchical structure and how it relates to the underlying structure of the data. Some questions I would like the authors to answer include: (1) How does the proposed model handle sequences with varying lengths and complexities? (2) Can the authors provide more insights into the learned boundary detectors and how they relate to the underlying structure of the data? (3) How does the proposed model compare to other models that use explicit boundary information, such as the Hierarchical RNN?
