Summary
The paper proposes a novel framework for training a vision-based agent in the First-Person Shooter (FPS) game Doom, using a combination of deep reinforcement learning (Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) model) and curriculum learning. The framework is simple in design, only using game states from the AI side, and achieves state-of-the-art performance in the ViZDoom AI Competition 2016, winning the champion of Track 1 by a large margin.
Decision
I decide to Accept this paper, with two key reasons: (1) the paper tackles a specific and challenging problem in training AI agents in partially observable 3D environments, and (2) the approach is well-motivated and supported by empirical results, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed framework.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a clear and concise introduction to the problem of training AI agents in FPS games, and motivates the use of deep reinforcement learning and curriculum learning. The proposed framework is well-designed, and the authors provide a detailed description of the network architecture, training pipeline, and curriculum learning strategy. The empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, with the trained agent winning the champion of Track 1 in the ViZDoom AI Competition 2016.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest the authors provide more details on the hyperparameter tuning process, and explore the use of other reinforcement learning algorithms, such as Deep Q-Networks (DQN) or Policy Gradient Methods (PGMs). Additionally, the authors may consider providing more visualizations of the agent's behavior, such as heatmaps or videos, to better illustrate the agent's decision-making process.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like to ask the authors the following questions:
* Can you provide more details on the curriculum learning strategy, and how the difficulty level of the tasks is controlled?
* How do you handle the exploration-exploitation trade-off in the proposed framework, and what are the implications of using entropy regularization?
* Can you provide more insights into the agent's behavior, such as its tactics and decision-making process, and how it adapts to different scenarios?
