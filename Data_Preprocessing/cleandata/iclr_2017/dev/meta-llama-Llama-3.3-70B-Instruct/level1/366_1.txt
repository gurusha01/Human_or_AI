The paper "Autoencoded Variational Inference For Topic Models" presents a novel approach to topic modeling using autoencoding variational Bayes (AEVB). The authors propose a black-box inference method, called AVITM, which can be applied to various topic models without requiring mathematically deriving a new inference algorithm for each model.
The paper claims to contribute to the field of topic modeling by providing a fast and efficient inference method that matches traditional methods in accuracy while reducing computational costs. The authors also introduce a new topic model, called ProdLDA, which replaces the mixture model in LDA with a product of experts, resulting in more interpretable topics.
I decide to accept this paper with two key reasons: (1) the paper presents a well-motivated approach to addressing the challenges of applying AEVB to topic models, and (2) the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of topic coherence and computational efficiency.
The paper provides a clear and well-structured presentation of the proposed method, including the mathematical derivations and the experimental setup. The authors also provide a thorough discussion of the related work and the advantages of their approach over existing methods. The experimental results are convincing, showing that AVITM achieves similar topic coherence to traditional methods while being significantly faster to train.
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the implementation of the inference network architecture, such as the number of layers and the activation functions used. Additionally, it would be helpful to include more visualizations of the topics learned by the different models to facilitate a better understanding of the results.
I would like to ask the authors to clarify the following points: (1) How did they choose the hyperparameters for the Laplace approximation to the Dirichlet prior, and (2) Can they provide more insights into the reasons behind the improved topic coherence in ProdLDA compared to LDA? 
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of topic modeling, and with some minor revisions, it has the potential to be a strong publication.
