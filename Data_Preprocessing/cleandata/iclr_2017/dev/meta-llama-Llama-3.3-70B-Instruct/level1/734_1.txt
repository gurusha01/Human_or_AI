Summary of the Paper's Claims and Contributions
The paper proposes a novel deep multi-view learning model called Variational Canonical Correlation Analysis (VCCA), which extends the latent variable model interpretation of linear Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) to nonlinear observation models parameterized by deep neural networks (DNNs). The authors also introduce a variant of VCCA, called VCCA-private, which can extract both common and private variables from multiple views. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of VCCA and VCCA-private on several multi-view representation learning tasks, including image-image, speech-articulation, and image-text datasets.
Decision and Key Reasons
Based on the review, I decide to Accept this paper. The two key reasons for this choice are:
1. The paper tackles a specific and well-motivated problem in multi-view representation learning, and the approach is well-placed in the literature.
2. The paper provides a clear and rigorous derivation of the VCCA and VCCA-private models, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of these models on several datasets.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a clear and concise introduction to the problem of multi-view representation learning and the limitations of existing approaches. The authors motivate the need for a deep generative model that can capture the underlying structure of the data, and they provide a rigorous derivation of the VCCA and VCCA-private models. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of these models on several datasets, including image-image, speech-articulation, and image-text datasets. The results show that VCCA and VCCA-private can learn informative and disentangled representations of the data, and that they can outperform existing methods on several tasks.
Additional Feedback and Questions
To further improve the paper, I would like to see more discussion on the following points:
* How do the authors plan to extend the VCCA and VCCA-private models to more complex datasets, such as those with multiple modalities or sequential data?
* How do the authors plan to incorporate additional prior knowledge or constraints into the VCCA and VCCA-private models, such as domain knowledge or physical constraints?
* Can the authors provide more insight into the interpretability of the learned representations, and how they can be used for downstream tasks?
Some specific questions I would like the authors to answer are:
* How did the authors choose the hyperparameters for the VCCA and VCCA-private models, and what is the sensitivity of the results to these hyperparameters?
* Can the authors provide more details on the implementation of the VCCA and VCCA-private models, including the architecture of the neural networks and the optimization algorithms used?
* How do the authors plan to evaluate the performance of the VCCA and VCCA-private models on more complex datasets, and what metrics do they plan to use for evaluation?
