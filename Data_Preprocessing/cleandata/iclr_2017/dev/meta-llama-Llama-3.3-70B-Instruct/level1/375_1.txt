The paper proposes a simple and unsupervised method for generating sentence embeddings, which achieves state-of-the-art results on various textual similarity tasks and even outperforms some supervised methods. The method involves computing a weighted average of word vectors in a sentence, where the weights are determined by a smooth inverse frequency (SIF) scheme, and then removing the common components from the resulting vector. The authors also provide a theoretical justification for the SIF scheme using a latent variable generative model for sentences.
I decide to Accept this paper for the following reasons:
1. The paper tackles a specific and well-defined problem in natural language processing, namely generating sentence embeddings that capture semantic meaning.
2. The approach is well-motivated and grounded in existing literature on word embeddings and sentence representations. The authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their method and its theoretical underpinnings.
3. The paper provides strong empirical evidence to support its claims, including experiments on multiple datasets and comparisons to other state-of-the-art methods.
Some supporting arguments for my decision include:
* The paper's results are impressive, with significant improvements over baseline methods and competitive performance with supervised methods.
* The authors provide a thorough analysis of their method's components, including the effects of smooth inverse frequency weighting and common component removal.
* The paper's theoretical contribution, namely the latent variable generative model for sentences, provides a new perspective on the problem of sentence embeddings and has potential implications for future research.
To improve the paper, I would suggest the following:
* Provide more detailed explanations of the hyperparameter tuning process and the sensitivity of the method to different parameter settings.
* Consider adding more experiments to evaluate the method's performance on other NLP tasks, such as text classification or machine translation.
* Provide more discussion on the potential limitations and drawbacks of the method, including its reliance on pre-trained word embeddings and its sensitivity to out-of-vocabulary words.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper include:
* Can you provide more intuition on why the smooth inverse frequency scheme is effective in down-weighting frequent words and up-weighting rare words?
* How do you plan to extend the method to handle out-of-vocabulary words or words with multiple senses?
* Can you provide more details on the computational resources required to train and evaluate the method, including the time and memory requirements?
