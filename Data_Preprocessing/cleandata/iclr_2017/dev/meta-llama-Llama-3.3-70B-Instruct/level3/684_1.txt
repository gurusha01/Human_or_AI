This paper proposes a novel model-based reinforcement learning approach using a residual recurrent neural network to predict future rewards. The idea is sound and original, and the authors demonstrate its effectiveness in learning multiple tasks simultaneously. The approach has the potential to overcome the limitations of traditional Q-learning methods, which can struggle with multi-task learning.
However, I decide to reject this paper due to two key reasons. Firstly, the experimental results are limited, only testing on three easy Atari games, and lack comparison to other RL techniques, making it hard to evaluate the approach's effectiveness. Secondly, the paper's "previous work" section is too limited, failing to cite important works in model-based RL, such as "Action-Conditional Video Prediction using Deep Networks in Atari Games".
The notation and formatting used in the paper are also unusual and potentially confusing, with issues such as non-standard notation for states and actions, and inconsistent use of symbols. Additionally, the paper has several minor errors and inconsistencies, including mistakes in variable definitions, notation, and figure descriptions, which detract from the overall quality of the work.
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors expand their experimental results to include more games and comparison to other RL techniques. They should also provide a more comprehensive review of previous work in model-based RL, including relevant citations. Furthermore, the authors should address the notation and formatting issues, and carefully proofread the paper to eliminate errors and inconsistencies.
I would like the authors to answer the following questions to clarify my understanding of the paper: How do the authors plan to address the issue of long-term dependencies in their approach? Can they provide more details on the training process, including the learning schedule and the weights assigned to each iteration? How do the authors think their approach can be applied to more complex environments, such as robotics, and what are the potential challenges and limitations?
