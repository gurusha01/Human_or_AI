Summary
The paper presents a novel approach to modeling sensory neurons using a multitask recurrent neural network (RNN) framework. The authors demonstrate that this approach can significantly improve prediction over current state-of-the-art models, such as generalized linear models (GLMs), in predicting the spiking responses of primate retinal ganglion cells to natural images. The paper also explores the benefits of sharing information across neurons in a multi-task framework and shows that this approach can lead to better and more stable predictions, even with relatively small amounts of experimental data.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, with the main reason being that the paper lacks implementation, simulation, and benchmarking of promised speedups on multiple tasks to be considered a full conference paper. While the paper presents an interesting observation and a novel approach, it is currently more suitable as a technical report, and more detailed results are needed to further support the observation and its potential applications.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's central observation is clearly presented, but using well-known datasets and experiment setups would make the results more convincing. Additionally, the paper's main observation is interesting, but it lacks concrete evidence to support the claims of improved performance and efficiency. The authors provide some results on the benefits of sharing information across neurons, but more thorough analysis and comparison with other approaches are needed to fully understand the advantages of the proposed framework.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more detailed results on the performance of the proposed framework, including comparisons with other state-of-the-art models and analysis of the benefits of sharing information across neurons. Additionally, the authors should consider using more well-known datasets and experiment setups to make the results more convincing. It would also be helpful to provide more concrete evidence to support the claims of improved performance and efficiency, such as simulation results or benchmarking on multiple tasks.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper and provide additional evidence, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
* Can you provide more detailed results on the performance of the proposed framework, including comparisons with other state-of-the-art models?
* How do you plan to address the lack of interpretability of the recurrent neural network models, and what insights can be gained from the trained models?
* Can you provide more concrete evidence to support the claims of improved performance and efficiency, such as simulation results or benchmarking on multiple tasks?
