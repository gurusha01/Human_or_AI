Summary
The paper proposes a novel approach to investigate the ability of reinforcement learning (RL) agents to perform physics experiments and infer physical properties of objects in an environment. The authors introduce a recurrent A3C model to tackle this problem and propose two tasks: moving blocks to determine mass and poking towers to determine rigid bodies. The paper is well-written and well-motivated, but its main novelty comes from the task application, lacking architectural or theoretical contributions.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the paper's contribution to the goal of having agents learn object properties by interaction is limited, and its results' contribution to understanding agents that interact with their environment is not significant. Secondly, the approach of learning physical object properties through interaction is not novel and has been explored in other work, such as Agrawal et al. (2016).
Supporting Arguments
The paper proposes two tasks that represent a limited cross-section of prerequisite abilities for an agent to understand physics. The tasks may not be challenging, and the RL agent's ability to solve them is not surprising, making it difficult to determine the significance of the results. The paper claims that the agents learn different strategies to balance information gathering and mistake costs, but this behavior is not surprising given the problem setup. The description of the model is concise and lacks details, such as a diagram illustrating the inputs and outputs, making replication difficult.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, I suggest the authors provide more details about the model architecture and the experimental setup. They should also discuss the limitations of their approach and compare their results with other state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, the authors should consider exploring more complex tasks that require a deeper understanding of physics and provide a more comprehensive analysis of the results.
Questions for the Authors
I would like the authors to answer the following questions to clarify my understanding of the paper and provide additional evidence to support their claims:
1. Can you provide more details about the model architecture and the experimental setup?
2. How do you plan to address the limitations of your approach and explore more complex tasks that require a deeper understanding of physics?
3. Can you provide a more comprehensive analysis of the results and compare them with other state-of-the-art methods?
