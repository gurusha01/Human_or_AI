The paper presents a novel approach to the problem of transferring a sample in one domain to an analog sample in another domain, which is a fundamental problem in machine learning and computer vision. The authors propose a Domain Transfer Network (DTN) that employs a compound loss function to learn a generative function G that maps an input sample from the source domain to the target domain, while preserving the representation function f. The paper is well-written and easy to understand, with clear results presented in a straightforward manner.
I decide to accept this paper with two key reasons: (1) the approach is well-motivated and well-placed in the literature, and (2) the paper supports its claims with convincing experimental results. The authors provide a thorough review of related work and clearly explain the limitations of existing approaches. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DTN in transferring samples between different domains, including digits and face images.
The results may not be generalizable to other scenarios or tasks, such as spinning a top, and are limited to the specific task of locomotion. However, the study's findings may be influenced by the inclusion of a reference-pose cost, and removing it could potentially yield different results. The accompanying video is of good quality and effectively complements the paper.
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more analysis on the sensitivity of the hyperparameters and the robustness of the proposed method to different types of noise or perturbations. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more examples of the transferred samples and a more detailed comparison with other state-of-the-art methods.
I would like to ask the authors to clarify the following points: (1) How do the authors plan to extend the proposed method to more complex tasks, such as transferring samples between multiple domains? (2) Can the authors provide more insights into the learned representation function f and how it is used in the DTN? (3) How does the proposed method handle cases where the source and target domains have different distributions or densities?
