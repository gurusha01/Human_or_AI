Summary of the Paper's Claims and Contributions
The paper presents a novel approach to modeling neural spiking responses using a multitask recurrent neural network (RNN) framework. The authors demonstrate that this framework can significantly improve prediction over current state-of-the-art models, such as generalized linear models (GLMs), on a dataset of retinal neurons responding to natural scenes. The paper also highlights the benefits of sharing information across neurons in a multitask framework, leading to better and more stable predictions, even with relatively small amounts of experimental data.
Decision and Key Reasons
Based on the evaluation of the paper, I decide to Accept the paper with minor revisions. The two key reasons for this decision are: (1) the paper introduces a well-motivated and innovative approach to modeling neural spiking responses, and (2) the results demonstrate significant improvements in prediction performance over existing models.
Supporting Arguments
The paper is well-motivated, as it addresses a significant challenge in neuroscience: developing accurate predictive models of neural spiking responses. The authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, and their approach is well-placed in the literature. The results are also well-supported by empirical evidence, including comparisons with existing models and analyses of the benefits of the multitask framework.
Additional Feedback and Suggestions
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more detailed analyses of the computational features captured by the recurrent networks. Additionally, it would be helpful to include more discussions on the potential applications of the proposed framework in other brain areas and its limitations. Some specific questions I would like the authors to address in their revision include: (1) How do the authors plan to extend this approach to higher sensory areas? (2) What are the potential limitations of the proposed framework, and how can they be addressed? (3) Can the authors provide more insights into the computational features captured by the recurrent networks, and how they relate to existing models of neural processing?
