This paper proposes a novel end-to-end speech recognition system that combines a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a graph decoding approach, trained using a simpler sequence criterion called AutoSegCriterion (ASG). The system is designed to output letters directly from the speech signal, eliminating the need for phonetic transcription and force alignment. The authors claim that their approach is competitive with state-of-the-art systems on the LibriSpeech corpus, with a word error rate (WER) of 7.2% using MFCC features.
Based on the provided guidelines, I will evaluate this paper by answering the three key questions. 
1. The specific question/problem tackled by the paper is the development of a simple and efficient end-to-end speech recognition system that can learn to recognize speech without the need for phonetic transcription and force alignment.
2. The approach is well-motivated, as it addresses the limitations of traditional HMM/GMM-based systems and RNN-based approaches, which are often computationally expensive and require large amounts of training data.
3. The paper supports its claims with experimental results, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed ASG criterion and the overall system on the LibriSpeech corpus.
My decision is to accept this paper, with the main reason being that it presents a novel and well-motivated approach to speech recognition, with competitive results on a benchmark dataset. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear explanation of their methodology and results.
However, I do have some questions and suggestions for improvement. For example, how does the proposed ASG criterion compare to other sequence criteria, such as CTC, in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency? How does the system perform on other datasets and languages? Additionally, it would be interesting to see a more detailed analysis of the system's performance, including error analysis and comparisons to other state-of-the-art systems.
Some minor errors and suggestions for improvement include providing more details on the implementation of the ASG criterion and the decoder, as well as more examples of the system's output and error cases. Overall, this is a well-written and well-motivated paper that presents a novel approach to speech recognition, and I believe it would be a valuable contribution to the field. 
To clarify my understanding of the paper and provide additional evidence, I would like the authors to answer the following questions: 
- Can you provide more details on the implementation of the ASG criterion and the decoder?
- How does the system perform on other datasets and languages?
- Can you provide a more detailed analysis of the system's performance, including error analysis and comparisons to other state-of-the-art systems? 
- How does the proposed ASG criterion compare to other sequence criteria, such as CTC, in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency?
