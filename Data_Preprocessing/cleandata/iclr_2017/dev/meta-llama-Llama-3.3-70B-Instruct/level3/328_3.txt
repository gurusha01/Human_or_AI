Summary
The paper proposes a recurrent neural network (RNN) framework to model the spiking responses of retinal ganglion cells to natural images, outperforming traditional generalized linear models (GLMs). The authors demonstrate that a multitask RNN with shared parameters across neurons can accurately predict spike trains, even with limited training data. The results show that the RNN model captures both spatial and temporal nonlinearities, providing a more comprehensive understanding of neural processing in the retina.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, primarily because I am not convinced that the authors have learned much from the paper about neural processing. While the RNN model performs better than the GLM, the authors do not provide sufficient insights into what was learned about neural processing.
Supporting Arguments
The paper presents a well-motivated approach, and the results are scientifically rigorous. However, the use of a more complicated model, such as LSTM, does not improve performance, which raises questions about the complexity of the model. Additionally, the simplification of having all neurons in the network share the same parameters may not be realistic, and a model with free parameters could potentially outperform the current one with more training data.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more insights into what was learned about neural processing, such as the types of nonlinearities captured by the RNN model. The authors could also explore more complex models with more data to potentially improve predictions further. Additionally, the authors could consider using a model with free parameters to see if it outperforms the current model.
Questions for the Authors
I would like the authors to answer the following questions to clarify my understanding of the paper:
1. What specific insights did you gain about neural processing from the RNN model, and how do these insights advance our understanding of the retina?
2. How do you plan to address the potential limitations of the model, such as the simplification of having all neurons share the same parameters?
3. What are the potential applications of the RNN model in retinal prosthetics research, and how do you plan to extend this approach to higher sensory areas?
