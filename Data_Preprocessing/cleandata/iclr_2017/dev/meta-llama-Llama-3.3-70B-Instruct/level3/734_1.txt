The paper proposes a probabilistic deep neural network formulation for learning multiple views of data. However, the model makes inference difficult and invokes the VAE framework, which may not be the most efficient approach. The authors claim that their model is a type of CCA model, but this claim is questionable due to the lack of analysis on canonical correlation directions in the non-linear case.
The paper fails to discuss significant related work on non-linear multi-view models, including probabilistic and Bayesian approaches. The model brings together multi-view modeling and VAEs, but it is unclear if this is the proper way to extend VAE to multiple views. The proposed VCCA model does not promote the state of the art in terms of results and has limitations, such as requiring manual tuning of dimensionalities and relying on dropout to avoid learning redundant information.
The approximate posterior being parameterized only from one of the views makes the model less useful as a generic multi-view model. However, the paper convincingly shows the merit of attaching multiple views to VAE, and with more work, it could demonstrate a practical and efficient approach.
To answer the three key questions:
1. The specific question/problem tackled by the paper is how to learn multiple views of data using a probabilistic deep neural network formulation.
2. The approach is not well-motivated, as it lacks analysis on canonical correlation directions in the non-linear case and fails to discuss significant related work on non-linear multi-view models.
3. The paper does not support its claims, as the proposed VCCA model has limitations and does not promote the state of the art in terms of results.
To improve the paper, the authors could provide more analysis on the canonical correlation directions in the non-linear case, discuss related work on non-linear multi-view models, and address the limitations of the proposed VCCA model. Additionally, the authors could explore alternative approaches to extending VAE to multiple views and provide more experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness of their model.
Some questions to ask the authors include:
* How do you plan to address the limitations of the proposed VCCA model, such as requiring manual tuning of dimensionalities and relying on dropout to avoid learning redundant information?
* Can you provide more analysis on the canonical correlation directions in the non-linear case and discuss how your model relates to other non-linear multi-view models?
* How do you plan to extend the VCCA model to more than two views, and what are the potential applications of such an extension?
