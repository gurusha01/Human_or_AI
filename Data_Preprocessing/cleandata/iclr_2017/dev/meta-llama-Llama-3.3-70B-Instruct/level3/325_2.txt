The paper presents a novel method for training a generative model via an iterative denoising procedure, which is a clearly written and interesting approach. The proposed method has ties to other recent work on denoising models for sampling from distributions, and its novelty and potential to sidestep problems of current procedures for training directed generative models are notable. The method's ability to potentially address issues such as convergence and mode coverage problems, as well as problems with modeling multi-modal distributions, is a significant advantage.
Based on the provided guidelines, I will evaluate the paper by answering the three key questions. 
1. The specific question/problem tackled by the paper is how to provide strong privacy guarantees for training data in machine learning applications, particularly when dealing with sensitive data.
2. The approach is well-motivated, including being well-placed in the literature, as it builds upon existing work on differential privacy and knowledge transfer.
3. The paper supports its claims through a combination of theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation on benchmark datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed PATE approach in providing strong privacy guarantees while maintaining good utility.
My decision is to Accept the paper, with the key reason being that the paper presents a well-motivated and novel approach to providing strong privacy guarantees for training data, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
The paper's strengths include its clear and well-written presentation, its ability to address important problems in machine learning, and its strong empirical evaluation. However, there are some areas for improvement, such as the lack of direct comparison to other methods and the need for more details on training and hyperparameter settings.
To improve the paper, I would suggest adding more comparisons to other related work, providing more details on the experimental setup, and exploring the application of the PATE approach to other domains and datasets. Additionally, it would be helpful to clarify some of the minor errors and areas for improvement, such as the unclear explanations of the convolutional network structure and the unusual choice of parametrizing the variance via a sigmoid output unit.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper include: How does the number of teachers affect the privacy cost, and what is the optimal number of teachers for a given dataset? How does the PATE approach compare to other methods for providing differential privacy, such as the method proposed by Abadi et al.? Can the PATE approach be applied to other types of machine learning models, such as recurrent neural networks or transformers?
