Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper proposes a novel approach to domain transfer, which involves learning a generative function that maps an input sample from one domain to another, while preserving the representation of the input sample. The proposed Domain Transfer Network (DTN) uses a combination of a generative adversarial network (GAN) and a constancy term to ensure that the generated samples are indistinguishable from the target domain and preserve the representation of the input sample. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the DTN on several applications, including transferring images from one domain to another and generating face emojis from photos.
Decision and Key Reasons
Based on the review, I decide to Accept the paper. The two key reasons for this decision are:
1. Novelty and Originality: The paper proposes a novel approach to domain transfer, which combines a GAN with a constancy term to preserve the representation of the input sample. This approach is well-motivated and well-placed in the literature, and the paper provides a clear and concise explanation of the methodology.
2. Strong Experimental Results: The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the DTN on several applications, including transferring images from one domain to another and generating face emojis from photos. The results are impressive, and the paper provides a thorough evaluation of the approach, including comparisons to baseline methods and ablation studies.
Supporting Arguments

Additional Feedback and Questions
To improve the paper, I would suggest providing more details on the implementation of the DTN, including the architecture of the generator and discriminator networks, and the hyperparameters used in the experiments. I would also like to see more examples of the generated samples, including failures and limitations of the approach.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer are:
* How does the DTN handle cases where the input sample is not well-represented in the target domain?
* Can the DTN be used for other applications, such as transferring text or audio samples from one domain to another?
* How does the DTN compare to other approaches to domain transfer, such as style transfer or domain adaptation?
