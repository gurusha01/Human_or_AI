This paper proposes a novel approach to domain transfer, where a generative function G maps an input from a source domain to a target domain while preserving a representation function f, termed as f-constancy. The authors provide extensive experimental results on two visual domain adaptation tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of their approach.
I decide to accept this paper, with the main reason being the novelty and potential impact of the proposed approach. The paper tackles a specific and well-motivated problem, and the authors provide a clear and well-structured solution. The experimental results are convincing, and the comparison with baseline methods and other related work is thorough.
One of the key strengths of the paper is the clear explanation of the problem and the proposed solution. The authors provide a detailed description of the Domain Transfer Network (DTN) and its components, making it easy to follow and understand. The experimental results are also well-presented, with a clear evaluation of the proposed method and its comparison with other approaches.
However, I do have some concerns regarding the approach. For example, the authors force the function G to be a composition of g and f, which may have already lost information. This raises concerns about the recoverability of inputs from the source or target domain. Additionally, the procedure may need to be repeated for different tasks, such as recognizing expressions instead of identity, as the representation function f is learned with a particular task in mind.
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more insight into why the baseline method performs poorly and compare the proposed method with style transfer in generating emojis from photos. This would help to further demonstrate the effectiveness and uniqueness of the proposed approach.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer include: How does the choice of representation function f affect the performance of the DTN? Can the DTN be used for other types of domain transfer tasks, such as transferring text or audio? How does the proposed approach handle cases where the source and target domains have different distributions or statistics?
Overall, this is a well-written and well-structured paper that proposes a novel and effective approach to domain transfer. With some additional clarification and comparison with other approaches, this paper has the potential to make a significant impact in the field.
