Summary
The paper proposes a novel model-based approach to deep reinforcement learning, called Predictive Reinforcement Learning (PRL), which learns a predictive model of the environment that is independent of any strategy. The authors introduce a new kind of recurrent neural network, Residual Recurrent Neural Network (RRNN), which decouples memory from computation, allowing for more complex environments to be modeled. The approach is tested on three ATARI games, demonstrating that it can learn multiple tasks simultaneously without degradation in performance and even achieve better results than individual models trained on each game.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the experimental results are limited, and the performance on CIFAR-10 and SVHN is not comparable to recent generative models. Secondly, the costly projection method required to guarantee a bounded energy function is a limitation, and its cost may further limit the appeal of the paper.
Supporting Arguments
The paper has strong theoretical contributions, including a proper energy formulation of ReLU RBMs and a novel sampling mechanism, making it of interest to the ICLR community. However, the experimental results are not convincing, and the lack of comparison to state-of-the-art models is a significant weakness. Additionally, the projection method required to guarantee a bounded energy function is a significant limitation, and the authors do not provide a clear solution to address this issue.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, the authors should provide more comprehensive experimental results, including comparisons to state-of-the-art models and results on more challenging datasets. Additionally, the authors should address the limitation of the projection method and provide a clear solution to mitigate its cost. The authors may also consider providing more details on the implementation of the RRNN and the training process, as well as more analysis on the benefits and limitations of the PRL approach.
Questions for the Authors
I would like to ask the authors to clarify the following points:
* How do the authors plan to address the limitation of the projection method, and what are the potential solutions to mitigate its cost?
* Can the authors provide more comprehensive experimental results, including comparisons to state-of-the-art models and results on more challenging datasets?
* How do the authors think the PRL approach can be improved, and what are the potential directions for future research?
