Summary
The paper proposes an Input Switched Affine Network (ISAN) for character-level language modeling, which achieves comparable performance to traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) while being more interpretable and computationally efficient. The ISAN model uses affine transformations to update the hidden state, allowing for a linear analysis of the network's behavior. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of the ISAN model on the Text8 dataset and provide various analyses to understand its behavior, including the decomposition of current predictions into contributions from previous time steps and the visualization of word-level semantic information.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the paper's main ideas, A3C and curriculums, are not novel, and the authors do not provide sufficient evidence to demonstrate the significance of their contribution. Secondly, the experimental results may not be robust due to potential reliance on a single hyper-parameter sweep, rather than multiple random initializations.
Supporting Arguments
The paper applies A3C to 3D spatial navigation tasks, but it's not the first time this has been done, raising questions about its novelty as a conference paper. The experimental results, such as those in Fig 5, may not be robust due to potential reliance on a single hyper-parameter sweep, rather than multiple random initializations. While the authors demonstrate the practical application of A3C and curriculums in a real system, the lack of novelty and potential issues with the experimental results undermine the paper's contribution.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, the authors could provide more detailed analyses of the ISAN model's behavior, such as comparing its performance to other interpretable models or exploring its applications in other domains. Additionally, the authors could address the potential issues with the experimental results by performing multiple random initializations and reporting the average performance. The authors could also provide more context about the related work and how their contribution differs from existing research.
Questions for the Authors
I would like to ask the authors to clarify the following points:
* How do the authors plan to address the potential issues with the experimental results, such as performing multiple random initializations?
* Can the authors provide more detailed analyses of the ISAN model's behavior, such as comparing its performance to other interpretable models?
* How do the authors plan to extend their work to other domains, such as word-level language modeling or continuous-valued inputs?
