Summary of the Paper's Claims and Contributions
The paper proposes a novel approach to providing strong privacy guarantees for training data in machine learning applications, called Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles (PATE). The authors claim that their approach can protect the privacy of sensitive training data while maintaining the accuracy of the model. They demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on several benchmark datasets, including MNIST and SVHN, and show that it outperforms existing methods in terms of privacy-utility trade-offs.
Decision and Reasons
Based on the evaluation of the paper, I decide to reject the paper. The main reason for this decision is that the paper's premise is flawed, as the original paragraph vectors paper can actually infer representations for text outside of the training data, rendering the current work's foundation invalid. Additionally, the paper's approach, although novel, is not well-motivated, and the authors do not provide sufficient evidence to support their claims.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's approach is based on the idea of training an ensemble of teacher models on disjoint subsets of the sensitive data and then using a student model to learn from the aggregate output of the ensemble. However, the authors do not provide a clear explanation of why this approach is necessary or how it addresses the privacy concerns. Furthermore, the paper's evaluation is limited to a few benchmark datasets, and the authors do not provide a thorough analysis of the results or a comparison with existing methods.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, the authors should provide a more detailed explanation of their approach and its motivations. They should also conduct a more thorough evaluation of their method, including a comparison with existing methods and an analysis of the results. Additionally, the authors should consider addressing the limitations of their approach, such as the need for a large number of teachers and the potential impact on the accuracy of the model.
