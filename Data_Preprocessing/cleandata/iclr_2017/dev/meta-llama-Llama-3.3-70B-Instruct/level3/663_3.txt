Summary
The paper proposes an input-switched affine recurrent network (ISAN) for language modeling, which achieves comparable performance to traditional RNN architectures while providing improved interpretability. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of ISAN on a character-level language modeling task and provide various analyses to understand the model's behavior.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, with the main reason being that the approach, although sound and solid, lacks novelty as it uses standard practices like feature fusion and decision time fusion in multi-modal analysis. Additionally, the paper may be a better fit for venues focused on production systems rather than ICLR, which prioritizes novel algorithms and theories.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's contribution is primarily in demonstrating the effectiveness of ISAN on a specific task, rather than introducing a new algorithm or theory. While the authors provide various analyses to understand the model's behavior, the underlying approach is not particularly innovative. Furthermore, the paper's focus on production systems and computational efficiency may not align with the priorities of ICLR.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, the authors could consider highlighting the specific advantages of ISAN over traditional RNN architectures, such as its interpretability and computational efficiency. They could also provide more detailed comparisons with other state-of-the-art models and explore the potential applications of ISAN in other domains. Additionally, the authors may want to consider submitting the paper to a venue that is more focused on production systems and practical applications.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
1. How do the authors plan to address the scalability issues of ISAN when dealing with large vocabularies or continuous-valued inputs?
2. Can the authors provide more detailed comparisons with other state-of-the-art models, such as transformer-based architectures, to demonstrate the advantages of ISAN?
3. How do the authors envision ISAN being used in practice, and what are the potential applications of this model in other domains?
