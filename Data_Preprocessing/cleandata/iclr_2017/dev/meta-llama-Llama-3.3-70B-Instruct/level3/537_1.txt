Summary
The paper proposes a novel approach to learning distributed representations for pieces of text, introducing the Generative Paragraph Vector (GPV) and its supervised extension, Supervised Generative Paragraph Vector (SGPV). GPV is a probabilistic extension of the Paragraph Vector model, allowing for the inference of distributed representations for unseen texts. SGPV incorporates text labels into the model, enabling supervised representation learning. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their models on five text classification benchmark datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the paper lacks a critical baseline comparison against a generic GAN, making it hard to judge the benefit of the proposed structured GAN. Secondly, the problem domain of decoding barcode markers on bees is not directly addressed in the paper, and the application of the method to another problem domain, such as object detection from 3D models, could provide a more comprehensive evaluation.
Supporting Arguments
The paper proposes an interesting approach to learning distributed representations for text, but the evaluation could be improved with additional baselines. The lack of comparison against a generic GAN makes it difficult to assess the contribution of the proposed structured GAN. Furthermore, the paper's focus on text classification tasks may not be the most suitable application of the proposed method, and exploring other problem domains could provide more insight into its effectiveness.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, I suggest the authors consider adding a comparison against a generic GAN to evaluate the benefit of their proposed structured GAN. Additionally, applying the method to other problem domains, such as object detection from 3D models, could provide a more comprehensive evaluation of its effectiveness. The writing in the paper could also be improved, with clearer contributions and minor errors, such as figure and table annotations, and typos in the text, addressed.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper and provide additional evidence, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
1. Can you provide more details on the GAN architecture used in the paper and how it differs from a generic GAN?
2. How do you plan to address the lack of comparison against a generic GAN in the evaluation?
3. Can you discuss the potential applications of the proposed method to other problem domains, such as object detection from 3D models?
