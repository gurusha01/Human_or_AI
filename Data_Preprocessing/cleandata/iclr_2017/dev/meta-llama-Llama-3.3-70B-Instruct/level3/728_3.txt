Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper presents a novel approach to analyzing and understanding the behavior of trained policies in reinforcement learning (RL) using a Semi-Aggregated Markov Decision Process (SAMDP) model. The SAMDP model combines ideas from semi-MDPs and aggregated-MDPs to create a simplified transition matrix, allowing for the identification of higher-level skills and clustering of states. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of the SAMDP model in analyzing trained policies in various domains, including Atari games, and show its potential in improving the robustness of RL agents.
Decision and Reasons
Based on the review, I decide to Reject the paper, with the main reasons being:
1. Limited novelty: The paper's contributions, while interesting, are not significantly novel, and the ideas presented are similar to existing work in hierarchical RL methods.
2. Lack of rigorous evaluation: The evaluation section of the paper needs improvement, with more detailed results and precise evaluation metrics to demonstrate the method's full strength.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's approach to analyzing trained policies using SAMDP is promising, and the authors provide some interesting examples and results. However, the paper could benefit from more rigorous evaluation and comparison to existing methods. Additionally, the paper's writing and organization could be improved, with clearer explanations and definitions of key concepts.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, I suggest the authors:
* Provide more detailed and rigorous evaluation of the SAMDP model, including comparison to existing methods and metrics.
* Clarify the novelty and contributions of the paper, highlighting what sets it apart from existing work.
* Improve the writing and organization of the paper, with clearer explanations and definitions of key concepts.
* Consider addressing the question of consistency in re-building an SAMDP, as mentioned in the discussion section.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper and provide additional evidence, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
* Can you provide more details on the clustering algorithm used in the SAMDP model, and how it is modified to account for temporal information?
* How do you plan to address the issue of consistency in re-building an SAMDP, and what optimization problem do you propose to solve to account for all performance criteria?
* Can you provide more examples and results demonstrating the effectiveness of the SAMDP model in different domains and applications?
