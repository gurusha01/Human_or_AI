This paper explores the inductive bias of convolutional networks, specifically their ability to model correlations among regions of their input. The authors analyze convolutional arithmetic circuits, a type of convolutional network, and show that they can support exponentially high separation ranks for certain input partitions, while being limited to polynomial or linear separation ranks for others. The network's pooling geometry effectively determines which input partitions are favored, allowing for control over the inductive bias. The authors also demonstrate that shallow networks can only support linear separation ranks, implying that they cannot efficiently replicate the correlations modeled by deep networks.
The paper provides a thorough analysis of the inductive bias of convolutional networks, shedding light on their ability to model complex correlations in data. The results have implications for the design of convolutional networks, suggesting that the choice of pooling geometry can significantly impact their performance on different tasks. The authors also provide empirical validation of their findings, demonstrating the effectiveness of their approach on a synthetic classification benchmark.
