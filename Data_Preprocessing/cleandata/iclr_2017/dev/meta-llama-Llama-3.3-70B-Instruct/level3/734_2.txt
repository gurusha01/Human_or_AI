This review is based on the provided key points and conference guidelines.
The paper proposes Deep VCCA, a deep version of the probabilistic CCA model, and explores its connection to multi-view autoencoders. The authors demonstrate the strong merits of Deep VCCA in application, with strong experiments comparing it to alternative multi-view approaches under various datasets. However, the methodology used in the paper is not very interesting, as it is a straightforward extension of probabilistic CCA with neural net parameterized likelihoods and uses old techniques such as mean-field approximation.
To evaluate this paper, I will answer the three key questions: 
1. What is the specific question/problem tackled by the paper?
The paper tackles the problem of modeling correlations among regions of the input in convolutional networks.
2. Is the approach well motivated, including being well-placed in the literature?
The approach is well-motivated, as it explores the connection between Deep VCCA and multi-view autoencoders, and demonstrates its strong merits in application.
3. Does the paper support the claims?
The paper supports its claims through strong experiments and theoretical analysis, demonstrating the effectiveness of Deep VCCA in modeling correlations among regions of the input.
Based on these questions, I decide to accept the paper. The paper provides a well-motivated approach to modeling correlations in convolutional networks and supports its claims through strong experiments and theoretical analysis.
However, I would like to provide some additional feedback to improve the paper. The authors could consider using more advanced techniques, such as MCMC and non-amortized variational inference, to improve the model's performance. Additionally, the authors could provide more insights into the connection between Deep VCCA and multi-view autoencoders, and explore the potential applications of this connection.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper include: 
* Can the authors provide more details on the experimental setup and the datasets used to evaluate Deep VCCA?
* How do the authors plan to address the limitations of the mean-field approximation used in the paper?
* Can the authors provide more insights into the potential applications of Deep VCCA in real-world scenarios?
