The paper proposes a novel framework for modeling the co-evolution of user and item latent features in recommender systems, leveraging recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and temporal point processes. The authors claim that their approach, DEEPCOEVOLVE, outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both item and time prediction tasks on several real-world datasets.
I decide to reject this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the experimental results are confusing, as they conflate model and inference performance, making it difficult to understand the significance of the results. Secondly, the authors fail to discuss hyper-parameter selection, which is crucial for the reproducibility and reliability of the results.
To support these reasons, I provide the following arguments. The paper lacks a clear discussion on how the hyper-parameters were selected, which is essential for understanding the performance of the model. Additionally, the results are presented in a way that makes it challenging to distinguish between the performance of the model and the inference scheme. This lack of clarity makes it difficult to assess the true effectiveness of the proposed approach.
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors generate synthetic datasets to assess the proposed method's ability to recover true parameters and include error bars to determine statistical significance. Furthermore, I recommend that the authors provide a clearer interpretation of Figure 1 and the concept of unimodality in softmax basis in Section 3.2. Minor errors, such as the incorrect labeling of the last term in equation (3) and the lack of acknowledgement of prior work on inference networks, should also be addressed.
I would like the authors to answer the following questions to clarify my understanding of the paper: (1) How did you select the hyper-parameters for your model, and what was the rationale behind this selection? (2) Can you provide a more detailed explanation of the experimental results, including a clear distinction between model and inference performance? (3) How do you plan to address the issue of reproducibility, given the lack of discussion on hyper-parameter selection?
