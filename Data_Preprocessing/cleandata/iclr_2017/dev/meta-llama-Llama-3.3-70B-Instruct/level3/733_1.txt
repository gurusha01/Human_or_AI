The paper presents an anomaly-based host intrusion detection method using LSTM RNN to model system-call sequences and determine anomalies. The paper is well-written and clearly presents its ideas, demonstrating an interesting application of LSTM sequential modeling to the HIDS problem. However, the overall novelty of the paper is limited due to the use of established technical components like LSTM RNN and ensemble methods.
To evaluate this paper, I will answer the three key questions: 
1. What is the specific question/problem tackled by the paper?
The paper tackles the problem of anomaly-based host intrusion detection using LSTM RNN.
2. Is the approach well motivated, including being well-placed in the literature?
The approach is well-motivated, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the problem and the proposed solution. However, the use of established technical components like LSTM RNN and ensemble methods limits the novelty of the paper.
3. Does the paper support the claims?
The paper provides a clear explanation of the proposed method and its evaluation. However, the contribution of the proposed ensemble method is questionable and needs further evaluation, as ensemble ideas can also be applied to other baselines like kNN and kMC.
Based on these questions, I decide to reject the paper due to its limited novelty and the need for further evaluation of the proposed ensemble method.
The paper's main contribution is the application of LSTM RNN to the HIDS problem, which is interesting but not particularly novel. The use of ensemble methods is also not new, and the authors do not provide a clear explanation of why their specific ensemble method is better than others.
To improve the paper, the authors could provide more details on the evaluation of the proposed ensemble method and compare it to other ensemble methods. Additionally, they could discuss the limitations of their approach and potential future directions.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer are:
- How does the proposed ensemble method compare to other ensemble methods like bagging and boosting?
- What are the limitations of the proposed approach, and how can they be addressed in future work?
- How can the proposed method be applied to other anomaly detection problems, and what are the potential benefits and challenges?
