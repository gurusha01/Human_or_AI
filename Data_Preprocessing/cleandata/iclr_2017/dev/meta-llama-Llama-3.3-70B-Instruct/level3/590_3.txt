This paper proposes a novel approach to modeling the co-evolution of user and item features in recommender systems, leveraging recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and temporal point processes. The authors claim that their method, DEEPCOEVOLVE, outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both item prediction and time prediction tasks on several real-world datasets.
I decide to accept this paper, with two key reasons: (1) the paper tackles a specific and important problem in recommender systems, and (2) the approach is well-motivated and supported by empirical results.
The paper provides a clear and well-structured presentation of the problem, related work, and the proposed approach. The authors demonstrate a good understanding of the limitations of existing methods and propose a novel solution that addresses these limitations. The use of RNNs and temporal point processes is well-justified, and the authors provide a thorough explanation of the model and its components.
The empirical results are impressive, with DEEPCOEVOLVE outperforming state-of-the-art baselines on several datasets. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the results, discussing the strengths and weaknesses of their approach and identifying areas for future improvement.
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the hyperparameter tuning process and the computational resources required to train the model. Additionally, it would be helpful to include more visualizations of the results, such as plots of the predicted item rankings and time distributions.
I would like the authors to answer the following questions to clarify my understanding of the paper: (1) How did you select the hyperparameters for the RNN and temporal point process models? (2) Can you provide more details on the computational resources required to train the model, and how this might impact the scalability of the approach? (3) How do you plan to extend this work to other social applications, such as group dynamics in message services?
