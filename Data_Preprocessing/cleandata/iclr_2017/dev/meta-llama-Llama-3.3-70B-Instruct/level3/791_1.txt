Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper proposes a novel approach to visual representation learning using deep neural networks, based on an unsupervised training objective that encourages feature representations of patches from the same image to be closer. This approach is technically similar to existing methods, such as the "exemplar network", and can be seen as a type of data augmentation. The authors claim that their method is effective for initializing neural networks for supervised training on several datasets.
Decision and Key Reasons
I decide to reject this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the paper's experimental results are misleading due to unfair comparisons, particularly with exemplar convnets, which may achieve similar improvements with fine-tuning. Secondly, the method's usefulness may be limited to natural images where patches from the same image can be similar, and further comparison with other methods like "What-where" autoencoder in large-scale settings is needed.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's approach is well-motivated, and the idea of using patch contrasting for visual representation learning is reasonable, particularly for high-level features showing translation invariance. However, the experimental results are not convincing, and the comparisons with other methods are not fair. Additionally, the method's applicability to other types of images or datasets is not clear, and more experiments are needed to demonstrate its effectiveness.
Additional Feedback and Questions
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more fair and comprehensive comparisons with other methods, including exemplar convnets and "What-where" autoencoder. Additionally, they should demonstrate the effectiveness of their method on a wider range of datasets and images. I would like to ask the authors to clarify how their method handles cases where patches from the same image are not similar, and how they plan to extend their approach to other types of sequential data. Furthermore, I would like to know more about the computational complexity of their method and how it compares to other approaches.
