Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper proposes a novel method for domain transfer, which involves learning a generative function to map samples from one domain to another while preserving a given representation function. The authors introduce the Domain Transfer Network (DTN), which employs a compound loss function that includes a multiclass GAN loss, an f-preserving component, and a regularizing component. The method is applied to visual domains, including digits and face images, and demonstrates its ability to generate convincing novel images of previously unseen entities while preserving their identity.
Decision and Key Reasons
I decide to Accept this paper, with two key reasons for this choice:
1. The paper tackles a specific and well-motivated problem, namely, transferring samples from one domain to another while preserving a given representation function.
2. The approach is well-placed in the literature, building upon recent advances in GANs, domain adaptation, and style transfer.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a clear and well-structured introduction to the problem, related work, and the proposed method. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through various experiments, including digit and face image transfer, and provide a thorough analysis of the results. The use of a compound loss function and the introduction of a regularizing component are novel and well-motivated contributions.
Additional Feedback and Questions
To further improve the paper, I would like to see more discussion on the following points:
* How does the choice of the representation function f affect the results?
* Can the authors provide more insights into the learned function g and its properties?
* How does the method perform on other domains, such as text or audio?
* Can the authors provide more details on the implementation, including the architecture of the networks and the hyperparameter settings?
Specifically, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
* How did you choose the hyperparameters for the trade-off between the GAN loss and the f-preserving component?
* Can you provide more examples of the generated images, including failures and limitations of the method?
* How does the method handle cases where the target domain has a different distribution or structure than the source domain?
