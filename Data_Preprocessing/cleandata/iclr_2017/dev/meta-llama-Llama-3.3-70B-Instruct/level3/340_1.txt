Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper presents a novel unsupervised image transformation method, called Domain Transfer Network (DTN), which maps a sample from a source domain to a target domain without requiring aligned training pairs from the two domains. The DTN employs a compound loss function that includes a multiclass GAN loss, an f-preserving component, and a regularizing component that encourages the generator to map samples from the target domain to themselves. The method is based on GANs and decomposes the generation function into two modules: an encoder and a decoder to identify a common feature space and generate samples in the target domain.
Decision and Key Reasons
I decide to Accept this paper with two key reasons: (1) the paper tackles a novel and important problem of unsupervised domain transfer, which has potential impact in broad problem contexts, and (2) the proposed method is well-motivated, and the results are supported by careful ablation studies and quantitative evaluations.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a clear and well-structured presentation of the problem, related work, and the proposed method. The DTN architecture is well-designed, and the use of a compound loss function is justified. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the method in transferring images between different domains, including digits and face images. The results are visually impressive, and the quantitative evaluations support the method's effectiveness.
Additional Feedback and Questions
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors consider exploring the application of the DTN to other domains, such as text and images, and analyzing the method's ability to preserve facial attributes when mapping to the target domain. I would like the authors to answer the following questions: (1) How does the choice of the function f affect the performance of the DTN? (2) Can the DTN be used for other tasks, such as image-to-image translation or image generation? (3) How does the method handle cases where the source and target domains have different distributions or styles?
