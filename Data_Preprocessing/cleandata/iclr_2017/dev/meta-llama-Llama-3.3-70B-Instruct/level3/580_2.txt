This paper proposes an input-switched affine network (ISAN) for character-level language modeling, which is a type of RNN without pointwise nonlinearity. The authors demonstrate that ISAN achieves near-identical performance to traditional architectures on language modeling of Wikipedia text, while offering potential computational speedup and interpretability. The paper is well-motivated, and the approach is novel and of high quality.
I decide to reject this paper, primarily due to two reasons. Firstly, the results on both the ISAN model and its analysis are not entirely convincing, with the model only being trained on a small task and the analysis not providing much real insight into the learned network. Secondly, the ISAN architecture is limited to small-vocabulary language modeling and may not be suitable for larger scale tasks or general RNNs with large-vocab discrete or continuous input.
The analysis sections provide some interesting plots and ideas, but lack concrete insights, and it's unclear which analysis is specific to the ISAN model and which will generalize to general nonlinear RNNs. The quantity κs^t used in the analysis is also questionable, with some results seeming meaningless. For instance, the influence of the '' character on the logit of 'e' in the word "revenue" is not clearly explained.
To improve the paper, I suggest the authors provide more convincing results on larger tasks and more detailed analysis of the ISAN model's performance. Additionally, they should clarify the limitations of the ISAN architecture and provide more concrete insights into the learned network. I would like the authors to answer the following questions: (1) How can the ISAN architecture be scaled up to larger vocabulary language modeling tasks? (2) Can the authors provide more detailed analysis of the κ_s^t quantity and its significance in the ISAN model? (3) How does the ISAN model compare to other RNN architectures in terms of computational efficiency and interpretability? 
Overall, while the paper is well-motivated and novel, it requires more convincing results and detailed analysis to demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of the ISAN architecture.
