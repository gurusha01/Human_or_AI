Summary
The paper proposes a dynamic reader model for machine reading comprehension, which extracts and ranks answer candidates from a document. The model utilizes two unique aspects: a convolution model and dynamic chunking, which differentiate it from other recent question answering systems. The authors claim that their approach improves over earlier systems and provides a more accurate and efficient way of answering questions.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the paper lacks a thorough analysis of the benefits and limitations of the proposed techniques, making it challenging to evaluate the importance and impact of the proposed model. Secondly, the paper does not provide a clear comparison to alternative approaches, such as LSTM, to assess the effectiveness of the convolution network for phrase representation.
Supporting Arguments
The paper proposes a novel approach to machine reading comprehension, which is a significant contribution to the field. However, the lack of analysis and comparison to other approaches makes it difficult to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed model. The use of a convolution network for phrase representation is noteworthy, but it is unclear how it compares to other approaches, such as LSTM. Additionally, the dynamic chunking approach is promising, but it requires more analysis to understand its benefits and ability to capture long answer phrases.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide a more detailed analysis of the benefits and limitations of the proposed techniques. This could include a comparison to other approaches, such as LSTM, to assess the effectiveness of the convolution network for phrase representation. Additionally, the authors could provide more insight into the dynamic chunking approach and its ability to capture long answer phrases. Finally, the authors could consider providing more experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.
Questions for the Authors
I would like to ask the authors to clarify the following points:
* How does the convolution network for phrase representation compare to other approaches, such as LSTM?
* Can you provide more insight into the dynamic chunking approach and its ability to capture long answer phrases?
* How do you plan to address the lack of analysis and comparison to other approaches in the paper?
* Can you provide more experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model?
