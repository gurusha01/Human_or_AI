The paper proposes a novel approach to modeling neural spiking responses using a multitask recurrent neural network (RNN) framework, which shares features across neurons to improve predictive performance. The authors demonstrate that this approach outperforms traditional generalized linear models (GLMs) in predicting the spiking responses of primate retinal ganglion cells to natural images. The paper also introduces a GLM-RNN hybrid model, which provides insights into the aspects of retinal processing better captured by the recurrent neural networks.
However, after careful evaluation, I decide to reject this paper. The two main reasons for this decision are: (1) the writing of the paper needs significant improvement, with issues including unnecessary explanations, misleading statements, and criticism of existing models that is not entirely accurate; and (2) the proposed idea is incremental and not new to the field, with similar concepts already explored in previous works.
The paper's writing style makes it difficult to follow, with excessive explanations and misleading statements that detract from the main contributions. Furthermore, the criticism of existing models, such as LSTMs, is not entirely accurate and could be perceived as unfair. Additionally, the paper fails to provide a rigorous analysis of its main contribution, which is the use of a multitask RNN framework to model neural spiking responses.
The baseline models used in the paper are also weak and outdated, making it difficult to fully agree with the claim of achieving the best performance on the Penn Treebank corpus. The paper could benefit from using more recent and competitive baseline models to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors revise the writing style to make it more concise and clear, and provide a more accurate and fair comparison with existing models. Additionally, the authors should provide a more rigorous analysis of the main contribution and use more recent and competitive baseline models to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
I would like the authors to answer the following questions to clarify my understanding of the paper and provide additional evidence to support their claims: (1) Can you provide more details on how the multitask RNN framework is implemented and how it shares features across neurons? (2) How do you respond to the criticism that the proposed idea is incremental and not new to the field? (3) Can you provide more rigorous analysis and comparison with existing models to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach?
