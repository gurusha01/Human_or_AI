Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper explores the problem of transferring a sample in one domain to an analog sample in another domain, given two related domains, S and T, and a representation function f. The authors propose a Domain Transfer Network (DTN) that employs a compound loss function, including a multiclass GAN loss, an f-preserving component, and a regularizing component. The DTN is evaluated on two application domains: digits and face images, demonstrating its ability to generate convincing novel images of previously unseen entities while preserving their identity.
Decision and Key Reasons
I decide to accept this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the paper tackles a unique and overlooked question in the field of domain transfer, providing a novel perspective on the topic. Secondly, the authors' approach is well-motivated, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DTN in transferring samples between domains.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's structure and experiments are well-organized, clear, and easy to interpret, making it a pleasant read. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the contributions of each component of the loss function, demonstrating the importance of the f-constancy term and the GAN constraints. The results on the digit and face image domains are impressive, and the comparison with human annotators and other state-of-the-art methods is convincing.
Additional Feedback and Questions
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors consider more realistic physical constraints, such as actuator constraints and communication delays, to increase the study's impact. I would also like to see more analysis on the limitations of the proposed approach and potential avenues for future research. Some questions I would like the authors to answer include: How does the choice of the representation function f affect the performance of the DTN? Can the DTN be applied to other domains beyond digits and face images? How does the proposed approach compare to other domain adaptation methods in terms of efficiency and effectiveness?
