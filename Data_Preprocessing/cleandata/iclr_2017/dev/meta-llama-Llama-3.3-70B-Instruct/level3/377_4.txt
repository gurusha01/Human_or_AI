Summary of the Paper
The paper proposes a novel approach to learning latent properties in an agent's environment through deep reinforcement learning methods. The approach combines convolutional layers for perception and later layers for learning actions based on reinforcement signals, allowing for direct application to robots with image inputs and fist-like actuator actions. The paper presents a new problem of learning physical properties by interacting with the environment and introduces higher-order recurrent neural networks (HORNNs) to model long-term dependency in sequential data.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper with two key reasons: (1) lack of algorithmic contribution, as the paper applies existing tools and methods rather than developing new ones or extending them, and (2) missing crucial experiments, such as the "Fist Pixels" setting in the Towers experiment, which is essential to confirm the approach's applicability to real-world robots.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's approach, although well-motivated, relies heavily on existing techniques and does not provide significant algorithmic contributions. Furthermore, the absence of critical experiments, such as the "Fist Pixels" setting, raises concerns about the approach's effectiveness in real-world scenarios. The paper's results, although promising, are not sufficient to support the claims made, and the lack of comparison to baseline methods makes it difficult to evaluate the agent's learning and the benefits of the proposed approach.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors (1) provide a more detailed analysis of the proposed approach's limitations and potential applications, (2) conduct additional experiments to demonstrate the approach's effectiveness in various scenarios, and (3) compare the results to baseline methods to provide a more comprehensive evaluation. Additionally, I would like the authors to clarify how the proposed approach can be applied to real-world robots and what specific benefits it provides over existing methods.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper and provide additional evidence, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
1. Can you provide more details on how the proposed approach can be applied to real-world robots, and what specific benefits it provides over existing methods?
2. How do you plan to address the lack of algorithmic contribution, and what potential extensions or improvements can be made to the proposed approach?
3. Can you provide additional experimental results, including the "Fist Pixels" setting, to demonstrate the approach's effectiveness in various scenarios?
