Summary
The paper introduces a multi-model product classification system with three modules: Image CNN, text CNN, and decision-level fusion policies. The system shows that text CNN alone works better than image CNN, and multi-model fusion can improve accuracy by a small margin. However, the performance gain of the proposed system is limited, and the technical novelty of the paper is also limited as all the decision-level fusion policies have been investigated by previous methods before.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper with two key reasons: (1) the limited technical novelty and performance gain of the proposed system, and (2) the lack of reporting results on other datasets and not releasing the Walmart dataset, making it hard to reproduce the results.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's technical novelty is limited because all the decision-level fusion policies have been investigated by previous methods before. The performance gain of the proposed system is also limited, which is a major concern. Furthermore, the paper only reports results on a single dataset (Walmart dataset) and does not release the dataset, making it hard to reproduce the results. This lack of transparency and reproducibility is a significant issue.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, the authors could consider reporting results on other datasets and releasing the Walmart dataset to increase transparency and reproducibility. Additionally, the authors could explore more novel and effective decision-level fusion policies to improve the performance of the system. The authors could also provide more detailed analysis and discussion on the results, including the limitations and potential future directions.
Questions for the Authors
I would like to ask the authors to clarify the following points:
* How do the authors plan to address the limited technical novelty and performance gain of the proposed system?
* Can the authors provide more detailed information about the Walmart dataset, such as its size, composition, and collection process?
* How do the authors plan to increase the transparency and reproducibility of their results, such as by releasing the dataset or providing more detailed descriptions of their methods and experiments?
