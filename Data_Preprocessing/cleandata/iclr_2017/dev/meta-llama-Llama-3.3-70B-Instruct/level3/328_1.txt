This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of neuroscience by demonstrating the ability of nonlinear recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to model neural response properties, particularly in accounting for transient responses. The authors show that RNNs outperform conventional models, such as generalized linear models (GLMs), in predicting the spiking responses of primate retinal ganglion cells to natural images.
I decide to accept this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the approach is well-motivated and placed in the literature, addressing a challenge in the field where standard receptive field models have struggled to explain responses to natural movies. Secondly, the paper supports its claims with rigorous empirical results, demonstrating the superiority of RNNs over GLMs in predicting neural spiking responses.
The authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of their methodology, including the use of a multitask framework with shared parameters across neurons. The results show that RNNs consistently outperform GLMs, capturing around 80% of the explainable variance across experiments and cell types. The authors also investigate the benefits of the multitask framework and show that it leads to better and more stable predictions.
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors consider pruning and simplifying the trained RNN to identify critical components contributing to its performance. This would provide further insight into the workings of the RNN and help to address the "black box" nature of deep networks. Additionally, I would like clarification on the definition of a "movie" in the paper, specifically whether it refers to a sequence of unrelated images or actual dynamic natural scenes.
I would like the authors to answer the following questions to clarify my understanding of the paper: (1) Can you provide more details on the specific characteristics of the natural images used in the study, and how they relate to the performance of the RNNs? (2) How do you plan to extend this approach to higher sensory areas, and what potential challenges do you anticipate? (3) Can you provide more insight into the computational features that are important to include in simpler models, as identified by the trained neural network models? 
Overall, this paper presents a significant advance in the field of neuroscience and has the potential to enable new, richer models of complex nonlinear spiking computations in other brain areas.
