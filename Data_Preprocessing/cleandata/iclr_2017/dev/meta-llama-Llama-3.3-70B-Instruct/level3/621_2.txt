This paper proposes a novel method for modeling the distribution of user-item interactions using a recurrent coevolutionary feature embedding process. The approach combines a recurrent neural network (RNN) with a multi-dimensional temporal point process to capture the nonlinear co-evolution of user and item latent features. The model is evaluated on three real-world datasets, demonstrating significant improvements in both item and time prediction tasks compared to state-of-the-art methods.
I decide to accept this paper for the following key reasons: 
1. The paper tackles a specific and well-defined problem in the field of recommender systems, which is to model the co-evolution of user and item latent features over time.
2. The approach is well-motivated and placed in the literature, building upon existing work on temporal point processes and RNNs.
The paper supports its claims through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method in capturing the nonlinear co-evolution of user and item latent features. The results show significant improvements in both item and time prediction tasks, which is a notable contribution to the field.
To further improve the paper, I suggest the authors provide more details on the hyperparameter tuning process and the sensitivity of the model to different hyperparameter settings. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more visualizations of the learned user and item embeddings to gain a better understanding of the co-evolutionary process.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper include: 
* Can you provide more insights into the interpretation of the learned user and item embeddings, and how they relate to the co-evolutionary process?
* How do you plan to extend this work to other social applications, such as group dynamics in message services, and what challenges do you anticipate in doing so?
* Can you discuss the potential limitations of the proposed method, such as the assumption of a Rayleigh distribution for the time intervals between consecutive events, and how you plan to address these limitations in future work?
