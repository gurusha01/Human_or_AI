This paper proposes a novel recommender system based on a time-dependent point process model, which captures the co-evolution of user and item latent features over time. The model combines a recurrent neural network (RNN) with a multi-dimensional point process to learn the nonlinear relationships between users and items. The authors claim that their approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both item prediction and time prediction tasks.
I decide to Reject this paper for the following reasons:
1. Lack of justification for the choice of point process: The authors do not provide a clear justification for choosing a Rayleigh process to model the user-item interactions. While they mention that it is well-adapted to modeling fads, they do not explain why this is the case or how it relates to the specific problem of recommender systems.
2. Unclear evaluation criteria: The authors introduce a new evaluation metric, Mean Average Rank (MAR), but do not provide a clear explanation of how it is calculated or why it is a suitable metric for evaluating recommender systems. Additionally, they do not compare the complexity or execution time of their method with other state-of-the-art methods.
The paper's technical soundness is overshadowed by the similarity with the authors' previous work, and they fail to convince that this is not a marginal extension of their previous research. Furthermore, the model's scalability and ability to handle large datasets are concerning, as the complexity of the method is proportional to the number of items and users.
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors:
* Provide a clear justification for the choice of point process and explain how it relates to the problem of recommender systems.
* Clarify the evaluation criteria and provide a detailed explanation of how the MAR metric is calculated.
* Compare the complexity and execution time of their method with other state-of-the-art methods.
* Address the concerns about scalability and provide experiments to demonstrate the model's ability to handle large datasets.
I would like the authors to answer the following questions to clarify my understanding of the paper:
* Can you provide more details on why you chose a Rayleigh process to model user-item interactions, and how it relates to the specific problem of recommender systems?
* Can you explain how the MAR metric is calculated, and why it is a suitable metric for evaluating recommender systems?
* How do you plan to address the concerns about scalability, and can you provide experiments to demonstrate the model's ability to handle large datasets?
