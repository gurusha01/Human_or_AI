Summary
The paper presents a novel model-based approach to deep reinforcement learning, which combines learning from raw waveforms and training letter-based CTC networks using a purely ConvNet. The key contribution is the end-to-end sequence training criterion for the CTC variant, allowing for sequence training without generating denominator lattices. The approach is evaluated on the large-scale Librispeech corpus, and the results show that it can surpass human performance simultaneously on three different games.
Decision
I decide to accept this paper, with two key reasons: (1) the paper presents a unique and well-motivated approach to deep reinforcement learning, and (2) the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in learning multiple tasks simultaneously.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a clear and well-structured presentation of the approach, including the prediction problem, the model architecture, and the training procedure. The results are impressive, showing that the approach can beat human performance in three different tasks simultaneously, and that it can benefit from learning multiple tasks. The paper also discusses potential limitations and future directions, demonstrating a thorough understanding of the research area.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest exploring the effect of increasing the step size, such as to 30ms or 40ms, which could potentially improve performance while reducing computational cost. Additionally, it would be interesting to see a more detailed analysis of the results, including a comparison with other state-of-the-art approaches.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like to ask the authors to provide more information on the following: (1) How does the approach handle long-term dependencies in the data? (2) Can the authors provide more details on the training procedure, including the learning schedule and the batch size? (3) How does the approach generalize to other environments and tasks beyond the ATARI games?
