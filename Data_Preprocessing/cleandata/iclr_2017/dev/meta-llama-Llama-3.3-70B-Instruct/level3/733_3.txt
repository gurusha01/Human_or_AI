The paper proposes a novel approach for anomaly detection in intrusion detection using system call sequences and LSTM-RNN language models. The approach uses an ensemble of multiple LSTM language models with diverse hyperparameters and combines their likelihoods to detect anomalies. However, a major drawback of the approach is its potential vulnerability to attacks that interleave malicious system calls with normal ones to fool the system.
To evaluate the paper, I will answer the three key questions: 
1. What is the specific question/problem tackled by the paper? 
The paper tackles the problem of anomaly detection in intrusion detection using system call sequences and LSTM-RNN language models.
2. Is the approach well motivated, including being well-placed in the literature? 
The approach is well-motivated, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the problem and the proposed solution. However, the paper could be improved by adding a discussion on the use of RNNs in other anomaly detection tasks to provide context for the novelty of the approach.
3. Does the paper support the claims? 
The paper provides a clear explanation of the proposed approach and its evaluation. However, the evaluation could be more comprehensive, and the authors could provide more details on the experimental setup and the results.
Based on these questions, I decide to accept the paper with some revisions. The paper provides a novel approach to anomaly detection, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the proposed solution. However, the paper could be improved by adding more context and discussion on the use of RNNs in other anomaly detection tasks.
To improve the paper, I provide the following feedback: 
* Add a discussion on the use of RNNs in other anomaly detection tasks to provide context for the novelty of the approach.
* Provide more details on the experimental setup and the results.
* Consider adding more comprehensive evaluation metrics to assess the performance of the proposed approach.
I would like the authors to answer the following questions to clarify my understanding of the paper: 
* Can you provide more details on the experimental setup and the results?
* How do you plan to address the potential vulnerability of the approach to attacks that interleave malicious system calls with normal ones?
* Can you provide more context on the use of RNNs in other anomaly detection tasks and how the proposed approach differs from existing solutions?
