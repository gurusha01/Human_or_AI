Summary
The paper proposes a novel approach to learning distributed representations for pieces of text, introducing the Generative Paragraph Vector (GPV) and its supervised extension, Supervised Generative Paragraph Vector (SGPV). GPV is a probabilistic extension of the Distributed Bag of Words version of Paragraph Vector, allowing for the inference of distributed representations for unseen texts. SGPV incorporates text labels into the model, enabling supervised representation learning and prediction tasks. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their models on five text classification benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the benefits of the proposed GPV and SGPV models over traditional GAN approaches and data augmentation techniques are unclear, lacking a thorough comparison and analysis. Secondly, the evaluation and comparisons are limited, with results shown only on a single dataset/task, which is insufficient to demonstrate the generalizability and robustness of the proposed models.
Supporting Arguments
The paper proposes a novel architecture, but it is unclear how it improves upon existing methods. The authors claim that GPV and SGPV outperform state-of-the-art baselines, but the comparison is limited to a single dataset/task, and the results may not generalize to other scenarios. Additionally, the paper lacks a thorough analysis of the impact of different stages in the proposed method on performance, leaving questions about the importance of each stage and the effect of including or excluding them.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, the authors should provide a more comprehensive comparison with traditional GAN approaches and data augmentation techniques, highlighting the advantages and limitations of their proposed models. Furthermore, the authors should conduct a more extensive evaluation of their models on multiple datasets and tasks, demonstrating their generalizability and robustness. It would also be beneficial to include a more detailed analysis of the impact of different stages in the proposed method on performance, providing insights into the importance of each stage and the effect of including or excluding them.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper and provide additional evidence, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
1. How do GPV and SGPV improve upon traditional GAN approaches and data augmentation techniques?
2. Can the authors provide more extensive evaluation results on multiple datasets and tasks, demonstrating the generalizability and robustness of their proposed models?
3. How do the different stages in the proposed method contribute to the overall performance, and what is the effect of including or excluding each stage?
