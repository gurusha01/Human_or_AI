Summary
The paper presents a novel approach to modeling sensory neurons using multitask recurrent neural networks (RNNs). The authors demonstrate that RNNs can effectively predict the spiking responses of parasol ganglion cells in the primate retina to natural images, outperforming traditional generalized linear models (GLMs). The paper introduces neural network modeling to a field that has not previously used it and is likely to be very effective in this area.
Decision
I decide to Accept this paper with minor revisions. The primary reason for this decision is that the paper presents a clear and well-motivated approach to modeling sensory neurons, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of RNNs in predicting neural responses. The paper also introduces a new framework for modeling neural computations, which has the potential to be applied to other brain areas.
Supporting Arguments
The paper tackles a specific question of developing accurate predictive models of sensory neurons, which is vital to understanding sensory processing and brain computations. The approach is well-motivated, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the limitations of traditional models and the benefits of using RNNs. The results are scientifically rigorous, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of the performance of different models.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors clarify some of the methods, such as the explanation of the receptive field center estimation and the model training process. Additionally, the authors could provide more details on the architecture of the RNNs and the hyperparameters used. The figures could also be improved for better presentation.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
1. Can you provide more details on the computational resources required to train the RNNs, and how this might impact the applicability of the approach to larger datasets?
2. How do you plan to extend this approach to higher sensory areas, and what challenges do you anticipate in doing so?
3. Can you provide more insight into the interpretability of the RNNs, and how the authors plan to tease apart the computations performed by the recurrent units?
