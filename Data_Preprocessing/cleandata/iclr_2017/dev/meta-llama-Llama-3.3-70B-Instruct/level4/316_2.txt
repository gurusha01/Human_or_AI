This paper explores a method for ensuring the privacy of training data by utilizing multiple models, each trained on disjoint datasets, as "teacher" models to instruct a "student" model. The student model learns to predict an output based on a noisy voting process among all the teachers.
The theoretical findings presented are both appealing and logical. The use of noisy voting among teachers to guide the student model reduces the likelihood of the student model replicating the teachers' behavior, thereby enhancing privacy. However, the probabilistic bounds provided contain several empirical parameters, making it challenging to ascertain whether the proposed approach offers absolute security guarantees.
The experimental evaluations conducted on the MNIST and SVHN datasets are commendable. Nevertheless, given the paper's assertion that this approach is particularly suited for sensitive data, such as medical records, it would be beneficial to include additional experiments that demonstrate its efficacy in these contexts to further substantiate its potential applications.
