I have mixed feelings about this submission. The utilization of the MPEG-7 dataset and references to curvature scale space evokes the notion that if a task is not worthwhile, it is not worth executing it well. It is undeniable that the MPEG-7 dataset and benchmark have been exhausted for some time, making it surprising to encounter it in a submission to a contemporary machine learning conference. Upon inquiry, the authors justified their choice of representation by stating that their primary objective was to establish a connection between the theoretical framework of differential geometry of curves and the computational capabilities of a convolutional neural network. This rationale is acceptable, as these fields do appear to be distinct, and the authors deserve recognition for attempting to bridge this gap. Assuming that this endeavor is worthwhile, the authors' approach, which employs a Siamese configuration, is logical, and their adaptation of deep convolutional network frameworks to one-dimensional signals is reasonable. Given that traditional invariant-based methods relied on smoothed or filtered representations combined with nonlinearities, it is sensible to reexamine this problem using convolutional networks. While I would not object to this paper being accepted, as it offers a unique perspective that deviates from the mainstream, I am concerned that the audience at ICLR may be too narrow, with limited interest in this type of shape representation.
