This paper presents a novel unsupervised training approach for visual representation learning using deep neural networks, leveraging patch contrasting to optimize feature representations. Specifically, it encourages the feature representations of patches from the same image to be more similar than those from different images, by optimizing the distance ratios of positive training pairs. The empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method as an initialization technique for supervised training.
Strengths:
- The proposed training objective is well-founded, particularly in its ability to capture translation-invariant high-level features.
- The method has been shown to be effective in initializing neural networks for supervised training across multiple datasets.
Weaknesses:
- The technical approach bears similarities to the "exemplar network" (Dosovitskiy 2015), where cropping patches from a single image can be viewed as a form of data augmentation comparable to the positive sample augmentation in the exemplar network.
- The experimental presentation is misleading. The reported results involve fine-tuning the entire network with supervision, whereas the comparison to exemplar convnets (Dosovitskiy 2015) is based on unsupervised feature learning without fine-tuning. This disparity makes the comparison unfair, and it is likely that exemplar convnets would achieve similar improvements with fine-tuning. Therefore, a head-to-head comparison with and without fine-tuning, using the same architecture except for the loss function, is necessary to make the results convincing.
Furthermore, a comparison to the "What-where" autoencoder (Zhao et al, 2015) in a large-scale setting, as demonstrated by Zhang et al (ICML 2016), would be intriguing. With the latest GPU technology (e.g., TITAN-X level), training an AlexNet is feasible and would provide a more comprehensive evaluation. The proposed method appears to be limited to natural images, where patches from the same image tend to share similarities, which restricts its broader applicability.
