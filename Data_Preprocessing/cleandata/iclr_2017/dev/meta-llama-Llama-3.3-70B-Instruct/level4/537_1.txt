This manuscript explores the challenge of decoding barcode-like markers in images by leveraging a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on data generated from a generative adversarial network (GAN). The GAN is trained using unlabeled images and incorporates a "3D model" that undergoes learned image transformations, such as blur, lighting, and background changes. The parameters of these transformations are optimized to deceive the GAN discriminator. The CNN is then trained on images produced by the GAN and its performance is compared to that of hand-crafted features and training with real images, demonstrating superior decoding capabilities.
Although the proposed GAN architecture shows potential, the evaluation could be strengthened, which prevents me from fully endorsing the paper. A notable omission is a comparison with a generic GAN, making it difficult to assess the benefits of the more structured approach. Additionally, it would be valuable to investigate the outcome of combining generated and real images for the final task.
Relevant references for object detection using rendered views of 3D shapes include the works by Xingchao Peng et al. (ICCV 2015) and Francisco Massa et al. (CVPR 2016), which demonstrate the application of similar concepts to broader problem domains. The current focus on decoding barcode markers on bees is somewhat limited, and applying this method to other domains, such as object detection from 3D models, could facilitate more direct comparisons with prior work.
The writing throughout the paper could be improved for clarity, as the introduction initially lacks a clear statement of the paper's contribution. Minor suggestions include verifying the authenticity of the 3D model renders in Figure 3, correcting the term "chapter" to "section" on page 3, specifying the loss function used for the DCNN in Table 2, and explaining the artifacts observed in the last four images of Figure 9(a).
