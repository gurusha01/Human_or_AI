Although I lack in-depth knowledge of mean-field techniques, which limits my ability to fully assess the validity of Equation 2, I am prepared to accept it for the purposes of this review.
On a minor note regarding presentation, referring to the "evolution" of \(x{i;a}\) as it progresses through the network might provide useful insight for some readers. However, I found this terminology somewhat confusing because \(x{*;a}\) is defined as an immutable input vector. It's actually the newly introduced variables \(z\) and \(y\) that represent the evolution or transformation of the input, not \(x_{i;a}\) itself.
When interpreting the analysis presented, it appears that a network could potentially be trainable even if information does not initially pass through it. This could occur if the training process alters the weights in such a way that information begins to flow through the network, provided that subsequent training steps do not then alter the weights to halt this information flow. To clarify this point, it might be beneficial to include a definition of what constitutes a "training algorithm" in this context.
Regarding the central claims made, previous research on initializing neural networks to facilitate information flow, such as the work by Glorot & Bengio, should be considered.
