This paper proposes a novel approach to modeling the distribution of four-part Bach chorales utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks, and explores the application of this model to artificial music generation through blocked Gibbs sampling.
The employment of a CNN to model the distribution appears to be a suitable choice for the given data. Additionally, the examination of the proposed sampling schemes, drawing an analogy between Gibbs sampling and human music composition, is a fascinating aspect of the paper.
However, I have some reservations regarding the evaluation methodology. The reported likelihoods are not directly comparable to existing work, making it challenging to assess the quality of the quantitative results. In the human evaluation, I would appreciate seeing the data from direct comparisons between models, such as a comparison between NADE and Bach. I also believe that asking participants to express a preference for a particular piece of music is a more robust test than inquiring which piece is more "musical", as the latter term may be open to interpretation by the AMT workers.
A further consideration is the potential limitations of this approach in terms of its generalizability to other types of music, which may exhibit distinct data distributions. While Bach chorales are undoubtedly interesting and worthy of analysis, it is unclear how well this modeling approach will translate to other musical genres.
In summary, despite some limitations, I find this to be an intriguing model that tackles a compelling task and generates noteworthy musical data, making it a valuable contribution to the field.
