This paper presents a well-structured and easily comprehensible result, demonstrating the potential of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) as predictive models for neuron firing rates in the retina, albeit with a relatively straightforward outcome.
From one perspective, the primary scientific contribution of this study appears to be a confirmation of the effectiveness of this approach, with the benefits of using RNNs being somewhat modest in the context of this specific stimulus-locked task, and not yet providing novel insights into the underlying biology.
However, from another perspective, this work, in conjunction with the concurrent research by McIntosh et al., has the potential to introduce neural network modeling to a field where it is currently underutilized, and is likely to yield significant benefits.
It would be fascinating to see the application of a similar framework incorporating Local Field Potentials (LFP) and other neurons as input, as well as exploring shorter discretization time scales, which could lead to more compelling results.
I anticipate that follow-up studies building upon this foundational work will yield increasingly intriguing outcomes.
Minor suggestions:
In Section 3.2, the purpose of the 0.833 ms bins is unclear and warrants further clarification.
To maintain consistency, it is recommended to use the term "epoch" throughout the paper, rather than alternating between "epoch" and "pass through data".
Figure 4 would benefit from a logarithmic scale on the x-axis, enhancing the visualization and interpretation of the results.
