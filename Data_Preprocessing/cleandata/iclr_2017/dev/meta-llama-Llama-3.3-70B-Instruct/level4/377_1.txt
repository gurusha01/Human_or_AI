This paper explores the use of physical interactions to infer physical outcomes, a topic of significant interest in the machine learning community, particularly in the realm of understanding physics. The authors take a novel approach by applying deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques to experimental setups where prior knowledge of physical properties or rules is absent. While the idea presented is intriguing, the overall contribution of the paper remains unclear in my opinion.
The experimental designs are noteworthy, aiming to determine the relative weights of blocks or identify glued blocks solely through physical interactions such as pushing and pulling, without any prior information. The paper demonstrates reasonable performance on these tasks, providing detailed scenarios for each experiment.
However, despite the interest generated by these experiments and their results, the novelty and impact of the contribution are not clearly established. A key question arises: does this work offer new insights into the field? The tasks, although focused on physical experiments, may not significantly differ from typical DRL tasks, such as learning from game environments like Atari, potentially making them easier or less distinctive. To enhance the paper, I believe the authors could delve deeper into the analysis of learned representations or discuss how the experimental outcomes relate to human behavior or physical laws and properties.
My overall assessment is mixed, leaning towards recommending acceptance due to the merit of the idea, although I think a more in-depth analysis would strengthen the paper.
Several specific points warrant further clarification or consideration:
(1) The assumption that interaction is necessary for learning physical properties could be revisited, as observation might also facilitate learning.
(2) Figure 1 is missing a Y-axis label, which should be added for clarity.
(3) While the relation to bandit problems is interesting, the formal approach relies entirely on DRL.
(4) The difficulty in distinguishing between the two heaviest blocks due to a small mass gap seems counterintuitive, as even minor differences in speed could potentially be discerned by a machine, unless this is a limitation of the network architecture.
(5) The decision to use feature observations for the remaining experiments due to faster training times could be supported by showing a correlation of performances at the instance level.
(6) Many conclusions, such as task difficulty, appear to be based on a specific training distribution. It would be beneficial to test these across various distributions to ensure the findings are robust.
(7) The inclusion of a baseline approach for comparison would enhance the evaluation of the proposed method's effectiveness.
