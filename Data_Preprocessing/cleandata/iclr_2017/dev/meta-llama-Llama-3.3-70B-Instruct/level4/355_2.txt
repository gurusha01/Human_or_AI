This paper essentially utilizes Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) for 3D spatial navigation tasks.
- The application of A3C to 3D navigation is not unprecedented, as the original A3C paper included such experiments. While the experimental results presented here are noteworthy, it is questionable whether this work offers sufficient new insights to justify its status as a conference paper, potentially making it more suitable as a workshop contribution.
- The graphs presented in Figure 5 appear to be based on a single hyper-parameter sweep. To enhance the robustness of the comparisons, the authors should consider reporting results from multiple random initializations.
- Overall, the two primary concepts explored in this paper, A3C and curriculums, are not particularly innovative. However, the authors do demonstrate their practical application in a real-world system, showcasing their utility in this context.
