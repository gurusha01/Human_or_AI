I regret the delay in submitting my review.
This manuscript presents a novel approach to structure estimation by formulating it as a supervised classification problem, where the input is an empirical covariance matrix of observed data and the output is a binary decision indicating whether two variables share a link. The paper is well-organized, with clear objectives and a thorough description of the methodology.
A notable highlight of the paper is the empirical results presented in the experimental section, which demonstrate that this simple approach outperforms previous non-learning-based methods. This finding is noteworthy and has significant implications for structure discovery problems.
I consider the construction of the supervised learning method to be a reasonable attempt to address this problem, although it lacks substantial technical novelty. For instance, developing an algorithm that is invariant to data permutation could have been a potential area for technical contribution. However, the authors do not make any claims in this regard, and the method is well-constructed and effectively executed.
The authors have done a commendable job in clearly stating the theoretical aspects of the paper. The results are straightforward, and I appreciate that the claims are explicitly stated, even if they do not come as a surprise. 
In conclusion, the paper makes a compelling observation that graph estimation can be formulated as a supervised learning problem, and training data from a separate source can be used to learn structure in novel and unseen test data from a new source. While this approach may have practical relevance, with stronger empirical results, it may also be limited by concerns about interpretability, which the authors acknowledge as a potential area for future work. Overall, this is a good initial step, and although it could be improved, it stands on its own merit.
