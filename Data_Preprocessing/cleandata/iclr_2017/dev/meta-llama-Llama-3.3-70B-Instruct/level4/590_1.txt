SYNOPSIS: This paper presents a novel neural network-based approach to reading comprehension, enabling the prediction of answers with varying lengths, unlike existing models that are limited to single words or entities. The proposed model is evaluated on the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD), demonstrating improvements over baseline models, although it trails behind the current state-of-the-art results listed on the SQuAD leaderboard.
THOUGHTS: The key innovation of this method lies in its ability to identify phrases of different lengths as potential answers. However, the two approaches employed - utilizing a POS pattern trie tree to filter word sequences based on POS tags and brute-force enumeration of phrases up to length N - appear to be somewhat disconnected from the concept of "end-to-end learning" for answer chunk extraction. Additionally, as noted by other reviewers, the linguistic features significantly contribute to the final accuracy (Table 3), which can be easily obtained using standard taggers, further diminishing the notion of an "end-to-end trained" system.
The paper is well-written overall, but certain sections describing the model are challenging to follow. Specifically, the attention mechanism seems to be a standard implementation in a sequence-to-sequence context, lacking architectural novelty compared to models like the Gated Attentive Reader. Despite clarification, the uniqueness of this attention mechanism compared to standard attention used in sequence-to-sequence models remains unclear.
Ultimately, while the method outperforms the baseline approach reported in the original SQuAD dataset paper, its current ranking of 12th out of 15 systems on the leaderboard raises concerns about its competitiveness with existing state-of-the-art models.
