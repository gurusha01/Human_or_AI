The authors present a novel energy function for Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) utilizing the leaky ReLU max(cx, x) activation function for hidden units, analogous to ReLU units in feed-forward networks. This formulation enables the input space to be divided into a combinatorial number of regions, each defining a truncated Gaussian distribution p(v). A significant contribution of the paper is the proposal of a novel sampling scheme for leaky RBMs, which involves initializing a Markov chain from a sample of the leaky RBM with c=1 (yielding a standard multivariate normal distribution over visible units) and then gradually annealing the parameter c. This approach is demonstrated to outperform Annealed Importance Sampling (AIS) in estimating the partition function, particularly in low-dimensional settings. The authors conduct experiments on both CIFAR-10 and SVHN datasets.
This paper is of interest to the ICLR community due to its strong theoretical contributions, including the introduction of a proper energy formulation for ReLU RBMs, a novel sampling mechanism, and an improvement over AIS for estimating the partition function. However, the experimental results are somewhat limited, notably lacking a Persistent Contrastive Divergence (PCD) baseline and evaluations on standard binary RBM datasets (e.g., Bernoulli visible and leaky ReLU hidden units). The performance on CIFAR-10 and SVHN, although improved with leaky ReLU, falls short of more recent generative models, such as VAE-based and auto-regressive models. Additionally, the costly projection method required to ensure the energy function remains bounded (i.e., the covariance matrix over each region is positive semi-definite) may further limit the paper's appeal.
The paper's strengths include:
* Introduction of an energy function incorporating the leaky ReLU activation function
* Proposal of a novel sampling procedure based on annealing the leakiness parameter
* Demonstration of the sampling scheme's superiority over AIS in certain settings
However, the paper's weaknesses include:
* Somewhat outdated results
* Lack of experiments on binary datasets, which are more comparable to prior RBM work
* Absence of a PCD baseline
* The high cost of the projection method required to guarantee a bounded energy function.
