This manuscript proposes a host intrusion detection approach based on anomaly detection. The methodology utilizes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to model system-call sequences, with the averaged sequence likelihood serving as an indicator of anomalous behavior, which is indicative of an attack. Additionally, the paper evaluates an ensemble method in comparison to two baseline models for classification purposes.
The strengths of this paper include its clear and well-structured presentation, effectively conveying the ideas and concepts explored. Furthermore, it showcases an intriguing application of LSTM sequential modeling to the problem of Host-Based Intrusion Detection Systems (HIDS).
However, upon closer examination, the overall novelty of the paper appears limited, given that the primary technical components, such as LSTM RNNs and ensemble methods, are already well-established in the field. A significant concern is that the contribution of the proposed ensemble method may not be as substantial as claimed, as the ensemble concept could potentially be applied to the k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) and k-Means Clustering (kMC) baseline models as well, which warrants further investigation to fully assess its value.
