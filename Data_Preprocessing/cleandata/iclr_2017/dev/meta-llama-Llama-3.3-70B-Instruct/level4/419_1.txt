This paper presents a novel approach that integrates concepts from generative topic models and recurrent neural network language models. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their proposed method through evaluations on both document-level classification and language modeling benchmarks, with promising results. Additionally, they provide an analysis of the topics learned by the model and its text generation capabilities. The paper is well-structured and clearly written, with the authors committing to release their code, which will enable others to replicate their approach. However, I have two significant questions that I would like the authors to address:
1. The generative story for TopicRNN appears to make an exchangeability assumption, similar to LDA topic models, as it samples yt using only the document topic vector and ht. Nevertheless, since ht is derived from a recurrent model that observes yt-1, it is unclear how this assumption aligns with the actual implementation. The discussion in the Generating sequential text section suggests that the topic model relies on y_1-t-1 to generate words, which seems inconsistent with the specified generative model. The authors should clarify and explicitly discuss this assumption in the paper to ensure a comprehensive presentation.
2. The topic model restricts interactions of the topic vector theta to linear transformations, which may be necessary for maintaining tractability but seems to be a limiting assumption. Intuitively, one would expect the topic representation to interact with the language model in a more complex, nonlinear manner to produce nuanced adjustments to word probabilities within a document. The authors should provide a justification for this design choice and, if possible, discuss potential avenues for future research to relax or modify this assumption, or explain why it may not be as restrictive as it initially appears.
Furthermore, the color scheme used in Figure 2 is challenging to distinguish, which may hinder the interpretation of the results.
