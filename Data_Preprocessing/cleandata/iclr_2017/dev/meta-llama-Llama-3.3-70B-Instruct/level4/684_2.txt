The concept of strategy requires further clarification in formal terms to dispel ambiguity. 
Could the authors provide a precise definition of 'r', specifying whether it denotes the discounted return or the reward at time 't'?
A comparison with TD learning would be beneficial to contextualize the proposed method.
The paper's reliance on reinforcement learning terminology without clear explanations of divergent meanings detracts from its clarity.
The assertion that the output for a given state-action pair remains constant is inherent to the Q function, which defines the value of a state-action pair. If the policy is deterministic, the output will indeed be constant, mirroring the behavior of Q learning. The distinction between this approach and Q learning is not clearly articulated.
The policy is only mentioned in the context of data generation, with no explicit description in the model outline. This omission raises questions about the model's specification.
The classification of the approach as model-based is unclear and warrants justification.
The learning curves, limited to 19 iterations, fail to provide meaningful insights. Moreover, the final results are not comparable to existing works, and the model's performance is evaluated on only three games.
Overall, the paper suffers from vagueness, informal language, and a misuse of common reinforcement learning terms. The experiments are constrained to a small scale and yield underwhelming results. The rationale behind categorizing the approach as model-based remains unclear, contributing to the paper's lack of clarity and impact.
