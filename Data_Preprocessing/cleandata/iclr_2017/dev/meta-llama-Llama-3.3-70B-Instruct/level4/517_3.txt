This paper presents a novel approach to learning graphical models by integrating a neural network architecture with sparse edge structure estimation via sampling methods. The authors acknowledge that model selection is a challenge in graphical lasso, but their proposed method still implicitly involves model selection. Specifically, the sparse prior $P(G)$ relies on hyper-parameters that require tuning, which raises questions about the equivalence of this tuning process to model selection. As a result, the actual benefits of this method over existing approaches are unclear.
Furthermore, the organization of the paper is a concern. In Algorithm 1, the sampling of $Gi$ and $\Sigmai$ is followed by the sampling of $xj$ from $N(0, \Sigma)$, but it is ambiguous whether $\Sigma$ differs from $\Sigmai$. Additionally, the construction of $(Yi, \hat{\Sigma}i)$ from $(Gi, Xi)$ is not clearly explained. A fundamental question also arises regarding the utilization of input data $X$ (as opposed to sampled data) in Algorithm 1.
Moreover, the definition of the receptive field in Propositions 2 and 3 is not provided, which hinders a comprehensive understanding of the theoretical contributions. Overall, the advantages of the proposed method, including its potential improvements over previous methods, remain uncertain due to these unresolved questions and ambiguities.
