This paper presents a robust application of A3C to the game of Doom, augmented by a suite of enhancements that ultimately led to a winning entry in one of the VizDoom competitions. While the competitive nature of the work might overshadow a more rigorous, scientifically-driven justification of each design choice, the authors nonetheless provide a satisfactory explanation for their decisions. 
However, two of my initial concerns remain unaddressed, as outlined in my previous feedback (AnonReviewer2). 
Furthermore, the reference list appears to be somewhat limited. Notably, the concept of reward shaping boasts an extensive body of literature, and the use of incrementally more challenging task setups has a history dating back to at least the 1990s, with contributions from researchers like Mark Ring. Additionally, there has been significant complementary research on other first-person shooter games. Although direct comparisons are not necessary, it would be beneficial for the authors to provide a broader context that situates their work within the existing landscape, thereby enhancing the reader's understanding and appreciation of their contributions.
