This manuscript presents a modeling approach to capture the spike trains of retinal ganglion cells in response to natural images, and I suggest that the title be revised to include the term "activity" for formal accuracy. The authors propose a recurrent network for time series prediction, comparing it to the previously employed generalized linear model, with the underlying premise that accurate spike prediction can provide insights into the neural processing mechanisms of the retina.
The paper appears plausible, although I did not gain substantial new knowledge from it. The results in Figure 2 demonstrate that the RNN model achieves slightly better spike prediction, which is a positive outcome. However, the implications of this finding are not fully explored. Having shown that a more complex model can yield better data fits, albeit with remaining variations, the authors should elucidate what this reveals about retinal neural processing, as initially outlined. As a non-specialist in retinal biology, I am aware of the retina's layered and recurrent structure, which makes the superiority of the new model over the GLM somewhat expected.
The paper mentions that more complex recurrent models, such as LSTM, do not significantly enhance performance, but such comparisons are challenging due to the increased data requirements of more complex models. I would anticipate that additional layers and a more detailed retinal model could further improve prediction accuracy. Furthermore, I found it intriguing that all neurons in the network share the same parameters (weights). While the simplified model captures many spike train characteristics, I wonder if a model with free parameters could potentially outperform it, given sufficient training data.
