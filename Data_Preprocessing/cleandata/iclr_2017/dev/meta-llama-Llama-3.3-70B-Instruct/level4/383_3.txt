The authors successfully employ Q-learning to train deep architectures on a limited set of small-scale vision problems, achieving robust outcomes, including state-of-the-art performance when restricted to specific layer types, as well as competitive results against other approaches. However, it would be beneficial to investigate the performance of this method when more intricate structural configurations are permitted. A more substantial demonstration of the approach's efficacy on a large-scale task, such as ImageNet, would significantly strengthen the paper's convincingness.
