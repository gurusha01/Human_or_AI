The paper presents a novel end-to-end machine learning approach, termed dynamic reader, designed for machine reading comprehension tasks. This proposed model demonstrates the capability to extract and rank answer candidates from a given document, surpassing earlier systems.
Recent studies have focused on developing question answering systems by extracting phrases from articles, and this work stands out in two key aspects:
1.	The incorporation of a convolution model, and
2.	The implementation of dynamic chunking.
The application of convolution networks, typically used for character-based word embeddings, to phrase representation is an intriguing choice, and its effectiveness warrants further analysis. Notably, the authors' decision to utilize uni-gram, bi-gram, and tri-gram information within the convolution network raises questions about the necessity of tri-gram information in alternative approaches, such as LSTM models. A comparative analysis between the convolution framework and other methods, like LSTM, would provide valuable insights into the model's performance.
The concept of dynamic chunking is commendable, and its similarity to ideas presented in recent papers, such as [Kenton et al, 16], which targets the same dataset, is noteworthy. However, a more in-depth examination of dynamic chunking is necessary to understand its efficacy in representing answer chunks. The construction of chunk representations using the first and last word representations generated by a convolution network may not be sufficient to capture long answer phrases, and this aspect requires further investigation.
The authors' choice to utilize pre-trained NLP models instead of character-based embeddings is an interesting one. A comparison of the advantages and disadvantages of using linguistic features versus character embeddings would be a valuable addition to the paper.
In summary, while the paper proposes several innovative ideas, the lack of comprehensive analysis hinders a thorough evaluation of the significance and impact of the proposed techniques.
