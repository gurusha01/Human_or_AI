This manuscript explores the concept of acquiring information through direct environmental interaction, a notion closely related to active learning in supervised learning and the exploration-exploitation dilemma in reinforcement learning (RL). The authors focus on a specific physics domain instance, leveraging recent deep RL techniques to learn policies that seek information.
The paper primarily presents empirical findings, examining how the cost of information, modified via the discount factor, influences the structure of learned policies. It demonstrates the efficacy of general-purpose deep policy gradient methods in learning such tasks. Notably, the proposed environment and task formulation in Section 2 appear to be novel contributions. Making this environment open-source would be a valuable resource for the community.
Throughout the text, the authors refer to "latent structure/dynamics" and touch upon connections to bandit problems in Section 4, suggesting an aspiration for a more general approach. However, the paper does not fully ground its proposed method within an existing framework nor does it introduce a completely new one.
Key questions arise regarding the formalization of "questions" and "answers," the quantification of question "difficulty," and the definition and units of the "cost of information." Clarification is needed on whether the approach is based on a Markov Decision Process (MDP) or a Partially Observable MDP (POMDP), the type of MDP considered, and the definition of the discounted MDP, including state and action spaces.
Further, incorporating critical problem structures from the "interaction/labeling/reward" paragraph in Section 2 into the MDP definition would be beneficial. This could involve specifying that labeling actions are restricted to the "labeling phase" and detailing the transition and reward functions' structures, including the use of positive/negative rewards leading to absorbing states. The concept of "phase" might be effectively implemented through an augmented state space, such as $\tilde s = (s, phase)$, enhancing the model's clarity and applicability.
