This manuscript introduces a innovative approach to unsupervised pretraining in deep convolutional networks, which may also be applicable to fully-connected architectures. The proposed method, termed 'spatial contrasting', involves constructing triplets from image patches and learning a representation that assigns high scores to patches from the same image and low scores to those from different images. The simplicity of this approach is noteworthy, and it is surprising that it has not been explored previously, according to the provided literature review. The following comments are offered:
In Section 4.1, the notation P(fi^1 | fi^2) is somewhat unconventional. It would be beneficial to provide a mathematical definition of the probability being referred to or replace the term with an alternative. 
The utilization of "batch statistics" in Section 4.2, specifically the process of sampling from it, requires further clarification. It is unclear whether the authors are sampling from all possible triples within the batch or employing a different strategy.
The number of patches sampled in Algorithm 1 appears to be fixed at 1, but it would be more appropriate to treat this as a hyperparameter. Have the authors investigated the effects of using different values for this parameter?
Certain details, such as patch size, are not explicitly mentioned in the paper. It would be helpful to know whether the authors have experimented with varying patch sizes, as this seems to be a crucial hyperparameter.
While the results on STL are impressive, the performance on CIFAR-10 is less so. For CIFAR, it might be beneficial to explore pretraining on a combination of datasets, such as Imagenet and CIFAR, to develop a more robust representation. Have the authors considered this approach?
Overall, this work presents an intriguing concept with potential applications, and its implementation appears to be relatively straightforward. However, further insight into what the spatial contrasting method learns, additional empirical studies on the impact of various parameter choices (e.g., patch size), and more attempts to surpass the state-of-the-art (e.g., on CIFAR) would be desirable.
