This manuscript investigates the capability of nonlinear recurrent neural networks to capture neural response properties that have proven elusive to other models. A multilayer recurrent neural network (RNN) is trained to replicate the stimulus-response mapping of actual retinal ganglion cells in response to a sequence of natural images. The RNN significantly outperforms conventional linear-nonlinear (LN) and generalized linear models (GLM), particularly in accounting for transient responses.
This research represents a crucial step forward in understanding the nonlinear response properties of visual neurons. Recent findings have highlighted the difficulty in explaining the responses of retinal ganglion cells to natural movies using standard receptive field models, posing a significant challenge to the field. The development of a functional model, even if preliminary, provides a vital starting point. Therefore, this work should be viewed as a foundational contribution. The next challenge lies in dissecting the RNN's mechanisms, potentially through pruning and simplification to identify critical components. Although such an analysis would have been a valuable addition, this initial result is noteworthy and deserves attention.
I am somewhat unclear about the definition of a "movie" in this context. It appears to refer to a sequence of unrelated images presented for 1 second each. However, the mention of a "frame rate" of 1/8.33 ms seems to pertain to the monitor's refresh rate. 
I speculate that the deviations from the LN model would be even more pronounced when using actual dynamic natural scenes, or real movies. In such cases, I anticipate that the RNN would have a more substantial impact and potentially yield more insightful results.
