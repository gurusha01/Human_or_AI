This paper presents a innovative methodology for anomaly detection in intrusion detection, leveraging system call sequences as a linguistic framework. Multiple LSTM-RNN language models are developed, trained, and combined in an ensemble to enhance detection capabilities. Ensemble diversity is ensured through the utilization of distinct hyperparameters for each LSTM-LM, with the combination of models achieved by averaging transformed likelihoods.
The approach's strengths lie in its exclusion of attack data during training and its effective employment of language models and ensemble techniques. However, several high-level concerns arise, potentially resolvable through further clarification:
- The system's vulnerability to system call relaying appears to be a weakness: an attacker with access to legitimate system call sequences could potentially deceive the system by interspersing malicious calls with normal ones, thereby artificially inflating the sequence's likelihood.
- The introduction would benefit from a brief discussion of other anomaly detection tasks that utilize RNNs, providing a clearer context for the novelty and significance of the proposed approach.
