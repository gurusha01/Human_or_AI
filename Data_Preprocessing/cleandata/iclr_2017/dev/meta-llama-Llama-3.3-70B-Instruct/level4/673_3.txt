I find the paper to be somewhat unconvincing. The core concept presented appears to involve integrating a fast neighbor search algorithm into a memory-augmented network to enable scalable memory lookups. However, this idea is not novel, as it was previously explored by Rae et al. Furthermore, there are established neighbor search algorithms that could have been utilized; instead, the authors opted to implement their own custom solution without comparing its performance to these standardized alternatives. The choice of test problem is also questionable, as it does not necessarily require vector-based fast nearest neighbor search, given that hashing can be effectively applied to the text data. Additionally, the paper's repeated emphasis on distinguishing between "mips" and "nns" is distracting, as most libraries are capable of handling both, and inputs can often be modified to accommodate either problem; notably, the authors themselves convert their problem to the "mcss" formulation, highlighting the flexibility between these concepts.
