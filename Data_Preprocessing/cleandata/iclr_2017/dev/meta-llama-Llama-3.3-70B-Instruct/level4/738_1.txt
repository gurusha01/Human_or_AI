The application of sparsity to the backward gradients in LSTM training yields intriguing results. However, the manuscript feels incomplete due to the lack of comprehensive experimental validation. The sole reporting of validation loss is inadequate, and the inclusion of thorough testing results along with standard evaluation metrics is necessary to substantiate the claim that the proposed sparsity method does not compromise performance. Furthermore, providing concrete evidence of the speed and efficiency gains achieved through this technique would significantly enhance the paper's robustness.
