This manuscript presents a generative model for mixtures of basic local structures, where the dependency between these structures is represented as a tensor. The authors leverage tensor decomposition, building upon their previous work on the expressive power of CNNs and hierarchical Tucker decomposition, to establish an inference mechanism. However, the efficacy of this approach is contingent upon the existence of a suitable decomposition. A significant concern is that the authors do not adequately address the applicability of their method to the general case, failing to specify the subspace in which this decomposition is efficient, exists, or yields a low approximation error. Their response to this inquiry, suggesting that such theoretical analyses are unnecessary in the era of deep learning, is subjective and lacks clarification within the paper. Consequently, from a theoretical standpoint, the manuscript is flawed, and the claims made are not fully justified. Certain assertions cannot be validated by current tensor literature findings, as the authors themselves acknowledge in the discussion. Therefore, it is imperative that the authors revise their claims to reflect the restricted nature of their approach to a specific subclass of tensors.
From an empirical perspective, disregarding the theoretical shortcomings, the experimental results presented are insufficient to warrant acceptance. The use of MNIST and CIFAR-10 as baselines is overly simplistic, and more comprehensive experiments are necessary. Furthermore, the experiments concerning missing data are overly synthetic and do not adequately represent real-world scenarios. Notably, the paper lacks extensions beyond image data, which is a critical omission given the authors' repeated assertions that their approach has broader applicability. In light of the incomplete theoretical framework, these additional experiments are essential for the manuscript's acceptance.
