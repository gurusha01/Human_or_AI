This manuscript presents a novel multiscale recurrent neural network architecture, wherein each layer operates on a distinct time scale that is adaptively determined by a neural network, rather than being fixed. The approach is skillfully integrated within a recurrent neural network framework, yielding state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmark datasets. The overall quality of the writing is commendable. 
A potential avenue for future exploration could involve extending this methodology to accommodate bidirectional RNNs.
