This paper presents a compelling probabilistic framework for weighted bag of words models, making it an interesting contribution. The upcoming comparison with Wang and Manning's work is anticipated to further enhance its strength. However, it is noteworthy that for sufficiently large datasets, NB-SVM remains the more effective approach.
In the penultimate paragraph of the introduction, the issue of large cooccurrence counts is discussed, although it is worth acknowledging that this problem has already been addressed by the Glove embeddings through their weighting function f.
Some minor suggestions for improvement include: correcting the typo in the introduction's second line, which reads "The capturing the similarities", and revising the citation format in the phrase "Recently, (Wieting et al.,2016) learned" to utilize the citet format instead of parenthesized citation.
