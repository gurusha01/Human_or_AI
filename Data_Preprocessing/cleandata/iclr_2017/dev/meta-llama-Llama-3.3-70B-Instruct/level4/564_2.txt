The foundation of this paper presents an intriguing concept with considerable potential for utility. The proposed integration of signal processing with recurrent networks, leveraging tools from each domain, is a compelling idea. Although the work contains valuable insights, it appears that these elements could be more effectively cohesive. 
The presentation and overall quality can be enhanced, and I encourage the authors to pursue this refinement, regardless of the paper's current outcome. Certain approaches to establishing connections with prior work are noteworthy, and further experimentation or in-depth analysis to elucidate the rationale behind these connections and their benefits would be beneficial.
