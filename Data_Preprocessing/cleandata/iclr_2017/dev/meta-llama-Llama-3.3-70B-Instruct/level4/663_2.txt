This paper addresses the challenge of classifying text and images using a multi-modal approach.
Strengths:
- The dataset and application presented are noteworthy and engaging.
Weaknesses:
- The results are somewhat underwhelming, demonstrating only a marginal improvement over the oracle improvement. However, providing insights into whether the incorrect decisions are plausible from a human perspective could enhance the significance of the results.
- The exploration of intermediate architectures, such as combining feature fusion with class probabilities, with or without fine-tuning, could have added depth to the study. Notably, the paper lacks results on feature fusion.
- The absence of evaluations on standard datasets or comparisons to prior works limits the context and impact of the findings.
It would be beneficial to understand the policy learned for CP-1. Specifically, how does the network outperform simple methods like max or mean when given two input class probabilities?
