The authors suggest utilizing leaky rectified linear units in place of binary units in Gaussian Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs). A novel sampling method is introduced for training the leaky-ReLU RBM, with results including Annealed Importance Sampling (AIS) estimated likelihood on Cifar10 and SVHN datasets.
This exploration of alternative nonlinear hidden units for RBMs is noteworthy. However, several concerns regarding the current study need to be addressed:
1. The validity of the proposed sampling method (Algorithm 2) lacks explanation, and the additional computational overhead incurred by the inner loop and projection steps should be examined.
2. The performance of the Gaussian RBM, in terms of both likelihood and generated samples, falls short of expectations, suggesting potential issues with the training process.
3. The representations learned from effective generative models often enhance classification performance, particularly when labeled samples are scarce. Given the suitability of Gaussian RBMs for texture synthesis tasks where mixing is crucial, the authors are encouraged to conduct further experiments in these areas to fully explore the capabilities of their model.
