This paper appears to be centered around an perceived limitation of the original paragraph vectors paper, specifically the supposed inability to derive representations for text beyond the training data. However, I believe this assumption is incorrect. As a result, the foundation of the presented work is undermined, rendering the majority of the subsequent analysis irrelevant.
Although I suggest rejecting this paper, I advise the authors to re-examine the innovative components of their idea and consider reworking it into a distinct type of paper in the future.
