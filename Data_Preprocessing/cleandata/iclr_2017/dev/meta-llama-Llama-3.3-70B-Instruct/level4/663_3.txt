This manuscript proposes a multi-modal classification framework, integrating various modalities to address a real-world e-commerce application. 
Overall, the approach outlined in the paper appears to be well-founded and methodically sound; however, it lacks innovative contributions, as both feature fusion and decision-level fusion are established techniques in multi-modal analysis. The remainder of the paper does not introduce any unexpected or groundbreaking elements in the implementation of these methods. As a result, this work seems more suited to conferences or publications that emphasize the development and deployment of practical systems, rather than ICLR, which prioritizes the presentation of novel algorithmic and theoretical advancements in the field.
