This manuscript explores a probabilistic deep neural network approach to learn multiple views of data, resulting in a non-linear model that poses inference challenges, which are addressed using the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) framework.
However, the authors' claim that this model is analogous to Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) is not substantiated, as the relationship between the proposed model and canonical correlation directions in the non-linear case remains unclear. In contrast, other methods like Deep Canonical Correlation Analysis (DCCA) and Deep Canonical Correlation Autoencoders (DCCAE) explicitly incorporate canonical correlations into their objectives and provide interpretative insights. The work of Bach and Jordan [Ref 1] demonstrates that maximum likelihood estimation of a linear latent model yields canonical correlation directions, but this analysis is absent in the present paper, making the CCA-type model designation questionable.
Furthermore, the paper overlooks a significant body of related research on non-linear multi-view models, including probabilistic [Ref 2, 3] and Bayesian [Ref 4] approaches, as well as variational and deep learning extensions [Ref 5]. 
Despite these limitations, the idea of combining multi-view modeling with VAEs is intriguing and potentially useful. Nevertheless, the paper fails to convincingly demonstrate a proper method for extending VAEs to multiple views. The proposed VCCA model does not appear to advance the state-of-the-art in terms of results, while the VCCA-private model seems ill-posed, requiring manual tuning of dimensionalities and relying on dropout to prevent redundant information learning. The experimental results for VCCA-private are also underwhelming. 
Additionally, the approximate posterior is parameterized solely from one view, limiting the model's applicability as a generic multi-view approach. If classification is the primary objective, comparison to a dedicated classification model, such as a feedforward neural network, would be more appropriate.
The plots in Fig. 8 are noteworthy, and the paper successfully conveys the potential merit of integrating multiple views with VAEs. However, it falls short in demonstrating the practicality of the proposed approach and its connection to CCA. Ultimately, although the manuscript is interesting, it requires further refinement to address these concerns.
