This paper introduces COCONET, a convolution-based neural autoregressive model, for the purpose of music composition. Notably, it adopts blocked Gibbs sampling as an alternative to the ancestral sampling method employed in the original NADE model, aiming to produce higher-quality musical pieces. The experimental outcomes demonstrate that COCONET achieves a lower negative log likelihood (NLL) compared to other baseline models, and a human evaluation task conducted via Amazon's Mechanical Turk platform indicates that the model is capable of generating musically compelling compositions.
Overall, the paper is deemed to be of good quality. The incorporation of convolution operations into a NADE-based model for music generation, along with the utilization of blocked Gibbs sampling, exhibits a degree of novelty. Nevertheless, the novelty is considered incremental, given that blocked Gibbs sampling for NADE models was previously proposed by Yao et al. in 2014, and the application of NADE-based models to music modeling was also explored by Boulanger-Lewandowski et al. in 2012.
