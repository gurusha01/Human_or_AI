The authors suggest employing a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to analyze sequences of system calls for the purpose of network intrusion detection (NIDS). While the concept of utilizing neural networks for NIDS is not novel [1], and the application of neural networks to system call sequences for NIDS has been previously explored [2], the specific use of LSTMs for this task has also been documented [2, 3]. Notably, the approach in [2] involves operating on counts of N-grams of system calls rather than the raw sequence, although this preprocessing step does not appear to be particularly complex.
The proposed system demonstrates performance comparable to other NIDS systems and includes an examination of portability, which is a positive aspect. However, a significant drawback is that this paper does not substantially contribute to the advancement of the state-of-the-art in NIDS. Furthermore, its alignment with the focus of ICLR is questionable. The paper does not offer significant insights into representations, as the application of LSTMs to sequence problems is a well-established approach.
In light of these considerations, I believe the paper falls below the threshold for acceptance at ICLR. The authors may want to consider submitting their work to a conference with a primary focus on security, where it might be more appropriately evaluated.
