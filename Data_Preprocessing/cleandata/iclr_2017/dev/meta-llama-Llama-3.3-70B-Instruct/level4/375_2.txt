This manuscript presents a straightforward approach to reweighting word embeddings within a simple composition function for generating sentence representations. Additionally, it establishes a link between this novel weighting scheme and prior research.
Regarding technical aspects, several points warrant clarification:
- The term "discourse" is ambiguous, and it is unclear whether the "discourse" in "discourse vector c_s" and "most frequent discourse" share the same definition.
- The justification for $c_0$ in relation to syntax is not provided.
- The statement "In fact, the new model was discovered by our detecting the common component c0 in existing embeddings" in the "Computing the sentence embedding" section is unclear.
- The results related to sentiment analysis in Table 2 lack explanatory commentary.
