This paper presents a groundbreaking algorithm for estimating graph structures, leveraging a convolutional neural network to approximate the mapping function between the empirical covariance matrix and the graph's sparsity pattern. Notably, this approach demonstrates improved adaptability to diverse network structures, such as small-world networks, within the empirical risk minimization framework. The experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets are promising, outperforming baseline methods.
Overall, the paper is intriguing and innovative, particularly in its formulation of structure estimation as a learning problem, which may stimulate further research in related areas. A key advantage of this approach is its ability to adapt to various network structure properties without requiring the design of specific regularization terms, as seen in graph lasso methods.
The experimental results are also noteworthy, with the proposed algorithm surpassing other baselines in the small sample region for both synthetic and real-world datasets.
However, the paper could benefit from clearer descriptions of the network architectures. For instance, on page 5, the definition of $o^k{i,j}$ as a d-dimensional vector is unclear, and its relation to $o^0{i,j} = p_{i,j}$ suggests it may be a scalar. The meaning of $d$ and its connection to the number of channels for the convolutional filters require further clarification.
Figure 1 is also confusing, with discrepancies between the number of nodes in (a) and the table size in (b). The representation of channels in each layer and the significance of the black squares, which appear in three blocks, are not clearly explained. Although there are descriptions in the text, they do not provide sufficient clarity.
Regarding the real-world data, the process of generating training data (Y, Sigma) is unclear. Is it similar to the method used for synthetic experiments, where entries are uniformly sparse? This raises the broader question of how to sample from the distribution P for real-world data, which requires more detailed explanation.
