This manuscript introduces an unsupervised image transformation approach, enabling the mapping of samples from a source domain to a target domain without requiring paired training data from both domains. The key innovation of this work is its reliance on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which are adapted for unsupervised learning by decomposing the generation process into two primary modules: an encoder that extracts a common feature space shared by the two domains, and a decoder that generates samples in the target domain. To prevent the model from converging to trivial solutions, the authors propose two supplementary loss functions. The first loss function penalizes the difference in features between the original source sample and its transformed counterpart, while the second loss function penalizes the difference in pixels between a target sample and its reconstructed version. The efficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated through extensive experiments, including the transfer of SVHN digit images to the MNIST style and the transformation of face images into emoji styles.
The strengths of this paper include its potential for impactful contributions to the broader field of unsupervised domain transfer, owing to the proposed learning methodology. Additionally, the manuscript presents thorough ablation studies that provide valuable insights into the functioning of the system's components. The quality of the transferred images is visually impressive, and quantitative results indicate a degree of preservation of image identities across domains.
However, there are areas that could be explored further to enhance the paper. For instance, extending the results to other domains, such as text and image combinations, could offer more comprehensive insights into the method's versatility. Moreover, beyond analyzing the preservation of face identities, it would be intriguing to investigate how well facial attributes are retained when images are mapped to the target domain, providing a more nuanced understanding of the transformation process.
