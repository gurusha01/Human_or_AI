1. The memory hierarchy is predetermined rather than dynamically learned, and the experimental setup lacks a hierarchical structure, featuring only a single layer for the softmax function.
2. The results indicate a performance trend where 10-mips outperforms 100-mips, which in turn outperforms 1000-mips; this raises the question of whether 1-mips would be the optimal choice.
3. The approximated k-mips approach yields inferior results compared to the original method, which suggests that the proposed method requires exact k-mips to be effective, thereby casting doubt on its robustness.
