This paper presents acceptable accuracy results, but its acceptance is questionable due to several concerns: 
1) The motivation relies on an incorrect premise that Paragraph Vector is ineffective on unseen data, which undermines the foundation of the work.
2) The manuscript is marred by multiple fundamental formatting errors and flaws in Bibtex citations.
Furthermore, the paper's contribution is limited by its reliance on a conventional directed LDA-like approach, utilizing a bag of words/bigram model, which lacks innovative value given the existing body of work in the field.
