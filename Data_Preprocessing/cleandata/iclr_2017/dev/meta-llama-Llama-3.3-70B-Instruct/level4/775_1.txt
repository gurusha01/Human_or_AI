This manuscript presents a clear and concise narrative, yielding easily interpretable results. 
Given that the various parameterisations ultimately produce torque outputs, it is surprising to observe significant differences between them, as a known conversion function exists to transform between representations or to torques. A potential explanation for the marginal superiority of proportional control could be the dependence of the tracking cost on positional data. 
It would be informative to investigate whether the results would hold if the reference-pose cost were removed, leaving only a locomotion cost. 
Furthermore, considering an alternative task, such as spinning a top, may yield divergent outcomes, suggesting that the findings may be task-specific. 
Although the study is intriguing, its applicability to broader scenarios appears limited, restricting its generalisability. 
The accompanying video is well-produced and effectively complements the manuscript.
