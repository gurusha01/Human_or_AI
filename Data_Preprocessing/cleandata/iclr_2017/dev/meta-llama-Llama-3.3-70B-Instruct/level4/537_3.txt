The submission presents a novel approach to matching synthetic data with real data in a GAN-based architecture, primarily through the introduction of parametric modules that mimic various transformations and artifacts to achieve a natural appearance.
Several key points were discussed:
1. The proposed method is more model-driven than previous GAN models, but it is unclear whether this added complexity yields significant benefits. A comparison with traditional GAN approaches, which could potentially model effects like blur, lighting, and background using upsampling networks or convolutional layers, would be beneficial. The authors' response only partially addresses this concern, and it remains unclear why a more generic parameterization, such as a neural network, would not be equally effective. The use of a render engine to generate initial sample appearances also lacks novelty.
2. The comparison to traditional data augmentation techniques, such as noise, dropout, and transformations, is limited. The authors mention using such augmentations but do not provide sufficient details, instead promising to include more information in the appendix. It would be more informative to have this information directly in the revision, allowing for a more thorough evaluation of the procedure. Currently, this remains a point of uncertainty, and the availability of data augmentation tools, such as Keras' ImageDataGenerator, makes this omission notable.
3. The impact of the different stages (Ï†) on performance is not fully explored. While the authors evaluate the effect of hand-tuning versus learning the transformation stages, it would be valuable to include results on the inclusion or exclusion of stages and the benefit of initial data jittering.
Although the paper presents an interesting idea with some novelty, concerns regarding evaluations and comparisons persist. The demonstration of success on only a single dataset/task further limits the impact. Nonetheless, the task is intriguing and challenging, leading to a weak recommendation for acceptance.
