This manuscript proposes a novel generative model that leverages a gradual denoising process to transform noise into model samples. Similar to diffusion-based generative models, this approach employs a denoising process; however, it differs in several key aspects:
- The model utilizes a significantly reduced number of denoising steps, resulting in substantially improved computational efficiency.
- Unlike the diffusion approach, which involves a reverse trajectory, the conditional chain for the approximate posterior directly jumps to q(z(0) | x) and then proceeds in the same direction as the generative model. This design enables the inference chain to behave as a perturbation around the generative model, effectively pulling it towards the data. This concept bears some resemblance to ladder networks.
- Notably, this model does not provide a tractable variational bound on the log likelihood.
I found the idea presented in this paper to be intriguing, and the visual sample quality produced by the short chain was impressive. The inpainting results were particularly noteworthy, as one-shot inpainting is not feasible under most existing generative modeling frameworks. However, a more convincing comparison of log likelihoods that does not rely on Parzen likelihoods would strengthen the argument.
The following detailed comments are provided:
Sec. 2:
- The phrase "theta(0) the" should be revised to "theta(0) be the".
- Similarly, "theta(t) the" should be changed to "theta(t) be the".
- The sentence "what we will be using" could be rephrased as "which we will be doing".
I appreciate the approach of inferring q(z^0|x) and then running inference in the same order as the generative chain, which bears some resemblance to ladder networks.
- The sentence "q. Having learned" would benefit from a paragraph break, resulting in "q. [paragraph break] Having learned".
Sec 3.3:
- The phrase "learn to inverse" should be revised to "learn to reverse".
Sec. 4:
- The sentence "For each experiments" contains a typo and should be corrected to "For each experiment".
- The sensitivity of the results to the infusion rate is not clear and warrants further investigation.
Sec. 5:
- The statement "appears to provide more accurate models" is not supported by the provided evidence, as there is no direct comparison to the Sohl-Dickstein paper.
