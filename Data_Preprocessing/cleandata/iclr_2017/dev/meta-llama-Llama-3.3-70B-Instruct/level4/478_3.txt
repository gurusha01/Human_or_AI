The submission presents several strengths, including: 
- The introduction of a novel representation that exhibits desirable properties, which are rigorously derived and contextualized within a mathematical framework for baseline comparison
- The proposal of a straightforward algorithm for obtaining this representation
However, the paper has some limitations, notably: 
- While the work is mathematically sound, its presentation leans heavily towards applied mathematics, suggesting that a deeper exploration into the intrinsic characteristics of the representation could enhance its impact, such as dissecting the role or behavior of individual layers, particularly the initial ones.
