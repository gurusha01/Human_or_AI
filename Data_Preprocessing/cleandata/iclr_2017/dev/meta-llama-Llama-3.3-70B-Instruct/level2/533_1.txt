The paper "Exploration in Complex Domains via Surprise-Incentivized Reinforcement Learning" presents a novel approach to exploration in reinforcement learning, particularly in complex domains with sparse rewards. The authors propose using surprise as an intrinsic motivation to encourage exploration, which is formulated as the KL-divergence of the true transition probabilities from a learned model. Two approximations to this divergence are derived, resulting in surprisal and k-step learning progress as intrinsic rewards.
The paper claims to contribute to the field of reinforcement learning by introducing a scalable and computationally efficient method for exploration in complex domains. The authors evaluate their approach on a range of benchmarks, including continuous control tasks and Atari games, and demonstrate that their method outperforms other heuristic exploration techniques.

The authors also provide empirical evaluations on several benchmarks, which demonstrate the effectiveness of their method.
3. Usefulness: The paper presents a useful contribution to the field of reinforcement learning, as it addresses the challenging problem of exploration in complex domains with sparse rewards.
4. Field knowledge: The paper demonstrates a good understanding of the field of reinforcement learning, including the challenges of exploration in complex domains and the existing approaches to addressing these challenges.
5. Novelty: The paper presents a novel approach to exploration in reinforcement learning, which is distinct from existing methods.
6. Completeness: The paper provides a complete and detailed presentation of the authors' approach, including theoretical derivations and empirical evaluations.
7. Limitations: The paper acknowledges the limitations of its approach, including the potential for the intrinsic rewards to vanish in the limit as the dynamics model converges.
Decision: Based on the evaluation above, I recommend accepting the paper.
Reasons: The paper presents a novel and useful contribution to the field of reinforcement learning, with a thorough theoretical foundation and empirical evaluations that demonstrate its effectiveness. The authors demonstrate a good understanding of the field and acknowledge the limitations of their approach.
Additional feedback: To further improve the paper, the authors could consider providing more detailed comparisons with other existing approaches to exploration in reinforcement learning, and discussing the potential applications of their method to real-world problems. Additionally, the authors could consider providing more insight into the relationship between the surprisal and k-step learning progress intrinsic rewards, and how they relate to other concepts in reinforcement learning, such as curiosity and novelty.
Questions for the authors: Can the authors provide more detail on how they selected the hyperparameters for their approach, and how they tuned the trade-off between exploration and exploitation? How do the authors plan to address the potential limitations of their approach, such as the vanishing of the intrinsic rewards in the limit? Can the authors provide more insight into the potential applications of their method to real-world problems, such as robotics or game playing?
