This paper presents a novel approach for unsupervised training of convolutional networks, called spatial contrasting, which is based on comparing spatial features sampled from multiple images. The authors claim that this method can improve the performance of convolutional networks on subsequent supervised training tasks, especially when a large amount of unlabeled data is available.
I decide to accept this paper, with the main reason being that the approach is well-motivated and supported by empirical results. The authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the spatial contrasting criterion and its formulation, and demonstrate its effectiveness on several benchmark datasets, including STL10, CIFAR10, and MNIST.
The supporting arguments for this decision include the fact that the spatial contrasting loss is a differentiable estimation that can be computed within a network parallel to supervised losses, making it a promising approach for semi-supervised learning. Additionally, the authors provide a thorough review of previous works on unsupervised learning and demonstrate that their approach outperforms several state-of-the-art models on the STL10 and CIFAR10 datasets.
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the implementation of the spatial contrasting criterion, including the choice of hyperparameters and the optimization algorithm used. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more experiments on the applicability of the spatial contrasting criterion to other domains, such as natural language processing or speech recognition.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer include: (1) How does the spatial contrasting criterion compare to other unsupervised learning methods, such as autoencoders or generative adversarial networks? (2) Can the spatial contrasting criterion be used in conjunction with other unsupervised learning methods to further improve performance? (3) How does the choice of patch size and sampling strategy affect the performance of the spatial contrasting criterion?
Overall, I believe that this paper presents a novel and promising approach to unsupervised learning, and I look forward to seeing further developments and applications of the spatial contrasting criterion in the future.
