The paper proposes a novel deep multi-view learning model called deep variational canonical correlation analysis (VCCA), which extends the latent variable model interpretation of linear CCA to nonlinear observation models parameterized by deep neural networks (DNNs). The authors also propose a variant of VCCA called VCCA-private, which can extract both the common variables underlying both views and the private variables within each view. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of VCCA and VCCA-private on several tasks, including image-image, speech-articulation, and image-text, and shows that they can achieve competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods.
I decide to accept this paper for the following reasons:
1. The paper tackles a specific and well-defined problem in the field of multi-view representation learning, which is a key challenge in many applications.
2. The approach is well-motivated and placed in the literature, with a clear connection to previous work on CCA and deep generative models.
3. The paper provides a thorough and well-structured presentation of the proposed method, including a clear explanation of the model, the optimization objective, and the experimental setup.
The supporting arguments for my decision are:
* The paper provides a clear and concise introduction to the problem of multi-view representation learning and the limitations of existing methods.
* The proposed method, VCCA, is well-motivated and has a clear connection to previous work on CCA and deep generative models.
* The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of VCCA and VCCA-private on several tasks, including image-image, speech-articulation, and image-text.
* The paper provides a thorough analysis of the results, including a discussion of the strengths and limitations of the proposed method.
Additional feedback to improve the paper:
* It would be helpful to provide more details on the implementation of the proposed method, including the specific architectures used for the DNNs and the hyperparameter settings.
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the results, including a discussion of the implications of the findings and the potential applications of the proposed method.
* It would be interesting to see a comparison of the proposed method with other state-of-the-art methods for multi-view representation learning, including methods that use different architectures or optimization objectives.
Questions to the authors:
* Can you provide more details on the implementation of the proposed method, including the specific architectures used for the DNNs and the hyperparameter settings?
* How do you plan to extend the proposed method to other applications, such as multi-modal learning or transfer learning?
* Can you provide more insights into the strengths and limitations of the proposed method, including potential limitations or biases in the model or the optimization objective?
