The paper "Inductive Bias of Deep Convolutional Networks" presents a theoretical analysis of the inductive bias of deep convolutional networks, specifically convolutional arithmetic circuits. The authors study the ability of these networks to model correlations among regions of their input and introduce the concept of separation rank as a measure of the correlation modeled between different sets of input patches.
The main claims of the paper are:
1. A polynomially sized deep convolutional arithmetic circuit supports exponentially high separation ranks for certain input partitions, while being limited to polynomial or linear separation ranks for others.
2. The network's pooling geometry effectively determines which input partitions are favored in terms of separation rank, thus serving as a means for controlling the inductive bias.
3. The standard choice of square contiguous pooling windows favors interleaved partitions over coarse ones, orienting the inductive bias towards the statistics of natural images.
The support for these claims is provided through a combination of theoretical analysis and empirical validation. The authors derive lower and upper bounds on the maximal rank of a coefficient tensor matricization under different partitions, which corresponds to the strength of correlation modeled between input patches. They also demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through experiments on a synthetic classification benchmark inspired by medical imaging tasks.
The usefulness of the ideas presented in the paper is evident in their ability to provide insights into the inductive bias of deep convolutional networks and how it can be controlled through pooling geometry. The paper also highlights the importance of understanding the correlations modeled by deep networks and how they relate to the task at hand.
