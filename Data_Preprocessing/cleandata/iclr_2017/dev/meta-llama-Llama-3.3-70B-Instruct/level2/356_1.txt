This paper proposes a novel technique called Neuro-Symbolic Program Synthesis (NSPS) that learns to generate programs incrementally based on given input-output examples. The approach uses a Recursive-Reverse-Recursive Neural Network (R3NN) to encode and expand partial program trees into full program trees. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of NSPS in the domain of regular expression-based string transformations.
I decide to accept this paper for the following reasons:
1. The paper tackles a specific and well-defined problem in the area of Program Induction and Synthesis, which is a fundamental problem in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.
2. The approach is well-motivated and placed in the literature, with a clear explanation of the limitations of existing methods and how NSPS overcomes these limitations.
3. The paper provides a thorough evaluation of the proposed method, including experiments on a synthetic dataset and a set of real-world benchmarks from the Microsoft Excel team.
The key strengths of the paper are:
* The proposal of a novel neural architecture, R3NN, which is specifically designed for program synthesis tasks.
* The use of a domain-specific language (DSL) for string transformations, which allows for a clear and concise definition of the program synthesis problem.
* The thorough evaluation of the proposed method, including experiments on a synthetic dataset and a set of real-world benchmarks.
To further improve the paper, I would like to see:
* More discussion on the scalability of the proposed method to larger program sizes and more complex domains.
* More analysis on the interpretability of the generated programs and how they can be verified for correctness.
* More comparison with other state-of-the-art methods in program synthesis, including those that use reinforcement learning or other neural architectures.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer are:
* How does the proposed method handle programs with loops or recursive functions?
* Can the proposed method be extended to handle more complex data types, such as images or videos?
* How does the proposed method compare to other neural architectures, such as graph neural networks or transformers, in terms of performance and interpretability?
