This paper introduces a novel recurrent neural network architecture, called the Input Switched Affine Network (ISAN), which achieves state-of-the-art performance on a language modeling task while being more interpretable and computationally efficient than traditional RNNs. The authors claim that the ISAN model, which uses affine transformations without nonlinearity, can match the performance of vanilla RNNs, GRUs, and LSTMs on the Text8 dataset.
I decide to accept this paper, with the main reason being that the authors provide a well-motivated and well-executed approach to creating an intelligible neural network model. The paper is well-structured, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the ISAN model, its benefits, and its performance on the language modeling task.
The supporting arguments for this decision include the fact that the authors provide a thorough analysis of the ISAN model, including its performance on the Text8 dataset, its ability to capture word-level semantic information, and its computational benefits. The authors also provide a detailed comparison with other RNN architectures, including vanilla RNNs, GRUs, and LSTMs, which demonstrates the competitiveness of the ISAN model.
Additional feedback to improve the paper includes providing more details on the training process, such as the hyperparameter tuning infrastructure used, and the number of iterations required to achieve the reported performance. It would also be helpful to include more visualizations, such as plots of the hidden state dynamics, to further illustrate the interpretability of the ISAN model.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer include: How do the authors plan to scale the ISAN model to larger vocabularies or continuous-valued inputs? What are the potential applications of the ISAN model beyond language modeling, and how do the authors plan to explore these applications in future work? How do the authors plan to address the potential limitations of the ISAN model, such as its reliance on affine transformations, and its potential vulnerability to adversarial attacks?
