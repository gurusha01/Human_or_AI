This paper introduces MetaQNN, a meta-modeling algorithm based on reinforcement learning that automatically generates high-performing convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures for image classification tasks. The authors claim that their approach outperforms existing meta-modeling methods and hand-crafted networks that use the same types of layers.
I decide to accept this paper for the following reasons:
1. The paper tackles a specific and well-defined problem in the field of deep learning, which is the automation of CNN architecture design.
2. The approach is well-motivated and placed in the literature, drawing on existing work in reinforcement learning and meta-modeling.
3. The paper provides a clear and detailed description of the MetaQNN algorithm, including the state and action spaces, the Q-learning update rule, and the exploration schedule.
The results presented in the paper are impressive, with the MetaQNN-generated networks outperforming existing hand-crafted networks and meta-modeling methods on several image classification benchmarks. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the Q-learning process, including the stability of the algorithm and the distribution of model accuracies at different values of the exploration parameter.
To further improve the paper, I suggest the following:
* Provide more details on the computational resources required to run the MetaQNN algorithm, including the number of GPUs and the training time.
* Consider adding more experiments to demonstrate the robustness of the MetaQNN algorithm to different hyperparameters and dataset sizes.
* Provide more insight into the design motifs and patterns that emerge in the MetaQNN-generated networks, and how they relate to existing hand-crafted networks.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer:
* How do the MetaQNN-generated networks compare to state-of-the-art networks that use more complex layer types, such as residual connections and attention mechanisms?
* Can the MetaQNN algorithm be applied to other computer vision tasks, such as object detection and segmentation?
* How does the MetaQNN algorithm handle overfitting, and are there any techniques used to regularize the generated networks?
