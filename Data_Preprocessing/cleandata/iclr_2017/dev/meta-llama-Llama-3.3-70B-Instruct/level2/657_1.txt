This paper presents a method for reducing the memory complexity of text classification models while maintaining their accuracy. The authors propose a combination of techniques, including product quantization, feature pruning, and hashing, to achieve a significant reduction in model size. The approach is based on the fastText library and is shown to outperform state-of-the-art methods in terms of the compromise between memory usage and accuracy.
I decide to accept this paper, with the main reason being that it presents a well-motivated and well-executed approach to reducing the memory complexity of text classification models. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their method and its evaluation.
The approach is well-supported by experiments on several benchmarks, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in reducing the model size while maintaining its accuracy. The authors also provide a thorough analysis of the trade-offs between different techniques and parameters, which helps to understand the strengths and limitations of their approach.
One of the key strengths of the paper is its ability to balance the complexity of the model with its accuracy. The authors demonstrate that their approach can achieve a significant reduction in model size while maintaining a high level of accuracy, which is a critical requirement for many real-world applications.
To further improve the paper, I would suggest that the authors provide more details on the computational resources required to train and deploy their models. Additionally, it would be interesting to see a comparison with other state-of-the-art methods that are specifically designed for low-memory devices.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper include:
* Can you provide more details on the implementation of the product quantization technique and how it is integrated with the fastText library?
* How do you handle out-of-vocabulary words in your approach, and what is the impact on the model's accuracy?
* Have you considered applying your approach to other NLP tasks, such as language modeling or machine translation, and what are the potential benefits and challenges of doing so?
