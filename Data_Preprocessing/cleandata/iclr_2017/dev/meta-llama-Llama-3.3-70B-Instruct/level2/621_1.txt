The paper presents a novel approach to music composition using machine learning, specifically exploring the use of blocked Gibbs sampling as an analogue to the human composition process. The authors introduce COCONET, a convolutional neural network in the NADE family of generative models, and demonstrate its effectiveness in improving sample quality over traditional ancestral sampling methods. The paper claims to contribute to the field by providing a more human-like approach to music composition and showcasing the benefits of blocked Gibbs sampling in generative models.
Based on the content and quality of the paper, I decide to Accept this paper with the key reason being that the approach is well-motivated and the results are scientifically rigorous. The authors provide a clear explanation of the limitations of traditional ancestral sampling methods and demonstrate the effectiveness of their proposed approach through experiments.
The paper supports its claims with empirical evidence, showing that the blocked Gibbs approach significantly improves sample quality and that even a cheap approximate version of the procedure yields better results than ancestral sampling. The authors also provide a thorough understanding of the relevant literature and demonstrate a good grasp of the field. The use of visualizations, such as Figure 1, helps to illustrate the effectiveness of the approach and makes the paper more engaging.
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the implementation of COCONET and the blocked Gibbs sampling procedure, as well as more extensive experiments to demonstrate the versatility of their method. Additionally, it would be helpful to see a more in-depth analysis of the conditional distributions that are poorly modeled by the NADE ancestral sampling procedure.
I would like the authors to answer the following questions to clarify my understanding of the paper: (1) Can you provide more insight into why the blocked Gibbs approach is more effective in modeling conditional distributions? (2) How do you plan to extend this work to other domains beyond music composition? (3) Can you provide more details on the computational cost of the blocked Gibbs procedure compared to ancestral sampling? These questions will help me better understand the paper and provide additional evidence to support my assessment.
