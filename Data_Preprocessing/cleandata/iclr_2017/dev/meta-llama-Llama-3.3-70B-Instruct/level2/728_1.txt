The paper "Semi-Aggregated Markov Decision Process (SAMDP) Model" presents a novel approach to analyzing trained policies in Reinforcement Learning (RL) by creating temporal and spatial abstractions. The authors introduce the SAMDP model, which combines the advantages of Semi-Markov Decision Process (SMDP) and Aggregated Markov Decision Process (AMDP) models. The SAMDP model is built in a transformed state space, where the problem of creating spatial abstractions (i.e., state aggregation) and temporal abstractions (i.e., identifying skills) is facilitated using spatiotemporal clustering.
I decide to accept this paper with the following key reasons: 
1. The paper tackles a specific and well-motivated question in the field of RL, which is the analysis of trained policies in complex and large state spaces.
2. The approach is well-placed in the literature, and the authors provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the related work in the field.
The paper supports its claims through a series of experiments on both a toy problem (gridworld) and more complex Atari2600 games. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the SAMDP model in identifying skills and providing a concise representation of the trained policy. The authors also provide a detailed evaluation of the model, including a comparison with other modeling approaches and an analysis of the model's performance on different tasks.
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the implementation of the SAMDP model, including the choice of hyperparameters and the computational resources required. Additionally, it would be interesting to see a more thorough analysis of the limitations of the SAMDP model and potential avenues for future work.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper include:
* How do the authors choose the number of clusters (K) and the window size (w) for the clustering algorithm?
* Can the authors provide more details on the computational resources required to build and evaluate the SAMDP model?
* How do the authors plan to address the issue of consistency in re-building an SAMDP model, and what are the potential implications of this issue for the practical application of the model?
