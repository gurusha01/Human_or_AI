This paper proposes a novel approach to designing anomaly-based host intrusion detection systems (IDS) using a system-call language modeling technique. The authors introduce a neural language model that utilizes long short-term memory (LSTM) units to learn the semantic meaning and interactions of system calls. To reduce false alarm rates, they propose an ensemble method that blends multiple thresholding classifiers into a single one. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method through experiments on public benchmark datasets, including ADFA-LD, KDD98, and UNM.
I decide to accept this paper with minor revisions. The main reasons for this decision are:
1. The paper tackles a significant problem in computer security, and the proposed approach is well-motivated and novel.
2. The authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of their method, including the system-call language model and the ensemble technique.
3. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, including its ability to reduce false alarm rates and its portability across different datasets.
However, I have some minor suggestions for improvement:
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the limitations of the proposed method, including its potential vulnerabilities to mimicry attacks.
* The authors could provide more insight into the interpretability of the learned representations, including the visualization of attack sequences.
* Some minor typos and formatting issues should be addressed.
To further improve the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
* Can you provide more details on how the proposed method can be extended to detect elaborate contemporary attacks, including mimicry attacks?
* How do you plan to optimize the structure of RNNs used in the system-call language model and ensemble algorithm?
* Can you provide more insight into the potential applications of the proposed method in real-world scenarios, including its deployment in distributed environments?
