This paper introduces a novel approach to learning about physical properties of objects through active interaction in a simulated environment. The authors propose a deep reinforcement learning framework that enables agents to conduct experiments to infer hidden properties such as mass and cohesion. The paper presents two environments, "Which is Heavier" and "Towers", where agents learn to manipulate objects and observe the consequences to answer questions about physical properties.
I decide to accept this paper with two key reasons: (1) the paper tackles a specific and well-defined problem in the field of artificial intelligence, and (2) the approach is well-motivated and grounded in literature from developmental psychology and computer vision.
The paper supports its claims through a series of experiments that demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach. The results show that agents can learn to perform experiments to discover hidden properties, and that the learned policies lead to better predictions than randomized baselines. The paper also provides a thorough analysis of the agents' behavior, including the trade-off between information gathering and risk of making mistakes.
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the implementation of the reinforcement learning algorithm and the hyperparameter tuning process. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more experiments on the transferability of the learned knowledge to new tasks and environments.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer include: (1) How do the agents' strategies change when the cost of information gathering is varied? (2) Can the agents learn to generalize to new objects and environments? (3) How does the performance of the agents compare to other state-of-the-art methods in computer vision and robotics?
Overall, this paper presents a significant contribution to the field of artificial intelligence, and the proposed approach has the potential to be applied to a wide range of tasks that require understanding of physical properties of objects. With some minor revisions to address the above questions and suggestions, this paper is ready for publication.
