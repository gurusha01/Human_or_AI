This paper proposes a novel neural reading comprehension model, called Dynamic Chunk Reader (DCR), which is capable of answering both factoid and non-factoid questions by selecting answer chunks from a given passage. The model uses a joint deep learning approach, enhanced with a novel attention mechanism and five simple yet effective features.
I decide to accept this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the paper tackles a specific and well-defined problem in the field of reading comprehension, and the proposed approach is well-motivated and grounded in the literature. Secondly, the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model, with a significant improvement over the baseline and comparable performance to the state-of-the-art models.
The paper provides a clear and concise problem definition, and the proposed approach is well-explained and easy to follow. The experimental results are thorough and well-analyzed, with a detailed comparison to the baseline and state-of-the-art models. The paper also provides a good discussion of the related work and the limitations of the proposed approach.
To further improve the paper, I suggest the authors to provide more details on the implementation of the model, such as the hyperparameter tuning and the training process. Additionally, it would be helpful to include more analysis on the error cases and the limitations of the proposed approach.
Some specific questions I would like the authors to answer include: How did the authors tune the hyperparameters of the model, and what was the effect of different hyperparameter settings on the performance of the model? How does the proposed approach handle out-of-vocabulary words and entities, and what is the impact of this on the performance of the model? What are the potential applications of the proposed approach, and how can it be extended to other tasks and domains?
Overall, this is a well-written and well-structured paper that makes a significant contribution to the field of reading comprehension. With some minor revisions and additional analysis, it has the potential to be a strong publication.
