Review
Summary of Contributions
This paper investigates the impact of action parameterization on learning difficulty, policy robustness, motion quality, and policy query rates in deep reinforcement learning (DeepRL) for dynamic locomotion tasks. Specifically, the authors compare four actuation models—torques, muscle activations, target joint angles (PD), and target joint velocities (Vel)—on planar articulated figures performing gait-cycle imitation tasks. The paper demonstrates that higher-level action parameterizations (e.g., PD and Vel) incorporating local feedback can significantly improve learning speed, robustness, and motion quality compared to low-level torque-based control. Key contributions include: (1) a DeepRL framework for motion imitation tasks; (2) a systematic evaluation of four actuation models across multiple criteria; and (3) a novel optimization approach combining policy learning with actuator optimization for complex muscle models. The work is well-motivated, addressing an underexplored aspect of reinforcement learning in biomechanical systems, and provides valuable insights into the embodied nature of control.
Decision: Accept
The paper is recommended for acceptance due to its novel exploration of action parameterization in DeepRL, rigorous experimental evaluation, and practical contributions to motion control in biomechanical systems. The results are scientifically rigorous, and the findings are likely to stimulate further research in this area.
Supporting Arguments
1. Problem Relevance and Novelty: The paper addresses a critical gap in the literature by systematically studying the impact of action parameterization, a design choice often overlooked in DeepRL. The exploration of biomechanically inspired models (e.g., MTUs) alongside traditional approaches is particularly novel and relevant for advancing motion control research.
   
2. Scientific Rigor: The experiments are thorough, involving multiple characters (biped, dog, raptor), gaits, and evaluation metrics (learning speed, robustness, motion quality, query rates). The results are well-supported by empirical evidence, and the authors provide detailed analyses of the trade-offs between different parameterizations.
3. Broader Impact: The findings have implications beyond locomotion tasks, as the insights into action parameterization could influence the design of RL systems in robotics, biomechanics, and animation. The paper also highlights the importance of co-designing actuation mechanics and control strategies, opening avenues for future research.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Clarity on MTU Optimization: While the proposed actuator optimization approach improves MTU performance, the paper acknowledges that the parameters may not be fully optimal. Providing more details on the limitations of the optimization process and potential improvements (e.g., multi-task optimization) would strengthen the discussion.
2. Generalization to 3D and Other Tasks: The experiments are limited to planar articulated figures. While the authors note this limitation, preliminary results or discussion on extending the findings to 3D locomotion or other control tasks would enhance the paper's impact.
3. Reward Function Bias: The authors argue that the reward function is not inherently biased toward PD and Vel models, but this claim could be better substantiated. Including additional reward functions or ablation studies could help validate this assertion.
4. Supplemental Materials: The paper references supplemental materials (e.g., videos, figures) extensively. While this is helpful, including key visualizations (e.g., motion quality comparisons) in the main paper would make the results more accessible to readers.
Questions for the Authors
1. How sensitive are the results to changes in hyperparameters (e.g., neural network architecture, learning rates)? Could these factors disproportionately affect certain action parameterizations?
2. The MTU models exhibit smoother actions and torques. Could this property be leveraged for tasks requiring fine-grained control or energy efficiency? Are there specific applications where MTUs might outperform other parameterizations?
3. How do you envision extending the proposed framework to 3D locomotion or real-world robotic systems? What challenges do you anticipate in such extensions?
Overall, this paper makes a strong contribution to the field of DeepRL and motion control, and I look forward to seeing its findings inspire further research.
