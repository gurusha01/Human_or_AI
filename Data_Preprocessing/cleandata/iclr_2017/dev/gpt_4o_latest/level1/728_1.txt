Review of the Paper
Summary of Contributions
The paper introduces the Semi-Aggregated Markov Decision Process (SAMDP) model, a novel framework designed to analyze trained reinforcement learning (RL) policies by leveraging spatiotemporal abstractions. SAMDP combines the strengths of Semi-Markov Decision Processes (SMDPs) and Aggregated MDPs (AMDPs) to simplify policy analysis by reducing the state-space complexity and planning horizon. The authors propose a systematic process for constructing SAMDP models, including feature selection, spatiotemporal clustering, skill identification, inference, and model selection. The paper demonstrates the utility of SAMDP through experiments on both a toy gridworld problem and challenging Atari2600 games solved by Deep Q-Networks (DQNs). Notably, the SAMDP model is shown to facilitate policy monitoring, improve robustness via an "eject button" mechanism, and provide interpretable insights into policy behavior. The work is well-motivated, addressing the critical challenge of understanding and analyzing policies in complex RL environments.
Decision: Accept
The paper makes a significant contribution to the field of RL by proposing a novel and practical framework for policy analysis, supported by rigorous experiments and well-grounded theoretical insights. The key reasons for acceptance are:
1. Novelty and Relevance: The SAMDP model introduces a unique approach to combining spatial and temporal abstractions, addressing a pressing need in the RL community for interpretable policy analysis.
2. Scientific Rigor: The methodology is robust, with clear explanations of the SAMDP construction process, evaluation criteria, and experimental results that validate the claims.
Supporting Arguments
1. Well-Motivated Approach: The paper is well-placed in the literature, building on established concepts such as SMDPs and AMDPs while addressing their limitations. The motivation for SAMDP is compelling, particularly in the context of analyzing policies trained with deep neural networks, where interpretability is a known challenge.
2. Experimental Validation: The experiments on gridworld and Atari2600 games effectively demonstrate the SAMDP model's ability to simplify policy analysis and provide actionable insights. The use of evaluation criteria such as VMSE, entropy, and correlation metrics strengthens the scientific rigor of the results.
3. Practical Applications: The "eject button" mechanism highlights the practical utility of SAMDP in shared autonomy systems, showcasing its potential for real-world applications.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Clustering Methods: While the paper uses a modified K-means algorithm, exploring more advanced clustering techniques (e.g., spectral clustering) could further enhance the quality of the SAMDP models. The authors briefly mention this but could provide more detailed comparisons or insights.
2. Consistency of SAMDP Models: The paper acknowledges potential variability in SAMDP construction due to randomness in clustering and feature extraction. Future work could focus on developing methods to ensure consistency across multiple runs.
3. Scalability: The paper could discuss the computational scalability of SAMDP construction for larger-scale RL problems, particularly in environments with continuous state and action spaces.
4. Feature Representation: While the use of t-SNE for feature extraction is justified, the authors could explore alternative dimensionality reduction techniques that explicitly account for temporal dependencies, as suggested in the discussion.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the SAMDP model perform in environments with continuous state and action spaces? Have you considered extending the framework to handle such cases?
2. Could you elaborate on the trade-offs between different clustering methods (e.g., K-means vs. spectral clustering) in terms of computational cost and model quality?
3. How sensitive is the SAMDP model to the choice of hyperparameters, such as the number of clusters (K) and window size (w)? Could you provide more insights into the parameter tuning process?
Overall, this paper presents a valuable contribution to the RL community, and the SAMDP framework has the potential to inspire further research in interpretable and robust policy analysis.
