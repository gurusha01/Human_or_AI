Summary of Contributions
The paper presents a simple yet effective method for generating unsupervised sentence embeddings by computing a weighted average of word embeddings followed by a principal component removal step, termed "Smooth Inverse Frequency" (SIF). The authors demonstrate that this method outperforms sophisticated supervised models, such as RNNs and LSTMs, on various textual similarity tasks and even improves upon the supervised embeddings of Wieting et al. (2016). The paper also provides a theoretical justification for the approach using a modified latent variable generative model for sentences. The simplicity, robustness, and strong empirical performance of the method make it a compelling baseline for future work, especially in low-resource or domain adaptation settings.
Decision: Accept
Key reasons: 
1. Strong empirical results: The proposed method achieves significant improvements over existing baselines, including both unsupervised and supervised approaches, on a wide range of textual similarity tasks. 
2. Theoretical grounding: The paper provides a clear and well-motivated theoretical explanation for the success of the method, enhancing its scientific rigor and generalizability.
Supporting Arguments
1. Well-Motivated Approach: The paper builds upon prior work, particularly Wieting et al. (2016) and Arora et al. (2016), and extends their ideas in a meaningful way. The use of word frequency-based weighting and principal component removal is both intuitive and theoretically justified, addressing known limitations of simple averaging methods.
2. Empirical Validation: The method demonstrates consistent and substantial improvements (10%-30%) over unweighted baselines across 22 textual similarity datasets. It also outperforms or matches supervised models in several cases, highlighting its utility in transfer learning and domain adaptation scenarios.
3. Simplicity and Generalizability: The method is computationally efficient, easy to implement, and robust to hyperparameter choices, making it a practical baseline for a wide range of NLP tasks.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Clarify Limitations: While the paper briefly mentions that the method may not perform as well on tasks requiring sentiment analysis or word order sensitivity, a more detailed discussion of these limitations would strengthen the paper. For example, how might the method be adapted to better handle negation or antonymy in sentiment tasks?
2. Comparison with Recent Advances: The paper could benefit from a discussion of how the proposed method compares to more recent sentence embedding techniques, such as transformer-based models (e.g., BERT, Sentence-BERT). While these models were not the focus of this work, acknowledging their relevance would provide a more comprehensive context.
3. Ablation Studies: While the paper includes some analysis of the contributions of the weighting scheme and principal component removal, additional ablation studies on different datasets could further validate the importance of these components.
4. Broader Applications: The paper focuses primarily on textual similarity tasks. It would be valuable to explore the method's applicability to other NLP tasks, such as question answering or summarization, to better understand its versatility.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the performance of the proposed method compare to transformer-based models like BERT or Sentence-BERT on the same textual similarity tasks?
2. Could the weighting scheme be adapted or learned dynamically for tasks where certain words (e.g., "not") are more critical, such as sentiment analysis?
3. The method assumes that word embeddings are pre-trained. How sensitive is the performance to the choice of word embedding method (e.g., GloVe vs. Word2Vec vs. FastText)?
In conclusion, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field by proposing a simple, theoretically grounded, and empirically robust method for sentence embeddings. While there are areas for further exploration and refinement, the work is well-positioned to serve as a new baseline for unsupervised sentence embedding methods.
