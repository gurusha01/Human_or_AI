Review of the Paper: "Domain Transfer Network (DTN) for Unsupervised Domain Transfer"
Summary of Contributions
The paper addresses the problem of unsupervised domain transfer, where a generative function \( G \) maps samples from a source domain \( S \) to a target domain \( T \), ensuring that a shared representation function \( f \) remains invariant. The proposed Domain Transfer Network (DTN) employs a compound loss function combining adversarial, representation-preserving, and regularization terms. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of DTN in generating visually convincing results across challenging domains, such as transferring SVHN digits to MNIST and generating personalized emoji from face images. The paper also highlights DTN's superiority over baseline methods and its potential for unsupervised domain adaptation. The results are compelling, particularly in the face-to-emoji application, where the generated emoji outperform human-created ones in identity preservation.
Decision: Accept
The paper makes a novel and significant contribution to the field of unsupervised domain transfer, introducing a well-motivated approach that is rigorously evaluated across multiple domains. The following reasons support this decision:
1. Novelty and Scope: The formulation of the domain transfer problem as a general analogy synthesis task is novel, and the proposed DTN framework is well-designed to address it.
2. Empirical Validation: The results are scientifically rigorous, with comprehensive experiments demonstrating the method's effectiveness and generalizability.
3. Broader Impact: The method has potential applications in diverse areas, including domain adaptation, style transfer, and identity-preserving image synthesis.
Supporting Arguments
1. Motivation and Literature Placement: The paper is well-situated in the literature, building on GANs, style transfer, and domain adaptation while addressing their limitations. The authors clearly articulate the novelty of their approach compared to existing methods.
2. Methodological Rigor: The DTN architecture is thoughtfully designed, with a clear explanation of the loss components and their contributions. The inclusion of \( f \)-constancy and identity mapping regularization is particularly compelling.
3. Experimental Results: The experiments are thorough, covering both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. The SVHN-to-MNIST transfer demonstrates the method's robustness, while the face-to-emoji application showcases its practical utility and ability to outperform human annotators.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Ablation Study on Loss Components: While the paper includes some analysis of the loss terms, a more detailed ablation study could clarify the relative importance of each component (e.g., \( L{CONST} \), \( L{TID} \), \( L_{GAN} \)) across different datasets.
2. Comparison with Style Transfer: The paper briefly compares DTN with neural style transfer but could provide more quantitative metrics to substantiate the claim that DTN is more general and effective.
3. Scalability and Efficiency: The paper does not discuss the computational cost of training DTNs, particularly for large-scale datasets. Including runtime or resource requirements would strengthen the practical relevance of the method.
4. Generalization to Non-Visual Domains: While the paper focuses on visual tasks, it would be interesting to explore how DTN performs in non-visual domains (e.g., text or audio).
Questions for the Authors
1. How sensitive is the performance of DTN to the choice of the representation function \( f \)? Would a poorly trained \( f \) significantly degrade results?
2. Could the authors provide more insights into the failure cases of DTN, particularly in the reverse domain transfer direction (e.g., emoji-to-face)?
3. How does DTN handle domain pairs with highly imbalanced data distributions or domains with significantly different complexities?
In conclusion, this paper presents a well-motivated and impactful contribution to unsupervised domain transfer. With minor clarifications and additional experiments, it could further solidify its position as a foundational work in this area.
