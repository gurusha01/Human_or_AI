Review of the Paper
Summary of Contributions  
This paper introduces a novel variation of the Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) using leaky rectified linear units (leaky ReLU), termed as "leaky RBM." The authors systematically analyze the joint and marginal distributions of leaky RBM, interpreting it as a union of truncated Gaussian distributions. They propose a new sampling algorithm that anneals the leakiness parameter rather than the energy, which improves the efficiency and accuracy of likelihood estimation compared to the conventional Annealed Importance Sampling (AIS). Furthermore, the proposed method demonstrates faster mixing compared to the contrastive divergence algorithm, enhancing training without additional computational cost. Empirical results on benchmark datasets show that leaky RBM outperforms Bernoulli-Gaussian RBM in terms of log-likelihood, and the annealing leakiness approach provides better partition function estimation and optimization performance.
Decision: Accept  
The key reasons for acceptance are:  
1. Novelty and Significance: The paper addresses critical limitations in RBM training and sampling, proposing a well-motivated and innovative solution with significant improvements in efficiency and accuracy.  
2. Empirical Validation: The claims are rigorously supported by theoretical analysis and extensive empirical results, demonstrating the superiority of the proposed method over existing approaches.
Supporting Arguments  
1. Well-Motivated Approach: The paper builds on prior work in RBMs and exponential family distributions, clearly identifying gaps in existing methods (e.g., limitations of ReLU RBM and AIS). The choice of leaky ReLU as a hidden unit activation function is justified both theoretically and empirically.  
2. Theoretical Rigor: The authors provide a detailed mathematical framework for leaky RBM, including proofs of positive definite constraints and derivations of joint/marginal distributions. This adds credibility to their claims about the model's stability and interpretability.  
3. Empirical Strength: The proposed sampling algorithm outperforms AIS in partition function estimation with significantly reduced computational resources. Additionally, the leaky RBM achieves higher log-likelihood scores on benchmark datasets (e.g., CIFAR10, SVHN) compared to Bernoulli-Gaussian RBM. These results are consistent and robust across various experimental settings.
Suggestions for Improvement  
1. Clarity in Presentation: The paper is dense with mathematical details, which may overwhelm readers unfamiliar with RBMs. Simplifying or summarizing key equations and providing more intuitive explanations could improve accessibility.  
2. Computational Complexity: While the paper acknowledges the computational cost of the projection step and Cholesky decomposition, it would benefit from a more detailed discussion on how these costs scale with larger datasets or higher-dimensional models.  
3. Comparison with Advanced Models: The paper primarily compares leaky RBM with Bernoulli-Gaussian RBM. Including comparisons with more recent generative models (e.g., Variational Autoencoders, GANs) would strengthen the paper's positioning in the broader landscape of generative modeling.  
4. Visualization of Results: While the paper emphasizes quantitative metrics (e.g., log-likelihood), additional visualizations of sampled images or convergence behavior could provide a more intuitive understanding of the model's performance.
Questions for the Authors  
1. How does the proposed annealing leakiness approach generalize to deeper architectures, such as Deep Boltzmann Machines or multi-layer RBMs?  
2. Can the computational cost of the projection step be mitigated further, especially for high-dimensional datasets?  
3. How sensitive is the performance of leaky RBM to the choice of the leakiness parameter and its annealing schedule?  
Overall, this paper makes a strong contribution to the field of energy-based generative models and provides a compelling case for the adoption of leaky RBM and the annealing leakiness approach. With minor improvements in presentation and broader comparisons, it could have an even greater impact.
