The proposed self-supervised loss is designed using a Siamese architecture, encouraging patches from the same image to be closer in feature space compared to a contrasting patch sampled from a different, random image. Conceptually, the loss is closely related to the approaches of Doersch et al. (ICCV 2015) and Isola et al. (ICLR 2016 workshop). In fact, the proposed loss appears to be a simplified variant of Doersch et al. (ICCV 2015), as it does not leverage the spatial offsetâ€”a readily available self-supervised signal inherent in natural images. Intuitively, this simplification suggests that the self-supervised task defined by the proposed method is less complex, and potentially less powerful, than the task posed in the aforementioned work. I would recommend including a more detailed discussion comparing these two approaches. That said, the proposed method demonstrates its effectiveness by achieving strong empirical results despite its simplicity. However, additional implementation details should be provided, such as the impact of patch size, the degree of overlap between sampled patches, and any specific measures taken to prevent trivial solutions.
