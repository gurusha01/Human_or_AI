This manuscript investigates the capacity of nonlinear recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to explain neural response properties that have remained beyond the reach of other modeling approaches. A multilayer RNN is trained to replicate the stimulus-response mapping observed in retinal ganglion cells when exposed to sequences of natural images. The RNN demonstrates a marked improvement over conventional LN/GLM models, particularly in capturing transient responses.
This study represents a significant advancement in understanding the nonlinear response characteristics of visual neurons. Recent findings have highlighted the difficulty of explaining retinal ganglion cell responses to natural movies using standard receptive field models, posing a critical challenge to the field. The development of any model capable of addressing this issue would serve as a valuable starting point, and this work should be viewed in that context. The next step, naturally, is to dissect the RNN's mechanisms to identify the components essential for its performance. For instance, pruning or simplifying the network could help reveal the critical elements driving its success. While such an analysis would have been a valuable addition, this study nonetheless provides an important foundation and is a noteworthy contribution to the field.
I found the term "movie" somewhat unclear. My interpretation is that it refers to a sequence of unrelated images presented for 1 second each. However, the manuscript also mentions a "frame rate" of 1/8.33 ms, which I assume corresponds to the monitor's refresh rate. Clarification on this point would be helpful.
I suspect that deviations from the LN model would be even more pronounced when using actual dynamic natural scenesâ€”i.e., real movies. In such scenarios, I would anticipate the RNN to exhibit an even greater advantage and provide deeper insights into the underlying neural mechanisms.
