The paper is clear, well-structured, and presents its results in an accessible manner.
Given that all these parameterizations ultimately produce torques, it seems unlikely there would be significant differences between them. There exists a known function to convert one representation into another (or at least into torques). Could it be that the slight advantage of proportional control arises simply because the tracking cost depends on positions?
Would the results remain the same if the reference-pose cost were removed, leaving only a locomotion cost?
Would the results hold if the task were to spin a top? My intuition suggests they would not.
While the work is engaging, its applicability to other scenarios appears limited, which constrains its broader relevance.
The accompanying video is well-done.
