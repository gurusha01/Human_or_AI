The exploration of applying sparsity to backward gradients for training LSTMs is intriguing.  
However, the paper feels incomplete due to the lack of thorough experimental validation. Reporting only the validation loss is inadequate. Comprehensive testing results and standard evaluation metrics must be provided to substantiate the claim that the proposed sparsity technique does not lead to performance degradation.  
Additionally, a detailed justification of the improvements in speed and efficiency would significantly strengthen the paper.
