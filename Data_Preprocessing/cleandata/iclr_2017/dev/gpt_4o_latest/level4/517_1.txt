I apologize for the delay in submitting this review.
This paper addresses the problem of structure estimation by reframing it as a supervised classification task. The input to the proposed method is the empirical covariance matrix derived from the observed data, and the output is a binary decision indicating whether two variables share a link. The paper is well-written, with clear objectives and thorough descriptions of the methodology.
The most notable aspect of the paper lies in the empirical results presented in the experimental section. The proposed approach is straightforward yet outperforms prior non-learning-based methods. This finding is both intriguing and relevant to the field of structure discovery, making it a valuable contribution.
The specific design of the supervised learning method is a reasonable and practical approach to tackling this problem. However, it does not introduce significant technical novelty. For instance, an algorithmic contribution such as a method invariant to data permutation could have been a potential avenue for technical innovation. That said, the paper does not claim to focus on this aspect, and the method is both well-conceived and effectively implemented.
The theoretical components of the paper are clearly articulated, which is commendable. While the results are relatively straightforward, the clarity with which the claims are presented is appreciated. However, there is little in the way of unexpected or groundbreaking insights in the theoretical statements.
In conclusion, the paper makes a compelling observation: graph estimation can be formulated as a supervised learning problem, and training data from one source can be leveraged to infer structure in novel, unseen test data from a different source. This has practical implications, as the method demonstrates stronger empirical performance. However, practitioners interested in structure discovery may face additional constraints, such as the interpretability of the method. From the Discussion and Conclusion sections, it is clear that the authors recognize this limitation and consider it as a direction for future work. Overall, this is a solid first step that stands on its own while leaving room for further development.
