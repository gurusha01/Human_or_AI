I find myself conflicted about this submission. The mention of the MPEG-7 dataset and references to curvature scale space immediately brought to mind the adage, "if it's not worth doing, it's not worth doing well." It's undeniable that the MPEG-7 dataset and benchmark have been thoroughly explored and arguably saturated for quite some time, making its appearance in a submission to a contemporary ML conference rather unexpected. When I questioned the authors about their choice of representation, they explained that their "main purpose was to connect the theory of differential geometry of curves with the computational engine of a convolutional neural network." This is a fair justification. I acknowledge that these are distinct areas of study, and the authors deserve recognition for attempting to bridge them. Assuming we accept that this endeavor is worthwhile, their approach using a Siamese network configuration is logical, and their adaptation of deep convolutional network frameworks to 1D signals is well-reasoned. Given that traditional invariant-based methods relied on smoothed or filtered representations combined with nonlinearities, revisiting this problem through the lens of convolutional networks seems sensible. While I wouldn't oppose the acceptance of this paper, as it offers a perspective that diverges from the mainstream, I am concerned that the audience at ICLR may be too narrow to fully appreciate this type of shape representation.
