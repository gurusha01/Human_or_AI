This paper develops models to analyze spike trains of retinal ganglion cells driven by natural images. I suggest adding the word "activity" to the title, as its absence renders the current phrasing formally imprecise.
More specifically, the paper introduces a recurrent neural network (RNN) for time series prediction and compares its performance to that of a generalized linear model (GLM), which appears to be the prior standard. The overarching premise is that accurately predicting spikes enables one to examine the model and gain insights into the underlying mechanisms of neural processing.
While the paper presents a plausible approach, I am not entirely convinced that it provides significant new insights. The results in Figure 2 demonstrate that the RNN achieves slightly better spike prediction than the GLM, which is a positive outcome. However, this raises the question: what comes next? The authors have shown that a more complex model can better fit the data, although discrepancies with the real data remain. The stated goal was to use improved predictive models to enhance understanding of retinal neural processing. Therefore, it would be valuable for the authors to elaborate on what specific insights were gained. As someone not specialized in retinal neuroscience, I am aware that the retina involves multiple layers and recurrent connections, so it is not entirely surprising that the RNN outperforms the GLM.
The paper also notes that more advanced recurrent architectures, such as LSTMs, do not yield further performance improvements. However, this comparison is inherently challenging, as more complex models typically require larger datasets. Thus, it seems plausible that incorporating additional layers or a more detailed representation of retinal structure could further enhance predictive accuracy with sufficient data.
Lastly, I found it surprising that all neurons in the network share identical parameters (weights). While the results indicate that these simplified models capture many characteristics of the spike trains, wouldn't a model with neuron-specific parameters outperform this one, assuming adequate training data were available? This is worth exploring further.
