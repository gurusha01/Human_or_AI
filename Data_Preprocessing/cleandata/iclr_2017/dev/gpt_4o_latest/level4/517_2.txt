The paper introduces a novel algorithm for estimating graph structures by leveraging a convolutional neural network to approximate the mapping function from the empirical covariance matrix to the graph's sparsity pattern. Compared to existing methods, the proposed algorithm demonstrates improved adaptability to various network structures, such as small-world networks, while operating within the same empirical risk minimization framework. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets indicate that the algorithm achieves promising performance relative to baseline methods.
Overall, I find this to be an interesting and innovative paper. The approach of framing structure estimation as a learning problem is particularly compelling and has the potential to inspire further research in related areas. A key advantage of this methodology is its ability to adapt more easily to diverse network structure properties without requiring the design of specific regularization terms, as is the case with methods like graph lasso.
The experimental results are encouraging as well. On both synthetic and real-world datasets, the proposed algorithm consistently outperforms baseline methods, particularly in scenarios with limited sample sizes.
That said, the paper could benefit from clearer explanations of certain aspects of the network architecture. For instance, on page 5, it is stated that each \( o^k{i,j} \) is a \( d \)-dimensional vector. However, based on the context, it seems that \( o^k{i,j} \) might actually be a scalar (e.g., \( o^0{i,j} = p{i,j} \)). The exact nature of \( o^k_{i,j} \) and the meaning of \( d \) are unclear. Is \( d \) the number of channels in the convolutional filters?
Additionally, Figure 1 is somewhat confusing. In panel (b), the table is shown as 16 x 16, whereas panel (a) depicts only six nodes. Furthermore, the figure seems to suggest that there is only one channel in each layer. What do the black squares represent, and why are there three blocks of them? While the text provides some descriptions, the explanations remain ambiguous.
Regarding the real-world data, it is unclear how the training data pairs (\( Y, \Sigma \)) are generated. Are they created in the same manner as in the synthetic experiments, where the entries are uniformly sparse? This raises a broader question about how samples are drawn from the distribution \( P \) in the context of real-world data. Providing more details on this process would enhance the clarity and reproducibility of the work.
