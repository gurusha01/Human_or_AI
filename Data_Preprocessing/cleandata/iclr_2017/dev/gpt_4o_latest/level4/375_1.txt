This paper presents a compelling probabilistic motivation for weighted bag-of-words models and is overall a strong contribution. Including a comparison to Wang and Manning (anticipated in a future revision) will further enhance its impact. However, it is unfortunate that NB-SVM still outperforms the proposed approach on sufficiently large datasets.
In the second-to-last paragraph of the introduction, you discuss the issue of large co-occurrence counts, which was already addressed by the Glove embeddings through their weighting function f.
Minor points:
- "The capturing the similarities" — typo in line 2 of the introduction.  
- "Recently, (Wieting et al., 2016) learned" — replace the parenthesized citation with a \citet format.
