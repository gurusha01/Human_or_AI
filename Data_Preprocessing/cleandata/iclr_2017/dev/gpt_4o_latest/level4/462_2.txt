This paper investigates a significant aspect of adversarial examples: the detection of adversarial images and their application in training more robust neural networks.
It elevates the dynamic between adversaries and models to a higher level. The study provides compelling evidence supporting the viability of strengthening networks by integrating a detector subnetwork, which is specifically trained to identify adversarial inputs in a targeted manner, rather than solely focusing on making the networks themselves resilient to adversarial examples.
The proposed jointly trained primary network and detector system is tested across various scenarios, including situations where the adversary generator has direct access to the model and cases where adversarial examples are generated in a more generic fashion.
The results demonstrate notable improvements with the proposed approach and are supported by well-reasoned, comprehensive analyses that reinforce the paper's central claims. The writing is both clear and concise.
