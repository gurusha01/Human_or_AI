Learning the physical structure and semantics of the world from video data without supervision is a highly active and significant area of research in computer vision and machine learning.  
In this paper, the authors explore how predicting future image frames (an inherently unsupervised task) can facilitate the understanding of object structures and their properties—specifically, single object pose, category, and steering angle—following a supervised linear readout step.  
I found this paper to be an enjoyable read. It is well-written, engaging, and introduces an innovative network architecture (PredNet) for video frame prediction, which demonstrates promising results on both synthetic and real-world image datasets. Additionally, the authors provide a thorough experimental evaluation and analysis, establishing a strong foundation for future comparisons.  
Weaknesses:  
- The connection to predictive coding, which is used as a motivation for the PredNet model, should be elaborated more clearly in the paper.  
- The suggestion that the proposed method implicitly learns a `model' of the `objects' in a `scene' is vague and overly ambitious, though it is an appealing idea.  
Minor comment:  
In addition to the number of labeled training examples (Fig. 5), it would be valuable to include information on the amount of unsupervised training data used to learn the representations.
