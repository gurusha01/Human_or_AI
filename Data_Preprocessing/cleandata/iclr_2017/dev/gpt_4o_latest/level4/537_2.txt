The paper introduces a method for generating synthetic training data for deep neural networks by rendering 3D models and employing adversarial training to learn additional transformations. This approach is applied to the generation of barcode-like markers for honeybee identification. The authors demonstrate that a classifier trained on synthetic data produced by their method outperforms classifiers trained on limited real data or data augmented with hand-designed transformations.
The paper addresses an important and intriguing topic â€” leveraging machine learning, specifically adversarial training, to create realistic synthetic training data. The proposed method appears sound, and the paper is well-written. However, the experiments are confined to a relatively simple and niche domain of honeybee marker classification. While this is undoubtedly a significant task in its own right, extending the experiments to standard or widely-used datasets would better demonstrate the general applicability of the method and facilitate comparisons with existing techniques. Overall, I recommend acceptance but strongly encourage the authors to evaluate their approach on additional datasets.
I commend the authors for including a baseline with manually designed transformations, which strengthens the paper.
As Reviewer3 notes, it would be valuable to investigate whether restricting the GAN to a fixed set of transformations is necessary in this context and to identify which transformations are most critical. Such an analysis could offer useful insights for designing transformation sets in more complex scenarios.
The authors should moderate claims such as, "Our method is an improvement over previous work <...> Whereas previous work relied on real data for training using pre-trained models or mixing real and generated data, we were able to train a DCNN from scratch with generated data that performed well when tested on real data." This comparison is not entirely fair, as the domain studied in this paper is significantly simpler than those addressed in prior works, making such claims inappropriate.
