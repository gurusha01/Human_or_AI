Pros:  
- Introduces a novel representation with appealing properties, which are thoroughly derived and evaluated against a solid mathematical foundation and context.  
- Proposes a straightforward algorithm to compute the representation.  
Cons:  
- While the paper leans towards applied mathematics, it could benefit from deeper exploration of the representation's characteristics, such as analyzing the behavior of individual layers, particularly the first one.
