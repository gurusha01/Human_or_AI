This paper presents a method for modeling time-varying dynamics in collaborative filtering.  
Comments:  
1) The core concept of the paper builds upon prior work by the same group of authors (Wang et al., KDD), with the primary distinction being the modification of certain latent factors to incorporate RNNs.  
2) The authors detail the use of a BPTT approach for training the proposed model.  
3) A new metric, time prediction, is introduced to assess the effectiveness of the time-dependent model. However, this metric should be conditioned on a given user-item pair.  
4) It would be valuable to explore additional metrics, such as:  
   - The switching time, which captures when a user transitions to another item.  
   - Joint prediction of the next item and the switching time.  
Summary:  
Overall, this paper extends an existing time dynamics model for recommender systems. The introduction of the time prediction metric is noteworthy and sparks an engaging discussion on how to evaluate recommender systems in scenarios where time plays a significant role (see comments for further suggestions).
