This paper addresses the challenge of multi-modal classification involving both text and images.
Strengths:
- The dataset and application are intriguing and relevant.
Weaknesses:
- The results demonstrate only marginal improvements over the oracle baseline. Providing insights into whether the errors made by the model are understandable or plausible from a human perspective could enhance the significance of the findings.
- The study does not investigate intermediate architectures, such as combining feature fusion with class probabilities, either with or without fine-tuning. Additionally, no results are presented for feature fusion approaches.
- There is a lack of evaluation on standard datasets and no comparisons are made to prior works in the field.
What is the learned policy for CP-1? When presented with two input class probabilities, how does the network outperform simple strategies like taking the maximum or the mean?
