The paper introduces a method for visualizing and analyzing policies derived from observed trajectories generated by those policies. This approach identifies higher-level skills and clusters states, resulting in a simplified, discrete, higher-order state and action transition matrix. The proposed model has potential applications in analysis, modeling, and interpretation. To construct a semi-aggregated MDP, the authors combine concepts from semi-MDPs and aggregated-MDPs. The method involves feature selection, state clustering, skill inference, reward and skill length estimation, and model selection. The approach is demonstrated on a small grid-world problem and a DQN-trained agent playing Atari games.
The authors rightly emphasize the importance of interpretability tools for reinforcement learning (RL), particularly for analyzing and deploying RL methods in real-world scenarios, such as robotics and high-stakes systems.
The method ultimately produces a high-level transition matrix. While there is extensive literature on hierarchical RL methods that integrate lower-level skills with higher-level policies, the presented method stands out by analyzing and structuring already-trained agents. This distinction is compelling, and the paper would benefit from explicitly highlighting this difference and contrasting it with the broader body of related work.
To construct the model, the authors combine ideas from semi-MDPs and aggregated-MDPs, employing a modified k-means algorithm for state clustering. However, the novelty of the proposed method appears limited. The paper would be stronger if the authors explicitly articulated their contributions beyond combining existing methods and better demonstrated the practical utility of the approach.
The evaluation section could be improved by including more analytical results and precise evaluations to better showcase the method's full potential.
The paper is challenging to read. To enhance readability:
- The Semi-Aggregated MDP section should provide a more precise and detailed description of the methods. While the intuitive narrative is helpful, it should be supplemented with algorithms and formulas where applicable.
- The paper should be self-contained. For instance, additional background on the Occam's Razor principle should be included.
- The number of acronyms should be reduced, especially those that sound similar. Acronyms should also be defined before their first use.
- The contributions, comparisons with relevant literature, and specific advantages of the proposed method should be more clearly articulated.
- Typos, formatting errors, and other distractions should be corrected.
The reverse-engineering approach to uncovering hierarchies and learning a high-level transition matrix is both intriguing and promising. This method might even enable the development of more specialized hierarchical trainers that outperform single-network approaches by learning complex behaviors more efficiently. However, the paper falls short in terms of novelty, precision, and clarity.
