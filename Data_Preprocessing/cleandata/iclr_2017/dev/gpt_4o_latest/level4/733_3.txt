In this paper, a novel method for anomaly detection is proposed for the task of intrusion detection using system call sequences.  
The system call sequence is treated as a language, and multiple LSTM-RNN language models are trained and combined into an ensemble.  
Diversity within the ensemble is achieved by selecting different hyperparameters for each LSTM-based language model.  
The ensemble is formed by averaging transformations of the likelihoods produced by the individual models.  
I appreciate that the approach does not rely on attack data during training and find the use of language models and ensemble techniques particularly appealing.  
However, I have a few high-level concerns, which may have straightforward explanations since I am not an expert in this domain:
- The reliance on system calls appears to have a potential weakness: If an attacker gains access to some "normal" system call sequences, they could potentially manipulate the system by interleaving malicious system calls with normal ones, artificially increasing the likelihood of the sequence.  
- Including a few lines in the introduction about other anomaly detection tasks where RNNs have been applied could help provide a clearer context for the novelty of this approach.
