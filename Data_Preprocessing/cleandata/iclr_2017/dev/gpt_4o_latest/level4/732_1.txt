While the paper reports reasonably good accuracy metrics, it is difficult to justify its acceptance due to the following concerns:
1) The motivation relies on the flawed premise that the Paragraph Vector model fails to generalize to unseen data.  
2) Several fundamental issues with formatting and BibTeX citations are present.
Additionally, the work lacks novelty, as it introduces yet another conventional directed LDA-inspired bag-of-words/bigram model.
