This paper introduces a system-level approach to integrating multiple modalities for classification tasks within a practical context (e-commerce).
Overall, I find the approach described in the paper to be robust and well-founded. However, the work lacks novelty: both feature fusion and decision-level fusion are well-established techniques in multi-modal analysis, and the remainder of the paper does not present any unexpected innovations in applying these methods. This work appears to align better with venues emphasizing production systems rather than ICLR, which prioritizes research on novel algorithms and theoretical advancements.
