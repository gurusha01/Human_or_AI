This paper introduces a novel multiscale recurrent neural network, where each layer operates on a distinct time scale that is not fixed but adaptively determined by a neural network. The approach is seamlessly integrated into the recurrent neural network framework and achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks. The manuscript is clearly written and well-structured.
Question) Is it possible to extend this approach to bidirectional RNNs?
