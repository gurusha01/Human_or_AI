The authors present a method for network intrusion detection (NIDS) by applying an LSTM to a sequence of system calls. While the use of neural networks for NIDS is a well-established concept [1], and the application of neural networks, including LSTMs, to system call sequences for NIDS has already been explored [2, 3], the novelty of this work appears limited. Specifically, [2] employs N-gram counts of system calls rather than raw sequences, but the preprocessing involved in that approach does not seem particularly burdensome.
On the positive side, the proposed system achieves performance comparable to other NIDS approaches and includes an evaluation of portability, which is a valuable contribution.
However, on the negative side, the paper does not significantly advance the state-of-the-art in NIDS. Furthermore, it does not align well with the scope of ICLR, as it offers limited insights into representation learning. The application of LSTMs to sequence data is a well-trodden path, and this work does not introduce substantial innovation in that regard.
In conclusion, I find this submission to be below the threshold for ICLR. The authors might consider submitting their work to a security-focused conference instead.
