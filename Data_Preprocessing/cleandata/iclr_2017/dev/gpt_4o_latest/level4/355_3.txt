This paper presents a strong application of A3C to Doom, augmented with a series of techniques to secure victory in one of the VizDoom competitions. While it is reasonable to expect the competitive focus to take precedence over a purely scientific approach that justifies each design choice independently, the authors manage to perform a commendable job in addressing the latter as well.
However, two of my concerns remain unresolved (see AnonReviewer2, below).
Additionally, the citation list is somewhat sparse. For instance, there is extensive literature on reward shaping, as well as on incrementally more challenging task setups, with roots tracing back to Mark Ring's work in the 1990s. Furthermore, there has been significant complementary research on other FPS games. While I am not suggesting that the authors conduct direct comparisons, it would be beneficial to provide readers with a clearer sense of the broader context in which this work is situated.
