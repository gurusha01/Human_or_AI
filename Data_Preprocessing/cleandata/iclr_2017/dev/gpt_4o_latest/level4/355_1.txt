The paper outlines methods employed to train learning agents for the 3D game Doom. The authors introduce several performance enhancements (curriculum learning, attention via zoomed-in centered frames, reward shaping, game variables, and post-training rules) that are informed by domain knowledge.
These enhancements collectively result in a notable improvement, as evidenced by the competition results. Figure 4 demonstrates that curriculum learning significantly aids in training across progressively challenging settings. A particularly interesting finding is the absence of overfitting to the more difficult classes once the agents have learned, likely due to the curriculum's focus on health and speed. While the authors claim in Figure 5 that the adaptive curriculum outperforms and is more stable than pure A3C, this conclusion seems somewhat overstated based on the presented graph. Additionally, they assert that pure A3C fails to learn in the harder map but do not provide corresponding results or graphs to substantiate this claim. Table 5, however, clearly highlights the advantages of the post-training rules.
If the objective is to address challenges like those in 3D shooter games, this paper offers a meaningful contribution by identifying practical techniques to tackle such problems and improve task performance. That said, I find the paper less compelling, primarily because it heavily relies on domain knowledge, making it diverge significantly from a pure reinforcement learning problem. The results, while potentially novel for this specific problem, are not particularly surprising.
Regarding Figure 6, I find it difficult to draw any solid conclusions in its current form. I recommend that the authors either improve the resolution or provide quantitative metrics to assess the clarity or fuzziness of each row/imageâ€”something more definitive than an arrow pointing to already low-resolution images.
--- Added after rebuttal:
I still do not see higher-resolution images for Figure 6 or a link to them, but I trust the authors will include these if the paper is accepted.
