The paper introduces an algorithm for training memory networks with extremely large memory capacities. Traditional training methods, which rely on applying a soft-attention mechanism across all memory slots, are not only computationally slow but also challenging to optimize due to gradient dispersion. To address this, the authors propose leveraging the k-mips algorithm to select a subset of memory slots for attention computation. However, since the computational cost of exact k-mips matches that of full attention, the authors suggest using approximate k-mips for efficiency, albeit at the cost of reduced performance. A key limitation of this approach is that it prevents the memory slots from being learned, requiring them to be pre-trained and fixed throughout the training process. The experimental results, conducted on the SimpleQuestions dataset, demonstrate that exact k-mips achieves comparable performance to full attention, while approximate k-mips leads to a noticeable performance drop. The paper is well-written and easy to follow.
That said, I find the ideas presented in the paper to be unconvincing, and I have several concerns:
1. The use of the k-mips algorithm necessitates fixing the memory slots, which I find to be a significant limitation. This constraint could be particularly problematic for tasks or datasets that require multi-hop reasoning to solve more complex problems. Consequently, I am skeptical about the broader applicability of this technique.
2. Additionally, exact k-mips has the same computational complexity as full attention, meaning that any speedup can only be achieved through approximate k-mips. However, as the results indicate, approximate k-mips leads to a substantial degradation in performance, which diminishes the practical utility of this approach.
3. The paper positions itself as addressing the reliance on heuristics for pruning memory slots. However, in Section 3.1, the authors themselves employ several heuristics to make the training process feasible. While it is true that these heuristics are not data-dependent, this approach feels like a deferral of the problem rather than a resolution, as heuristics are still being used to some extent.
4. The experimental results are not particularly compelling. First, the paper does not include any speed comparisons to substantiate the claimed efficiency gains. Second, the authors fail to compare their method with alternative fast nearest neighbor search techniques, such as FLANN, which could provide a more comprehensive evaluation of their approach.
