This paper appears to center its focus on a perceived limitation of the original paragraph vectors paper, specifically an asserted inability to infer representations for text not included in the training data. However, I am fairly confident that this claim is inaccurate. As a result, the foundational premise of the work presented here is undermined, which invalidates much of the ensuing discussion.
Although I recommend rejecting this paper, I encourage the authors to explore the innovative elements of their idea and consider developing it into a different type of paper in the future.
