The core concept of the paper is intriguing and holds promise for potentially impactful contributions. I appreciate the approach of linking signal processing with recurrent networks and leveraging tools from one domain in the other. That said, while the paper contains several compelling insights, I believe they could be organized and presented more cohesively. 
The overall presentation and clarity of the manuscript could be enhanced, and I encourage the authors to work on this aspect if the paper is not accepted in its current form. Some of the proposed ideas for connecting to prior work are particularly interesting, but it would be valuable to include additional experiments or provide deeper insights into why these connections are beneficial and how they contribute to the overall framework.
