This paper introduces a novel approach to unsupervised pretraining within the context of deep convolutional networks, which could potentially extend to fully-connected networks as well. The proposed method, termed 'spatial contrasting,' involves constructing triplets from patches of input images and learning a representation that assigns high similarity scores to patches from the same image and low scores to patches from different images. The simplicity of the method is striking, and it is surprising that, based on the related work cited in the submission, this idea has not been explored previously. Below are some comments:
The use of P(fi^1 | fi^2) in Section 4.1 feels somewhat unconventional. It might be helpful to provide a precise mathematical definition of the type of probability being referenced, or alternatively, consider removing this phrasing altogether and substituting "probability" with a more appropriate term.
I would appreciate additional clarification regarding how the method leverages "batch statistics" (as mentioned at the end of Section 4.2) through sampling. Does this imply that the authors sample from all possible triplets within the batch, or is there another mechanism at play?
In Algorithm 1, shouldn't the number of patches sampled be treated as a hyperparameter rather than being fixed at 1? Have the authors experimented with other values for this parameter?
There appear to be some missing details in the paper, such as the patch size or whether the authors have explored variations in this parameter. Given its significance as a hyperparameter, this warrants further discussion.
While the STL results are quite impressive, the CIFAR-10 results are less so. For CIFAR-10, one might expect that pretraining on a larger dataset, such as ImageNet combined with CIFAR, could yield a more robust representation. Have the authors considered this approach?
Overall, this work is intriguing and has clear practical applications. The method appears relatively straightforward to implement and test. However, I would have liked to see a deeper exploration of what spatial contrasting learns, more empirical analysis of the impact of various parameter choices (e.g., patch size), and additional efforts to achieve state-of-the-art performance (e.g., on CIFAR-10).
