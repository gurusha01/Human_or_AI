This paper primarily focuses on applying A3C to 3D spatial navigation tasks.
- While the experimental results are impressive, it is worth noting that this is not the first instance of A3C being applied to 3D navigation; the original A3C paper already included such experiments. As a result, I am uncertain whether this work provides sufficient additional insights to justify its acceptance as a conference paper. It might be more appropriately positioned as a workshop paper.
- Regarding Fig. 5, were the graphs generated using a single hyper-parameter sweep? To enhance the robustness of the comparisons, I recommend that the authors present results obtained from multiple random initializations.
- In summary, the two central components of this paper—A3C and curriculum learning—are not particularly novel. However, the authors do demonstrate their application in a practical system.
