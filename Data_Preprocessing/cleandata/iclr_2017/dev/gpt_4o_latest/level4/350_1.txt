An intriguing architecture that accumulates errors and iteratively corrects them as more frames from a video sequence are processed.
Clarity: The generated video is highly informative for visualizing the information flow within your network. It would be beneficial to include a link to it directly in the paper for easier access.
"Our model, when optimized with hyperparameters tuned for the KITTI dataset, performs worse than the model proposed by Finn et al. (2016) but surpasses the prior state-of-the-art model by Mathieu et al. (2016)."
Currently, it is unclear how distinct the training and testing sequences are, given the lack of standardized benchmarks for video prediction, with each author selecting their preferred datasets. The model's underperformance compared to Finn et al. (2016) on the H3.6m Walking videos is somewhat disappointing.
