This paper examines the problem of acquiring information (answering questions) through direct interaction with the environment. In this regard, it is closely aligned with "active learning" in supervised learning and the core exploration-exploitation trade-off in reinforcement learning (RL). The authors focus on a specific instance of this problem within a physics domain, leveraging recent deep RL techniques to learn information-seeking policies.
The study is primarily empirical, investigating how varying the cost of information (via the discount factor) influences the structure of the learned policies. Additionally, it demonstrates that general-purpose deep policy gradient methods are sufficiently capable of solving such tasks. To the best of my knowledge, the proposed environment and the task formulation described in Section 2 are novel. (It would be highly beneficial to the research community if the authors made the environment publicly available.)
The term "latent structure/dynamics" is used throughout the paper, and Section 4 draws a connection to bandit problems. This suggests that the authors aim for a broader generalization of their approach. However, the paper does not fully formalize the proposed method within any existing framework, nor does it introduce a completely new one.
For instance, how does the proposed approach formalize the concepts of "questions" and "answers"? What constitutes a "difficult" question, and how is "difficulty" quantified? How is the "cost of information" defined, and what are its units (e.g., bits, scalar rewards) and semantics? Is the framework based on an MDP or a POMDP? If it is an MDP, what specific type is considered? How are the state and action spaces defined? What is the structure of the discounted MDP? 
Some critical problem structure described in the "interaction/labeling/reward" section of Section 2 could be more explicitly incorporated into the MDP definition. For example, labeling actions are restricted to the "labeling phase," and the transition and reward functions exhibit specific properties (e.g., positive/negative rewards, transitions to absorbing states). The notion of "phase" might be better represented by augmenting the state space, such as defining an extended state $\tilde{s} = (s, \text{phase})$.
