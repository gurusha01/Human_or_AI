This paper introduces a novel approach for learning graphical models. By integrating a neural network architecture, the method estimates a sparse edge structure using sampling techniques. In the introduction, the authors highlight model selection as a challenge in graphical lasso. However, the proposed method still appears to involve model selection implicitly. Specifically, the sparse prior $P(G)$ in the proposed method likely includes certain hyper-parameters. How are these hyper-parameters tuned? Does this tuning process not pose a problem analogous to model selection? Consequently, I am unclear about the actual advantage of this method compared to existing approaches. What specific benefits does the proposed method offer?
Another issue is that the paper lacks organization. In Algorithm 1, Gi and \Sigmai are sampled first, followed by sampling xj from N(0, \Sigma). What exactly is \Sigma in this context? Is it distinct from \Sigmai? Additionally, how are (Yi, \hat{\Sigma}i) constructed from (Gi, Xi)? Lastly, I have a straightforward question: Where is the input data X (as opposed to sampled data) utilized in Algorithm 1?
Finally, what is the precise definition of the receptive field as used in Proposition 2 and Proposition 3?
