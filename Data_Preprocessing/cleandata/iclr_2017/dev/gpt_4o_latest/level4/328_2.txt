This paper is well-written and presents a clear, albeit straightforward, result: RNNs can serve as effective predictive models for neuron firing rates in the retina.
On one hand, the main scientific contribution appears to be a validation that this method works. For this specific stimulus-locked task, the performance improvements from employing the RNN were relatively modest, and the study has not yet provided new insights into the underlying biology.
On the other hand, this work (alongside the concurrent study by McIntosh et al.) introduces neural network modeling to a domain that has not widely adopted it yet, but where it holds significant potential for impact.
It would be particularly intriguing to see how this framework performs when applied with LFP and other neuronal inputs, as well as on a shorter discretization time scale.
I anticipate that follow-up studies building on this proof of concept will yield increasingly compelling results.
Minor comments:  
- Section 3.2: The purpose of the 0.833 ms bins was unclear.  
- Maintain consistency by using "epoch" throughout instead of alternating between "epoch" and "pass through data."  
- For Figure 4, consider using a log scale for the x-axis to improve clarity.
