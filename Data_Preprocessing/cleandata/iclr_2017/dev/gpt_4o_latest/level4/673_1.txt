1. The hierarchical memory structure is predetermined rather than learned, and the experimental section lacks a true hierarchical setup, as it only employs a single layer for the softmax operation.  
2. The results indicate 10-mips > 100-mips > 1000-mips. Does this imply that 1-mips is the optimal choice to adopt?  
3. The approximated k-mips approach performs worse than the original method. Why is exact k-mips necessary? This raises concerns about the robustness of the proposed method.
