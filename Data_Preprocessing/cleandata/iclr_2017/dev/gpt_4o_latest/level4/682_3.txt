The authors present a novel energy function for Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), employing the leaky ReLU activation function, defined as max(cx, x), for the hidden units. Similar to ReLU units in feed-forward networks, these leaky ReLU RBMs partition the input space into a combinatorial number of regions, with each region representing p(v) as a truncated Gaussian. Another key contribution of the paper is the introduction of a novel sampling method for the leaky RBM: a shorter Markov chain can be employed by initializing it with samples from the leaky RBM where c=1 (resulting in a standard multivariate normal distribution over the visible units) and gradually annealing c. In low-dimensional settings, this approach is demonstrated to outperform AIS for partition function estimation. The experimental evaluation is conducted on CIFAR-10 and SVHN datasets.
This paper is interesting and likely to attract attention from the ICLR community. The theoretical contributions are notable: the authors not only propose a well-defined energy function for ReLU-based RBMs but also introduce a novel sampling methodology and an improvement over AIS for partition function estimation.
However, the experimental results are somewhat limited. A key omission is the Persistent Contrastive Divergence (PCD) baseline. Including experiments with (Bernoulli visible, leaky ReLU hidden) RBMs would have allowed the authors to assess likelihoods on standard binary RBM datasets. Additionally, while leaky ReLU improves performance on CIFAR-10 and SVHN, the results remain significantly behind those of more recent generative models, such as VAE-based or auto-regressive approaches. Although this comparison may not be entirely fair, it does restrict the broader appeal of the paper. Another concern is the computational cost of the projection method required to ensure the energy function remains bounded (i.e., the covariance matrix for each region is positive semi-definite). While it is reasonable to defer this issue to future work given the other contributions, it further limits the paper's impact.
PROS:
- Proposes an energy function incorporating the leaky ReLU activation function.

CONS:
- Experimental results are somewhat outdated.
- Lacks experiments on binary datasets, which would provide better comparability to prior RBM research.
- Missing PCD baseline.
- Computational cost of the projection method.
