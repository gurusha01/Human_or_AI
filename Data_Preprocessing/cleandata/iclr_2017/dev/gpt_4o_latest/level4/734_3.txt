Summary:  
This paper explores the application of variational autoencoders (VAEs) for multi-view representation learning as an alternative to canonical correlation analysis (CCA), deep CCA (DCCA), and multi-view autoencoders (MVAE). The authors investigate two VAE variants, referred to as VCCA and VCCA-private, and evaluate their performance on three datasets: a synthetic MNIST dataset, the XRMB speech-articulation dataset, and the MIR-Flickr dataset.
Review:  
Variational autoencoders are a well-established tool, and their application to multi-view representation learning is likely to be of interest to the ICLR community. The paper is well-structured and clearly written, with comprehensive experiments. It is particularly intriguing that MVAE and VCCA exhibit significantly different performance despite the similarity in their objective functions. Additionally, the analyses of the impact of dropout and private variables are insightful.
The authors correctly note that "VCCA does not optimize the same criterion, nor produce the same solution, as any linear or nonlinear CCA." However, it would have been valuable to include a discussion on the differences between a linear variant of VCCA and linear CCA, along with a quantitative comparison. While variational inference may not be practical in the linear case, such an analysis could provide a deeper understanding of the distinctions.
The derivations in Equation 3 and Equation 13 appear overly detailed, given that VCCA and VCCA-private are specific instances of VAEs with particular architectural constraints. These details might be more appropriate for the Appendix.
In Section 3, the authors claim that "if we are able to generate realistic samples from the learned distribution, we can infer that we have discovered the underlying structure of the data." This statement is inaccurate, as a model that has learned nothing can still produce realistic samples (see Theis et al., 2016). This sentence should be revised or removed.
Minor:  
In the equation between Equation 8 and Equation 9, adopting the notation \( N(x; g(z, \theta), I) \) as used in Equation 6 would improve clarity.
