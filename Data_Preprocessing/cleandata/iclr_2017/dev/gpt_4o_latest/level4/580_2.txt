Review - Summary:  
The authors introduce an input-switched affine network (ISAN) for character-level language modeling. This architecture can be viewed as a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that forgoes pointwise nonlinearity, instead switching the transition matrix and bias based on the input character. The motivation behind this approach is to enhance interpretability, as it enables the decomposition of output contributions into the terms \(\kappa_s^t\), allowing the use of fundamental linear algebra techniques to analyze the network.
As a reviewer, I believe I have a solid understanding of the paper's core ideas and arguments, though I am not a specialist in RNN-based language modeling or the broader topic of interpretability in machine learning. I have not encountered prior work with a similar premise; the closest related work I am familiar with would be deconvolutional networks (deconvnets) used for interpretability in vision-based convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
Strengths:  
- This work is both original and novel. The ideas presented are of high quality, the paper is well-written, and it is evident that significant effort went into the research.  
- I found Section 4.5, which discusses the projection into the readout subspace versus the "computational" subspace, to be particularly interesting and meaningful.
Weaknesses:  
1. My primary concern is that the results, both for the ISAN model itself and the subsequent analysis, are not entirely convincing:  
   - (1a) The ISAN model is only evaluated on a small-scale task (text8), leaving it unclear whether it would perform well as a character-level language model on larger-scale datasets.  
   - (1b) Additionally, the proposed ISAN architecture seems inherently limited to small-vocabulary tasks (e.g., character-based language modeling) and does not appear suitable for general RNN tasks involving large-vocabulary discrete inputs or continuous inputs.  
2. Regarding the analysis:  
   - (2a) While the paper presents a variety of interesting plots and creative ideas for quantities to examine, the insights derived from these analyses are somewhat limited.  
   - (2b) It is unclear which aspects of the analysis are specific to the ISAN model and which might generalize to more conventional nonlinear RNNs.  
   - (2c) In Sections 4.2â€“4.3, the interpretability of the key quantity \(\kappas^t\), which underpins much of the analysis, seems questionable. For instance, in Figure 2, the influence of the '' character on the logit of 'e' in the word "revenue" appears to lack meaningful interpretation. This suggests that the switching matrices (e.g., \(Wu\), \(Wn\), \(We\)) are leveraging the prior state in an interesting way to predict the subsequent 'e', but the metric \(\kappas^t\) itself does not seem particularly insightful. This critique ties into the final paragraph of Section 4.2.
Recommendation:  
Despite the longer list of weaknesses compared to strengths, I recommend accepting this paper. The originality of the work inherently makes it more susceptible to critique, but the paper is well-motivated, rigorously executed, and has the potential to inspire further research in this area.
