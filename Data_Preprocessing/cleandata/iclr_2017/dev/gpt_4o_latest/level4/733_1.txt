This paper introduces an anomaly-based host intrusion detection approach. It employs LSTM RNN to model system-call sequences, using the averaged sequence likelihood to identify anomalies, which correspond to attacks. Additionally, the paper evaluates an ensemble method against two baseline classification models.
+ The paper is well-written, and most of the ideas are clearly articulated.  
+ It showcases an intriguing application of LSTM sequential modeling to the HIDS problem.  
- The overall novelty is somewhat limited, as the primary technical components, such as LSTM RNN and the ensemble method, are already well-established.  
- The proposed ensemble method's contribution requires further assessment, as ensemble techniques could also be applied to the kNN and kMC baselines.
