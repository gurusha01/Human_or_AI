The manuscript extends a recent mean-field approximation framework for deep random neural networks to investigate depth-dependent information propagation, its phase behavior, and the effects of dropout. The writing is exceptionally clear, the mathematical analysis is rigorous, and the numerical experiments effectively support the theoretical findings. In summary, this work is a standout contribution, offering one of the most comprehensive analyses of training dynamics and performance in deep neural networks.
