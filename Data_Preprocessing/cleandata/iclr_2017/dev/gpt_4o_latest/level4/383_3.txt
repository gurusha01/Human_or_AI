The authors apply Q-learning to train deep architectures on a few small vision tasks, achieving strong results, including state-of-the-art performance when restricted to specific layer types, and competitive outcomes compared to broader approaches. However, it would be valuable to assess how this method performs with more complex architectures. The paper would be significantly more compelling if evaluated on a large-scale dataset like ImageNet.
