This paper tackles the challenge of achieving differential privacy in a broad setting where a group of teachers is trained on non-overlapping subsets of sensitive data, and the student makes predictions using public data labeled by the teachers through a noisy voting mechanism. I found the proposed approach to be both credible and well-articulated by the authors. It would be beneficial to include further discussion on the bound (and its tightness) presented in Theorem 1. The authors effectively repurpose the straightforward idea of adding perturbation noise to the counts, a concept well-established in the differential privacy literature, and apply it in a significantly broader (non-convex) and more practical context compared to many prior works in differential privacy and related fields. The method's general applicability, clear advancements over existing techniques, and the lucid presentation make it a strong candidate for publication.
