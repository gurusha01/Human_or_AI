Review
The paper investigates the inductive bias of convolutional networks, particularly focusing on their ability to model correlations among input regions. The authors introduce the concept of separation rank to formalize correlations and analyze how the architecture of convolutional arithmetic circuits (CACs) influences their inductive bias. The paper's main contributions include theoretical results showing that deep networks can achieve exponentially high separation ranks for certain input partitions, while shallow networks are limited to linear separation ranks. The authors also demonstrate that pooling geometry plays a critical role in controlling inductive bias, allowing networks to be tailored to specific data types. Empirical validation is provided through experiments on synthetic tasks, demonstrating the practical implications of the theoretical findings.
Decision: Accept
Key Reasons:
1. Novelty and Insight: The paper provides a novel theoretical framework for understanding the inductive bias of convolutional networks through separation rank. It offers new insights into the role of depth and pooling geometry in modeling correlations, which are critical for tasks involving structured data.
2. Theoretical Rigor and Empirical Validation: The theoretical claims are well-supported by rigorous proofs and are complemented by experiments that validate the practical utility of the findings.
Supporting Arguments:
1. Theoretical Contributions: The paper extends the understanding of depth efficiency by connecting it to the ability of networks to model correlations. The introduction of separation rank as a measure of correlation is a significant contribution, and the results on the dependence of separation rank on pooling geometry are both novel and impactful.
2. Empirical Relevance: The experiments on synthetic tasks, such as classifying closedness and symmetry, demonstrate how pooling geometry can be tailored to specific tasks. The results align well with the theoretical predictions, strengthening the paper's claims.
3. Clarity and Organization: The paper is well-organized, with clear definitions, proofs, and explanations. The authors provide sufficient background on tensor analysis, making the work accessible to readers familiar with the field.
Additional Feedback:
1. Broader Applicability: While the paper focuses on convolutional arithmetic circuits, it would be valuable to extend the analysis to more commonly used architectures, such as convolutional rectifier networks, in greater detail. The authors briefly mention this as future work, but a deeper exploration would strengthen the paper's impact.
2. Practical Implications: The paper could benefit from a discussion on how the findings might influence the design of real-world architectures. For example, how might practitioners use the insights about pooling geometry to improve performance on specific tasks?
3. Experimental Diversity: The synthetic dataset used in the experiments is well-designed but limited in scope. Including experiments on real-world datasets would enhance the paper's practical relevance.
Questions for the Authors:
1. How robust are the theoretical results to variations in the choice of representation functions? For instance, what happens if the representation functions are not linearly independent?
2. Can the concept of separation rank be extended to other types of neural networks, such as transformers or recurrent networks? If so, how might the analysis differ?
3. Have you considered combining multiple pooling geometries within the same network to support a broader range of correlations? If so, what challenges might arise?
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the theoretical understanding of convolutional networks and provides actionable insights for their design. While there are areas for further exploration, the work is rigorous, novel, and well-supported, warranting acceptance.
