Review of the Paper
Summary
This paper investigates the ability of reinforcement learning agents to actively interact with objects in simulated environments to infer hidden physical properties such as mass and cohesion. Inspired by developmental psychology, the authors propose two tasks—"Which is Heavier" and "Towers"—to evaluate agents' ability to perform experiments and make predictions about object properties. The work demonstrates that agents can learn effective experimentation strategies to balance the cost of information gathering with the cost of making errors. The authors also show that learned policies outperform randomized baselines in terms of accuracy and efficiency. While the paper does not introduce new algorithms, it provides a novel framework for studying active experimentation and physical reasoning in AI.
Decision: Accept  
The paper addresses a significant and underexplored problem in AI: enabling agents to actively interact with their environment to infer hidden properties. The work is well-motivated, grounded in relevant literature, and demonstrates scientifically rigorous results. While it does not propose new algorithms, the novelty lies in the design of the tasks and the insights into learned experimentation strategies. The paper is likely to be of interest to the AI community, particularly those working on reinforcement learning, embodied AI, and physical reasoning.
Supporting Arguments
1. Novelty and Contribution: The paper introduces a novel framework for studying active experimentation in AI, inspired by developmental psychology. The tasks are well-designed to isolate the need for interaction to infer hidden properties, which is a meaningful contribution to the field.
2. Scientific Rigor: The experiments are thorough, and the results are systematically analyzed. The authors demonstrate that agents adapt their strategies based on task difficulty and instance-level challenges, providing strong evidence for the claims made.
3. Relevance and Usefulness: The work addresses a critical gap in AI research—how agents can develop an intuitive understanding of physical properties through interaction. This has practical implications for robotics and embodied AI systems.
4. Comparison to Baselines: The comparison with randomized interaction policies convincingly shows the superiority of the learned policies, adding credibility to the results.
Additional Feedback
1. Clarity: While the paper is generally well-written, the introduction could benefit from a more concise summary of the contributions. The current version is somewhat verbose and could be streamlined to emphasize the novelty of the task design.
2. Limitations: The paper does not explicitly discuss its limitations. For instance, the reliance on simulated environments may limit the applicability of the findings to real-world scenarios. Acknowledging this and discussing potential extensions to real-world settings would strengthen the paper.
3. Data Efficiency: The authors note that they have not optimized for data efficiency. While this is not a major drawback, discussing how the approach could be made more sample-efficient would be valuable for future work.
4. Theory Building and Transfer: The paper raises the intriguing possibility of agents leveraging learned knowledge to solve new tasks. While this is mentioned as future work, providing preliminary insights or experiments in this direction would significantly enhance the impact of the paper.
Questions for the Authors
1. How well do the learned policies generalize to unseen variations of the tasks or environments? For example, would the agents perform well if the visual appearance of the objects were changed?
2. Have you considered extending the approach to real-world robotics, where physical interactions are noisier and more complex? If so, what challenges do you anticipate?
3. Could the framework be adapted to study more complex physical reasoning tasks, such as inferring material properties (e.g., elasticity or viscosity)?
4. How sensitive are the results to the choice of reinforcement learning algorithm? Would alternative methods (e.g., model-based RL) yield similar or better results?
Conclusion
This paper makes a meaningful contribution to the study of active experimentation and physical reasoning in AI. By designing tasks that require interaction to infer hidden properties, the authors provide a valuable framework for future research. While there are areas for improvement, such as addressing real-world applicability and data efficiency, the strengths of the paper outweigh its limitations. I recommend acceptance.
