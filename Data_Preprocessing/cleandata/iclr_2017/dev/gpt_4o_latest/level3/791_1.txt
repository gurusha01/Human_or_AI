Review of the Paper
Summary of Contributions
This paper proposes a novel unsupervised training objective, termed Spatial Contrasting (SC), for convolutional neural networks (ConvNets). The method leverages the inherent spatial coherence of features within an image to encourage feature representations of patches from the same image to be closer in embedding space than those from different images. The SC loss is differentiable and integrates seamlessly with standard ConvNet architectures and training pipelines. The authors demonstrate the utility of SC as a pretraining method for supervised tasks, achieving competitive performance on datasets such as STL10, CIFAR-10, and MNIST. Notably, the method achieves state-of-the-art results on STL10 and shows significant improvements in scenarios with limited labeled data. The paper also highlights the computational efficiency and flexibility of SC, as it can be applied at multiple layers of the network.
Decision: Reject
While the paper presents a reasonable and promising unsupervised objective, the decision to reject is based on two primary concerns: (1) the lack of rigorous and fair comparisons with prior work, and (2) the limited novelty of the proposed method, which bears strong similarities to existing approaches like exemplar networks and data augmentation techniques.
Supporting Arguments for Decision
1. Strengths:
   - The proposed SC objective is conceptually sound and effectively exploits translation invariance in high-level features, a key property of ConvNets.
   - The method demonstrates practical utility as a pretraining technique, particularly for datasets with abundant unlabeled data (e.g., STL10), and achieves competitive performance on benchmarks.
   - The approach is computationally efficient and does not require architectural modifications, making it broadly applicable.
2. Weaknesses:
   - Similarity to Prior Work: The SC method is closely related to exemplar networks (Dosovitskiy et al., 2015) and other contrastive learning approaches. While the paper positions SC as distinct, the differences appear incremental rather than fundamental.
   - Misleading Comparisons: The experimental results compare SC with prior methods under different fine-tuning and supervision settings, making it difficult to assess the true effectiveness of SC. For example, the comparison with exemplar networks does not account for the fact that exemplar networks were evaluated without fine-tuning, whereas SC benefits from supervised fine-tuning.
   - Missing Baselines: The paper fails to include head-to-head comparisons with closely related methods, such as exemplar networks and "What-Where" autoencoders, in large-scale settings. This omission weakens the empirical claims of superiority.
   - Applicability Limitation: The method relies on the assumption that patches from the same image share semantic similarities, which limits its applicability to natural images and may not generalize well to other data modalities (e.g., text or audio).
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Fair Comparisons: Include direct, head-to-head comparisons with exemplar networks, "What-Where" autoencoders, and other relevant baselines under identical fine-tuning and supervision conditions. This will provide a clearer picture of SC's relative performance.
2. Clarify Novelty: Emphasize the unique contributions of SC compared to prior work. For example, if SC's strength lies in computational efficiency or flexibility, this should be explicitly demonstrated and quantified.
3. Broader Applicability: Explore the applicability of SC to non-natural image datasets or other modalities to strengthen the claim of generalizability.
4. Ablation Studies: Conduct ablation studies to isolate the contributions of different components of SC (e.g., patch size, sampling strategy) and provide insights into why the method works.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does SC compare to exemplar networks and "What-Where" autoencoders when evaluated under identical fine-tuning and supervision settings?
2. Can SC be applied effectively to non-natural image datasets, such as medical imaging or satellite imagery, where the assumption of spatial coherence may not hold?
3. How sensitive is the method to the choice of patch size and sampling strategy? Would larger or smaller patches significantly affect performance?
In conclusion, while the paper has merit and demonstrates promising results, the lack of rigorous comparisons and limited novelty prevent it from meeting the standards for acceptance at this time. Addressing the outlined weaknesses would significantly strengthen the paper.
