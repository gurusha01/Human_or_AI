Review
Summary of Contributions
This paper provides a comprehensive mathematical analysis of information propagation in deep feed-forward neural networks using mean field theory. It identifies depth scales that govern the propagation of signals and gradients, offering insights into the vanishing and exploding gradient problem. The authors demonstrate that networks are trainable only when information can propagate through them, and they establish a connection between trainability and the "edge of chaos" critical point. Additionally, the paper extends the analysis to include the dropout algorithm, showing that even small amounts of dropout disrupt the critical point and limit trainable depth. The theoretical findings are validated with experiments on MNIST and CIFAR10, confirming that trainability is constrained by the identified depth scales. The paper is well-written, with clear explanations, rigorous mathematical derivations, and experimental results that align with the proposed model.
Decision: Accept
The paper makes significant theoretical and practical contributions to understanding the dynamics of deep neural networks. Its insights into the relationship between depth scales, trainability, and dropout are novel and impactful. The clarity of presentation and alignment of experimental results with theoretical claims further strengthen its merit. 
Supporting Arguments
1. Problem Tackled: The paper addresses the fundamental problem of understanding how information propagates in deep neural networks, particularly in the context of vanishing and exploding gradients. This is a critical issue in training deep networks and has implications for architecture design and hyperparameter selection.
   
2. Motivation and Placement in Literature: The work builds on prior research (e.g., Poole et al., 2016; Raghu et al., 2016) and extends it by introducing depth scales and analyzing the impact of dropout. The connection to the "edge of chaos" and the formalization of trainability constraints are well-motivated and fill a gap in the literature.
3. Scientific Rigor: The mathematical derivations are thorough and grounded in mean field theory. The experimental results are robust, demonstrating consistency across datasets, training conditions, and hyperparameter settings. The alignment between theory and empirical findings is strong.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Clarity on Practical Implications: While the theoretical contributions are clear, the paper could provide more actionable guidance for practitioners. For example, how can the identified depth scales be used to design architectures or select hyperparameters in real-world scenarios?
2. Dropout Analysis: The paper shows that dropout disrupts the critical point, but it would be helpful to discuss whether alternative regularization techniques (e.g., batch normalization) might mitigate this issue.
3. Extension to Other Architectures: The analysis focuses on fully connected feed-forward networks. It would be valuable to discuss how the framework might generalize to convolutional or recurrent architectures, which are more commonly used in practice.
4. Empirical Depth Scale Threshold: The paper observes that networks are trainable when depth is less than approximately six times the depth scale (6Î¾c). A deeper discussion or theoretical justification for this threshold would strengthen the argument.
Questions for the Authors
1. How sensitive are the depth scales to changes in activation functions or loss functions beyond those tested in the paper?
2. Can the proposed framework be extended to networks with unbounded activations (e.g., ReLU)? If not, what modifications would be required?
3. The experiments suggest that networks closer to criticality train faster. Could this be quantified more explicitly, and does it hold across optimizers and datasets?
4. How does the framework account for structured weight matrices (e.g., in convolutional networks), and are there plans to extend the analysis in this direction?
In conclusion, this paper provides a rigorous and insightful contribution to the theoretical understanding of deep neural networks. Its findings have the potential to inform both research and practice, and with minor clarifications and extensions, it could have an even broader impact.
