Review
Summary of Contributions
The paper presents a novel approach to structure discovery in undirected graphical models by framing the problem as a supervised classification task. Specifically, it uses empirical covariance matrices as input and predicts binary link decisions as output. The authors propose a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based architecture, termed DeepGraph, to learn this mapping. The method is trained on synthetic data and evaluated on both synthetic and real-world datasets, including genetics and neuroimaging data. The key contribution lies in demonstrating that training on synthetic data can generalize effectively to unseen real-world data, outperforming traditional non-learning-based methods like graphical lasso in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency. The authors also highlight the practical relevance of their method, particularly in scenarios with high-dimensional data and limited samples.
Decision: Accept
The paper provides a solid contribution to the field of graphical model structure estimation, with strong empirical results and practical relevance. The decision to accept is based on the following key reasons:
1. Empirical Performance: The proposed method consistently outperforms baseline methods, including graphical lasso and MCMC-based approaches, across a variety of datasets and evaluation metrics, particularly in challenging high-dimensional, low-sample regimes.
2. Practical Impact: The method is computationally efficient, scalable, and applicable to real-world problems in genetics and neuroimaging, making it highly relevant for practitioners.
Supporting Arguments
1. Well-Motivated Approach: The paper is well-placed in the literature, addressing limitations of existing methods like graphical lasso, which require manual regularization and are computationally expensive. The use of supervised learning to directly optimize edge recovery is a compelling alternative.
2. Clarity and Rigor: The theoretical claims are clearly stated, and the experimental results are scientifically rigorous. The method's generalization to unseen data is convincingly demonstrated through extensive experiments.
3. Practical Relevance: The ability to train on synthetic data and generalize to real-world datasets is a significant strength, as it reduces the dependency on labeled real-world data, which is often scarce.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Technical Novelty: While the approach is effective, it lacks significant technical novelty. The use of CNNs for this task is interesting but not groundbreaking, and the method does not address invariance to data permutation explicitly. Future work could explore architectures that are inherently permutation-invariant to improve robustness.
2. Interpretability: The authors acknowledge that the method may face challenges with interpretability for practitioners. Providing more insights into how the learned model makes decisions (e.g., feature importance or visualization of learned filters) would enhance its usability.
3. Broader Applicability: The method is currently tailored to Gaussian graphical models. Extending it to other types of graphical models or distributions would broaden its impact.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the method handle cases where the training and test data distributions differ significantly (e.g., non-Gaussian data)?
2. Could the authors elaborate on the sensitivity of the method to the choice of synthetic training data? For example, how critical is the sparsity level or graph structure in the training data?
3. Have the authors considered alternative architectures, such as graph neural networks, that might better capture the relational structure of the input data?
Conclusion
This paper represents a strong first step in leveraging supervised learning for structure discovery in graphical models. While the technical novelty is modest, the practical relevance and empirical performance of the method justify its acceptance. With further development, particularly in addressing interpretability and robustness to data permutations, this approach has the potential to significantly advance the field.
