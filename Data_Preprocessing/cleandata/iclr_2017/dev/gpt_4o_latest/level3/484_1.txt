Review of the Paper
Summary of Contributions
This paper investigates the inductive biases of convolutional networks, particularly focusing on how pooling geometry influences their ability to model correlations between input regions. The authors introduce the concept of separation rank as a measure of correlation strength and demonstrate that deep networks can achieve exponentially high separation ranks for certain input partitions, while shallow networks are limited to linear separation ranks. The study is centered on convolutional arithmetic circuits, but the insights are empirically validated on convolutional rectifier networks as well. The authors also show that pooling geometry can be tailored to align with the statistical properties of specific data types, providing a mechanism to control inductive bias. This work contributes to the theoretical understanding of why deep networks perform well and offers practical insights into designing pooling schemes for diverse tasks.
Decision: Accept
The paper is a strong candidate for acceptance due to its significant theoretical contributions, well-motivated problem, and rigorous empirical validation. The key reasons for this decision are:
1. Novelty and Depth of Analysis: The paper provides a novel perspective on inductive bias through the lens of separation rank and establishes a clear connection between pooling geometry and the network's ability to model correlations.
2. Impact on the Field: The insights into tailoring pooling geometry for specific tasks have practical implications for improving network design, particularly in domains where data deviates from natural image statistics.
Supporting Arguments
1. Well-Motivated Approach: The paper builds on prior work that highlights the superiority of deep networks but extends the analysis to scenarios without activation functions and with multiplicative pooling. This exploration fills a gap in the literature and is well-placed within the broader context of understanding depth efficiency and inductive bias.
2. Theoretical Rigor: The use of separation rank as a formal measure of correlation strength is compelling, and the derivation of upper and lower bounds for deep and shallow networks is mathematically rigorous. The connection to tensor decompositions adds depth to the theoretical framework.
3. Empirical Validation: The experiments are thoughtfully designed to validate the theoretical claims. The use of synthetic tasks with controllable properties (e.g., closedness and symmetry) effectively demonstrates how pooling geometry influences network performance.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Accessibility of Notations and Definitions: While the authors carefully define their mathematical framework, some definitions (e.g., separation rank and its relation to L2 distance) could be further elaborated for accessibility to a broader audience. Including more intuitive explanations or visualizations would enhance readability.
2. Discussion of Limitations: The paper could benefit from a more explicit discussion of its limitations, such as the focus on convolutional arithmetic circuits and the potential challenges in generalizing the findings to other architectures or real-world datasets.
3. Future Directions: While the authors briefly mention blending multiple pooling geometries, a more detailed exploration of this idea, including potential challenges and trade-offs, would strengthen the paper's practical relevance.
Questions for the Authors
1. How sensitive are the empirical results to the choice of representation functions (e.g., orthonormality vs. linear independence)?
2. Can the concept of separation rank be extended to other architectures, such as transformers or graph neural networks? If so, how might the analysis differ?
3. Have you considered the computational trade-offs of implementing non-standard pooling geometries in large-scale networks?
In conclusion, this paper makes a valuable contribution to the theoretical understanding of convolutional networks and provides actionable insights for improving network design. With minor revisions to improve clarity and accessibility, it will be a strong addition to the conference.
