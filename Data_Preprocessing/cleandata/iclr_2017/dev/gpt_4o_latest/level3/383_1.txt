Review of "MetaQNN: Reinforcement Learning for Neural Architecture Design"
This paper introduces MetaQNN, a reinforcement learning (RL) framework for automating the design of convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures. The authors propose a Q-learning-based agent that sequentially selects layer types and parameters to construct CNNs. By discretizing the design space and employing techniques such as experience replay and an ε-greedy exploration strategy, the agent efficiently discovers high-performing architectures. The method is validated on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and SVHN datasets, where the generated architectures outperform existing automated methods and are competitive with state-of-the-art handcrafted designs.
Decision: Accept
Key reasons for acceptance:
1. Novelty and Impact: The paper presents a novel approach to automating neural architecture design using reinforcement learning, which is a significant step forward in reducing human intervention in deep learning model development.
2. Empirical Validation: The proposed method demonstrates strong performance on standard benchmarks (MNIST, CIFAR-10, SVHN), outperforming prior automated methods and achieving competitive results against handcrafted architectures.
Supporting Arguments:
1. Problem and Motivation: The paper addresses a critical bottleneck in deep learning—manual neural architecture design—which is both time-consuming and reliant on expert intuition. The motivation is well-placed in the literature, with clear comparisons to prior work in automated architecture search (e.g., genetic algorithms, Bayesian optimization).
2. Methodological Rigor: The use of Q-learning, ε-greedy exploration, and experience replay is well-justified and effectively adapted to the problem of architecture search. The authors also detail the constraints imposed on the state-action space to ensure tractability, which is a thoughtful design choice.
3. Results and Claims: The empirical results are convincing. The MetaQNN-generated architectures outperform previous automated methods and match or exceed the performance of handcrafted networks using standard layer types. The paper also demonstrates the transferability of the discovered architectures to other datasets, which is a valuable contribution.
Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Scalability: While the authors acknowledge the limitations of the discretized state-action space, it remains unclear how well the method scales to larger design spaces or more complex tasks. Future work could explore continuous state-action spaces or more sophisticated Q-function approximations to address this limitation.
2. Design Flexibility: The reliance on predefined layer types and parameter bins reduces the flexibility of the approach. Incorporating more diverse layer types or allowing finer-grained parameter choices could improve the generality of the method.
3. Computational Cost: The experiments required significant computational resources (10 GPUs for 8-10 days per dataset). A discussion on how to reduce the computational overhead, perhaps through parallelization or more efficient exploration strategies, would be beneficial.
Questions for the Authors:
1. How does the performance of MetaQNN compare to other neural architecture search methods (e.g., NASNet or DARTS) on more recent benchmarks or larger datasets?
2. Could the method be extended to include more complex layer types (e.g., residual connections, attention mechanisms) without significantly increasing the state-action space?
3. How sensitive is the approach to the choice of hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, discount factor) during Q-learning?
In conclusion, this paper presents a novel and impactful contribution to automated neural architecture design. Despite some limitations in scalability and flexibility, the proposed method is a significant step forward and merits publication.
