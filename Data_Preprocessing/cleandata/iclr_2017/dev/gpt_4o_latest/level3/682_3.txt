Review of the Paper
Summary of Contributions
This paper introduces a novel approach to Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) by leveraging leaky ReLU activation functions for hidden units, which results in several theoretical and practical advancements. The authors propose a new energy function for leaky RBM, demonstrating that the model divides the input space into regions, each represented as a truncated Gaussian distribution. A novel sampling scheme is introduced, which anneals the leakiness parameter, enabling faster mixing and shorter Markov chains. This method significantly improves partition function estimation, outperforming Annealed Importance Sampling (AIS) in low-dimensional settings. Empirical evaluations on CIFAR-10 and SVHN datasets show that leaky RBMs achieve better log-likelihood performance compared to Bernoulli-Gaussian RBMs. The paper also provides strong theoretical contributions, including energy formulation, sampling mechanisms, and improvements to AIS. However, the work is limited in experimental scope, lacking binary RBM datasets and a Persistent Contrastive Divergence (PCD) baseline. Additionally, the computational cost of the projection step to ensure a bounded energy function is a drawback.
Decision: Reject
While the paper presents novel and theoretically sound contributions, it falls short in experimental validation and practical relevance. The limited experimental scope and the performance gap compared to modern generative models weaken its impact. The computational cost of the projection step further detracts from its practicality.
Supporting Arguments
1. Strengths:
   - Novelty: The introduction of leaky ReLU RBMs and the annealing-based sampling scheme is innovative and well-motivated.
   - Theoretical Contributions: The paper provides a rigorous theoretical foundation, including the energy formulation and partition function estimation improvements.
   - Improved Sampling: The proposed sampling method outperforms AIS in low-dimensional settings, which is a notable advancement.
2. Weaknesses:
   - Experimental Scope: The paper does not evaluate leaky RBMs on binary RBM datasets or compare against a PCD baseline, which are standard benchmarks in the field.
   - Performance Gap: The performance on CIFAR-10 and SVHN lags behind state-of-the-art generative models, limiting the practical impact of the proposed method.
   - Computational Cost: The projection step to ensure a bounded energy function is computationally expensive, making the approach less scalable.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Expand Experimental Scope: Evaluate the model on binary RBM datasets and include comparisons with a PCD baseline to provide a more comprehensive evaluation.
2. Address Computational Cost: Explore methods to reduce the computational overhead of the projection step, such as approximate or alternative formulations.
3. Benchmark Against Modern Models: Compare the performance of leaky RBMs with state-of-the-art generative models to better position the contributions within the broader literature.
4. Clarify Practical Implications: Provide a more detailed discussion on the practical trade-offs of using leaky RBMs, particularly in terms of computational cost and scalability.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the proposed method perform on binary RBM datasets, and why were these experiments omitted?
2. Can the computational cost of the projection step be reduced without compromising the validity of the energy function?
3. How does the annealing-based sampling scheme scale to higher-dimensional datasets or more complex models?
4. Could the proposed method be extended to multi-layer architectures, and if so, how would it compare to deep generative models like VAEs or GANs?
In summary, while the paper makes significant theoretical contributions, its practical impact is limited by the experimental scope, computational cost, and performance gap. Addressing these issues could substantially strengthen the work.
