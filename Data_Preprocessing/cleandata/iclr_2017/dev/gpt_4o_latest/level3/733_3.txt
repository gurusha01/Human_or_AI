The paper presents a novel approach to anomaly detection in host-based intrusion detection systems (HIDS) by modeling system call sequences as a language and leveraging LSTM-based language models. The proposed method ensembles multiple LSTM-RNN models, trained with diverse hyperparameters, to improve detection accuracy. A key strength of the approach is its ability to detect anomalies without requiring attack data during training, addressing the challenge of zero-day attacks. The ensemble method, which averages transformations of likelihoods from individual LSTM models, is particularly effective in reducing false alarm rates, a common issue in anomaly-based IDS. The authors validate their approach on benchmark datasets, demonstrating competitive performance and strong portability across different systems.
Decision: Accept
The paper is well-executed and makes significant contributions to the field of intrusion detection. The key reasons for acceptance are:
1. Novelty and Practical Relevance: The use of LSTM-based language models for system call sequences is innovative and addresses a critical challenge in anomaly-based IDSâ€”detecting zero-day attacks without attack data.
2. Empirical Rigor: The results are robust, with strong performance on multiple datasets and a clear demonstration of the ensemble method's effectiveness in reducing false alarms.
Supporting Arguments:
1. Well-Motivated Approach: The paper is grounded in the literature, clearly identifying limitations in existing methods (e.g., reliance on labeled attack data or handcrafted features). The use of language modeling to capture semantic and contextual information in system calls is a compelling extension of deep learning techniques to IDS.
2. Strong Empirical Results: The proposed method achieves competitive false alarm rates and detection rates, outperforming traditional methods like HMM and STIDE. The portability evaluation further strengthens the practical applicability of the approach.
3. Innovative Ensemble Method: The ensemble approach is simple yet effective, leveraging diverse LSTM models to improve robustness without requiring attack data for parameter tuning.
Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Introduction Section: The introduction could benefit from a broader discussion of related work on anomaly detection using RNNs in other domains (e.g., fraud detection, medical anomaly detection). This would better contextualize the novelty of applying language modeling to IDS.
2. Vulnerability to Mimicry Attacks: The paper acknowledges the potential vulnerability to mimicry attacks but does not provide experimental evidence or mitigation strategies. A brief analysis or discussion on handling such attacks would strengthen the paper.
3. Visualization of Anomalies: While the visualization of learned representations is insightful, the inability to cluster attack sequences highlights a limitation. Future work could explore methods to better separate different types of anomalies in the embedding space.
Questions for the Authors:
1. How does the proposed method handle mimicry attacks where malicious calls are interleaved with normal ones? Could the likelihood thresholding mechanism be adapted to detect such patterns?
2. The ensemble method uses fixed weights and biases. Would a learned weighting scheme (e.g., based on validation performance) further improve results?
3. Could the proposed method be extended to detect anomalies in real-time, given the sequential nature of system calls?
Overall, the paper makes a strong contribution to the field of intrusion detection and is recommended for acceptance with minor revisions.
