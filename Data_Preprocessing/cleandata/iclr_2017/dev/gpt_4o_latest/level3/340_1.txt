The paper presents a novel approach to unsupervised domain transfer using a Domain Transfer Network (DTN) based on GANs, addressing the challenge of mapping samples between two domains without aligned training pairs. The proposed method introduces an encoder-decoder architecture that leverages a shared feature space and employs a compound loss function to ensure meaningful transformations. Notably, the inclusion of feature- and pixel-level losses prevents trivial solutions, while the GAN loss ensures that generated samples align with the target domain distribution. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of DTN in tasks such as SVHN-to-MNIST digit transfer and photo-to-emoji transformation, showcasing visually compelling results that preserve key image characteristics.
Decision: Accept
The primary reasons for acceptance are the novelty and rigor of the proposed approach, as well as its demonstrated efficacy in unsupervised domain transfer tasks. The method is well-motivated within the context of existing literature, addressing a gap in unsupervised analogy synthesis. The experimental results convincingly support the claims, and the ablation studies provide valuable insights into the contributions of individual components. The paper also opens avenues for broader applications, making it a significant contribution to the field.
Supporting Arguments:
1. Novelty and Motivation: The paper tackles a well-defined problem of unsupervised domain transfer, which is both ecologically relevant and underexplored. The use of GANs combined with additional loss terms to enforce feature and pixel consistency is innovative and well-grounded in prior work.
2. Experimental Validation: Extensive experiments on diverse domains (digits and faces) demonstrate the robustness of the approach. The results are visually compelling, and the ablation studies highlight the importance of each component in achieving the desired outcomes.
3. Broader Impact: The method has potential applications beyond the presented tasks, such as text-to-image synthesis or other cross-domain transformations, making it a versatile tool for future research.
Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Broader Domain Experiments: While the results on SVHN-to-MNIST and photo-to-emoji tasks are impressive, demonstrating the method's applicability to other domains, such as text-to-image or more complex visual transformations, would significantly enhance the paper's impact.
2. Analysis of Facial Attributes: A more detailed analysis of how well facial attributes (e.g., expressions, pose, or accessories) are preserved during photo-to-emoji transfer would provide deeper insights into the method's capabilities.
3. Reverse Domain Transfer: The paper briefly mentions reverse domain transfer (e.g., emoji-to-photo), but the results are less compelling. Further exploration or explanation of the limitations in this direction would strengthen the discussion.
Questions for the Authors:
1. How sensitive is the method to the choice of the perceptual function \( f \)? Would using a different pre-trained network significantly affect the results?
2. Can the proposed method handle more complex domains with higher variability, such as natural scenes or multi-object images?
3. How does the model perform in low-resource scenarios where the target domain has very few samples?
In conclusion, this paper makes a strong contribution to the field of unsupervised domain transfer, and with minor enhancements, it could have an even broader impact.
