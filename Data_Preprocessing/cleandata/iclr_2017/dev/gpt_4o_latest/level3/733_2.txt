The paper proposes a system-call language modeling approach using LSTMs for anomaly-based host intrusion detection systems (HIDS). It claims to address high false-alarm rates in conventional methods by introducing an ensemble method that combines multiple thresholding classifiers. The authors argue that their approach captures the semantic meaning and interactions of system calls, which traditional methods fail to do effectively. The paper demonstrates the system's performance on benchmark datasets, highlights its portability across different systems, and claims to reduce training overhead compared to alternative methods.
Decision: Reject
Key Reasons for Rejection:
1. Lack of Novelty: The use of LSTMs for network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) is not novel and has been explored in prior work (e.g., Creech & Hu, 2014; Staudemeyer & Omlin, 2013). While the authors emphasize the use of raw sequences instead of N-gram counts, this preprocessing step does not represent a significant advancement over existing methods.
2. Limited Contribution to Representation Learning: The paper does not provide substantial new insights into representation learning, which is a core focus of this conference. Its contributions are more aligned with the security domain, making it better suited for a security-focused venue.
Supporting Arguments:
- The experimental results show that the proposed system performs comparably to existing methods, with a slight improvement in false-alarm rates. However, the improvements are incremental rather than groundbreaking.
- While the ensemble method is an interesting addition, it is not sufficiently novel or impactful to justify acceptance at a representation learning conference.
- The portability of the system is a positive aspect, but it is not explored in depth or tied to significant advancements in representation learning.
Additional Feedback:
1. Positioning in Literature: The paper should better contextualize its contributions relative to prior work. For example, it could explicitly compare its results with those of Creech & Hu (2014) and Staudemeyer & Omlin (2013) in terms of both performance and novelty.
2. Evaluation Metrics: While the ROC curves and AUC values are informative, the paper could benefit from additional metrics or ablation studies to isolate the impact of the ensemble method.
3. Portability Analysis: The portability claim is intriguing but underexplored. The authors could provide more detailed experiments or insights into why the model generalizes well across systems.
4. Relevance to Representation Learning: The paper should explicitly discuss how its approach advances representation learning, particularly in the context of system-call sequences.
Questions for the Authors:
1. How does the proposed system compare to prior LSTM-based methods in terms of computational efficiency and scalability?
2. Can the ensemble method be generalized to other types of anomaly detection tasks, or is it specific to system-call sequences?
3. What is the significance of using raw sequences instead of N-gram counts, and how does this impact the model's ability to learn meaningful representations?
While the paper demonstrates solid engineering and experimental results, its contributions are incremental and lack the novelty required for acceptance at this conference. The authors are encouraged to refine their focus and consider submitting to a security-focused venue.
