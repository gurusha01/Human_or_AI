Review of the Paper
Summary of Contributions
The paper proposes an anomaly-based host intrusion detection system (HIDS) using an LSTM-based language model to model system-call sequences. It introduces a novel ensemble method to reduce false alarm rates by combining multiple thresholding classifiers. The authors claim that their approach captures both call-level and phrase-level semantics of system calls, enabling robust anomaly detection. They evaluate their method on public benchmark datasets, demonstrating competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, the paper highlights the portability of the proposed model across different datasets, suggesting its potential for transfer learning in similar systems.
Decision: Reject
While the paper is well-written and presents a clear application of LSTM sequential modeling to the HIDS problem, the decision to reject is based on two key reasons:
1. Limited Novelty: The technical components, such as LSTM RNNs and ensemble methods, are well-established in the literature. The paper does not introduce significant methodological innovations beyond applying these techniques to the HIDS domain.
2. Insufficient Evaluation of the Ensemble Method: The ensemble method's contribution is not thoroughly evaluated. The authors do not explore its applicability to the baseline kNN and kMC models, leaving its generalizability unclear.
Supporting Arguments
1. Limited Novelty: The use of LSTMs for sequence modeling is not new, and the ensemble method, while tailored for this application, is conceptually straightforward. The paper does not sufficiently differentiate its contributions from prior work, particularly in terms of methodological advancements.
2. Evaluation Gaps: The ensemble method is only applied to LSTM classifiers, and its potential to enhance the baseline models (kNN and kMC) is not explored. This omission weakens the claim that the ensemble method is a significant contribution. Additionally, while the results are promising, the lack of comparison with more recent methods in the field limits the paper's impact.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Clarify Novelty: The authors should explicitly articulate how their approach advances the state of the art in HIDS. For example, they could emphasize unique aspects of their ensemble method or demonstrate how their LSTM-based language model outperforms other deep learning approaches.
2. Broader Evaluation of the Ensemble Method: The ensemble method should be tested with the baseline models (kNN and kMC) to validate its generalizability. Additionally, comparisons with more recent HIDS methods would strengthen the evaluation.
3. Ablation Studies: Conduct ablation studies to isolate the contributions of the LSTM-based language model and the ensemble method. This would help clarify the individual impact of each component.
4. Real-World Applicability: The authors could enhance the paper by discussing the practical deployment of their system in real-world environments, including computational overhead and scalability.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the proposed ensemble method compare when applied to the baseline models (kNN and kMC)? Could it improve their performance as well?
2. Have you considered comparing your approach with more recent deep learning-based HIDS methods? If not, why?
3. Can you provide more details on the computational cost of training and deploying the proposed system in real-world scenarios?
4. How does the model handle mimicry attacks or other sophisticated intrusion techniques that may exploit normal patterns?
In conclusion, while the paper presents an interesting application of LSTM-based language modeling to HIDS, its limited novelty and incomplete evaluation of the ensemble method prevent it from making a strong contribution to the field. Addressing the above concerns could significantly enhance the paper's impact and clarity.
