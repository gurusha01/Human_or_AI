Review of "Hierarchical Multiscale Recurrent Neural Networks"
The paper introduces a novel hierarchical multiscale recurrent neural network (HM-RNN) that dynamically learns latent hierarchical structures in temporal data without explicit boundary information. The proposed model integrates a boundary detection mechanism into the RNN framework, enabling three operations—COPY, UPDATE, and FLUSH—to process sequences at varying timescales. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach through state-of-the-art results on the Text8 dataset for character-level language modeling and improved performance on handwriting sequence generation tasks. The paper also provides compelling visualizations of the learned hierarchical structures, offering interpretability and insights into the model's behavior.
Decision: Accept
The key reasons for this decision are the novelty and elegance of the proposed approach, as well as its strong empirical performance. The HM-RNN addresses a significant challenge in sequence modeling by learning hierarchical multiscale representations without requiring explicit boundary annotations, a capability that sets it apart from prior work. The results are rigorously validated across multiple benchmarks, and the paper is well-written, making the contributions clear and accessible.
Supporting Arguments:
1. Problem Significance and Novelty: The paper tackles the long-standing challenge of learning hierarchical and temporal representations in RNNs. Unlike previous multiscale RNNs, which rely on fixed or predefined timescales, the HM-RNN dynamically adapts its timescales based on data, making it more flexible and applicable to real-world scenarios with variable-length sequences.
   
2. Empirical Rigor: The model achieves state-of-the-art results on the Text8 dataset and competitive performance on Penn Treebank and Hutter Prize Wikipedia datasets. Additionally, it outperforms standard LSTMs on handwriting sequence generation, demonstrating its versatility across discrete and continuous sequence data.
3. Interpretability: The visualizations of boundary detection and hierarchical structure provide valuable insights into the model's operation, enhancing its interpretability—a notable advantage over many black-box neural models.
Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Extension to Bidirectional RNNs: The paper does not explore whether the proposed HM-RNN can be extended to bidirectional architectures. This could be a valuable direction for future work, especially for tasks requiring full-sequence context, such as machine translation or speech recognition.
2. Computational Efficiency: While the paper discusses computational savings due to the COPY operation, a more detailed analysis of runtime performance compared to standard RNNs and LSTMs would strengthen the argument for practical applicability.
3. Ablation Studies: The paper could benefit from additional ablation studies to isolate the contributions of specific components, such as the boundary detector, the slope annealing trick, and the straight-through estimator.
Questions for the Authors:
1. How does the HM-RNN handle noisy or ambiguous data where hierarchical boundaries may be less distinct? Does the model's performance degrade significantly in such cases?
   
2. Could the proposed architecture be extended to bidirectional RNNs, and if so, what challenges might arise in implementing boundary detection in both forward and backward directions?
3. The paper mentions that the FLUSH operation balances reward and penalty. Could you provide more quantitative insights into how this balance impacts the model's performance and stability during training?
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of sequence modeling and is well-suited for acceptance at the conference. With minor clarifications and additional experiments, it could further solidify its impact.
