Review
Summary of Contributions:
This paper investigates the use of physical interactions to infer hidden physical properties of objects, such as mass and cohesion, in simulated environments. Inspired by developmental psychology, the authors propose tasks where agents actively interact with objects to deduce these properties using deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The paper introduces two environments, Which is Heavier and Towers, where agents learn experimentation strategies to solve tasks that cannot be addressed through visual observation alone. The authors demonstrate that agents can balance the trade-off between information gathering and decision-making costs, and that learned policies outperform randomized baselines. While the paper does not propose new algorithms or models, it highlights the potential of DRL for active experimentation and physical reasoning.
Decision: Accept
Key Reasons:
1. Novelty of Problem Setting: The paper introduces a unique problem formulation—learning physical properties through interaction rather than observation—which is underexplored in reinforcement learning literature.
2. Experimental Rigor: The experimental setups are well-designed, and the results convincingly demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach, even if the contribution is incremental.
Supporting Arguments:
1. Research Focus: The paper addresses an important gap in AI research: the ability to infer physical properties through interaction, a skill that current AI systems lack. The connection to developmental psychology provides a compelling motivation for the work.
2. Experimental Results: The experiments are thorough, with clear evidence that agents learn effective interaction strategies. The comparison with randomized baselines strengthens the claims.
3. Potential Impact: While the contribution is incremental, the work lays the foundation for future research in active experimentation and physical reasoning, which could have implications for robotics and embodied AI.
Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Clarify Contribution: The paper lacks a clear articulation of its novel contributions relative to prior work. While the problem formulation is interesting, the connection to existing DRL tasks (e.g., bandit problems) is not sufficiently differentiated.
2. Baseline Comparison: The absence of a baseline approach for comparison limits the ability to contextualize the performance of the proposed method. Including a simple heuristic-based or classical physics-inspired baseline would strengthen the evaluation.
3. Representation Analysis: The paper misses an opportunity to analyze the learned representations. Understanding how the agent encodes physical properties (e.g., mass) could provide deeper insights into the learning process.
4. Broader Testing: The conclusions about task difficulty rely heavily on specific training distributions. Broader testing across diverse environments or distributions would make the findings more generalizable.
5. Feature vs. Pixel Observations: The claim that feature-based observations improve training efficiency should be supported with instance-level performance correlations to validate the conclusion.
6. Human Behavior Comparison: Drawing explicit parallels between the agent's learned strategies and human experimentation behaviors could strengthen the psychological inspiration of the work.
Questions for the Authors:
1. Why is physical interaction necessary for inferring object properties in these tasks? Could observational approaches (e.g., video-based learning) achieve similar results?
2. What is the reason for the difficulty in distinguishing small mass differences? Could this be a limitation of the network architecture or the training process?
3. How do the learned policies generalize to unseen environments or tasks? Have you tested transfer learning capabilities?
4. Could you provide more details on the computational efficiency of the proposed approach, especially in terms of sample complexity?
Minor Issues:
1. Figure 1: The Y-axis label is missing, which makes it difficult to interpret the data.
2. Terminology: The paper occasionally uses terms like "latent bandit problem" without sufficient explanation, which could confuse readers unfamiliar with the concept.
In conclusion, while the paper's contributions are incremental, its novel problem setting and rigorous experimental design merit acceptance. Addressing the above suggestions would significantly enhance the clarity and impact of the work.
