Review
Summary of Contributions
This paper proposes a novel generative model that transforms noise into high-quality samples through a progressive denoising process, akin to diffusion-based models but with significantly fewer steps. The key innovation lies in the "infusion training" procedure, which biases the training chain toward the target data distribution, enabling the model to learn a Markov transition operator that efficiently generates samples in a small number of steps. The approach is computationally efficient and avoids the instability issues associated with adversarial training in GANs. The paper demonstrates competitive results across multiple datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CelebA, with impressive visual sample quality and one-shot inpainting capabilities. The method is particularly notable for its ability to generate sharp and varied samples while requiring fewer denoising steps compared to prior work like Sohl-Dickstein et al. (2015).
Decision: Accept
The paper makes a meaningful contribution to the field of generative modeling by introducing a computationally efficient alternative to existing diffusion-based methods. Its novel infusion training procedure is well-motivated and empirically validated through competitive results on benchmark datasets. The impressive visual sample quality and one-shot inpainting results further underscore the practical utility of the proposed approach. However, the lack of a tractable variational bound on the log-likelihood and limited exploration of sensitivity to infusion rates are areas for improvement. Despite these limitations, the paper presents a significant advancement and warrants acceptance.
Supporting Arguments
1. Novelty and Computational Efficiency: The infusion training procedure is a creative and effective alternative to traditional diffusion-based methods, requiring fewer denoising steps while maintaining high sample quality. This makes the approach computationally attractive for real-world applications.
2. Empirical Validation: The paper provides strong empirical evidence, including competitive log-likelihood estimates, high-quality generated samples, and successful inpainting results. The visual results, particularly in Figure 4, are compelling and demonstrate the model's capability to handle diverse datasets.
3. Comparison to Prior Work: The paper situates itself well in the literature, highlighting its advantages over related methods like GANs, VAEs, and Sohl-Dickstein et al. (2015). The discussion is thorough and provides a clear understanding of the contributions.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Log-Likelihood Evaluation: While the paper uses Parzen-window-based estimates and importance sampling, a more robust evaluation method that does not rely on Parzen likelihoods would strengthen the claims.
2. Sensitivity Analysis: A deeper exploration of the sensitivity to infusion rates and the number of denoising steps would provide better insights into the model's robustness and optimal configurations.
3. Direct Comparisons: Including direct quantitative comparisons to Sohl-Dickstein et al. (2015) and other diffusion-based models would further contextualize the performance gains.
4. Clarity and Grammar: Minor textual corrections in Sections 2, 3.3, and 4 would improve readability. For example, clarifying the infusion chain's role in training and its relationship to the generative chain would enhance understanding.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the model's performance scale with the number of denoising steps during training and inference? Is there a trade-off between sample quality and computational efficiency?
2. Can the infusion training procedure be adapted to conditional generative tasks, such as text-to-image generation or structured output problems?
3. Have you considered incorporating more sophisticated neural architectures (e.g., transformers or attention mechanisms) to further improve sample quality?
In summary, this paper presents a novel and computationally efficient generative modeling approach with strong empirical results. Addressing the outlined limitations would further solidify its contributions, but the current work is already a valuable addition to the field.
