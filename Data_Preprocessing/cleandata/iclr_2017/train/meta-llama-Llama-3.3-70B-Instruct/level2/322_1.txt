This paper proposes a novel framework for automatically determining the optimal size of a neural network for a given task without prior information. The authors introduce nonparametric neural networks, a non-probabilistic framework for conducting optimization over all possible network sizes, and prove its soundness when network growth is limited via an `p penalty. They also develop a novel optimization algorithm, Adaptive Radial-Angular Gradient Descent (AdaRad), and demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments on several benchmark datasets.
The main claims of the paper are:
1. Nonparametric neural networks can automatically adapt and choose the size of a neural network during a single training run.
2. The proposed framework, including AdaRad, can improve the performance of trained networks beyond what is achieved by regular parametric networks of the same size.
3. The framework is scalable and can be applied to large datasets.
The support for these claims is provided through theoretical analysis and experimental results. The authors prove the soundness of the nonparametric neural network framework and demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments on several benchmark datasets, including MNIST, rectangles images, and convex. They also show that the framework is scalable by applying it to a large dataset, poker.
The usefulness of the ideas presented in the paper is evident, as they address a significant problem in deep learning, namely, the need for prior information to choose a good network size. The framework proposed in the paper provides a way to automatically adapt and choose the size of a neural network during a single training run, which can be beneficial in many applications.
