The paper "Instance Retrieval with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks" presents a thorough evaluation of various factors that impact the performance of image retrieval using features extracted from Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The authors identify five key factors: feature aggregation and normalization, output layer selection, image resizing, multi-scale feature representation, and PCA and whitening. They conduct extensive experiments to analyze the impact of these factors on retrieval performance and propose a new multi-scale image representation method that outperforms state-of-the-art methods on four datasets.
I decide to accept this paper with minor revisions. The paper is well-motivated, and the approach is well-placed in the literature. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the factors that impact image retrieval performance, and their experimental results are convincing. The proposed multi-scale image representation method is novel and shows significant improvements over previous methods.
The supporting arguments for my decision include the thorough evaluation of the factors that impact image retrieval performance, the convincing experimental results, and the novelty of the proposed method. The paper provides a clear and well-structured presentation of the research, making it easy to follow and understand.
To improve the paper, I suggest the authors provide more details on the network transformations and the overlap between different regions in the multi-scale representation. Additionally, it would be helpful to include more visualizations of the feature maps and the regional vectors to better understand the proposed method.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer include: How do the authors plan to extend their method to larger datasets or more complex scenarios? Can the authors provide more insights into the trade-offs between the different factors that impact image retrieval performance? How do the authors plan to address the potential limitations of their method, such as the requirement for a large number of training samples?
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of image retrieval, and with minor revisions, it has the potential to be a strong publication.
