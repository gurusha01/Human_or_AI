This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of state-of-the-art deep neural networks (DNNs) submitted to the ImageNet challenge, evaluating their performance in terms of accuracy, memory footprint, parameters, operations count, inference time, and power consumption. The authors aim to provide insights into design choices that can lead to efficient neural networks for practical applications, optimizing limited resources in actual deployments.
I decide to accept this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the paper tackles a specific and relevant problem in the field of computer vision, namely the lack of consideration for resource utilization in DNNs. Secondly, the authors provide a thorough and well-motivated analysis of various DNN architectures, using a range of metrics to evaluate their performance.
The paper supports its claims with a range of experiments, including measurements of inference time, memory usage, and power consumption on a Jetson TX1 board. The results are presented in a clear and informative manner, with figures and tables that effectively illustrate the key findings. The authors also provide a detailed discussion of their results, highlighting the implications for the design of efficient DNNs.
One area for improvement is the discussion of limitations, which is somewhat brief. The authors could provide more detail on the potential limitations of their analysis, such as the use of a single device (the Jetson TX1) for measurements, and the potential impact of other factors (e.g. dataset size, training methodology) on the results.
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors consider adding more detail on the following points:
* A more detailed discussion of the implications of their results for the design of efficient DNNs, including potential trade-offs between accuracy, inference time, and power consumption.
* An analysis of the potential impact of other factors (e.g. dataset size, training methodology) on the results.
* A comparison with other related work in the field, to provide a clearer understanding of the contribution of this paper.
I would like the authors to answer the following questions to clarify my understanding of the paper:
* Can you provide more detail on the methodology used to measure power consumption, and the potential sources of error in these measurements?
* How do you think the results of this paper could be used to inform the design of more efficient DNNs, and what potential trade-offs might need to be considered?
* Are there any plans to extend this analysis to other datasets or applications, and how might the results be expected to generalize?
