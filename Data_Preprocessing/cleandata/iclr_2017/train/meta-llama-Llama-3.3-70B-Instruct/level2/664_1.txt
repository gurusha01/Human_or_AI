The paper proposes a novel approach to generating image-like containers for steganography applications using Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN). The authors introduce a Steganographic Generative Adversarial Networks (SGAN) model, which consists of a generator network, a discriminator network, and a steganalyzer network. The SGAN model is trained to generate realistic images that can deceive a steganalyzer, and the authors demonstrate that their approach can decrease the detection accuracy of a steganalysis method almost to that of a random classifier.
I decide to accept this paper with some minor revisions. The main reason for this decision is that the paper presents a well-motivated and novel approach to steganography, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the background and related work, and the paper is well-organized and easy to follow.
One of the strengths of the paper is the thorough evaluation of the proposed approach, including experiments on different datasets and comparison with existing methods. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the results and discuss the implications of their findings. However, there are some minor issues that need to be addressed, such as providing more details on the implementation of the SGAN model and the experimental setup.
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more information on the hyperparameter tuning process and the selection of the optimal parameters for the SGAN model. Additionally, it would be helpful to include more visualizations of the generated images and the steganalysis results to better illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
Some questions that I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper include: How did the authors select the optimal value of the parameter Î± in the SGAN model, and what is the sensitivity of the results to this parameter? How do the authors plan to extend their approach to more advanced steganographic algorithms, and what are the potential challenges and limitations of their method? What are the potential applications of the proposed approach beyond steganography, and how can it be used in other fields such as computer vision and machine learning? 
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of steganography and generative adversarial networks, and with some minor revisions, it has the potential to be a strong publication.
