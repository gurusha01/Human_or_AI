Summary of the Paper
The paper proposes a novel approach to learn a simple, low-dimensional state representation of the world from images acquired by a robot using a neural network. The approach utilizes "robotic priors" as loss functions to guide the learning process, which are implemented through a siamese network. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach by learning a one-dimensional representation of a Baxter head position from raw images, achieving a 97.7% correlation between the learned representation and the ground truth.
Decision
I decide to accept this paper, with the main reason being that the approach is well-motivated and the results are promising. The use of robotic priors as a means to incorporate prior knowledge about the world into the learning process is a novel and interesting idea. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in learning a robust state representation.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a clear and well-structured presentation of the approach, including a thorough discussion of related work and a detailed description of the methodology. The experimental results are convincing, and the use of data augmentation to improve robustness to noise and luminosity variations is a nice touch. The authors also provide a thoughtful discussion of the limitations of their approach and potential future directions.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I would suggest providing more details on the implementation of the siamese network and the robotic priors. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more experimental results, such as comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods or evaluations on more complex tasks. The authors may also want to consider discussing potential applications of their approach beyond robotics, such as in computer vision or other areas of artificial intelligence.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like to ask the authors the following questions:
* Can you provide more details on how the robotic priors are formalized and implemented in the siamese network?
* How do you plan to extend your approach to learn more complex state representations, such as objects positions in three dimensions?
* Have you considered evaluating your approach on real-world images, rather than simulated data? If so, what challenges do you anticipate and how do you plan to address them?
