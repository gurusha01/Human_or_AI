This paper presents a framework for unsupervised learning of representations based on the infomax principle for large-scale neural populations. The authors propose a hierarchical infomax approach to optimize the mutual information between the input and output of a neural network, which is approximated using an asymptotic formula. The optimization process is divided into two stages: maximizing the mutual information between the input and a noise-corrupted version of the input, and maximizing the mutual information between the noise-corrupted input and the output. The authors also propose two algorithms, Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2, to optimize the objective function, which is a function of the matrix C that represents the transformation from the input to the output.
The paper claims to contribute to the field of unsupervised learning by providing a novel framework for learning representations that is based on the infomax principle and is applicable to large-scale neural populations. The authors also claim that their method is more efficient and robust than existing methods, such as independent component analysis (ICA) and sparse coding.
I decide to accept this paper because it presents a novel and well-motivated approach to unsupervised learning, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of the proposed framework and algorithms.
