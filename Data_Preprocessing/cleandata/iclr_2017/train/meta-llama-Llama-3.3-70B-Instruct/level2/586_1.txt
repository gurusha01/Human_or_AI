The paper "Improving the Neural GPU" presents a thorough investigation into the capabilities and limitations of the Neural GPU, a neural network architecture designed to learn algorithms. The authors claim to have improved the performance of the Neural GPU by carefully designing a curriculum and increasing the model size, allowing it to generalize to longer inputs and solve more complex tasks.
I decide to accept this paper, with the main reason being that it presents a well-motivated and well-executed study on the Neural GPU, providing valuable insights into its strengths and weaknesses. The authors' approach to improving the Neural GPU's performance is sound, and their results demonstrate a significant improvement in its ability to generalize to longer inputs.
The paper supports its claims with thorough experiments and analysis, providing a detailed understanding of the factors that affect the Neural GPU's performance. The authors also acknowledge the limitations of their approach and discuss potential avenues for future research, demonstrating a clear understanding of the current state of the field.
One area for improvement is the discussion of the Neural GPU's failure modes, which could be more comprehensive. The authors mention that the model fails on highly structured test cases, but a more detailed analysis of these failures and potential ways to address them would strengthen the paper.
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more context on the significance of their results, particularly in relation to other work on neural networks and algorithm learning. Additionally, they could consider providing more details on the implementation of the Neural GPU and the curriculums used, to facilitate reproducibility and further research.
Questions I would like the authors to answer include: How do the authors plan to address the Neural GPU's failure modes, and what potential modifications to the architecture or training procedure could improve its performance on highly structured test cases? How do the authors' results relate to other work on neural networks and algorithm learning, and what implications do their findings have for the development of more general and robust learning methods?
