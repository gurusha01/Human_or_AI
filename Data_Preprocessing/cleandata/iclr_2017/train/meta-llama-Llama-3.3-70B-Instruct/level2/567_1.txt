The paper proposes a novel method for finding dependent subspaces across multiple views of data, with a focus on preserving neighborhood relationships between data samples. The authors introduce a new criterion that maximizes the similarity of neighborhoods between views, which is related to an information retrieval task. The method is shown to outperform existing approaches, such as Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) and Locality Preserving CCA (LPCCA), in experiments on artificial and real-world data sets.
I decide to accept this paper, with two key reasons for this choice: (1) the paper proposes a novel and well-motivated approach to finding dependent subspaces, and (2) the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in preserving neighborhood relationships between views.
The paper provides a clear and well-structured presentation of the proposed method, including a detailed description of the optimization technique and the properties of the method. The authors also provide a thorough discussion of related work, highlighting the differences between their approach and existing methods. The experimental results are convincing, demonstrating the ability of the proposed method to find dependent subspaces that preserve neighborhood relationships between views.
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the computational complexity of the proposed method and its scalability to large data sets. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more experiments on data sets with multiple views, to demonstrate the ability of the method to handle more complex scenarios.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper include: (1) How do the authors choose the parameter σi,V in the neighbor probability distribution, and what is the effect of this parameter on the results? (2) Can the authors provide more insights into the optimization process, including the choice of the penalty parameter γ and the number of L-BFGS rounds? (3) How do the authors plan to extend the method to handle nonlinear transformations, and what are the potential challenges and benefits of such an extension?
