The paper "Energy-based Generative Adversarial Networks" introduces a novel approach to generative adversarial networks (GANs) by viewing the discriminator as an energy function. This energy-based formulation allows for greater flexibility in the choice of architecture and loss functionals, and the authors demonstrate its effectiveness in generating high-resolution images.
The main claims of the paper are: (1) the energy-based formulation of GANs provides a more stable and scalable approach to generating high-resolution images, (2) the use of an auto-encoder architecture as the discriminator can improve the quality of generated images, and (3) the proposed "repelling regularizer" can help to prevent mode collapse.
I decide to accept this paper with the following key reasons: (1) the paper presents a well-motivated and well-placed approach in the literature, and (2) the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in generating high-resolution images.
The paper provides a clear and concise introduction to the energy-based formulation of GANs, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of the theoretical foundations of their approach. The experimental results are also well-presented, with a clear comparison to existing methods and a demonstration of the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the implementation of the repelling regularizer and its effect on the generated images. Additionally, it would be helpful to include more comparisons to existing methods, such as variational auto-encoders (VAEs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs) with different architectures.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer are: (1) How does the choice of margin value m affect the performance of the EBGAN model? (2) Can the authors provide more insights into the theoretical understanding of the EBGAN model, particularly in terms of the convergence of the generator and discriminator? (3) How does the EBGAN model compare to other energy-based models, such as contrastive divergence and noise-contrastive estimation?
Overall, the paper presents a well-motivated and well-executed approach to generative adversarial networks, and I believe that it has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field. With some additional details and comparisons, the paper could be even stronger.
