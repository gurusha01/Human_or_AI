This paper proposes a novel framework for language learning based on multi-agent communication, where agents develop their own language through interactive games. The authors demonstrate that simple neural network agents can learn to coordinate in a referential game, assigning symbols to meanings that capture general conceptual properties of objects. They also show that grounding the communication in natural language is possible by combining the game with a supervised task.
I decide to accept this paper, with the main reason being that it presents a well-motivated and innovative approach to language learning, with a clear and thorough evaluation of the proposed framework. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a comprehensive review of related work, demonstrating a good understanding of the field.
The approach is well-supported by experimental results, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in learning to communicate and grounding the language in natural language. The use of reinforcement learning and game theory provides a solid foundation for the development of the framework. The authors also acknowledge the limitations of their work and provide a clear direction for future research.
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the implementation of the framework, such as the specific architectures used for the sender and receiver networks, and the hyperparameter tuning process. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more analysis on the emergent language, such as the semantic properties of the symbols and the relationship between the symbols and the objects they refer to.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper include: How do the authors plan to scale up the framework to more complex scenarios, such as multi-agent games or more realistic environments? How do the authors ensure that the emergent language is robust to changes in the environment or the agents' goals? What are the potential applications of this framework, and how do the authors plan to evaluate its effectiveness in real-world scenarios?
