This paper proposes a novel approach to training undirected graphical models with latent variables, called Variational Walkback. The main claim of the paper is that it is sufficient to locally carve the energy function in the right direction at each point in the space of random variables, rather than trying to match the whole positive and negative phase distributions. The authors propose a variational bound on the marginal log-likelihood of the data, which corresponds to a new learning procedure that first walks away from data points by following the model's transition operator and then trains that operator to walk backwards for each of these steps, back towards the training example.
I decide to accept this paper with the following reasons: 
1. The paper tackles a specific and well-defined problem in the field of undirected graphical models, which is the difficulty of training these models due to the need for sampling from Monte-Carlo Markov chains that may not mix well.
2. The approach proposed by the authors is well-motivated and grounded in previous work on contrastive divergence, denoising autoencoders, and generative stochastic networks.
3. The paper provides a clear and detailed explanation of the variational bound and the learning procedure, as well as experimental results on several datasets that demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.
Some potential limitations of the paper include the fact that the approach may not be suitable for all types of data or models, and that the choice of hyperparameters such as the number of walkback steps and the temperature schedule may require careful tuning. Additionally, the paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with other related methods, such as Non-Equilibrium Thermodynamics and Annealed Importance Sampling.
To improve the paper, I would suggest the following:
* Provide more intuition and explanation for the choice of the variational bound and the learning procedure.
* Include more experimental results and comparisons with other methods to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the approach.
* Consider providing more details on the implementation and hyperparameter tuning for the experiments.
* Address potential limitations and future directions for the approach, such as incorporating latent variables and exploring other applications.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer include:
* How do the authors choose the number of walkback steps and the temperature schedule, and what is the effect of these hyperparameters on the performance of the model?
* How does the approach compare to other methods, such as Non-Equilibrium Thermodynamics and Annealed Importance Sampling, in terms of performance and computational efficiency?
* Can the authors provide more intuition and explanation for the choice of the variational bound and the learning procedure, and how they relate to the underlying energy function and transition operator?
