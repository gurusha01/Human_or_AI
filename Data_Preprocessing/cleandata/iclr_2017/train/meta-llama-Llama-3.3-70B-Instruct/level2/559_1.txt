This paper proposes a novel approach to few-shot learning called prototypical networks, which learns a metric space where classification can be performed by computing Euclidean distances to prototype representations of each class. The authors claim that their method is competitive with state-of-the-art few-shot classification approaches while being much simpler and more scalable.
I decide to accept this paper with the following key reasons: 
1. The approach is well-motivated and placed in the literature, building upon existing work in metric learning and few-shot learning.
2. The paper supports its claims with empirical results on the Omniglot and miniImageNet datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on the former and competitive results on the latter.
The authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their approach, which is based on the idea of representing each class by the mean of its examples in a representation space learned by a neural network. They also provide a thorough analysis of the relationship between their approach and existing work, highlighting the advantages of their method in terms of simplicity and scalability.
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more detailed analysis of the results, including a breakdown of the performance on different classes and an examination of the effect of prototype normalization on the results. Additionally, it would be helpful to include more visualizations of the learned embeddings, such as the t-SNE visualization provided for the zero-shot classification results.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper include: 
1. How do the authors choose the number of classes to operate over during each training episode, and what is the effect of this choice on the performance of the model?
2. Can the authors provide more details on the implementation of the prototype normalization technique, and how it affects the training process?
3. How do the authors plan to extend their approach to more complex datasets and tasks, such as those involving multiple modalities or more nuanced class relationships? 
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of few-shot learning, and with some additional analysis and clarification, it has the potential to be a strong and impactful publication.
