This paper proposes a novel distributed transfer learning approach for deep convolutional networks, aiming to address the challenges of optimization complexity and class-imbalance in transfer learning. The authors introduce a basic probability assignment (BPA) method to handle class-imbalance and distribute the transfer learning process among convolutional filters. The approach is evaluated on several standard datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR, and SVHN, and the results show consistent improvement over conventional transfer learning methods.
I decide to accept this paper, with two key reasons: (1) the approach is well-motivated and grounded in the literature, and (2) the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
The paper provides a clear and thorough introduction to the problem of transfer learning and the challenges associated with it. The authors also provide a comprehensive review of related work and demonstrate a good understanding of the field. The proposed approach is novel and addresses the limitations of conventional transfer learning methods.
The experimental results are thorough and well-presented, with a clear comparison to baseline methods and conventional transfer learning approaches. The results demonstrate the advantage of the proposed distributed transfer learning strategy, particularly in scenarios with significant differences in data distributions and class setups.
To further improve the paper, I suggest the authors provide more details on the computational complexity of the proposed approach and its scalability to larger datasets. Additionally, it would be beneficial to include more analysis on the sensitivity of the BPA method to hyperparameters and its robustness to different types of noise or outliers in the data.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer include: (1) How do the authors plan to extend the proposed approach to other types of neural networks, such as recurrent or graph neural networks? (2) Can the authors provide more insights into the interpretation of the BPA values and their relationship to the class-imbalance problem? (3) How do the authors plan to address the potential issue of overfitting in the distributed transfer learning process, particularly when dealing with small target datasets?
