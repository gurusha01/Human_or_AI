The paper proposes a novel approach, GRAM, to address the challenges of data insufficiency and interpretation in deep learning models for healthcare predictive modeling. GRAM leverages medical ontologies to supplement electronic health records (EHR) data, enabling the model to learn robust and interpretable representations of medical concepts. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of GRAM in three predictive modeling experiments, showcasing its ability to outperform baseline models, particularly in scenarios with limited data.
I decide to accept this paper, with two key reasons for this choice: (1) the paper tackles a significant problem in healthcare predictive modeling, and (2) the proposed approach, GRAM, demonstrates promising results in addressing the challenges of data insufficiency and interpretation.
The paper provides a clear and well-motivated introduction to the problem, followed by a detailed description of the proposed approach, GRAM. The authors conduct thorough experiments to evaluate the performance of GRAM, comparing it to various baseline models. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of GRAM in improving predictive performance, especially in scenarios with limited data. Additionally, the authors provide a qualitative evaluation of the interpretability of the learned representations, showcasing the ability of GRAM to align with medical knowledge.
To further improve the paper, I suggest the authors consider the following points: (1) provide more detailed analysis of the attention mechanism, including visualizations of the attention weights for different medical concepts; (2) explore the application of GRAM to other healthcare predictive modeling tasks, such as disease diagnosis or patient risk stratification; and (3) investigate the potential of GRAM to incorporate other types of knowledge, such as clinical guidelines or medical literature.
I would like the authors to answer the following questions to clarify my understanding of the paper: (1) How do the authors plan to extend GRAM to handle multiple medical ontologies, and what are the potential challenges in doing so? (2) Can the authors provide more insight into the initialization scheme of the basic embeddings, and how it affects the performance of GRAM? (3) How do the authors envision GRAM being used in practice, and what are the potential barriers to its adoption in real-world healthcare settings?
