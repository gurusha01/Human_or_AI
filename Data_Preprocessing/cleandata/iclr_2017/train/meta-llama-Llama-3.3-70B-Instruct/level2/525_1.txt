This paper proposes an online structure learning technique for continuous sum-product networks (SPNs) with Gaussian leaves. The authors claim that their approach, called online structure learning with running average update (oSLRAU), is the first online structure learning technique for continuous SPNs and that it outperforms existing methods on several benchmark datasets.
I decide to accept this paper with the following key reasons: 
1. The paper tackles a specific and well-defined problem in the field of sum-product networks, which is a significant contribution to the field.
2. The approach is well-motivated and placed in the literature, with a clear explanation of the limitations of existing methods and how oSLRAU addresses these limitations.
The paper provides a clear and detailed description of the oSLRAU algorithm, including the parameter update and structure update procedures. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of oSLRAU on several benchmark datasets, including toy datasets and larger datasets. The results show that oSLRAU outperforms existing methods, including online Bayesian moment matching, online expectation maximization, and stacked restricted Boltzmann machines.
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more analysis on the computational complexity of the oSLRAU algorithm and its scalability to very large datasets. Additionally, it would be useful to provide more insights into the hyperparameter tuning process, including the choice of correlation threshold and maximum number of variables per leaf node.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper include: 
1. How does the oSLRAU algorithm handle missing data or outliers in the input data?
2. Can the authors provide more details on the implementation of the oSLRAU algorithm, including any optimization techniques used to improve efficiency?
3. How does the oSLRAU algorithm compare to other online learning methods, such as online gradient descent or online stochastic gradient descent? 
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of sum-product networks and provides a well-motivated and effective approach to online structure learning for continuous SPNs.
