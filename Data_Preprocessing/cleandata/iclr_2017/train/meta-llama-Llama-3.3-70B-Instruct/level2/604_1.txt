This paper proposes a novel approach to argumentation mining, specifically focusing on extracting links between argument components (ACs) and classifying AC types. The authors introduce a modified Pointer Network (PN) architecture, which achieves state-of-the-art results on two evaluation corpora. The paper is well-structured, and the authors provide a clear motivation for their approach, as well as a thorough evaluation of their model.
I decide to accept this paper, with two key reasons for this choice: (1) the paper tackles a specific and well-defined problem in argumentation mining, and (2) the proposed approach is well-motivated and supported by experimental results.
The paper provides a clear and concise overview of the problem, and the authors demonstrate a good understanding of the relevant literature. The proposed PN architecture is well-suited for the task, and the authors provide a thorough explanation of how it works. The experimental results are impressive, with the PN model achieving state-of-the-art results on both corpora.
One potential limitation of the paper is that the authors assume that ACs have already been identified, which may not always be the case in real-world applications. However, the authors acknowledge this limitation and suggest potential future work to address it.
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the feature representation used for ACs, as well as the hyperparameter tuning process. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more analysis on the errors made by the model, and how they relate to the specific characteristics of the corpora.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper include: (1) How do the authors plan to address the limitation of assuming pre-identified ACs in future work? (2) Can the authors provide more details on the computational resources required to train the PN model, and how it compares to other state-of-the-art models? (3) How do the authors think the PN model could be applied to other related tasks, such as predicting the type of link connecting ACs?
