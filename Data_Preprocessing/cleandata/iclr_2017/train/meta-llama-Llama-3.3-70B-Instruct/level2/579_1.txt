The paper proposes a novel hybrid neural network, TreNet, for predicting local trends in time series data. The authors claim that TreNet outperforms conventional CNN, LSTM, HMM, and various kernel-based baselines on real datasets. 
I decide to accept this paper with the following reasons: 
1. The paper tackles a specific and well-defined problem, which is predicting local trends in time series data. 
2. The approach is well-motivated, and the authors provide a clear explanation of how TreNet combines the strengths of CNN and LSTM to capture both local and global contextual features.
The supporting arguments for the decision are as follows: 
The paper provides a thorough review of related work, demonstrating a good understanding of the field and the limitations of existing approaches. The authors also provide a clear and detailed explanation of the TreNet architecture, including the use of LSTM to capture long-term dependencies and CNN to extract local features. The experimental evaluation is comprehensive, with results showing that TreNet outperforms baselines on three real-world datasets.
Additional feedback to improve the paper includes: 
1. Providing more visualizations of the predicted trends, such as plots of the predicted vs. actual trends, to help illustrate the performance of TreNet.
2. Discussing the potential applications of TreNet in more detail, such as how it could be used in practice to inform decision-making in fields like finance or energy management.
3. Considering the use of other evaluation metrics, such as mean absolute error or mean absolute percentage error, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of TreNet's performance.
Questions to the authors include: 
1. How did the authors determine the optimal window size for the local data, and are there any plans to investigate more sophisticated methods for selecting this parameter?
2. Can the authors provide more details on the computational resources required to train and deploy TreNet, and how this might impact its scalability to larger datasets or more complex applications?
3. Are there any plans to extend TreNet to handle multivariate time series data, and if so, how might this be achieved?
