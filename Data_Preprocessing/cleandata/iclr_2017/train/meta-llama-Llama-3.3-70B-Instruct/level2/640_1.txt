The paper presents a novel approach to learning multi-sense word embeddings by leveraging multilingual distributional information. The authors propose a multi-view Bayesian non-parametric algorithm that can efficiently utilize multiple languages to disambiguate words in English. The approach is well-motivated, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the limitations of existing bilingual approaches and the benefits of using multilingual information.
I decide to accept this paper with the following key reasons: 
1. The paper tackles a specific and important problem in natural language processing, namely learning multi-sense word embeddings.
2. The approach is well-motivated, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the limitations of existing bilingual approaches and the benefits of using multilingual information.
The paper provides a thorough analysis of the benefits of using multilingual information for learning multi-sense word embeddings. The authors demonstrate that their approach can achieve competitive performance with state-of-the-art monolingual models, even when trained on significantly less data. The experimental results are convincing, and the authors provide a detailed analysis of the effects of language family distance and window size on the performance of their approach.
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the parameter tuning process and the sensitivity of the model to different hyperparameters. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more qualitative examples of the learned sense embeddings and how they compare to existing word sense induction approaches.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper include: 
1. How do the authors plan to extend their approach to model polysemy in foreign languages, and what are the potential challenges and benefits of doing so?
2. Can the authors provide more details on the computational resources required to train their model, and how it compares to existing approaches in terms of efficiency?
3. How do the authors plan to evaluate the quality of the learned sense embeddings, and what metrics or datasets would they use to compare their approach to existing word sense induction methods?
