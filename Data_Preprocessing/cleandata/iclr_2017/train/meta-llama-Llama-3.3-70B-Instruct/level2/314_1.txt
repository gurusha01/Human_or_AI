Summary of the Paper
The paper presents an approach to sensorimotor control in immersive environments, utilizing a high-dimensional sensory stream and a lower-dimensional measurement stream. The cotemporal structure of these streams provides a rich supervisory signal, enabling training a sensorimotor control model using supervised learning techniques without extraneous supervision. The model learns to act based on raw sensory input from a complex three-dimensional environment and can pursue dynamically changing goals at test time.
Decision
I decide to Accept this paper, with two key reasons for this choice: (1) the paper presents a novel and well-motivated approach to sensorimotor control, and (2) the experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning formulations on challenging tasks.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a clear and well-structured presentation of the approach, including a detailed description of the model architecture and training procedure. The experimental results are extensive and well-designed, demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach in various scenarios, including the Visual Doom AI Competition. The paper also provides a thorough discussion of the related work and the limitations of the approach, highlighting potential avenues for future research.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest the authors consider the following points: (1) provide more details on the hyperparameter tuning process for the baseline methods, (2) include a more detailed analysis of the computational resources required for training the model, and (3) discuss potential applications of the approach beyond the domain of video games.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions: (1) How did you select the specific temporal offsets for predicting future measurements, and (2) Can you provide more details on the architecture of the higher-capacity model used in the D4-tx-L regime?
