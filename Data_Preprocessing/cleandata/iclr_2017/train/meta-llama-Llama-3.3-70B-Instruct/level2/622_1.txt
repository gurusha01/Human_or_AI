This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the dynamic behavior of Residual Networks (ResNets) during training. The authors show that ResNets can be viewed as ensembles of relatively shallow networks, and that the effective depth of these ensembles increases as training progresses. This increase in depth allows ResNets to maintain the advantage of depth while still being easy to optimize.
The paper makes several key contributions. First, it establishes a connection between the loss function of ResNets and the Hamiltonian of a generalized spherical spin glass model. This connection allows the authors to analyze the loss surface of ResNets and understand the dynamic behavior of the effective depth. Second, the paper shows that the scaling parameter introduced by batch normalization plays a crucial role in controlling the effective depth of ResNets. Finally, the paper provides experimental evidence to support the theoretical analysis, demonstrating that the dynamic behavior of ResNets is present in both synthetic and real-world datasets.
I decide to accept this paper because it provides a significant improvement over existing approaches to understanding ResNets. The paper's analysis of the dynamic behavior of ResNets is novel and well-motivated, and the experimental results provide strong evidence to support the theoretical claims. The paper is also well-written and easy to follow, making it accessible to a wide range of readers.
One potential area for improvement is the paper's discussion of the limitations of the analysis. While the paper acknowledges that the assumptions made in the analysis may not always hold, it would be helpful to provide more discussion of the potential consequences of these limitations. Additionally, the paper could benefit from more comparison to existing work on ResNets, to help readers understand how the paper's contributions fit into the broader context of the field.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer in their response include:
* Can you provide more intuition for why the effective depth of ResNets increases as training progresses? Is this due to the optimization algorithm, the architecture of the network, or some other factor?
* How do the results of the paper relate to existing work on ResNets, such as the work of Veit et al. (2016) and Larsson et al. (2016)?
* Are there any potential applications of the paper's results to other areas of deep learning, such as the design of new architectures or the development of more efficient optimization algorithms?
Overall, I believe that this paper makes a significant contribution to our understanding of ResNets and the dynamic behavior of deep neural networks. With some revisions to address the limitations of the analysis and provide more context, I believe that the paper has the potential to be a valuable addition to the field. 
Additional feedback to improve the paper includes:
* Providing more details on the experimental setup and the datasets used in the experiments.
* Including more visualizations of the results, such as plots of the loss surface or the effective depth of the network over time.
* Discussing the potential implications of the paper's results for the design of new architectures or the development of more efficient optimization algorithms.
* Providing more comparison to existing work on ResNets and deep neural networks, to help readers understand how the paper's contributions fit into the broader context of the field.
