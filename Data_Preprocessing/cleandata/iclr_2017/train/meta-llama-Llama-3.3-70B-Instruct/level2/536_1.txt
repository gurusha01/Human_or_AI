The paper claims to provide an efficient analog of the universal approximation theorem for neural networks on the boolean hypercube. The authors prove that any noise-stable boolean function can be well-approximated by a two-layer linear threshold circuit with a small number of hidden-layer nodes and small weights, independent of the input size. They also provide a polynomial-time learning algorithm that outputs a small two-layer linear threshold circuit that approximates a given noise-stable boolean function.
I decide to accept this paper with the key reason being that it provides a significant improvement over existing approaches in terms of the efficiency of the approximation and the learning algorithm. The paper is well-motivated, and the approach is well-placed in the literature, drawing on techniques from Fourier analysis and circuit complexity.
The supporting arguments for this decision include the fact that the paper provides a rigorous proof of the main theorem, which is based on a combination of existing results and new insights. The learning algorithm is also well-designed and efficient, with a clear analysis of its running time and accuracy. Additionally, the paper discusses the limitations of the approach and provides a clear outline of the obstacles to improvements, which demonstrates a good understanding of the underlying challenges.
To improve the paper, I would suggest providing more examples or applications of the results, to illustrate the practical significance of the efficient analog of the universal approximation theorem. Additionally, it would be helpful to provide more details on the implementation of the learning algorithm, such as the choice of parameters and the handling of noise in the data.
I would like to ask the authors to clarify the following points: (1) How does the noise-stability parameter affect the size and weights of the linear threshold circuit? (2) Can the results be extended to more general classes of functions, such as polynomial threshold functions or continuous functions? (3) How does the learning algorithm perform in practice, and are there any plans to implement it and test it on real-world datasets?
