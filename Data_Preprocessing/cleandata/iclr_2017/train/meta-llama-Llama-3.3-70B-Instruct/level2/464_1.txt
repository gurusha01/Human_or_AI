This paper proposes a novel approach to learning hierarchical structures of natural language sentences using reinforcement learning. The authors claim that their method can discover task-specific composition orders that outperform traditional sequential and recursive neural network models. The paper is well-motivated, and the approach is well-placed in the literature, building upon previous work on tree-structured models and reinforcement learning.
I decide to accept this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the paper presents a well-designed and well-executed set of experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on four different tasks. The results show that the latent syntax model, which learns task-specific composition orders, outperforms competing methods with predefined composition orders. Secondly, the paper provides a thorough analysis of the induced trees, including quantitative and qualitative evaluations, which provides insights into the strengths and limitations of the approach.
The supporting arguments for this decision include the fact that the paper presents a clear and concise description of the proposed method, including the reinforcement learning algorithm and the Tree LSTM model. The experiments are well-designed, and the results are thoroughly analyzed and discussed. The paper also provides a good overview of the related work and places the proposed approach in the context of existing research.
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the training time and computational resources required for the proposed method. Additionally, it would be helpful to include more examples of the induced trees and to provide a more detailed analysis of the errors made by the model. Some questions that I would like the authors to answer include: How do the learned trees compare to traditional syntactic parse trees? Can the proposed method be applied to other languages or domains? How does the performance of the model vary with the size of the training dataset?
Overall, this is a well-written and well-researched paper that presents a novel and effective approach to learning hierarchical structures of natural language sentences. With some minor revisions to address the suggested improvements, the paper is ready for publication.
