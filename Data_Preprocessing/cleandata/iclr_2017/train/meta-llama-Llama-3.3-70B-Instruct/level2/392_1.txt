The paper proposes a novel approach to optimizing autoencoders for lossy image compression, addressing the challenge of non-differentiable compression loss. The authors introduce a simple yet effective method to deal with the non-differentiability of rounding-based quantization and entropy rate estimation. The approach enables the training of deep autoencoders that are competitive with JPEG 2000 and outperform recently proposed approaches based on RNNs.
I decide to accept this paper, with the primary reason being the significant improvement in performance over existing approaches, particularly in terms of SSIM and MOS scores. The paper provides a well-motivated approach, thoroughly placed in the literature, and supports its claims with extensive experiments and evaluations.
The paper's contributions are well-supported by the experimental results, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in achieving better performance than JPEG 2000. The use of a sub-pixel architecture and incremental training strategy enables the training of efficient convolutional neural networks, making it suitable for high-resolution images. The paper also provides a thorough discussion of related work, highlighting the differences and advantages of the proposed approach.
To further improve the paper, I suggest the authors provide more details on the implementation of the entropy coding scheme and the range coder used in the experiments. Additionally, it would be beneficial to include more visual examples of the compressed images, particularly for the low-bit-rate settings, to better illustrate the differences between the proposed approach and existing methods.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper include: (1) How do the authors plan to extend the proposed approach to other forms of media, such as video or 3D images? (2) Can the authors provide more insights into the optimization of the compressive autoencoders for different metrics, such as perceptual metrics or generative adversarial networks? (3) How do the authors plan to address the potential limitations of the proposed approach, such as the requirement for large amounts of training data or the computational complexity of the incremental training strategy?
