The paper proposes an LSTM-based meta-learner model to learn the exact optimization algorithm used to train another learner neural network classifier in the few-shot regime. The model is designed to learn a beneficial common initialization that serves as a good starting point for fine-tuning, allowing for quick convergence of training. The authors demonstrate that this meta-learning model is competitive with deep metric-learning techniques for few-shot learning.
I decide to accept this paper, with the key reason being that the approach is well-motivated and well-placed in the literature. The authors provide a clear and thorough explanation of the meta-learning formulation, the model architecture, and the training procedure. The experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms natural baselines and is competitive with state-of-the-art metric learning methods.
The paper supports its claims through a series of experiments on the Mini-ImageNet dataset, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in few-shot learning tasks. The authors also provide a visualization of the optimization strategy learned by the meta-learner, which provides insight into how the model updates the learner during training.
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the hyperparameter selection process and the sensitivity of the model to different hyperparameters. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more analysis on the learned optimization strategy and how it compares to other optimization methods.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper include: How does the meta-learner handle tasks with different numbers of classes and examples? Can the meta-learner be fine-tuned using additional data during meta-testing? How does the proposed model compare to other meta-learning methods, such as model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML)? 
Overall, the paper presents a well-motivated and well-executed approach to few-shot learning, and I believe it makes a significant contribution to the field. With some additional analysis and clarification, the paper has the potential to be even stronger.
