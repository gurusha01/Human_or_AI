This paper proposes a novel approach to two-sample testing, called Classifier Two-Sample Tests (C2ST), which utilizes binary classifiers to distinguish between two samples. The authors claim that C2ST learns a suitable representation of the data on the fly, returns test statistics in interpretable units, has a simple null distribution, and allows for the interpretation of where the two distributions differ.
Based on the provided information, I decide to accept this paper. The two main reasons for this choice are:
1. The paper tackles a specific and well-defined problem in statistics, namely two-sample testing, and proposes a novel and well-motivated approach to solve it.
2. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the theoretical properties of C2ST, including its asymptotic distribution, testing power, and interpretability, and demonstrate its effectiveness through a range of experiments on synthetic and real data.
The supporting arguments for this decision include:
* The paper provides a clear and concise introduction to the problem of two-sample testing and the limitations of existing approaches.
* The authors propose a simple and intuitive method for constructing a two-sample test using binary classifiers, which is well-motivated by the idea that a good classifier should be able to distinguish between the two samples if they are drawn from different distributions.
* The paper provides a thorough analysis of the theoretical properties of C2ST, including its asymptotic distribution, testing power, and interpretability, which demonstrates a deep understanding of the underlying statistics.
* The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of C2ST through a range of experiments on synthetic and real data, including comparisons with state-of-the-art alternatives, which shows that C2ST is a competitive and useful approach to two-sample testing.
Additional feedback to improve the paper includes:
* Providing more details on the implementation of C2ST, such as the choice of classifier and hyperparameters, to make it easier for readers to reproduce the results.
* Including more examples of how C2ST can be used in practice, such as in the evaluation of generative models or in causal discovery, to demonstrate its potential impact and applications.
* Discussing the limitations and potential drawbacks of C2ST, such as its reliance on the choice of classifier and the potential for overfitting, to provide a more balanced view of the approach.
Questions to the authors include:
* Can you provide more details on the choice of classifier and hyperparameters used in the experiments, and how these were selected?
* How do you think C2ST could be extended or modified to handle more complex or high-dimensional data, such as images or text?
* Can you provide more examples of how C2ST could be used in practice, such as in the evaluation of generative models or in causal discovery, and what benefits it could bring to these applications?
