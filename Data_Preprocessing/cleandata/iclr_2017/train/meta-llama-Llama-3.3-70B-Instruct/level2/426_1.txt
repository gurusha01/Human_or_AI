This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of bilingual word vectors, introducing a novel approach to learning offline bilingual word vectors using orthogonal transformations. The authors prove that the optimal linear transformation between word vector spaces should be orthogonal and can be obtained using the singular value decomposition (SVD) on a dictionary of translation pairs.
The paper claims to improve the precision of Mikolov's original linear mapping from 34% to 43% when translating a test set composed of both common and rare English words into Italian. The authors also demonstrate that their approach can achieve high precision without an expert bilingual signal by using a pseudo-dictionary acquired from identical word strings that appear in both languages.
I decide to accept this paper, with the main reason being that the approach is well-motivated and supported by theoretical analysis and empirical results. The paper provides a clear and concise explanation of the methodology, and the experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
The supporting arguments for this decision include the fact that the paper provides a significant improvement over existing approaches, and the results are robust and consistent across different experimental settings. The use of orthogonal transformations and the inverted softmax function are novel contributions that enhance the accuracy of bilingual word vector learning.
Additional feedback to improve the paper includes providing more detailed analysis of the limitations of the approach, such as the sensitivity to the quality of the dictionary and the impact of noise on the orthogonal transformation. It would also be helpful to include more comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods and to explore the applicability of the approach to other languages and domains.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer include: How does the size and quality of the dictionary affect the performance of the approach? Can the approach be extended to learn bilingual word vectors for languages with limited resources or without a large dictionary of translation pairs? How does the inverted softmax function compare to other methods for mitigating the hubness problem in bilingual word vector learning?
