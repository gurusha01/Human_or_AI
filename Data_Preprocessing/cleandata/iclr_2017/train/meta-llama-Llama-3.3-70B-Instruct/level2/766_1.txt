The paper proposes a novel pedestrian detection method based on the Fast R-CNN framework, incorporating batch normalization and the EdgeBoxes algorithm to improve efficiency and accuracy. The authors claim that their approach achieves satisfactory performance on two benchmark datasets, INRIA and ETH, and outperforms several state-of-the-art methods.
I decide to accept this paper, with the main reason being that the approach is well-motivated and supported by experimental results. The use of batch normalization and EdgeBoxes algorithm is a significant improvement over existing methods, and the authors provide a thorough evaluation of their approach on two popular datasets.
The paper is well-structured, and the authors provide a clear introduction to the problem of pedestrian detection, related work, and their proposed approach. The experimental results are comprehensive, and the authors provide a detailed comparison with other state-of-the-art methods. The use of batch normalization and EdgeBoxes algorithm is well-justified, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of the results.
However, there are some limitations to the paper. The authors could provide more analysis on the impact of batch normalization and EdgeBoxes algorithm on the performance of the approach. Additionally, the authors could provide more details on the training process, such as the learning rate schedule and the number of iterations.
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more visualizations of the detection results, such as examples of correctly detected pedestrians and false positives. This would help to better understand the strengths and weaknesses of the approach. Additionally, the authors could provide more analysis on the computational complexity of the approach and its potential for real-time deployment.
I would like the authors to answer the following questions to clarify my understanding of the paper:
* Can you provide more details on the training process, such as the learning rate schedule and the number of iterations?
* How do you handle cases where the EdgeBoxes algorithm generates multiple overlapping proposals for the same pedestrian?
* Can you provide more analysis on the impact of batch normalization on the performance of the approach?
* How do you plan to address the issue of detecting pedestrians in low-resolution images, which is mentioned as an open issue in the conclusion?
