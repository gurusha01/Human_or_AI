This paper presents a novel method for visualizing the response of a deep neural network to a specific input, called prediction difference analysis. The method highlights areas in the input image that provide evidence for or against a certain class, overcoming several shortcomings of previous methods. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on natural images (ImageNet data) and medical images (MRI brain scans).
I decide to accept this paper, with the main reason being that it presents a well-motivated and novel approach to visualizing neural network decisions, with a clear and thorough evaluation on various datasets. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a detailed explanation of their method, including its limitations and potential applications.
The approach is well-placed in the literature, and the authors provide a comprehensive review of related work. The method is rigorously evaluated on various datasets, including ImageNet and MRI brain scans, demonstrating its effectiveness in providing insights into neural network decisions. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the results, including a comparison with other methods and an evaluation of the computational resources required.
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the computational resources required for their method, including the time and memory complexity. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more examples of how the method can be used in practice, such as in medical diagnosis or autonomous driving. The authors may also want to consider providing more information on the potential applications and limitations of their method, including any potential biases or errors that may arise.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper include: How do the authors plan to address the computational resources required for their method, particularly for large-scale datasets? Can the authors provide more examples of how their method can be used in practice, including any potential applications in areas such as healthcare or finance? How do the authors plan to evaluate the effectiveness of their method in real-world scenarios, including any potential limitations or biases that may arise?
