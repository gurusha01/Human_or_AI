The paper "Iterative PoWER: A Method for Efficient Policy Updates with Limited Rollouts" presents a novel approach to policy optimization in reinforcement learning, specifically designed for scenarios where the number of policy updates is limited. The authors propose an iterative version of the PoWER algorithm, which approximates the expected policy reward as a sequence of concave lower bounds that can be efficiently maximized. This approach enables the use of control variates, reducing the variance of the estimator and improving convergence.
I decide to accept this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the paper tackles a specific and relevant problem in reinforcement learning, providing a well-motivated and clearly explained solution. Secondly, the approach is supported by theoretical analysis and empirical results on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in achieving good performance with limited policy updates.
The paper provides a thorough review of existing literature, clearly placing the proposed method within the context of reinforcement learning and policy optimization. The authors also acknowledge the limitations of their approach, discussing potential issues with variance and the need for additional regularizers. The experimental results are convincing, showing significant improvements over the standard PoWER algorithm and demonstrating the benefits of using control variates.
To further improve the paper, I suggest the authors consider addressing the following points: (1) providing more detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the iterative PoWER algorithm, (2) exploring the use of additional regularizers to mitigate the issue of high variance, and (3) discussing potential applications of the proposed method in other domains beyond online advertising.
I would like the authors to answer the following questions to clarify my understanding of the paper: (1) How do the authors plan to address the issue of high variance in the iterative PoWER algorithm, and what additional regularizers could be used to mitigate this problem? (2) Can the authors provide more details on the experimental setup and the specific datasets used in the evaluation, including the Cartpole benchmark and the online advertising data? (3) How do the authors envision the proposed method being used in practice, and what are the potential benefits and challenges of deploying it in a real-world production system?
