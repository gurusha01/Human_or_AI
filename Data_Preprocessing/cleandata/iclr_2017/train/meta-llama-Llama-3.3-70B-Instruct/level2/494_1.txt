This paper introduces a new dataset based on Higher-Order Logic (HOL) proofs, with the goal of developing new machine learning-based theorem-proving strategies. The authors propose various machine learning tasks that can be performed on this dataset and discuss their significance for theorem proving. They also benchmark a set of simple baseline machine learning models, including logistic regression, convolutional neural networks, and recurrent neural networks, and demonstrate the promise of applying machine learning to HOL theorem proving.
I decide to accept this paper, with the main reason being that it presents a well-motivated and well-placed approach in the literature, tackling a specific question of applying machine learning to HOL theorem proving. The paper supports its claims with experimental results, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed baseline models.
The paper's contributions are significant, as it provides a new dataset for machine learning-based theorem proving and proposes various tasks that can be performed on this dataset. The authors also provide a thorough discussion of the related work and demonstrate a good understanding of the field. The experimental results are well-presented and demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach.
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the dataset extraction process and the preprocessing steps performed on the data. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more analysis on the results, such as an ablation study to understand the contribution of each component of the proposed models.
I would like to ask the authors to clarify the following points: How do the authors plan to address the issue of overfitting, which seems to be a problem in some of the proposed models? Can the authors provide more details on the graph structure of HOL statements and how it can be leveraged using graph-based recursive architectures? How do the authors plan to extend the proposed approach to other interactive theorem provers or automated theorem provers?
Overall, the paper presents a well-motivated and well-executed approach to applying machine learning to HOL theorem proving, and I believe it has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field.
