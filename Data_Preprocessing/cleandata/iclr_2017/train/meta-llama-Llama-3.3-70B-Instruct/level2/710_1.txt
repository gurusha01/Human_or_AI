This paper proposes a Bayesian non-parametric approach to analyze bioacoustic signals, specifically using Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Hidden Markov Models (HDP-HMM) to segment signals into song units. The authors apply this approach to two real-world bioacoustic applications: humpback whale song decomposition and multi-species bird song unit structuration.
I decide to accept this paper, with two key reasons for this choice: 
1. The paper tackles a significant problem in bioacoustics, which is the analysis of complex acoustic signals from non-human species, and proposes a novel approach to address this challenge.
2. The authors provide a thorough evaluation of their approach on two real-world datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of their method in segmenting bioacoustic signals into meaningful units.
The paper provides a clear and well-motivated introduction to the problem, and the authors do an excellent job of explaining the technical details of their approach. The use of HDP-HMM is well-justified, and the authors provide a thorough discussion of the advantages and limitations of their method. The experimental results are impressive, and the authors provide a detailed analysis of the results, including comparisons with expert annotations.
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors consider the following points:
* Provide more discussion on the computational efficiency of their approach, as they mention that the model is computationally expensive and not suitable for larger datasets.
* Consider using more advanced techniques, such as variational inference or stochastic variational inference, to improve the scalability of their approach.
* Provide more analysis on the robustness of their approach to different types of noise and interference, as this is an important consideration in real-world bioacoustic applications.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper include:
* Can the authors provide more details on how they selected the hyperparameters for their model, and how they tuned the model for the two different applications?
* How do the authors plan to address the issue of scalability, and what techniques do they propose to use to improve the computational efficiency of their approach?
* Can the authors provide more discussion on the potential applications of their approach in ecological monitoring and conservation, and how their method can be used to inform conservation efforts?
