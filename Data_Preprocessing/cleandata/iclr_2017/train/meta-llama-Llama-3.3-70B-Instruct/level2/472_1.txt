This paper proposes Support Regularized Sparse Coding (SRSC), a novel sparse coding method that captures the locally linear manifold structure of high-dimensional data. The authors introduce a support regularization term that encourages nearby data points to share dictionary atoms, which helps to preserve the geometric information and manifold structure of the data. The paper also presents a feed-forward neural network, Deep Support Regularized Sparse Coding (Deep-SRSC), as a fast encoder to approximate the sparse codes generated by SRSC.
The main claims of the paper are:
1. SRSC can capture the locally linear manifold structure of high-dimensional data, which is not achieved by traditional sparse coding methods.
2. Deep-SRSC can efficiently approximate the sparse codes generated by SRSC, making it a fast and effective method for sparse coding.
The support for these claims is provided through extensive experimental results on various datasets, including USPS, COIL-20, COIL-100, and UCI Gesture Phase Segmentation. The results demonstrate that SRSC outperforms other sparse coding methods, including K-means, Spectral Clustering, and `2-RSC, in terms of clustering accuracy and normalized mutual information. Additionally, the results show that Deep-SRSC can achieve comparable performance to SRSC with significant speedup.
The usefulness of the proposed method is evident in its ability to capture the locally linear manifold structure of high-dimensional data, which is essential for many machine learning tasks, such as clustering, classification, and dimensionality reduction. The method is also robust to noise and can handle large datasets efficiently.
