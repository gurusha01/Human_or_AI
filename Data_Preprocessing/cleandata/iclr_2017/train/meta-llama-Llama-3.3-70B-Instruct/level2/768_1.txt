This paper proposes a novel approach to learning rich and diverse feature representations in deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) by incorporating auxiliary annotations as privileged information. The authors introduce a group orthogonal convolutional neural network (GoCNN) model that learns features from foreground and background in an orthogonal way, exploiting privileged information for optimization. The paper claims that the proposed GoCNN model can learn more diverse feature representations and offers stronger generalization ability for image classification tasks.
I decide to accept this paper with the following key reasons: 
1. The paper tackles a specific and well-defined problem in the field of deep learning, which is learning rich and diverse feature representations in CNNs.
2. The approach is well-motivated and placed in the literature, with a clear explanation of how the proposed GoCNN model differs from existing methods.
The paper provides a clear and concise explanation of the proposed GoCNN model, including the architecture and training procedure. The authors also provide a thorough evaluation of the model on two benchmark datasets, ImageNet and PASCAL VOC, demonstrating the effectiveness and high generalization ability of the proposed GoCNN model. The experimental results show that the GoCNN model outperforms the baseline models, including the standard ResNet-18 and SVM+ methods.
To further improve the paper, I suggest the authors provide more analysis on the computational cost and efficiency of the proposed GoCNN model, as well as its potential applications in other computer vision tasks. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more visualizations of the learned features and how they differ from those learned by the baseline models.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper include: 
1. How does the size ratio of foreground and background groups affect the performance of the GoCNN model?
2. Can the authors provide more details on how the privileged information is utilized during training, and how it affects the learning process?
3. How does the GoCNN model perform on other image classification datasets, and are there any plans to extend the approach to other computer vision tasks?
