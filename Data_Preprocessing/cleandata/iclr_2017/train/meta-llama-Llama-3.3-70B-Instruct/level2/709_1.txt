This paper presents a novel unsupervised pretraining method to improve sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) learning, which is a crucial component in various natural language processing tasks such as machine translation and abstractive summarization. The authors propose to initialize the encoder and decoder of a seq2seq model with the pretrained weights of two language models, and then fine-tune the model with labeled data. The paper claims that this approach significantly improves the accuracy of seq2seq models, achieving state-of-the-art results on the WMT English→German task and surpassing the previous best models on both WMT'14 and WMT'15 English→German.
Based on the provided information, I decide to accept this paper. The main reasons for this decision are: 
1. The paper tackles a specific and well-defined problem in the field of natural language processing, which is the improvement of seq2seq learning.
2. The approach is well-motivated and placed in the literature, with a clear explanation of the limitations of existing methods and the potential benefits of the proposed approach.
3. The paper provides strong empirical evidence to support its claims, including experiments on challenging benchmarks in machine translation and abstractive summarization.
The supporting arguments for this decision include the fact that the paper presents a simple yet effective technique for using unsupervised pretraining to improve seq2seq models, and that the experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over the previous best models. Additionally, the paper provides a thorough analysis of the benefits and limitations of the proposed approach, including an ablation study to understand the behavior of each component of the method.
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the hyperparameter tuning process and the computational resources required to train the models. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more qualitative analysis of the generated summaries and translations, to better understand the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed approach.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper include: 
- How do the authors plan to extend this approach to other seq2seq tasks, such as question answering or dialogue generation?
- Can the authors provide more insights into the benefits and limitations of using language models as a pretraining objective, compared to other unsupervised objectives such as autoencoding or generative adversarial training?
- How do the authors plan to address the potential issue of overfitting to the pretraining data, and what techniques can be used to regularize the model and prevent this from happening?
