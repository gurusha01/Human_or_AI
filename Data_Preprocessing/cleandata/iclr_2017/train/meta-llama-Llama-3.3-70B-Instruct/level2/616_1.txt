This paper proposes a weakly supervised inversion machine that generates imaginations of hidden representations in images, which can then be rendered to reconstruct the original image. The model uses convolutional adversarial priors to regularize the inferred representations by distribution matching against retrieved relevant memories. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on three computer vision tasks: image in-painting, intrinsic image decomposition, and figure-ground layer extraction.
I decide to accept this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the paper tackles a specific and well-motivated problem in computer vision, namely the inverse problem of image formation, and proposes a novel and well-designed solution. Secondly, the approach is well-supported by experimental results, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model on various tasks and datasets.
The paper provides a clear and well-structured presentation of the proposed model, including the architecture, loss functions, and training procedures. The authors also provide a thorough discussion of related work and the advantages of their approach over existing methods. The experimental results are convincing, and the use of fully-convolutional discriminators and relevant memory retrieval is well-justified.
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the memory retrieval engine and the selection of relevant memories. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more results on the generalization of the model to unseen data and the robustness of the approach to different types of noise and perturbations.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer include: How do the authors plan to extend the approach to video data, and what are the potential challenges and benefits of doing so? How do the authors measure the quality of the generated imaginations, and what are the evaluation metrics used to compare the results with other methods? Are there any plans to apply the approach to other computer vision tasks, such as object recognition or scene understanding? 
Overall, the paper presents a well-designed and effective approach to the inverse problem of image formation, and I believe it has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of computer vision.
