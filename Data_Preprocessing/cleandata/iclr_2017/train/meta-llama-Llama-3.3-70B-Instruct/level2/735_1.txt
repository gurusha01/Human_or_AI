This paper proposes a novel non-linear dimensionality regularization technique for solving ill-posed inverse problems without pre-training. The authors introduce a robust energy minimization algorithm that handles the implicitness of the feature space to directly penalize its rank by iteratively creating robust low-dimensional representation for the data and reconstructing the noise-free version of the data. The approach is demonstrated to perform robustly in the presence of missing data and noise, and achieves state-of-the-art results on predicting missing entries in the oil flow dataset and on the challenging problem of Non-Rigid Structure from Motion.
I decide to accept this paper for the following reasons:
