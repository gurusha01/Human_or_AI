The paper presents a novel approach to learning a natural language interface for database tables using a weakly supervised, end-to-end neural network model called Neural Programmer. The model is trained on a real-world dataset, WikiTableQuestions, with only 10,000 examples and achieves competitive performance with a state-of-the-art traditional semantic parser. The authors enhance the objective function of Neural Programmer to handle weaker supervision signals and demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through extensive experiments.
I decide to accept this paper with two key reasons: (1) the paper tackles a specific and challenging problem in natural language processing, and (2) the approach is well-motivated and supported by experimental results. The authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of their model, and the experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach in achieving competitive performance with a state-of-the-art traditional semantic parser.
The supporting arguments for my decision include the fact that the paper presents a novel and innovative approach to learning a natural language interface for database tables. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the results, including an ablation study and error analysis, which helps to understand the strengths and limitations of their approach. Additionally, the paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their model and experiments.
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the hyperparameter tuning process and the effect of different hyperparameters on the performance of the model. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more examples of induced programs and a more detailed analysis of the errors made by the model. Some questions I would like the authors to answer include: (1) How do the authors plan to extend their approach to handle more complex queries and larger datasets? (2) Can the authors provide more insights into the types of errors made by the model and how they can be addressed? (3) How does the performance of the model compare to other neural network-based approaches, such as sequence-to-sequence models and pointer networks?
