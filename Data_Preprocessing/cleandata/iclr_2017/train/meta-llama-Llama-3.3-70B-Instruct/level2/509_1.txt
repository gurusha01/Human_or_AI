This paper presents a novel approach to incorporating prior procedural knowledge into neural networks by introducing a differentiable interpreter for the Forth programming language. The authors propose a neural implementation of the dual stack machine underlying Forth, which enables programmers to write program sketches with slots that can be filled with behavior trained from program input-output data. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach on two tasks: sorting and addition.
The main claims of the paper are: (1) the introduction of a differentiable Forth abstract machine, (2) the ability to learn complex transduction tasks with substantially less data and better generalization, and (3) the presentation of neural program optimizations based on symbolic computation and parallel branching.
I decide to accept this paper with the following key reasons: 
1. The paper tackles a specific and well-defined problem of incorporating prior procedural knowledge into neural networks.
2. The approach is well-motivated and placed in the literature, drawing on existing work in program synthesis, probabilistic programming, and neural approaches to language compilation.
3. The paper provides a clear and detailed description of the differentiable Forth abstract machine and its implementation, as well as empirical results demonstrating its effectiveness.
The paper provides strong support for its claims, including empirical results on two tasks and a detailed analysis of the program counter traces. The approach is also well-motivated, with a clear explanation of the need for incorporating prior procedural knowledge into neural networks.
To improve the paper, I suggest the following additional feedback: 
1. Provide more details on the training procedure, including the hyperparameter settings and the optimization algorithm used.
2. Consider adding more tasks or experiments to demonstrate the generality of the approach.
3. Provide more analysis on the relationship between the degree of prior knowledge and the difficulty of the problem, as well as the impact of the optimizations on the performance of the model.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper are: 
1. How do the authors plan to extend this approach to more complex programming languages or tasks?
2. Can the authors provide more insight into the trade-offs between using more or less prior knowledge in the sketches, and how this affects the performance of the model?
3. How do the authors plan to address the issue of incongruencies between traditional language properties and the desire for neural networks to learn behaviors that generalize to unseen data?
