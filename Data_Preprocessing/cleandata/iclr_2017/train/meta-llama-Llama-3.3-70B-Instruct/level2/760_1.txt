This paper introduces the Hierarchical Compositional Network (HCN), a directed generative model that can discover and disentangle the building blocks of binary images without supervision. The HCN is a multilayer model that uses a combination of AND, OR, and POOL factors to represent the compositional hierarchy of the images. The authors propose using max-product message passing (MPMP) to perform inference and learning in the HCN, which is a challenging task due to the loopy structure of the model.
The paper claims to contribute to the field of computer vision and machine learning by introducing a novel model that can learn hierarchical representations of images without supervision. The authors also claim that the HCN can be used for classification, missing value imputation, and other tasks, and that it has advantages over existing models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs).
I decide to accept this paper because it presents a novel and well-motivated approach to hierarchical feature learning, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the HCN in discovering and disentangling the building blocks of binary images. The paper is well-written and provides a clear explanation of the model and the inference and learning algorithms.
One of the key reasons for accepting this paper is that it addresses a specific question or problem in the field, namely the discovery and disentanglement of hierarchical representations of images without supervision. The approach is well-motivated and the authors provide a clear explanation of the model and the algorithms used to perform inference and learning.
The paper also provides a thorough evaluation of the HCN, including experiments on synthetic and real-world data, and comparisons with existing models such as CNNs and VAEs. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the HCN in discovering and disentangling the building blocks of images, and the authors provide a clear discussion of the advantages and limitations of the model.
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the implementation of the MPMP algorithm, including the choice of hyperparameters and the initialization of the messages. Additionally, the authors could provide more comparisons with existing models, such as other generative models or deep learning architectures, to further demonstrate the advantages of the HCN.
Some questions that I would like the authors to answer include: How does the choice of hyperparameters affect the performance of the HCN? How does the initialization of the messages affect the convergence of the MPMP algorithm? Can the HCN be used for other tasks, such as image generation or image editing, and if so, how?
Overall, I believe that this paper presents a novel and well-motivated approach to hierarchical feature learning, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the HCN in discovering and disentangling the building blocks of binary images. With some minor revisions to address the questions and suggestions above, I believe that this paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of computer vision and machine learning.
