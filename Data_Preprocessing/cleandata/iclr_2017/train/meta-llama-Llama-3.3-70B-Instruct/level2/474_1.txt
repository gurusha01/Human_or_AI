This paper presents MUS-ROVER II, an extension of the authors' previous work on automatic music theorists, which aims to learn and represent music concepts in a human-interpretable way. The main claim of the paper is that MUS-ROVER II can learn hierarchical rules and represent them in a way that is more cognitive and dynamic than previous approaches.
The paper is well-motivated, and the authors provide a clear overview of the background and related work in music theory and artificial intelligence. The approach is well-placed in the literature, and the authors demonstrate a good understanding of the field.
The paper supports its claims through a combination of theoretical analysis, experiments, and comparisons to existing music theory and pedagogy. The results show that MUS-ROVER II can learn rules that are comparable to those taught in music theory classes, and that the system can be used to generate personalized syllabi for learning music composition.
The approach is novel and improves upon existing methods in several ways. The use of hierarchical filters and adaptive memory selection allows the system to learn more complex and nuanced rules than previous approaches. The authors also demonstrate the potential of the system for applications beyond music, such as style recognition and synthesis.
However, there are some limitations to the paper. The authors could provide more detail on the implementation of the system and the experiments, particularly in terms of the dataset used and the evaluation metrics. Additionally, the paper could benefit from more discussion on the potential applications and implications of the research.
Overall, I would accept this paper, as it presents a significant contribution to the field of music theory and artificial intelligence. The approach is novel, well-motivated, and well-supported by experiments and analysis.
To improve the paper, I would suggest the following:
* Provide more detail on the implementation of the system and the experiments, particularly in terms of the dataset used and the evaluation metrics.
* Discuss the potential applications and implications of the research in more depth.
* Consider adding more comparisons to existing music theory and pedagogy to further demonstrate the effectiveness of the system.
* Provide more insight into the cognitive and dynamic aspects of the system, and how they improve upon existing approaches.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer:
* Can you provide more detail on the dataset used for training and testing the system?
* How do you evaluate the effectiveness of the system, and what metrics do you use to compare it to existing music theory and pedagogy?
* Can you discuss the potential applications of the system beyond music, and how it could be used in other domains?
* How do you see the system being used in practice, and what are the potential benefits and limitations of its use?
