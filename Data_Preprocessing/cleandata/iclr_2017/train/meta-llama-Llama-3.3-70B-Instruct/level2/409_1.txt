This paper introduces MusicNet, a large-scale music dataset designed to serve as a source of supervision and evaluation for machine learning methods in music research. The dataset consists of hundreds of freely-licensed classical music recordings, along with instrument/note annotations, resulting in over 1 million temporal labels on 34 hours of chamber music performances. The authors define a multi-label classification task to predict notes in musical recordings and benchmark several machine learning architectures for this task.
I decide to accept this paper, with the primary reason being the significant contribution of MusicNet to the music research community. The dataset is large, diverse, and well-annotated, making it a valuable resource for training and evaluating machine learning models. The authors' experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of end-to-end models in learning low-level features of musical audio, which modestly outperform traditional spectrogram features.
The paper is well-motivated, and the approach is well-placed in the literature. The authors provide a clear overview of the related work and demonstrate a good understanding of the challenges and opportunities in music research. The experiments are well-designed, and the results are thoroughly evaluated using various metrics.
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the dataset construction process, including the selection of recordings, annotation methodology, and quality control measures. Additionally, the authors could explore more advanced machine learning architectures, such as recurrent neural networks or attention-based models, to further improve the performance of note prediction.
I would like the authors to answer the following questions to clarify my understanding of the paper:
1. Can you provide more information on the licensing agreements for the MusicNet dataset, and how will it be made available to the research community?
2. How do you plan to address the issue of class imbalance in the dataset, where some instruments or notes are under-represented?
3. Can you provide more details on the evaluation protocol used to assess the performance of the machine learning models, and how do you plan to establish a benchmark for future research in this area?
