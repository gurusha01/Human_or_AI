This paper proposes a novel deep learning model, GRU-D, to effectively handle missing values in multivariate time series data. The model captures informative missingness by incorporating masking and time interval directly inside the GRU architecture. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their model on both synthetic and real-world healthcare datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance.
I decide to accept this paper for the following reasons:
1. The paper tackles a specific and well-defined problem, namely handling missing values in multivariate time series data, which is a common challenge in many applications.
2. The approach is well-motivated, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the limitations of existing methods and how their proposed model addresses these limitations.
3. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model, GRU-D, in achieving better performance than strong baselines on multiple datasets.
The supporting arguments for my decision include:
* The paper provides a thorough review of existing methods for handling missing values in time series data, highlighting their limitations and motivating the need for a new approach.
* The authors propose a novel model, GRU-D, which incorporates masking and time interval directly into the GRU architecture, allowing it to capture informative missingness.
* The experimental results are comprehensive, including comparisons with multiple baselines, and demonstrate the effectiveness of GRU-D in achieving better performance on multiple datasets.
To improve the paper, I suggest the authors provide additional feedback on the following points:
* It would be helpful to include more details on the hyperparameter tuning process for the proposed model and the baselines.
* The authors could provide more insights into the interpretability of the proposed model, such as how the decay rates are learned and how they relate to the missing patterns in the data.
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion on the potential applications of the proposed model in real-world scenarios, such as healthcare and finance.
Questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper include:
* Can you provide more details on the implementation of the GRU-D model, such as the specific architecture and hyperparameters used?
* How do the authors plan to extend the proposed model to handle more complex missing patterns, such as missing-not-at-random data?
* Can you provide more insights into the computational complexity of the proposed model and how it compares to the baselines?
