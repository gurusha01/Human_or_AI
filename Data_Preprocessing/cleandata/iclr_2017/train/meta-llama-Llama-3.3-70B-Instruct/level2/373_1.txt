This paper presents a transfer learning approach for sequence tagging tasks, leveraging the generality of deep neural networks to improve performance on target tasks with limited annotations. The authors propose three neural network architectures for cross-domain, cross-application, and cross-lingual transfer, and demonstrate significant improvements on various datasets under low-resource conditions.
I decide to accept this paper, with the main reasons being the novelty of the approach and the thorough experimental evaluation. The paper presents a well-motivated and well-placed approach in the literature, and the results show that the proposed transfer learning method can achieve state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets.
The supporting arguments for this decision include the fact that the paper provides a clear and concise introduction to the problem of sequence tagging and the concept of transfer learning, and that the proposed approach is well-supported by experimental results. The authors also provide a thorough analysis of the factors that affect the performance of the transfer learning approach, including label abundance, task relatedness, and parameter sharing.
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the hyperparameter tuning process and the sensitivity of the results to different hyperparameter settings. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more analysis on the types of tasks that benefit most from transfer learning and the reasons behind these benefits.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer include: How do the results change when using different types of neural network architectures, such as convolutional neural networks or recurrent neural networks with different types of gates? How does the performance of the transfer learning approach change when the source and target tasks have different types of annotations, such as token-level vs. sentence-level annotations? What are the potential applications of this approach beyond sequence tagging tasks, and how could it be extended to other types of natural language processing tasks?
