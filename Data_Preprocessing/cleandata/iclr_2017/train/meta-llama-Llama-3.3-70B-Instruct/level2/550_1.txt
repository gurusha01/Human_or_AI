Summary of the Paper
The paper proposes a modified objective function for Denoising Autoencoders (DAEs) that explicitly enforces the denoising process to occur during the encoding phase. The authors argue that the original DAE objective function does not guarantee robustness in the encoding phase, and their modification aims to address this limitation. The modified objective function adds a penalty term to the encoding space, which encourages the encoder to learn a more robust representation of the input data.
Decision
I decide to Accept this paper, with the main reason being that the authors propose a well-motivated and simple modification to the DAE objective function that leads to improved robustness in the encoding phase. The paper provides a clear and concise explanation of the modified objective function, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a thorough analysis of the modified objective function, including its relationship to the conditional entropy of the code given the inputs. The authors also provide a clear explanation of the architectural considerations and the encoding loss function, which helps to understand the implementation details of the proposed approach. The experimental results on synthetic data and the MNIST dataset demonstrate the ability of the modified DAE to learn useful encoding mappings and regularized input-output relationships.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more detailed comparisons with other related approaches, such as contractive autoencoders and variational autoencoders. Additionally, it would be helpful to include more visualizations of the learned representations and the energy landscapes of the modified DAE. Finally, the authors may want to consider exploring the application of the modified DAE to more complex datasets and tasks, such as image classification and generation.
