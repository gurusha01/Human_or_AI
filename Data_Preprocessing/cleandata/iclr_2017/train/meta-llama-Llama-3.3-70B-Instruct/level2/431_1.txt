The paper "PALEO: An Analytical Performance Model for Scalable Deep Learning Systems" presents a novel approach to modeling the performance of deep learning systems. The authors claim that their model, PALEO, can accurately estimate the execution time of training and deploying deep neural networks on various hardware and software configurations. The main contribution of the paper is the development of a performance model that can help practitioners and developers design and optimize scalable deep learning systems.
I decide to accept this paper with the following reasons: 
1. The paper tackles a specific and important problem in the field of deep learning, which is the scalability of deep learning systems. 
2. The approach is well-motivated and placed in the literature, with a clear understanding of the design space of algorithms, hardware, and communication strategies.
The supporting arguments for this decision are as follows: 
* The paper provides a thorough analysis of the computation and communication time of deep neural networks, which is essential for understanding the scalability of these systems.
* The authors evaluate their model on various case studies, including different neural network architectures, hardware configurations, and communication schemes, which demonstrates the robustness and accuracy of PALEO.
* The paper also provides hypothetical setups to analyze the scalability of different models under various communication schemes, which shows the potential of PALEO in designing and optimizing scalable deep learning systems.
Additional feedback to improve the paper includes: 
* Providing more details on the implementation of PALEO, such as the specific algorithms and data structures used, to facilitate reproducibility.
* Including more case studies on different types of neural networks, such as recurrent neural networks or transformers, to demonstrate the applicability of PALEO to a broader range of deep learning systems.
* Discussing the limitations of PALEO, such as the assumption of perfect parallelization and the lack of consideration for other factors that may affect scalability, such as memory usage and synchronization overhead.
Questions to the authors include: 
* How does PALEO handle the variability in computation and communication time across different iterations of the training process?
* Can PALEO be used to optimize the design of deep learning systems for specific hardware configurations, such as GPUs or TPUs?
* How does PALEO compare to other performance modeling approaches, such as simulation-based or empirical modeling, in terms of accuracy and scalability?
