This paper explores the possibility of learning chess game concepts under weak supervision with convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The authors propose a novel approach to confirm whether a CNN understands game concepts by using class activation mapping (CAM) to visualize the network's attention. The paper claims to contribute to three main areas: (1) learning game concepts under weak supervision, (2) applying cross-modal supervision for representation learning, and (3) demonstrating that CAM can activate at non-salient regions.
I decide to accept this paper with the following key reasons: 
1. The paper tackles a specific and interesting question of whether a CNN can learn game concepts under weak supervision, and 
2. The approach is well-motivated and supported by experiments.
The paper provides a clear and well-structured introduction to the problem, methodology, and technique background. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through four experiments, including varying the chessboard appearance and piece appearance. The results show that the network can learn game concepts, such as the chessboard grid and winning rule, and that CAM can activate at non-salient regions.
To further improve the paper, I suggest the authors provide more details on the training process, such as the hyperparameters used and the computational resources required. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more analysis on the robustness of the approach to different types of games and scenarios.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper include: 
1. How do the authors plan to extend this approach to more complex games, such as chess or Go? 
2. Can the authors provide more insights into the network's decision-making process, such as visualizing the feature maps or analyzing the weights? 
3. How does the authors' approach compare to other methods for learning game concepts, such as reinforcement learning or imitation learning? 
Overall, the paper presents a novel and interesting approach to learning game concepts under weak supervision, and the experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach. With some additional details and analysis, the paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field.
