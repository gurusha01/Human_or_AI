The paper "Ensemble Policy Optimization for Robust Learning in Complex Environments" presents a novel approach to reinforcement learning, specifically designed to tackle the challenges of learning policies in complex, real-world environments. The authors introduce the Ensemble Policy Optimization (EPOpt) algorithm, which uses an ensemble of simulated source domains and adversarial training to learn robust policies that generalize to a broad range of possible target domains.
The main claims of the paper are that EPOpt can learn policies that are robust to model mismatch, unmodeled effects, and can adapt to changing environments. The authors support these claims through a series of experiments on simulated robotic tasks, including the hopper and half-cheetah tasks. The results show that EPOpt outperforms standard policy search methods, such as TRPO, in terms of robustness and generalization.
I decide to accept this paper because it presents a well-motivated and well-executed approach to reinforcement learning in complex environments. The authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, and the EPOpt algorithm is well-described and easy to follow. The experimental results are thorough and demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.
One of the key strengths of the paper is its ability to tackle the challenge of model mismatch, which is a major obstacle in reinforcement learning. The authors show that EPOpt can learn policies that are robust to changes in the environment, even when the changes are not modeled in the source domain. This is a significant contribution to the field, as it enables the application of reinforcement learning to real-world problems where the environment is complex and uncertain.
The paper also provides a good discussion of the related work, and the authors clearly position their approach within the context of existing research in reinforcement learning and robust control. The writing is clear and concise, and the paper is well-organized and easy to follow.
To improve the paper, I would suggest that the authors provide more details on the implementation of the EPOpt algorithm, including the specific hyperparameters used in the experiments. Additionally, it would be helpful to see more results on the robustness of the policies learned by EPOpt, including experiments on more complex environments and tasks.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer are: How does the choice of ensemble size and distribution affect the performance of EPOpt? Can the authors provide more insights into the trade-off between robustness and performance in EPOpt? How does EPOpt compare to other approaches to reinforcement learning, such as model-based RL and imitation learning?
Overall, I believe that this paper presents a significant contribution to the field of reinforcement learning, and I recommend it for acceptance.
