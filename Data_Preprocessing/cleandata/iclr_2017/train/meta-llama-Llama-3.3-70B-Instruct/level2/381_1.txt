The paper proposes a novel approach for pruning convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to enable efficient inference. The authors introduce a new criterion based on Taylor expansion to approximate the change in the cost function induced by pruning network parameters. The method is evaluated on various datasets, including Birds-200, Flowers-102, and ImageNet, and demonstrates superior performance compared to other pruning criteria.
The main claims of the paper are: (1) the proposed Taylor expansion-based criterion is effective for pruning CNNs, (2) the method can achieve significant reduction in computational cost while maintaining good generalization performance, and (3) the approach is flexible and can be applied to various CNN architectures and tasks.
Based on the evaluation, I decide to Accept this paper. The reasons for this decision are: (1) the paper presents a novel and well-motivated approach for pruning CNNs, (2) the method is thoroughly evaluated on various datasets and demonstrates superior performance compared to other pruning criteria, and (3) the paper provides a detailed analysis of the results and discusses the limitations of the approach.
The supporting arguments for this decision are: (1) the paper provides a clear and concise introduction to the problem of pruning CNNs and motivates the need for a new approach, (2) the proposed Taylor expansion-based criterion is well-justified and easy to implement, (3) the experimental evaluation is thorough and demonstrates the effectiveness of the method, and (4) the paper discusses the limitations of the approach and provides suggestions for future work.
Additional feedback to improve the paper includes: (1) providing more details on the implementation of the Taylor expansion-based criterion, (2) discussing the computational cost of the method and comparing it to other pruning approaches, and (3) exploring the application of the method to other deep learning architectures and tasks.
