The paper proposes a novel neural machine translation model that introduces a continuous latent variable containing an underlying semantic extracted from both texts and images. The model, which can be trained end-to-end, requires image information only when training and outperforms the baseline in both METEOR and BLEU scores. The authors claim that their model can generate more accurate translations, especially for short sentences, and that it can capture the meaning of materials in the source sentence more accurately than the baseline model.
I decide to accept this paper with the following reasons: 
1. The paper tackles a specific and well-motivated question, which is to improve neural machine translation by incorporating image information.
2. The approach is well-placed in the literature, building upon existing work on variational neural machine translation and multimodal translation.
The paper provides supporting arguments for the claims, including experimental results on the Multi30k dataset, which show that the proposed model outperforms the baseline in both METEOR and BLEU scores. The authors also provide a qualitative analysis of the results, which suggests that the model can translate nouns accurately but may make grammatical errors.
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the experimental setup, such as the hyperparameters used and the training procedure. Additionally, it would be helpful to include more examples of translations generated by the model, as well as a more detailed analysis of the errors made by the model.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper include:
* How did the authors choose the hyperparameters for the model, and what was the effect of different hyperparameters on the results?
* Can the authors provide more details on the qualitative analysis of the results, such as how they selected the examples to include and what criteria they used to evaluate the translations?
* How does the model perform on longer sentences, and are there any plans to extend the model to handle more complex sentences or larger datasets?
