The paper presents a novel approach to transfer learning, leveraging pre-trained neural networks as modules and combining them with untrained modules to learn the shift in distributions between data sets. The authors claim that their neuro-modular approach outperforms traditional fine-tuning methods, particularly when dealing with small amounts of training data.
I decide to accept this paper, with the primary reason being that the approach is well-motivated and supported by comprehensive experiments on various datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Stanford Cars, and IMDB sentiment. The authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of their methodology, and the results demonstrate significant improvements over traditional fine-tuning methods, especially in the small data regime.
The paper is well-structured, and the authors provide a thorough review of related work in transfer learning. The experiments are well-designed, and the results are presented in a clear and concise manner. The authors also acknowledge the limitations of their approach and provide suggestions for future research.
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more detailed analysis of the learned representations and features in the modular approach. Additionally, it would be beneficial to explore more efficient architectures and training strategies, as mentioned in the conclusion. I would like the authors to answer the following questions: (1) How do the learned representations in the modular approach differ from those learned through traditional fine-tuning? (2) Can the authors provide more insights into the choice of hyperparameters and their impact on the performance of the modular approach? (3) How does the modular approach perform in comparison to other state-of-the-art transfer learning methods, such as progressive neural networks? 
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of transfer learning, and with some minor revisions, it has the potential to be a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the field.
