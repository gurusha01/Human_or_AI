This paper proposes the use of Annealed Importance Sampling (AIS) for evaluating log-likelihoods of decoder-based generative models, such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and Generative Moment Matching Networks (GMMNs). The authors validate the accuracy of AIS using Bidirectional Monte Carlo (BDMC) and demonstrate its effectiveness in estimating log-likelihoods, which is a crucial measure of a generative model's performance.
The paper claims to contribute to the field by providing a more accurate and reliable method for evaluating decoder-based generative models, which is essential for understanding their behavior and improving their performance. The authors also analyze the performance of different models, including VAEs, GANs, and GMMNs, and provide insights into their strengths and weaknesses.
I decide to accept this paper because it addresses a significant problem in the field of generative models, and the proposed method, AIS, is well-motivated and validated through extensive experiments. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the methodology and results.
The key reasons for my decision are:
1. The paper tackles a crucial problem in the field of generative models, which is the evaluation of decoder-based models.
2. The proposed method, AIS, is well-motivated and validated through extensive experiments, demonstrating its effectiveness in estimating log-likelihoods.
3. The paper provides insights into the performance of different models, including VAEs, GANs, and GMMNs, which is essential for understanding their behavior and improving their performance.
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors:
1. Provide more details on the implementation of AIS and BDMC, including the choice of hyperparameters and the computational resources required.
2. Compare the performance of AIS with other log-likelihood estimators, such as Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) and Importance Weighted Autoencoder (IWAE), in more detail.
3. Investigate the applicability of AIS to other types of generative models, such as flow-based models and autoregressive models.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer are:
1. How do the authors choose the number of intermediate distributions and the transition operator for AIS?
2. Can the authors provide more details on the computational resources required for running AIS and BDMC?
3. How do the authors plan to extend the proposed method to other types of generative models?
