The paper "Paying More Attention to Attention: Improving the Performance of Convolutional Neural Networks via Attention Transfer" proposes a novel approach to improve the performance of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) by transferring attention from a powerful teacher network to a smaller student network. The authors define attention as a set of spatial maps that encode the importance of different spatial areas of the input for the network's output decision. They propose two types of attention maps: activation-based and gradient-based, and demonstrate that transferring attention from a teacher network to a student network can significantly improve the student's performance.
I decide to accept this paper with the following reasons: 
1. The paper tackles a specific and well-defined problem, which is how to improve the performance of CNNs by transferring attention from a teacher network to a student network.
2. The approach is well-motivated and placed in the literature, with a clear explanation of the concept of attention and its importance in CNNs.
3. The paper provides extensive experimental results, including comparisons with other knowledge transfer methods, such as knowledge distillation, and demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed attention transfer approach.
The supporting arguments for the decision include:
* The paper provides a clear and concise explanation of the concept of attention and its importance in CNNs.
* The authors propose two types of attention maps, activation-based and gradient-based, and demonstrate their effectiveness in transferring attention from a teacher network to a student network.
* The experimental results are extensive and well-organized, including comparisons with other knowledge transfer methods, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed attention transfer approach.
Additional feedback to improve the paper includes:
* Providing more details on the implementation of the attention transfer approach, such as the specific architecture of the teacher and student networks, and the hyperparameters used in the experiments.
* Discussing the potential limitations of the attention transfer approach, such as the requirement for a powerful teacher network, and the potential impact on the student network's performance.
* Exploring the application of the attention transfer approach to other tasks, such as object detection and weakly-supervised localization, as mentioned in the conclusion.
Questions to the authors include:
* Can you provide more details on the specific architecture of the teacher and student networks used in the experiments?
* How did you choose the hyperparameters for the attention transfer approach, such as the value of Î² in equation 2?
* Have you explored the application of the attention transfer approach to other tasks, such as object detection and weakly-supervised localization, and if so, what were the results?
