This paper proposes a character-aware attention residual network for short text classification, which addresses the challenges of feature sparsity and noise in short texts. The authors claim that their model outperforms state-of-the-art models on several short text datasets.
I decide to accept this paper with some minor revisions. The main reasons for this decision are: (1) the paper tackles a specific and important problem in text classification, and (2) the approach is well-motivated and grounded in the literature. The authors provide a clear and concise overview of the related work and demonstrate a good understanding of the field.
The paper supports its claims with empirical results on several datasets, including Tweets, Question, and AG News. The results show that the proposed model outperforms baseline models, including traditional models such as TF-SVM and TFIDF-SVM, as well as deep learning models like Lg. Conv and Sm. Conv. The authors also provide an ablation study to demonstrate the effectiveness of different components of their model, including the character-aware attention mechanism and the residual network.
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the experimental setup, such as the hyperparameter tuning process and the evaluation metrics used. Additionally, it would be helpful to include more analysis on the results, such as the types of errors made by the model and the potential limitations of the approach.
Some specific questions I would like the authors to address in their revision are: (1) How did the authors tune the hyperparameters of their model, and what was the effect of different hyperparameter settings on the results? (2) Can the authors provide more insight into the types of features that are being learned by the character-aware attention mechanism and the residual network? (3) How does the proposed model handle out-of-vocabulary words, and what is the effect of using pre-trained word embeddings versus training them from scratch?
Overall, this is a well-written and well-structured paper that makes a significant contribution to the field of text classification. With some minor revisions to address the above questions and provide more details on the experimental setup, I believe this paper has the potential to be a strong addition to the conference program.
