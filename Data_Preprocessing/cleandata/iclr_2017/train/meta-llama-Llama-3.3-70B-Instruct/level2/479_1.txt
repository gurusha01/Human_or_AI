The paper proposes a novel computational hypothesis testing framework based on memory-augmented neural networks (MANN) for language comprehension tasks. The approach involves a hypothesis testing loop that refines a previously formed hypothesis to generate new hypotheses, mimicking human reasoning. The authors apply this framework to cloze-type question answering tasks using Neural Semantic Encoders (NSE) and achieve state-of-the-art results on two benchmark datasets, Children's Book Test (CBT) and Who-Did-What (WDW).
I decide to accept this paper with two key reasons: (1) the proposed approach is well-motivated and grounded in cognitive science, and (2) the experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over previous state-of-the-art models.
The paper provides a clear and concise overview of the hypothesis testing process in human cognition and its inspiration for the proposed framework. The authors also provide a thorough review of related work in language comprehension and machine reading, highlighting the limitations of existing approaches. The proposed NSE models with dynamic reasoning and halting mechanisms are well-explained, and the experimental results are rigorously evaluated on two large-scale datasets.
To further improve the paper, I suggest the authors provide more analysis on the query regression process and the effect of different hyperparameters on the model's performance. Additionally, it would be interesting to see how the proposed approach can be applied to other AI tasks, such as language-based conversational tasks, link prediction, and knowledge inference.
I would like the authors to answer the following questions to clarify my understanding of the paper: (1) How do the authors plan to extend the proposed approach to other AI tasks, and what modifications would be necessary? (2) Can the authors provide more insights into the query regression process and how the model decides to halt the reasoning process? (3) How do the authors plan to address the overfitting issue that occurs when the number of permitted steps is large?
