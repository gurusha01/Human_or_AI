This paper proposes a novel approach to quantify human intention by applying competitive learning to human behavior prediction as supervised learning. The authors aim to extract a driver's potential intention by utilizing competitive learning, which generates several outputs associated with several potential situations imagined by a human. The proposed method is applied to human driving behavior, and the results show a significant reduction in squared error compared to a conventional method.
I decide to accept this paper, with the main reason being that the approach is well-motivated and the results are promising. The authors provide a clear explanation of the competitive learning architecture and its application to driver behavior modeling. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in extracting potential driving intentions and improving prediction accuracy.
The paper supports its claims with a thorough evaluation of the proposed method, including a comparison with a baseline architecture and an analysis of the extracted driving intentions. The authors also discuss the importance of pre-training for competitive learning and demonstrate its effectiveness in improving the robustness of the model against noisy data.
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the implementation of the competitive learning architecture, such as the specific hyperparameters used and the optimization algorithm employed. Additionally, it would be helpful to include more visualizations of the extracted driving intentions and their corresponding predictions to better illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper include:
* How did the authors select the number of output layers (No) in the competitive learning architecture, and what is the effect of varying this parameter on the results?
* Can the authors provide more insights into the pre-training technique used for competitive learning, and how it helps to initialize the parallel competitive layers?
* How do the authors plan to extend the proposed method to more complex driving scenarios, such as urban driving or driving in the presence of pedestrians and other vehicles?
