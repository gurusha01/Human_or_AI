This paper proposes a novel algorithm, b-GAN, which learns a deep generative model from a density ratio estimation perspective. The authors derive a unified algorithm that employs well-studied results regarding density ratio estimation and provide experimental insights that Pearson divergence and estimating relative density ratio are useful to improve the stability of GAN learning.
The paper is well-structured, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the proposed algorithm and its connection to existing GAN variants. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in generating natural images.
Based on the conference guidelines, I will answer the three key questions:
1. What is the specific question/problem tackled by the paper?
The paper tackles the problem of learning a deep generative model using a density ratio estimation perspective, which is a novel approach to GANs.
2. Is the approach well-motivated, including being well-placed in the literature?
The approach is well-motivated, and the authors provide a clear connection to existing GAN variants and density ratio estimation literature. The paper is well-placed in the literature, and the authors demonstrate a good understanding of the existing research in the field.
3. Does the paper support the claims?
The paper provides experimental results that support the claims made by the authors. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in generating natural images and provide insights into the stability of GAN learning.
Based on these questions, I decide to accept the paper. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the proposed algorithm and its connection to existing research.
