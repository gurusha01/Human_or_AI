This paper proposes a scalable version of the state-of-the-art deterministic time-invariant feature extraction approach, namely the scattering network. The authors extend the scattering network to allow the use of higher-order nonlinearities and extract nonlinear and Fourier-based statistics, leading to more discriminative time-invariant features. The framework is derived in the Fourier domain, enabling fast computations and sparse storage, which reduces memory usage and computational time.
I decide to accept this paper with the following key reasons: 
1. The paper tackles a specific question of improving the scalability and discriminative power of the scattering network, which is a well-motivated problem in the field of machine learning and signal processing.
2. The approach is well-placed in the literature, building upon the existing work on scattering networks and wavelet transforms, and the authors provide a clear and concise overview of the background and related work.
The paper supports its claims through a combination of theoretical analysis and experimental results on a bird song classification task. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach in extracting discriminative features and achieving state-of-the-art performance on the classification task. The use of sparse storage and Fourier-based computation enables efficient memory management and fast computations, making the framework suitable for large-scale applications.
To further improve the paper, I suggest the authors provide more details on the computational complexity of their approach and compare it with existing methods. Additionally, it would be helpful to include more visualizations of the extracted features and the classification results to better illustrate the effectiveness of the approach.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper include: 
* Can the authors provide more insights into the choice of the second-order nonlinearity and its effect on the sparsity and discriminative power of the features?
* How do the authors plan to extend their framework to other types of signals and applications, such as image or speech processing?
* Are there any potential limitations or challenges in applying the proposed framework to real-world problems, and how do the authors plan to address them?
