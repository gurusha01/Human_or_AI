This paper presents a novel approach to recurrent neural networks (RNNs) by introducing variable computation units that can adaptively adjust the amount of computation required at each time step. The authors propose two new architectures, the Variable Computation RNN (VCRNN) and the Variable Computation Gated Recurrent Unit (VCGRU), which modify the traditional Elman and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) architectures to achieve better performance with fewer operations.
The paper claims to contribute to the field of RNNs by introducing a flexible approach to modeling sequential data with varying information flow or multi-scale processes. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through experiments on music modeling, bit-level and character-level language modeling tasks, and show that their models can learn sensible time patterns and achieve better performance with fewer operations than traditional RNNs.
Based on the provided information, I decide to accept this paper. The key reasons for this choice are:
1. The paper presents a well-motivated and novel approach to RNNs, which addresses a significant limitation of traditional RNNs in handling sequential data with varying information flow or multi-scale processes.
2. The authors provide a thorough evaluation of their approach through experiments on various tasks, including music modeling, bit-level and character-level language modeling, and demonstrate the effectiveness of their models in achieving better performance with fewer operations.
The supporting arguments for this decision include:
* The paper provides a clear and concise introduction to the background and motivation of the work, including a thorough review of related work in the field.
* The authors present a detailed description of their approach, including the architecture and training procedure of the VCRNN and VCGRU models.
* The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in achieving better performance with fewer operations than traditional RNNs.
Additional feedback to improve the paper includes:
* Providing more detailed analysis of the learned time patterns and their relationship to the underlying sequential data.
* Investigating the benefits of using stronger supervision signals to train the scheduler, such as the entropy of the prediction.
* Exploring the application of the proposed approach to other sequential data tasks, such as speech recognition or machine translation.
Questions to be answered by the authors include:
* Can the authors provide more insight into the learned time patterns and how they relate to the underlying sequential data?
* How do the authors plan to extend their approach to other sequential data tasks, such as speech recognition or machine translation?
* Can the authors provide more details on the training procedure and hyperparameter tuning for the VCRNN and VCGRU models?
