This paper provides a comprehensive overview of implicit generative models, with a focus on likelihood-free inference methods. The authors develop a rich view of this growing area of machine learning, building connections to statistical thinking and related fields such as econometrics and approximate Bayesian computation. The paper claims to contribute to the understanding of generative adversarial networks (GANs) and their connection to likelihood-free inference, hypothesis testing, and density ratio estimation.
I decide to accept this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the paper provides a clear and well-motivated approach to likelihood-free inference, which is a significant challenge in implicit generative models. The authors develop a principled framework for learning in these models, using hypothesis testing and density ratio estimation as the driving principles. Secondly, the paper establishes connections between GANs, approximate Bayesian computation, and other related areas, providing a unified view of these techniques and highlighting opportunities for cross-pollination.
The paper supports its claims through a thorough analysis of the relationships between different approaches to density ratio estimation, including class-probability estimation, divergence minimisation, ratio matching, and moment matching. The authors provide a detailed derivation of the objective functions used in GANs and other related methods, demonstrating a deep understanding of the underlying principles. The paper also discusses the advantages and limitations of each approach, providing a balanced view of the current state of the field.
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more concrete examples and empirical evaluations of the methods discussed. While the paper provides a thorough theoretical analysis, it would be helpful to see how these methods perform in practice, particularly in comparison to other approaches. Additionally, the authors could provide more guidance on the choice of loss function and the evaluation of implicit generative models, as these are important practical considerations.
I would like the authors to answer the following questions to clarify my understanding of the paper: (1) Can you provide more details on how the density ratio estimation methods can be used for Bayesian inference in implicit models? (2) How do the authors plan to address the challenge of non-differentiable models, and what are the potential applications of these methods in practice? (3) Can you discuss the relationship between the proposed methods and other likelihood-free inference techniques, such as noise-contrastive estimation and variational inference?
