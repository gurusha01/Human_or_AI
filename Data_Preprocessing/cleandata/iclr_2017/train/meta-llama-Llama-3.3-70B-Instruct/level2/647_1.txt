This paper proposes a novel learning framework for solving inverse problems, which abandons the traditional separation between model and inference. The authors introduce Recurrent Inference Machines (RIMs), a class of recurrent neural networks that directly learn to solve inverse problems. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of RIMs in experiments on various image reconstruction tasks, showing that they can outperform state-of-the-art methods.
I decide to accept this paper, with the main reason being that it presents a well-motivated and innovative approach to solving inverse problems. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their framework and its advantages.
The approach is well-supported by experiments, which demonstrate the effectiveness of RIMs in various image reconstruction tasks. The paper also provides a thorough discussion of related work and the limitations of existing approaches. The authors' decision to abandon the traditional separation between model and inference is well-justified, and the proposed framework has the potential to bridge the gap between deep learning and inverse problems.
One potential limitation of the paper is that it focuses primarily on linear image reconstruction tasks. However, the authors acknowledge this limitation and suggest that the framework can be applied to inverse problems of all kinds, including non-linear inverse problems.
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the implementation of RIMs, including the specific architectures used and the hyperparameters chosen. Additionally, it would be helpful to see more comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods, particularly in the context of non-linear inverse problems.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper include:
* Can the authors provide more insight into the choice of the logistic sigmoid nonlinearity as the link function Î¨?
* How do the authors plan to extend the framework to non-linear inverse problems, and what challenges do they anticipate in doing so?
* Can the authors provide more details on the computational resources required to train and deploy RIMs, particularly in the context of large-scale inverse problems?
