This paper presents a novel approach to improving the generalization of supervised learning models by leveraging unsupervised learning to generate features that promote better extrapolation to unseen scenarios. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on the task of predicting the stability of towers of square blocks, achieving significant improvements in generalization performance compared to baseline models.
I decide to accept this paper, with the primary reason being the well-motivated approach and the convincing experimental results. The authors provide a clear and thorough explanation of their methodology, and the results show a significant improvement in generalization performance, especially when testing on scenarios with more bricks than during training.
The paper is well-structured, and the authors provide a comprehensive review of related work, highlighting the importance of unsupervised learning in improving the generalization of supervised models. The experimental setup is well-designed, and the results are thoroughly analyzed, providing insights into the strengths and limitations of the approach.
One potential limitation of the paper is the reliance on a specific dataset and task, which may limit the generalizability of the results. However, the authors acknowledge this limitation and provide a clear direction for future work, including extending the approach to more complex tasks and datasets.
To further improve the paper, I would suggest the authors provide more details on the hyperparameter tuning process and the sensitivity of the results to different hyperparameter settings. Additionally, it would be interesting to see a more detailed analysis of the features learned by the unsupervised model and how they contribute to the improved generalization performance.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper include:
* Can you provide more details on the architecture of the ConvDeconv and ConvLSTMDeconv models, including the specific layers and activation functions used?
* How did you select the hyperparameters for the unsupervised and supervised models, and what was the sensitivity of the results to different hyperparameter settings?
* Can you provide more insights into the features learned by the unsupervised model and how they contribute to the improved generalization performance?
* How do you plan to extend this work to more complex tasks and datasets, and what are the potential challenges and limitations of this approach?
