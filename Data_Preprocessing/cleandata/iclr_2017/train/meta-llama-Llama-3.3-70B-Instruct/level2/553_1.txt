This paper proposes a novel approach to near-data processing (NDP) for machine learning (ML) workloads using a solid-state drive (SSD) platform, called ISP-ML. The authors claim that their platform can simulate in-storage processing (ISP) of ML workloads and evaluate the potential of NDP for ML. They implement and compare three variants of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithms using ISP-ML and demonstrate the advantages of ISP over conventional in-host processing (IHP).
I decide to accept this paper with minor revisions. The main reasons for this decision are: (1) the paper tackles a specific and relevant problem in the field of ML and NDP, (2) the approach is well-motivated and grounded in the literature, and (3) the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed platform.
The supporting arguments for this decision are: (1) the paper provides a clear and concise overview of the background and related work, (2) the proposed ISP-ML platform is well-designed and implemented, and (3) the experimental results are thorough and demonstrate the advantages of ISP over IHP. Additionally, the paper identifies intriguing future research opportunities, such as exploiting parallelism inside SSDs and investigating the effect of NAND flash design on performance.
To improve the paper, I suggest the following minor revisions: (1) provide more details on the implementation of the ISP-ML platform, such as the specific hardware and software components used, (2) clarify the methodology used to compare the performance of ISP and IHP, and (3) discuss the potential limitations and challenges of the proposed approach.
I would like the authors to answer the following questions to clarify my understanding of the paper: (1) How does the ISP-ML platform handle data fragmentation and page size issues in SSDs? (2) Can the authors provide more details on the adaptive optimization algorithms they plan to implement in future work? (3) How do the authors plan to investigate the effect of NAND flash design on performance in future work? 
Overall, this paper presents a novel and well-motivated approach to NDP for ML workloads using an SSD platform. With minor revisions, it has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field.
