This paper proposes a novel deep learning framework called Marginal Deep Architectures (MDA) that leverages stacked feature learning models to handle small and middle-scale datasets. The authors claim that MDA outperforms traditional deep learning models and shallow feature learning models on various benchmark datasets.
I decide to accept this paper with minor revisions. The main reasons for this decision are:
1. The paper tackles a specific problem in deep learning, namely, the need for large-scale training data, and proposes a novel solution that combines the advantages of feature learning models and deep architectures.
2. The approach is well-motivated, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the proposed framework, including the use of marginal Fisher analysis (MFA) and deep learning tricks like backpropagation, denoising, and dropout.
The supporting arguments for this decision include:
* The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of MDA on various datasets, including handwritten digits recognition, speech recognition, and image classification.
* The authors provide a thorough evaluation of the proposed framework, including the impact of different structures and hyperparameters on the performance of MDA.
* The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the proposed approach and its advantages.
However, I would like the authors to address the following minor issues:
* Provide more details on the computational complexity of MDA and its comparison to traditional deep learning models.
* Discuss the potential limitations of MDA and its applicability to large-scale datasets.
* Consider adding more visualizations, such as plots or diagrams, to illustrate the performance of MDA on different datasets.
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
* Can you provide more details on the choice of MFA as the feature learning model in the proposed framework?
* How do you plan to extend the proposed framework to handle large-scale datasets?
* Can you provide more insights into the hyperparameter tuning process for MDA and its impact on the performance of the model?
