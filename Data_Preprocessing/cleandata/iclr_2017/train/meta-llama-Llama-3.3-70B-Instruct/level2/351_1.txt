This paper proposes a novel neural network parametrization, called Diet Networks, which reduces the number of free parameters in the fat layers of a model when the input is very high-dimensional. The authors tackle the problem of ancestry prediction based on SNP data, which is a relevant task in medical genetics. The main claim of the paper is that Diet Networks can significantly reduce both the number of parameters and the error rate of the classifier.
I decide to accept this paper, with the main reason being that the approach is well-motivated and the results are promising. The authors provide a clear explanation of the problem and the proposed solution, and the experimental results show that Diet Networks can achieve better performance than traditional methods, such as PCA, in terms of misclassification error.
The supporting arguments for this decision include the fact that the authors provide a thorough analysis of the problem and the proposed solution, and the experimental results are well-presented and easy to understand. The authors also provide a clear explanation of the feature embeddings used in the auxiliary networks, which is an important aspect of the proposed approach.
To improve the paper, I would suggest that the authors provide more details on the computational resources required to train the Diet Networks, as well as the time complexity of the algorithm. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more experiments on different datasets and tasks to further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
I would like to ask the authors to clarify the following points: (1) How do the authors choose the number of hidden units in the auxiliary networks? (2) Can the authors provide more details on the feature embeddings used in the auxiliary networks, such as the dimensionality of the embeddings and the number of parameters required to learn the embeddings? (3) How do the authors plan to extend the proposed approach to more complex tasks, such as genetic association studies? 
Overall, the paper is well-written and provides a clear explanation of the proposed approach and the experimental results. With some minor revisions, the paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of deep learning and medical genetics.
