The paper proposes a Context-aware Attention Network (CAN) for Interactive Question Answering (IQA) tasks. The model uses Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) networks as encoders for statements and questions, and another GRU as a decoder for outputs. The approach employs context-dependent word-level attention and question-guided sentence-level attention to accurately understand when to output an answer or generate a supplementary question for additional input. The model also incorporates user feedback to update sentence-level attention and infer the answer.
I decide to accept this paper with the following key reasons: 
1. The paper tackles a specific and well-defined problem in the field of question answering, which is handling incomplete information and uncertain situations.
2. The approach is well-motivated and placed in the literature, building upon existing sequence-to-sequence models and attention mechanisms.
3. The paper provides extensive experiments on both QA and IQA datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed model over state-of-the-art baseline methods.
The supporting arguments for the decision include:
* The model's ability to accurately understand when to output an answer or generate a supplementary question, which is a key capability for intelligent QA models.
* The use of context-dependent word-level attention and question-guided sentence-level attention, which allows the model to focus on relevant words and sentences.
* The incorporation of user feedback to update sentence-level attention and infer the answer, which enables the model to adapt to new information and improve its performance.
Additional feedback to improve the paper includes:
* Providing more detailed analysis of the results, such as error analysis and comparison with other state-of-the-art models.
* Exploring the use of other attention mechanisms, such as multi-head attention or self-attention, to further improve the model's performance.
* Investigating the application of the proposed model to other NLP tasks, such as dialogue systems or text summarization.
Questions to be answered by the authors include:
* How does the model handle out-of-vocabulary words or unseen entities in the input data?
* Can the model be extended to handle multi-turn dialogue or conversations?
* How does the model's performance compare to other state-of-the-art models on larger-scale datasets or more complex tasks?
