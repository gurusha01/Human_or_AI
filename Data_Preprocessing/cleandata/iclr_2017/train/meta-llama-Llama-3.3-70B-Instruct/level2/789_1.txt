The paper proposes a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling process for generative autoencoders, which allows for sampling from the learned latent distribution, PÌ‚(Z). The authors argue that this approach improves the quality of generated samples, especially when the learned latent distribution is far from the prior distribution, P(Z). The paper also explores the application of MCMC sampling to denoising generative autoencoders.
I decide to accept this paper, with two key reasons for this choice: (1) the paper presents a novel and well-motivated approach to sampling from generative autoencoders, and (2) the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MCMC sampling process in improving the quality of generated samples.
The paper provides a clear and well-structured introduction to the problem of sampling from generative autoencoders, and the proposed MCMC sampling process is well-motivated and easy to understand. The authors also provide a thorough analysis of the convergence properties of the MCMC chain and demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach through experiments on several datasets.
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more detailed comparisons with existing methods for sampling from generative autoencoders, such as the approaches proposed by Bengio et al. (2013) and Rezende et al. (2014). Additionally, it would be helpful to provide more insights into the choice of hyperparameters, such as the number of MCMC steps and the learning rate, and how they affect the performance of the proposed method.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper include: (1) How does the choice of prior distribution, P(Z), affect the performance of the proposed MCMC sampling process? (2) Can the authors provide more detailed analysis of the computational cost of the proposed method, especially in comparison to existing methods? (3) How does the proposed method perform on datasets with complex latent structures, such as those with multiple modes or hierarchical relationships? 
Overall, the paper presents a well-motivated and effective approach to sampling from generative autoencoders, and I believe it has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of generative modeling.
