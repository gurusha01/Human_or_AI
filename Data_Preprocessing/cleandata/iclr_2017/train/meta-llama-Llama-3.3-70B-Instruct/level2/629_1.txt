This paper claims to investigate the similarity between human visual perception and the computations of deep neural networks (DNNs) trained on image recognition tasks. The authors find that DNNs exhibit similar properties to human perception, such as sensitivity to image changes, contextual modulation, and contrast sensitivity. They also show that the DNN computation correlates with human perceptual data, particularly at the mid-computation and end-computation stages.
I decide to accept this paper with minor revisions. The main reason for this decision is that the paper presents a well-motivated and well-executed study that sheds light on the relationship between human visual perception and DNN computations. The authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, a thorough review of related work, and a detailed description of their methodology and results.
The paper supports its claims with a range of experiments, including image change sensitivity, contextual modulation, and contrast sensitivity. The results show that DNNs exhibit similar properties to human perception, such as sensitivity to image changes and contextual modulation. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the DNN computation stages, showing that the mid-computation and end-computation stages are most similar to human perception.
One potential limitation of the paper is that it relies on a limited set of experiments and datasets. To strengthen the paper, the authors could consider additional experiments and datasets to further validate their findings. Additionally, the authors could provide more discussion on the implications of their results for our understanding of human visual perception and DNN computations.
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on their experimental setup and methodology, particularly with regards to the DNN models and training procedures used. Additionally, the authors could consider providing more visualizations and illustrations to help readers understand the results and findings.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer in their revision include:
* How do the authors plan to address the potential limitations of their study, such as the limited set of experiments and datasets?
* Can the authors provide more details on the DNN models and training procedures used in their study?
* How do the authors think their findings could be used to improve our understanding of human visual perception and DNN computations?
* Are there any potential applications or implications of the authors' findings that they would like to explore in future work?
