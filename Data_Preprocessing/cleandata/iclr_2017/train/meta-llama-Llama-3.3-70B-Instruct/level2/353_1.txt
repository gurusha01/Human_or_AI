Summary of the Paper's Claims and Contributions
The paper introduces PixelVAE, a novel latent variable model that combines the strengths of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and PixelCNNs. The authors claim that PixelVAE achieves state-of-the-art performance on binarized MNIST, competitive performance on 64 × 64 ImageNet, and generates high-quality samples on the LSUN bedrooms dataset. The model uses an autoregressive decoder based on PixelCNN, which allows it to capture small details in images while still modeling global structure. The authors also extend PixelVAE to a hierarchical model with multiple stochastic layers and autoregressive decoders at each layer.
Decision and Key Reasons
Based on the review, I decide to Accept the paper. The key reasons for this decision are:
1. The paper presents a well-motivated and novel approach to natural image modeling, combining the strengths of VAEs and PixelCNNs.
2. The authors provide extensive experimental results, including state-of-the-art performance on binarized MNIST and competitive performance on 64 × 64 ImageNet, which demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a clear and well-structured presentation of the PixelVAE model, including its architecture, training procedure, and experimental results. The authors also provide a thorough discussion of related work and the advantages of their approach over existing methods. The experimental results are impressive, and the authors provide a detailed analysis of the performance of their model on different datasets.
Additional Feedback and Suggestions
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors:
1. Provide more visualizations of the generated samples, particularly for the LSUN bedrooms dataset, to better illustrate the quality of the samples.
2. Consider adding more ablation studies to investigate the effect of different components of the PixelVAE model, such as the number of autoregressive layers or the use of hierarchical latent variables.
3. Provide more discussion on the potential applications of PixelVAE, such as semi-supervised learning or image compression.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
1. Can you provide more details on the computational cost of training PixelVAE compared to PixelCNN and other state-of-the-art models?
2. How do you plan to extend PixelVAE to larger image sizes, such as 128 × 128 or 256 × 256?
3. Can you provide more insight into the trade-offs between using a hierarchical latent variable model versus a single-level model, in terms of performance and computational cost?
