This paper proposes a novel approach to domain adaptation for time series data, called Variational Recurrent Adversarial Deep Domain Adaptation (VRADA). The authors claim that their model is the first to capture and transfer temporal latent dependencies between domains, which is a crucial aspect of time series data. The paper is well-structured, and the authors provide a clear overview of the problem, related work, and their proposed solution.
The main claim of the paper is that VRADA outperforms state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods on two real-world healthcare datasets. The authors provide empirical evidence to support this claim, including tables and figures that compare the performance of VRADA with other methods. The results show that VRADA achieves higher AUC scores on the target domain test subset for the AHRF mortality prediction task and the ICD9 code prediction task.
I decide to accept this paper because it presents a novel and well-motivated approach to domain adaptation for time series data. The authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their method, and the empirical results demonstrate its effectiveness. The paper is well-organized, and the authors provide sufficient details about the datasets, methods, and implementation.
One potential limitation of the paper is that the authors do not provide a detailed analysis of the temporal latent dependencies captured by VRADA. While they provide some visualizations of the activation patterns of the VRADA model, it would be helpful to have a more in-depth analysis of how these dependencies are learned and transferred between domains.
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details about the hyperparameter tuning process and the sensitivity of the results to different hyperparameter settings. Additionally, it would be helpful to have a more detailed comparison with other domain adaptation methods, including a discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer include:
* Can you provide more details about the hyperparameter tuning process and the sensitivity of the results to different hyperparameter settings?
* How do you plan to extend VRADA to other types of time series data, such as data with multiple modalities or data with non-uniform sampling rates?
* Can you provide a more detailed analysis of the temporal latent dependencies captured by VRADA, including visualizations and quantitative metrics to evaluate their quality?
