The paper introduces quasi-recurrent neural networks (QRNNs), a novel approach to neural sequence modeling that combines the strengths of convolutional and recurrent neural networks. The authors claim that QRNNs can handle long sequences more efficiently and accurately than traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs), including LSTMs. They demonstrate the effectiveness of QRNNs on several natural language tasks, including document-level sentiment classification, language modeling, and character-level neural machine translation.
I decide to accept this paper, with the main reasons being the novelty and significance of the proposed QRNN architecture, as well as the thorough evaluation of its performance on various tasks. The authors provide a clear and well-motivated explanation of the QRNN model, and the experimental results show that it outperforms LSTM-based models on all three tasks while reducing computation time.
The paper is well-structured, and the authors provide a comprehensive overview of the related work in the field. The QRNN architecture is well-described, and the authors provide a detailed analysis of its components and their interactions. The experimental evaluation is thorough, and the results are presented in a clear and concise manner.
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more insights into the interpretability of the QRNN's hidden states, as they mention that the channels maintain their independence across timesteps. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more analysis on the trade-offs between the QRNN's performance and its computational efficiency.
I would like the authors to answer the following questions to clarify my understanding of the paper: (1) Can you provide more details on the implementation of the zoneout regularization scheme for the QRNN, and how it differs from the original zoneout approach for LSTMs? (2) How do the authors plan to address the potential limitations of the QRNN architecture, such as its dependence on the filter size and the number of layers? (3) Are there any plans to apply the QRNN architecture to other sequence modeling tasks, such as speech recognition or time-series forecasting?
