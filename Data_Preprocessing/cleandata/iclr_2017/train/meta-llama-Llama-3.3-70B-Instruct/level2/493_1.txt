This paper proposes a novel approach to supervised classification by iteratively updating the upper bound of the classification error during optimization. The authors argue that the standard approach of minimizing the log-loss as an upper bound to the classification error can be improved by using a tighter bound, especially when the model is far from its initialization.
The paper claims to contribute to the field of supervised learning by introducing a new iterative scheme for optimizing the classification error, which leads to improved classification rates. The authors also propose a link between supervised learning and reinforcement learning, allowing for the seamless introduction of external constraints and costs.
I decide to accept this paper with the following reasons: 
1. The paper tackles a specific question/problem, namely, the limitation of the standard approach to supervised classification, and proposes a well-motivated solution.
2. The approach is well-placed in the literature, and the authors provide a clear and concise overview of the related work.
3. The paper supports its claims with theoretical analysis and empirical experiments on several datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
The supporting arguments for my decision are as follows:
* The paper provides a clear and concise introduction to the problem of supervised classification and the limitations of the standard approach.
* The authors propose a novel and well-motivated solution, which is supported by theoretical analysis and empirical experiments.
* The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach on several datasets, including the Covertype binary dataset, Alpha dataset, MNIST dataset, and IJCNN dataset.
* The authors provide a clear and concise discussion of the results, highlighting the advantages and limitations of the proposed approach.
Additional feedback to improve the paper includes:
* Providing more details on the implementation of the proposed approach, including the choice of hyperparameters and the optimization algorithm used.
* Discussing the potential applications of the proposed approach in real-world scenarios, including its potential impact on the field of supervised learning.

Questions I would like the authors to answer include:
* How do the authors plan to address the issue of overfitting when using the proposed approach, especially when the model has limited capacity?
* Can the authors provide more insights into the choice of hyperparameters, including the number of iterations and the regularization strength?
* How do the authors plan to extend the proposed approach to more complex models, including deep neural networks?
