This paper proposes NoiseOut, a novel pruning algorithm for neural networks that removes redundant neurons based on the correlation between their activations. The authors also introduce a technique to encourage higher correlation between neurons by adding noise outputs to the network. The paper is well-structured, and the authors provide a clear explanation of their approach, along with theoretical and empirical evidence to support their claims.
The main claim of the paper is that NoiseOut can effectively prune neural networks without sacrificing accuracy. The authors support this claim through extensive experiments on various networks and datasets, including MNIST and SVHN. The results show that NoiseOut can remove a significant number of parameters (up to 95%) without degrading the accuracy of the network.
I decide to accept this paper, with the main reason being the novelty and effectiveness of the proposed pruning algorithm. The authors provide a clear and well-motivated approach, and the experimental results demonstrate the potential of NoiseOut to reduce the computational resources required for neural networks.
The paper is well-placed in the literature, and the authors provide a thorough review of existing pruning methods and techniques for reducing overfitting. The writing is clear, and the authors provide sufficient details for reproducibility.
One potential limitation of the paper is the lack of comparison with other state-of-the-art pruning methods. While the authors provide some comparison with Dropout and Regularization, it would be interesting to see how NoiseOut performs compared to other pruning algorithms, such as Optimal Brain Damage and Optimal Brain Surgeon.
To improve the paper, I suggest the authors provide more analysis on the effect of different noise distributions on the pruning process. Additionally, it would be interesting to see how NoiseOut performs on more complex datasets, such as ImageNet.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer include:
* How do the authors choose the number of noise outputs to add to the network?
* Can the authors provide more insight into the relationship between the correlation between neurons and the effectiveness of pruning?
* How does NoiseOut perform on networks with different architectures, such as recurrent neural networks or transformers?
