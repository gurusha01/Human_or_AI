The paper "Binary Paragraph Vector Models" presents a novel approach to learning short binary codes for text documents, extending the Paragraph Vector model by introducing a sigmoid nonlinearity before the softmax layer. The authors claim that their Binary Paragraph Vector models outperform autoencoder-based binary codes, such as semantic hashing, despite using fewer bits. They also demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach in transfer learning settings, where binary codes are inferred for documents unrelated to the training corpus.
I decide to accept this paper, with the main reason being that the approach is well-motivated and supported by comprehensive experiments. The authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of their methodology, and the results show significant improvements over existing approaches.
The paper supports its claims through a series of experiments on two popular information retrieval benchmarks, 20 Newsgroups and RCV1. The results demonstrate that Binary Paragraph Vector models achieve higher retrieval precision than semantic hashing codes, and retain a lot of their precision when trained on an unrelated text corpus. The authors also propose a Real-Binary PV-DBOW model that simultaneously learns short binary codes and longer, real-valued representations, which shows promising results in improving retrieval performance.
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more analysis on the trade-offs between the retrieval performance and the recall level when using short binary codes for initial filtering of documents. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more experiments on the effectiveness of the Real-Binary PV-DBOW model in different scenarios.
I have a few questions for the authors to clarify some aspects of the paper: (1) How do the authors plan to extend their approach to account for word order, which is mentioned as a potential future research direction? (2) Can the authors provide more details on the computational resources required to train the Binary Paragraph Vector models, and how they compare to other approaches? (3) How do the authors envision the Real-Binary PV-DBOW model being used in practice, and what are the potential applications of this approach? 
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of information retrieval, and the authors' approach has the potential to be widely adopted in practice. With some additional analysis and experimentation, the paper can be even stronger and more impactful.
