The paper proposes a novel framework for analyzing and comparing sentence embeddings by designing auxiliary prediction tasks that measure the extent to which different sentence representations capture specific aspects of sentence structure, such as length, word content, and word order. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach by analyzing various sentence representation methods, including continuous bag-of-words (CBOW) and encoder-decoder models.
I decide to accept this paper, with the primary reason being that it presents a well-motivated and well-executed approach to analyzing sentence embeddings, which is a crucial aspect of natural language processing. The paper provides a clear and concise overview of the problem, and the proposed methodology is sound and easy to follow. The experimental results are thorough and well-analyzed, providing valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of different sentence representation methods.
The paper supports its claims through a series of experiments that evaluate the performance of different sentence representation models on various tasks, including length prediction, word content prediction, and word order prediction. The results show that CBOW is surprisingly effective at capturing sentence length and word content information, while encoder-decoder models are better at capturing word order information. The paper also provides a detailed analysis of the importance of natural language statistics in encoding sentences and demonstrates that the trained LSTM encoder-decoder does not rely on ordering patterns in the training sentences when encoding novel sequences.
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors consider providing more context about the potential applications of their framework and how it can be used to improve downstream NLP tasks. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more analysis on the limitations of the proposed approach and potential avenues for future work. Some questions that I would like the authors to answer include: How do the results of the paper relate to other work on sentence embeddings and representation learning? Can the proposed framework be extended to analyze other aspects of sentence structure, such as syntax and semantics? How can the findings of the paper be used to improve the performance of NLP models on specific tasks, such as machine translation or question answering?
