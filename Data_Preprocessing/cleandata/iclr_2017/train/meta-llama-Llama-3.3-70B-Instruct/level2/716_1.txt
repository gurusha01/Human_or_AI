The paper proposes a novel deep neural network architecture, ENet, designed for real-time semantic segmentation on mobile devices. The authors claim that ENet is up to 18× faster, requires 75× less FLOPs, has 79× less parameters, and provides similar or better accuracy to existing models. 
I decide to accept this paper, with the main reason being that the approach is well-motivated and the results are scientifically rigorous. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the design choices and experimental results, demonstrating the effectiveness of ENet on various datasets, including Cityscapes, CamVid, and SUN RGB-D.
The paper supports its claims with extensive experiments and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, showcasing the significant improvements in terms of speed, parameters, and accuracy. The authors also discuss the limitations of their approach, including the potential drawbacks of convolutional layer factorization and the need for kernel fusion in existing software.
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the training process, including the hyperparameter tuning and the class weighing scheme. Additionally, it would be beneficial to include more visualizations of the segmentation results to better illustrate the performance of ENet.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer include: How did the authors determine the optimal number of bottleneck modules and the structure of the encoder-decoder architecture? What is the impact of using different nonlinear operations, such as ReLU and PReLU, on the performance of ENet? How do the authors plan to address the potential limitations of ENet, such as the increased number of kernel calls and memory operations, in future work? 
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of semantic segmentation, and with some minor revisions, it has the potential to be a strong publication.
