This paper proposes submodular sum-product networks (SSPNs), a novel extension of sum-product networks that can be understood as an instantiation of an image grammar in which all possible parses of an image over arbitrary shapes are represented. The authors introduce an efficient inference algorithm, INFERSSPN, which exploits submodularity to find the approximate MAP state of an SSPN. The paper provides a thorough analysis of the algorithm's efficiency and convergence, as well as empirical results demonstrating its effectiveness in parsing images.
I decide to accept this paper, with the main reasons being:
1. The paper tackles a specific and well-defined problem in the field of computer vision, namely scene understanding and semantic segmentation.
2. The approach is well-motivated and placed in the literature, building upon existing work on sum-product networks and image grammars.
3. The paper provides a clear and concise explanation of the proposed SSPN model and the INFERSSPN algorithm, making it easy to follow and understand.
The supporting arguments for this decision include:
* The paper provides a thorough analysis of the algorithm's efficiency and convergence, including proofs and theoretical guarantees.
* The empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of INFERSSPN in parsing images, with comparable accuracies to Î±-expansion and significantly reduced inference times.
* The paper discusses the limitations of the approach and provides potential avenues for future work, such as learning the structure and parameters of SSPNs from data.
To improve the paper, I suggest the authors:
* Provide more details on the implementation of INFERSSPN, including any optimization techniques used to improve efficiency.
* Consider adding more experimental results, such as comparisons to other state-of-the-art methods or evaluations on different datasets.
* Clarify the relationship between SSPNs and other existing models, such as hierarchical random fields and neural parsing methods.
Questions I would like the authors to answer:
* Can you provide more insight into the choice of submodularity as a restriction on the energy function, and how this affects the expressivity of the SSPN model?
* How do you plan to extend INFERSSPN to handle more complex grammars or larger images, and what are the potential limitations of the approach?
* Can you discuss the potential applications of SSPNs beyond scene understanding and semantic segmentation, such as activity recognition or social network modeling?
