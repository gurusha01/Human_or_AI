This paper presents a novel approach to learning a static analyzer from data using deep learning techniques. The authors propose using long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to learn a basic static analyzer for a simple toy language, and demonstrate that this approach can achieve high accuracy. The paper also explores the use of a language model to help programmers locate errors in their code.
The main claim of the paper is that LSTM networks can be used to learn a static analyzer from data, without the need for complicated feature engineering. The authors support this claim with experimental results, showing that LSTM networks can achieve an accuracy of 98.3% on a simple static analysis task, outperforming other approaches such as hidden Markov models and recurrent neural networks.
I decide to accept this paper, with the main reason being that it presents a novel and promising approach to learning a static analyzer from data. The paper is well-motivated, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their approach and results.
The paper is also well-placed in the literature, with the authors providing a thorough review of related work in the field of machine learning for programming language tools. The authors demonstrate a good understanding of the field, and their approach is a significant contribution to the existing body of work.
One potential limitation of the paper is that the approach is demonstrated on a simple toy language, and it is unclear how well it will generalize to more complex programming languages. However, the authors acknowledge this limitation, and suggest that their approach could be extended to more complex languages in future work.
To improve the paper, I would suggest that the authors provide more details on the training data and the experimental setup, such as the size of the training set and the hyperparameters used for the LSTM network. Additionally, the authors could provide more analysis of the results, such as an examination of the types of errors that the LSTM network is able to detect, and how it compares to traditional static analysis approaches.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer include: How do the authors plan to extend their approach to more complex programming languages? What are the potential applications of their approach, and how do they see it being used in practice? How does their approach compare to traditional static analysis approaches, in terms of accuracy and efficiency? 
Overall, I think this paper is a significant contribution to the field of machine learning for programming language tools, and I believe it has the potential to be a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the field.
