This paper presents a novel approach to unsupervised learning of probabilistic models using real-valued non-volume preserving (real NVP) transformations. The authors claim that their method enables exact log-likelihood computation, efficient sampling, and interpretable latent space, making it a significant improvement over existing approaches.
I decide to accept this paper, with the main reason being that the approach is well-motivated and supported by thorough experiments on four natural image datasets. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method in terms of sample quality, log-likelihood, and latent space semantics.
The paper is well-structured, and the authors provide a clear overview of the related work, highlighting the limitations of existing approaches and the advantages of their method. The technical contributions are sound, and the experiments are thorough and well-designed. The use of real NVP transformations allows for efficient and exact computation of the log-likelihood, making it a significant improvement over existing methods.
One potential limitation of the paper is that the authors do not provide a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of their method, which could be an important consideration for large-scale applications. Additionally, the authors could provide more insights into the interpretability of the latent space, which is an important aspect of their method.
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the implementation of their method, including the specific architectures used for the coupling layers and the hyperparameter settings. Additionally, the authors could provide more visualizations of the latent space and the generated samples to further demonstrate the effectiveness of their method.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer include: How do the authors plan to extend their method to other domains, such as text or audio? How do the authors plan to improve the scalability of their method for large-scale applications? What are the potential applications of their method in areas such as semi-supervised learning or reinforcement learning? 
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of unsupervised learning, and I believe that it has the potential to make a substantial impact in the machine learning community.
