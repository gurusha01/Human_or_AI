The paper proposes a novel architecture for learning representations on social network data, called Shift Aggregate Extract Network (SAEN). SAEN decomposes input graphs into hierarchies made of multiple strata of objects and learns vector representations of each object by applying shift, aggregate, and extract operations on the vector representations of its parts. The authors also introduce a domain compression algorithm that takes advantage of symmetries in hierarchical decompositions to reduce memory usage and obtain significant speedups.
I decide to accept this paper with two key reasons: (1) the proposed SAEN architecture is well-motivated and provides a significant improvement over existing approaches, and (2) the experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of SAEN on real-world social network datasets, outperforming the current state of the art.
The paper provides a clear and detailed explanation of the SAEN architecture and the domain compression algorithm. The authors also provide a thorough experimental evaluation, including a comparison with other state-of-the-art methods and an analysis of the computational benefits of the domain compression algorithm. The results show that SAEN achieves state-of-the-art performance on several social network datasets and that the domain compression algorithm can significantly reduce memory usage and speed up the training time.
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the implementation of the SAEN architecture and the domain compression algorithm, including any optimization techniques used to improve performance. Additionally, it would be helpful to include more analysis on the interpretability of the learned representations and the potential applications of SAEN beyond social network analysis.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper include: (1) How do the authors choose the number of strata and the part-of relations in the H-hierarchical decomposition? (2) Can the domain compression algorithm be applied to other types of graph data, such as molecular or protein structures? (3) How does the SAEN architecture handle graphs with varying sizes and structures? 
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of graph representation learning and provides a promising approach for analyzing social network data. With some additional details and analysis, the paper has the potential to be even more impactful and widely applicable.
