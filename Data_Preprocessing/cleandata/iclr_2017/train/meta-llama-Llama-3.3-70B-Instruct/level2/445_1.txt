This paper presents a novel approach to training conversational agents through online interaction with humans, using reinforcement learning and textual feedback. The authors claim to have developed a pipeline that starts with a model trained on an initial fixed dataset and then learns from interactions with humans to improve itself. The main contributions of the paper are the introduction of a simulator for testing various aspects of online learning, the development of models that work in this regime, and the validation of the approach through real experiments with Mechanical Turk.
I decide to accept this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the paper tackles a specific and important question in the field of conversational agents, namely how to improve their performance through online interaction with humans. Secondly, the approach presented in the paper is well-motivated and supported by a thorough analysis of the literature, as well as comprehensive experiments using both a simulator and real human feedback.
The paper provides a clear and detailed description of the methodology used, including the development of a simulator and the implementation of various reinforcement learning algorithms. The experiments are well-designed and provide valuable insights into the performance of the proposed approach. The results show that the approach is feasible and effective, with the model improving its performance over time through online learning.
To further improve the paper, I would suggest that the authors provide more details on the hyperparameter tuning process, as well as a more thorough analysis of the results. Additionally, it would be interesting to see a comparison with other state-of-the-art approaches in the field.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper are: How did the authors select the hyperparameters for the reinforcement learning algorithms? What is the impact of the batch size on the performance of the model? How does the approach handle out-of-vocabulary words or unseen entities in the dialogue?
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of conversational agents and has the potential to improve the performance of these systems through online learning. With some minor revisions to address the suggested improvements, the paper is ready for publication.
