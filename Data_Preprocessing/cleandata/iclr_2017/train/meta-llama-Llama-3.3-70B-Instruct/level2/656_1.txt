This paper proposes a novel deep hybrid architecture that combines scattering networks with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to achieve state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks such as CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and STL10. The authors claim that their approach leads to better generalization performance, especially on small datasets, and provides theoretical guarantees for the stability of the representation.
The paper is well-motivated, and the authors provide a clear overview of the limitations of existing approaches and the benefits of their proposed method. The technical contributions are sound, and the experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the hybrid architecture. The use of scattering networks as a generic and fixed initialization for the first layers of a deep network is an interesting idea, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of the stability properties of their approach.
I decide to accept this paper because it presents a novel and well-motivated approach to deep learning, and the experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise overview of their contributions.
The main reasons for my decision are:
1. The paper presents a novel and interesting approach to deep learning that combines the benefits of scattering networks and CNNs.
2. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the hybrid architecture, especially on small datasets.
3. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the stability properties of their approach, which is an important aspect of deep learning.
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the implementation of their approach, such as the specific architectures used for the scattering network and the CNN, and the hyperparameters used for training. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more experiments on larger datasets, such as ImageNet, to further demonstrate the effectiveness of the hybrid architecture.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer are:
* How do the authors plan to extend their approach to larger datasets, such as ImageNet?
* Can the authors provide more details on the computational savings achieved by using scattering networks as a generic and fixed initialization for the first layers of a deep network?
* How do the authors plan to address the potential limitations of their approach, such as the need for careful tuning of hyperparameters?
