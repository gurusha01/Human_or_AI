This paper presents a novel regularization technique called OrthoReg, which aims to reduce overfitting in deep neural networks by enforcing local orthogonality between feature detectors. The authors argue that regularizing negatively correlated features can be an obstacle to effective decorrelation and propose a method that only regularizes positively correlated feature weights.
The paper claims to contribute to the field of deep learning by introducing a new regularization technique that improves the performance of state-of-the-art models on several benchmark datasets, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the effects of OrthoReg on the performance of neural networks, including its ability to reduce overfitting and improve generalization.
