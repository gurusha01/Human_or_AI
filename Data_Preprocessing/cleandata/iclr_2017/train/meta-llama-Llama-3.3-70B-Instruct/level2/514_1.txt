The paper introduces a simple permutation equivariant layer for deep learning with set structure, which has a simple implementation and linear-time complexity in the size of each set. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of this layer in several novel supervised and semi-supervised tasks, including point-cloud classification, set anomaly detection, and improved red-shift estimation using clustering information.
I decide to accept this paper with the following key reasons: 
1. The paper tackles a specific and well-defined problem of permutation equivariance in deep learning with set structure, which is a crucial aspect of many real-world applications.
2. The approach is well-motivated and placed in the literature, with a clear explanation of the permutation equivariant layer and its properties.
The paper supports its claims with extensive experiments and theoretical analysis, demonstrating the effectiveness of the permutation equivariant layer in various tasks. The results show that the proposed layer outperforms other methods in point-cloud classification, set anomaly detection, and red-shift estimation.
To further improve the paper, I suggest the authors provide more details on the implementation of the permutation equivariant layer, including the choice of hyperparameters and the optimization process. Additionally, it would be helpful to include more visualizations of the learned features and the performance of the model on different tasks.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer include: 
1. How does the choice of non-linearity affect the performance of the permutation equivariant layer?
2. Can the authors provide more insights into the learned features and how they relate to the task at hand?
3. How does the permutation equivariant layer compare to other methods in terms of computational efficiency and scalability?
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of deep learning and provides a useful tool for handling set-structured data. With some minor revisions and additional details, the paper has the potential to be a strong contribution to the conference.
