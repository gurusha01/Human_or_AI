This paper proposes a novel framework called Generative Adversarial Parallelization (GAP) for training Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The authors claim that GAP improves the mode coverage, convergence, and quality of GANs by training multiple GANs simultaneously and exchanging their discriminators. 
I decide to accept this paper with the following reasons: 
1. The approach is well-motivated and placed in the literature, addressing the known issues of GANs such as mode collapse and difficulty in training.
2. The paper provides empirical evidence to support the claims, including experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, and evaluations using the proposed Generative Adversarial Metric II (GAM-II).
The supporting arguments for the decision include:
- The paper provides a clear and concise introduction to the background and motivation of the work, including the limitations of existing GANs.
- The proposed GAP framework is well-explained, and the pseudocode is provided for clarity.
- The experiments are well-designed, and the results are presented in a clear and concise manner, including visualizations and quantitative evaluations.
- The paper discusses the limitations of the work and provides potential directions for future research.
Additional feedback to improve the paper includes:
- Providing more detailed analysis of the results, including discussions on the implications of the findings and potential applications.
- Considering additional evaluations, such as comparing GAP with other state-of-the-art GAN variants.
- Providing more insights into the hyperparameter tuning process, including the selection of the swapping frequency and the number of GANs to train in parallel.
Questions to be answered by the authors include:
- Can the authors provide more details on the computational resources required to train the GAP models, and how it compares to training individual GANs?
- How does the GAP framework perform on more complex datasets, such as ImageNet or CIFAR-100?
- Can the authors provide more insights into the relationship between the number of GANs trained in parallel and the quality of the generated samples?
