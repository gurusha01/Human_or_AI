This paper proposes a novel approach to constructing a phylogenetic tree, also known as the tree of life, using the deep representation of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained for image classification. The authors claim that their method can leverage the hierarchical feature representation learned by deep networks to quantify the visual similarity of species and construct a tree of life.
I decide to accept this paper with some minor revisions. The main reason for my decision is that the paper presents a well-motivated approach that is well-placed in the literature, and the results show that the proposed method is competitive with human beings in building the tree of life based on visual similarity.
The paper provides a clear and concise introduction to the problem of constructing a phylogenetic tree and the potential of using deep learning techniques to solve it. The authors also provide a thorough review of the related work in the field of deep learning and bioinformatics. The proposed method is well-explained, and the experiments are well-designed to evaluate the effectiveness of the approach.
One of the strengths of the paper is that it provides a new perspective on the deep representation of neural networks and sheds light on possible novel applications of deep learning in the area of bioinformatics. The results show that the proposed method can correctly cluster species by families and ensure the correct hierarchy within each family.
However, there are some minor issues that need to be addressed. For example, the paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the results and a discussion of the limitations of the approach. Additionally, the paper could provide more information about the computational resources required to run the experiments and the potential applications of the proposed method in real-world scenarios.
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details about the implementation of the proposed method, including the specific architectures of the CNNs used and the hyperparameters tuned during the experiments. I also suggest that the authors provide more visualizations of the results, such as heatmaps or scatter plots, to help illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
Some questions that I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper include: How do the authors plan to extend the proposed method to handle species that are not visually similar? How do the authors plan to incorporate gene similarity information into the proposed method to build a more delicate tree of life? What are the potential applications of the proposed method in real-world scenarios, such as conservation biology or ecology?
