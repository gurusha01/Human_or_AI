This paper presents a novel method, Cat2Vec, for learning distributed representations of multi-field categorical data. The authors propose a pairwise interaction model that explores interactions among inter-field categories using neural gates and K-max pooling layers. The model is trained using a discriminant training method, which enables unsupervised learning of category vectors.
The paper claims to contribute a new approach to learning distributed representations of multi-field categorical data, which is a common data format in various applications such as recommender systems and computational advertising. The authors evaluate their model on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating its ability to capture significant patterns and improve performance on click-through rate prediction tasks.
Based on the review guidelines, I decide to accept this paper. The main reasons for this decision are:
1. The paper tackles a specific question/problem, namely learning distributed representations of multi-field categorical data, and proposes a well-motivated approach.
2. The approach is well-placed in the literature, drawing on existing work on distributed representations and association rule mining.
3. The paper provides empirical evidence to support its claims, including experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets.
Supporting arguments for this decision include:
* The paper provides a clear and concise introduction to the problem and the proposed approach.
* The authors provide a thorough review of related work and preliminaries, demonstrating a good understanding of the field.
* The experimental evaluation is comprehensive, including both synthetic and real-world datasets, and demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
Additional feedback to improve the paper includes:
* Providing more details on the implementation of the discriminant training method and the choice of hyperparameters.
* Exploring the use of different gate types and activation functions to improve the performance of the model.
* Considering the application of Cat2Vec to other data mining problems, such as recommender systems and social link prediction.
Questions to be answered by the authors include:
* How do the authors plan to extend the Cat2Vec model to handle more complex interactions among inter-field categories?
* Can the authors provide more insights into the choice of hyperparameters, such as the number of interaction times and the dropout rate?
* How do the authors plan to evaluate the scalability of the Cat2Vec model on larger datasets?
