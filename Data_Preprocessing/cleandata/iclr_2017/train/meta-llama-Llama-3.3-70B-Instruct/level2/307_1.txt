This paper proposes a testbed to evaluate end-to-end dialog systems in goal-oriented applications, specifically in the context of restaurant reservation. The authors design a set of five tasks that require manipulating sentences and symbols to conduct conversations, issue API calls, and use the outputs of such calls. They evaluate several learning methods, including rule-based systems, classical information retrieval models, supervised embeddings, and end-to-end Memory Networks, on these tasks.
The main claim of the paper is that the proposed testbed can help break down the strengths and shortcomings of end-to-end dialog systems in goal-oriented applications. The authors support this claim by showing that their testbed can be used to evaluate the performance of different models on various tasks, including issuing API calls, updating API calls, displaying options, providing extra information, and conducting full dialogs.
I decide to accept this paper because it presents a well-motivated and well-designed testbed for evaluating end-to-end dialog systems in goal-oriented applications. The authors provide a clear and detailed description of the tasks, datasets, and models used in their experiments, and their results show that the proposed testbed can be used to identify the strengths and weaknesses of different models.
One of the key reasons for my decision is that the paper addresses a significant problem in the field of dialog systems, which is the lack of a systematic and controlled way to evaluate end-to-end goal-oriented dialog learning methods. The authors' proposal of a testbed that can be used to break down the strengths and shortcomings of end-to-end dialog systems is a significant contribution to the field.
Another reason for my decision is that the paper provides a thorough evaluation of several learning methods on the proposed tasks, including rule-based systems, classical information retrieval models, supervised embeddings, and end-to-end Memory Networks. The authors' results show that Memory Networks outperform other models on most tasks, but still have limitations, such as difficulty in interpreting knowledge about entities and presenting results to the user.
To improve the paper, I would suggest that the authors provide more analysis of the results and discuss the implications of their findings in more detail. For example, they could provide more insights into why Memory Networks perform well on some tasks but not others, and what this means for the design of future dialog systems.
I would also like to ask the authors to clarify some points, such as how they plan to make the testbed and datasets available to the research community, and how they envision the testbed being used in future research. Additionally, I would like to know more about the limitations of the proposed testbed and how it can be extended or modified to accommodate more complex goal-oriented dialog tasks.
Overall, I think that this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of dialog systems and has the potential to impact future research in this area. With some revisions to address the points mentioned above, I believe that the paper can be even stronger and more effective in communicating its message to the research community.
