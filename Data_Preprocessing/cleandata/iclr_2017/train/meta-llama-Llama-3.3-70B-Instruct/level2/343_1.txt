This paper proposes a novel approach to character-level language modeling using a statistical model parameterized by a program from a domain-specific language (DSL). The authors claim that their model, instantiated with the TChar language, achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art neural network models while offering several advantages, including interpretability, fast query time, and the ability to quickly add and remove training data samples.
I decide to accept this paper with the following key reasons: 
1. The approach is well-motivated and placed in the literature, addressing a significant problem in language modeling, particularly for structured data.
2. The paper supports its claims with thorough experiments on two diverse datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed model.
The authors provide a clear and detailed description of the TChar language, its syntax, and semantics. They also present a comprehensive evaluation of their model, comparing it to n-gram models and recurrent neural networks. The results show that the proposed model outperforms the baselines in terms of precision and error rate, while also offering faster query times and smaller model sizes.
To further improve the paper, I suggest the authors provide more insights into the synthesis process of the TChar programs, including the computational complexity and the trade-offs between different synthesis algorithms. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more analysis on the interpretability of the synthesized programs and how they can be used to gain insights into the underlying data.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper include: 
1. How do the authors plan to extend the TChar language to handle more complex tasks, such as modeling multiple languages or incorporating external knowledge?
2. Can the authors provide more details on the implementation of the synthesis algorithm, including the specific techniques used for searching the program space and handling noise in the data?
3. How do the authors envision the proposed model being used in practice, particularly in applications where interpretability and explainability are crucial?
