This paper proposes a novel causal regularizer based on the independence of mechanisms assumption to steer deep neural network architectures towards causally-interpretable solutions. The authors claim that their approach can identify causal relationships between independent and target variables, which is a crucial problem in domains such as healthcare. 
I decide to accept this paper with two key reasons: (1) the approach is well-motivated and placed in the literature, and (2) the paper supports its claims with empirical results. The authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem of causal inference and the limitations of existing methods. They also propose a novel causal regularizer that can be seamlessly integrated with neural networks to perform non-linear causality analysis.
The empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in identifying causal factors and generating multivariate causal hypotheses. The authors evaluate their approach on two electronic health records datasets and show that it outperforms the L1-regularized counterpart in terms of predictive performance and causal relevance. They also provide a qualitative analysis of the generated hypotheses and show that they are clinically meaningful.
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the implementation of the neural network architecture and the training procedure. Additionally, they could provide more insights into the interpretation of the results and the potential applications of their approach in real-world scenarios. 
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper are: (1) How do the authors select the hyperparameters for the neural network architecture and the causal regularizer? (2) Can the authors provide more details on the expert judgment used to evaluate the causal performance of the algorithms? (3) How do the authors plan to extend their approach to handle more complex causal relationships and larger datasets? 
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the approach is novel and interesting. With some minor revisions to address the above questions and suggestions, the paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of causal inference and machine learning.
