This paper proposes Diverse Beam Search (DBS), a novel decoding algorithm for neural sequence models that aims to produce a list of diverse output sequences. The authors claim that DBS outperforms traditional beam search (BS) and other baselines in terms of diversity and oracle accuracy across various tasks, including image captioning, machine translation, conversation, and visual question generation.
I decide to accept this paper, with two key reasons for this choice: (1) the paper tackles a well-motivated problem, namely the lack of diversity in beam search outputs, and (2) the proposed approach, DBS, is well-supported by experimental results, demonstrating significant improvements over BS and other baselines.
The paper provides a clear and well-structured presentation of the problem, the proposed solution, and the experimental evaluation. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the limitations of traditional beam search and motivate the need for a diverse decoding algorithm. The proposed DBS algorithm is well-explained, and the experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness in producing diverse and accurate output sequences.
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more insights into the computational efficiency of DBS compared to BS and other baselines. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more qualitative examples of the output sequences generated by DBS and how they differ from those produced by BS.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper include: (1) How does the choice of diversity function affect the performance of DBS? (2) Can DBS be applied to other sequence generation tasks beyond those evaluated in the paper? (3) How does DBS handle cases where the input data is noisy or ambiguous, and how does this affect the diversity of the output sequences? 
Overall, the paper presents a well-motivated and well-executed approach to improving the diversity of beam search outputs, and I believe it makes a significant contribution to the field of natural language processing and sequence generation.
