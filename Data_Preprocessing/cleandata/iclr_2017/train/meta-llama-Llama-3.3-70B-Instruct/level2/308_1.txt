This paper presents a theoretical analysis of the training dynamics of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The authors aim to provide a solid understanding of the instability issues that arise during GAN training and propose a new direction to address these problems. 
I decide to accept this paper because it tackles a specific and important problem in the field of GANs, which is the instability of training. The approach is well-motivated, and the paper is well-placed in the literature, providing a thorough analysis of the current state of GAN training. The authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the theoretical background, making it easy to follow their arguments.
The paper supports its claims through a series of theorems and lemmas, which provide a rigorous analysis of the training dynamics of GANs. The authors show that the optimal discriminator will be perfect and its gradient will be zero almost everywhere, leading to vanishing gradients or massively unstable behavior. They also propose a new metric, the Wasserstein distance, to evaluate the similarity between the generated and real data distributions.
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more experimental results to validate their theoretical findings. Additionally, they could explore the application of their proposed metric to other generative models, such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). 
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper are: 
1. Can you provide more intuition behind the perfect discrimination theorems and how they relate to the instability of GAN training?
2. How do you plan to extend your analysis to more complex GAN architectures, such as those using multiple generators or discriminators?
3. Can you provide more details on the experimental setup used to verify the theoretical results, and how you plan to make the code and data available to the research community? 
Overall, the paper provides a significant contribution to the understanding of GAN training dynamics and proposes a new direction to address the instability issues. With some additional experimental results and clarification on the theoretical analysis, the paper has the potential to make a substantial impact in the field.
