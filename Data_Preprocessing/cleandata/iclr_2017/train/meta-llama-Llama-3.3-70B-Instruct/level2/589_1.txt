This paper introduces the Graph Convolutional Recurrent Network (GCRN), a deep learning model that predicts structured sequences of data by combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on graphs and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). The authors propose two GCRN architectures, Model 1 and Model 2, and apply them to two practical problems: predicting moving MNIST data and modeling natural language with the Penn Treebank dataset. The results show that the GCRN model can capture spatio-temporal structures and outperform traditional CNN and RNN models in certain cases.
I decide to accept this paper with the following reasons: 
1. The paper tackles a specific and well-defined problem of predicting structured sequences of data, which is a common challenge in many fields such as computer vision and natural language processing.
2. The approach is well-motivated and placed in the literature, with a clear explanation of the limitations of existing models and the benefits of the proposed GCRN model.
The supporting arguments for the decision are:
* The paper provides a thorough review of related works, including the use of CNNs and RNNs for spatio-temporal sequence modeling, and the application of graph neural networks to various problems.
* The proposed GCRN model is well-defined and easy to implement, with a clear explanation of the architecture and the training procedure.
* The experimental results are promising, with the GCRN model outperforming traditional CNN and RNN models in certain cases, such as video prediction and language modeling.
Additional feedback to improve the paper:
* The paper could benefit from more detailed analysis of the results, including a discussion of the limitations of the model and potential avenues for future work.
* The authors could provide more visualizations of the graph structures and the learned representations, to help illustrate the benefits of the GCRN model.
* The paper could be improved by providing more comparisons with other state-of-the-art models, to demonstrate the superiority of the GCRN model.
Questions to the authors:
* Can you provide more details on the construction of the graph structures, including the choice of the adjacency matrix and the node features?
* How do you handle the case where the graph structure is not available or is incomplete?
* Can you provide more insights on the interpretability of the learned representations, and how they can be used for downstream tasks?
