The paper proposes a framework for learning a diverse set of skills using Stochastic Neural Networks (SNNs) with minimal supervision, and then utilizing these skills in a hierarchical architecture to solve challenging tasks with sparse rewards. The authors claim that their approach can learn a wide range of skills, which can be used to improve exploration in downstream tasks, and demonstrate its effectiveness in several experiments.
I decide to accept this paper, with the main reason being that the approach is well-motivated and supported by a thorough analysis of the problem and the proposed solution. The authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the framework, and the experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in learning a diverse set of skills and improving exploration in downstream tasks.
The supporting arguments for this decision include:
* The paper provides a clear and concise explanation of the framework, making it easy to understand and follow.
* The authors provide a thorough analysis of the problem and the proposed solution, demonstrating a deep understanding of the challenges and limitations of current approaches.
* The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in learning a diverse set of skills and improving exploration in downstream tasks, providing strong evidence for the claims made in the paper.
* The paper is well-organized and easy to follow, making it a pleasure to read and review.
However, there are some areas that could be improved, including:
* Providing more details on the hyperparameters used in the experiments, such as the number of skills trained, the batch size, and the maximum path length.
* Including more comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the strengths and limitations of the proposed approach.
* Discussing the potential limitations and failure modes of the approach, such as the instability of the robot when switching between skills, and providing potential solutions or future directions for research.
To improve the paper, I would suggest the following:
* Providing more details on the hyperparameters used in the experiments, to make it easier for readers to reproduce the results.
* Including more comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the strengths and limitations of the proposed approach.
* Discussing the potential limitations and failure modes of the approach, and providing potential solutions or future directions for research.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer include:
* How did the authors choose the hyperparameters used in the experiments, and what was the process for tuning them?
* How do the authors plan to address the instability of the robot when switching between skills, and what potential solutions or future directions for research do they propose?
* How do the authors think the approach could be extended or modified to handle more complex tasks or environments, and what potential challenges or limitations do they foresee?
