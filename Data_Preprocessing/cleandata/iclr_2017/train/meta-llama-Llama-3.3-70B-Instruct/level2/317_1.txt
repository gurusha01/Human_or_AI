This paper proposes a novel approach to image super-resolution (SR) using amortized Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) inference. The authors introduce a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that projects the model output to the affine subspace of valid SR solutions, ensuring that the high-resolution output is always consistent with the low-resolution input. They then propose three methods to approximate the MAP estimate: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), denoiser-guided SR, and density-guided SR.
The paper claims to contribute to the field of image SR by providing a more desirable approach than empirical risk minimization, which often results in blurry and over-smoothed outputs. The authors argue that their approach prefers solutions that have a high posterior probability and thus high probability under the image prior, leading to more plausible and perceptually superior SR results.
I decide to accept this paper because it tackles a specific question/problem in image SR, namely the limitation of empirical risk minimization approaches. The approach is well-motivated, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the theoretical background and the proposed methods. The paper also includes a comprehensive set of experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, particularly the GAN-based method (AffGAN).
The results show that AffGAN outperforms other methods, including MSE and MAE-based approaches, in terms of cross-entropy and visual quality. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the limitations of their approach, including the potential dependence on the representation and the assumption that MAP estimates appear plausible.
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the implementation of the denoiser-guided and density-guided methods, which seem to be less effective than AffGAN. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more experiments on the robustness of the proposed approach to different types of noise and degradation.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer include:
* Can you provide more insight into why the denoiser-guided and density-guided methods did not perform as well as AffGAN?
* How do you plan to address the potential limitations of the MAP inference approach, such as the dependence on the representation?
* Can you provide more details on the computational complexity of the proposed approach and its potential applications to real-world image SR tasks?
Overall, this paper presents a well-motivated and well-executed approach to image SR, and I believe it has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field.
