This paper proposes a novel approach to state estimation in robotics by combining problem-specific algorithms with machine learning. The authors introduce end-to-end learnable histogram filters (E2E-HFs), which encode the structure of recursive state estimation using prediction and measurement update, while allowing the specific models to be learned end-to-end. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach in two localization tasks, showing improved data efficiency and performance compared to traditional methods.
I decide to accept this paper, with two key reasons for this choice: (1) the paper tackles a specific and well-motivated problem in robotics, and (2) the approach is well-supported by theoretical analysis and empirical results.
The paper provides a clear and well-structured presentation of the problem, related work, and the proposed approach. The authors demonstrate a good understanding of the field and provide a comprehensive review of existing methods. The experimental results are thorough and well-analyzed, showing the advantages of the proposed approach in terms of data efficiency and performance.
To further improve the paper, I suggest the authors provide more details on the computational complexity of the proposed approach and its scalability to higher-dimensional problems. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods in robotics.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper include: (1) How do the authors plan to address the computational limits of the proposed approach for higher-dimensional problems? (2) Can the authors provide more insights into the choice of hyperparameters and their impact on the performance of the proposed approach? (3) How do the authors envision the proposed approach being applied to more complex robotic tasks, such as manipulation or navigation in dynamic environments? 
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of robotics and machine learning, and I believe it has the potential to inspire further research in this area.
