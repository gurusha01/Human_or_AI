The paper proposes Compositional Kernel Machines (CKMs), a novel instance-based method for object recognition that addresses some of the weaknesses of deep architectures and other kernel methods. The authors claim that CKMs can learn similar nonlinear concepts as convolutional neural networks (convnets) but with easier training and architecture selection. The main contributions of the paper are the definition of CKMs, the proposal of a sum-product function to efficiently sum over an exponential number of virtual instances, and the demonstration of promising results on NORB datasets.
I decide to accept this paper with the key reason being that the approach is well-motivated and well-placed in the literature. The authors provide a clear and concise overview of the limitations of convnets and the potential benefits of using kernel methods. They also provide a thorough analysis of the properties and computational advantages of CKMs.
The paper supports its claims with theoretical analysis and empirical results on NORB datasets. The authors demonstrate that CKMs can outperform support vector machines (SVMs) and be competitive with convnets in several scenarios, including object recognition and composition tasks. The results are promising, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the advantages and limitations of CKMs.
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the implementation of CKMs, including the choice of hyperparameters and the optimization procedure. Additionally, it would be helpful to include more comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks.
I would like to ask the authors to clarify the following points: (1) How do the authors plan to extend CKMs to more complex tasks, such as image segmentation and object detection? (2) Can the authors provide more insights into the computational advantages of CKMs compared to convnets, including the trade-offs between training time and model size? (3) How do the authors plan to address the potential limitations of CKMs, such as the need for careful selection of hyperparameters and the potential for overfitting?
