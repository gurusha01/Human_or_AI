This paper introduces QRAQ, a new synthetic domain for training interactive agents to reason and answer questions in a conversational setting. The authors propose two reinforcement learning-based memory-network architectures, baseRL and impRL, to solve QRAQ problems. The paper presents a thorough evaluation of these architectures on four QRAQ dataset types, demonstrating their ability to reason and interact with the environment.
I decide to accept this paper, with two key reasons for this choice: 
1. The paper tackles a significant problem in conversational systems, which is reasoning and answering questions in the presence of incomplete or ambiguous information. The introduction of the QRAQ domain and the proposed architectures address this challenge effectively.
2. The evaluation of the architectures on various dataset types provides a comprehensive understanding of their strengths and limitations, demonstrating the potential of the approach for real-world applications.
The supporting arguments for these reasons include the fact that the QRAQ domain is well-motivated and placed in the literature, building on existing work on reasoning and dialog systems. The authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of the domain, the architectures, and the evaluation methodology. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed architectures, particularly the improved architecture, impRL, which outperforms the baseline architecture, baseRL, on more complex datasets.
Additional feedback to improve the paper includes:
* Providing more insights into the limitations of the current approach and potential avenues for future research, such as exploring other reinforcement learning algorithms or incorporating additional knowledge sources.
* Including more detailed analysis of the results, such as visualizations of the query graphs or examples of successful and failed interactions, to provide a deeper understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the architectures.
* Considering the potential applications of the QRAQ domain and the proposed architectures in real-world scenarios, such as customer service or language translation.
Questions to be answered by the authors include:
* How do the authors plan to address the performance gap between the supervised and reinforcement learning approaches, particularly for more complex datasets?
* Can the authors provide more details on the exploration strategy used in the reinforcement learning setting, and how it affects the performance of the architectures?
* How do the authors envision the QRAQ domain being used in real-world applications, and what potential challenges or limitations do they anticipate?
