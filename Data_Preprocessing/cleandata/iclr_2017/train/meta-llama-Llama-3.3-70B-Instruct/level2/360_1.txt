This paper proposes a novel approach to semi-supervised reinforcement learning (SSRL), which enables an agent to learn a policy that generalizes to unseen scenarios by leveraging both labeled and unlabeled experiences. The authors formalize SSRL as a problem where the reward function is only available in a limited set of "labeled" Markov decision processes (MDPs), while the agent must learn to perform well in a wider range of "unlabeled" MDPs.
The paper's main contribution is the development of the Semi-Supervised Skill Generalization (S3G) algorithm, which infers the reward function in the unlabeled MDPs by learning from the agent's prior experience in the labeled MDPs. S3G alternates between updating the reward function and the policy, using an inverse reinforcement learning objective to shape the policy's behavior in the unlabeled MDPs.
I decide to accept this paper because it presents a well-motivated and clearly explained approach to SSRL, with a thorough evaluation on a range of challenging tasks. The authors provide a comprehensive discussion of the related work and demonstrate the effectiveness of S3G in improving the generalization of a learned policy.
The paper's strengths include its clear problem formulation, well-designed experiments, and thorough analysis of the results. The authors also provide a detailed description of the S3G algorithm and its components, making it easy to follow and understand.
One potential limitation of the paper is that the evaluation is limited to simulated environments, and it would be interesting to see the results extended to real-world scenarios. Additionally, the authors could provide more discussion on the potential applications and implications of SSRL in real-world domains.
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors consider adding more visualizations or illustrations to help explain the S3G algorithm and its components. Additionally, they could provide more details on the hyperparameter tuning and the choice of the reward function architecture.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer include:
* How do the authors plan to extend the S3G algorithm to more complex and high-dimensional tasks?
* Can the authors provide more insights into the trade-offs between the labeled and unlabeled experiences in SSRL?
* How does the S3G algorithm handle cases where the reward function is highly nonlinear or non-stationary?
