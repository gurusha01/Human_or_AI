This paper presents a novel approach to understanding the behavior of deep neural networks by introducing the concept of preimages, which are the sets of inputs that result in the same node activity at a certain level of the network. The authors demonstrate how to compute these preimages for fully connected multi-layer rectifier networks and show that they are piecewise linear manifolds in the input space.
I decide to accept this paper, with the main reason being that it presents a well-motivated and well-placed approach in the literature, tackling a specific question of understanding the behavior of deep neural networks. The authors provide a clear and detailed procedure for computing preimages, which is a significant contribution to the field.
The paper supports its claims through a combination of theoretical analysis and illustrative examples, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The authors also provide a thorough discussion of the implications of their work, including the potential for improving the efficiency of network training and the relationship between preimages and adversarial examples.
One potential limitation of the paper is that it focuses primarily on fully connected networks and does not fully address the case of convolutional networks, although the authors do provide some discussion of this topic. Additionally, the paper could benefit from more empirical evaluation of the proposed approach, including experiments on real-world datasets.
To improve the paper, I would suggest that the authors provide more detailed examples of how the preimage concept can be used in practice, such as in network training or adversarial example detection. Additionally, the authors could explore the relationship between preimages and other concepts in deep learning, such as feature visualization or interpretability.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper include:
* How do the authors plan to extend their approach to convolutional networks, and what challenges do they anticipate in doing so?
* Can the authors provide more intuition about why the preimage concept is useful for understanding network behavior, and how it relates to other concepts in deep learning?
* How do the authors plan to evaluate the effectiveness of their approach in practice, and what metrics or benchmarks do they propose using?
