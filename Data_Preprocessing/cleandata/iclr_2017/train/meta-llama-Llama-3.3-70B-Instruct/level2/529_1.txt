This paper proposes a novel sequence learning approach, called RL Tuner, which combines supervised learning and reinforcement learning (RL) to refine a pre-trained Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for sequence generation tasks. The authors claim that their approach can improve the coherence and structure of generated sequences, such as music melodies, by incorporating music theory-based rewards into the RL framework.
I decide to accept this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the paper presents a well-motivated approach to addressing the known failure modes of sequence models, such as excessively repeating tokens or producing sequences that lack a consistent theme or structure. The authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the problem and their proposed solution, which is well-placed in the literature. Secondly, the paper provides a thorough evaluation of the proposed approach, including quantitative results and a user study, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the RL Tuner method in improving the quality of generated melodies.
The supporting arguments for my decision include the fact that the paper provides a clear and well-structured presentation of the proposed approach, including a detailed description of the RL Tuner framework and its components. The authors also provide a thorough analysis of the results, including a discussion of the limitations and potential applications of the approach. Additionally, the paper provides a comprehensive review of related work, which helps to situate the proposed approach within the broader context of sequence generation and RL research.
To improve the paper, I would suggest that the authors provide more details on the implementation of the RL Tuner framework, including the specific hyperparameters used and the computational resources required. Additionally, it would be helpful to include more examples of generated melodies, to provide a clearer illustration of the improvements achieved by the RL Tuner method. Finally, I would like to ask the authors to clarify how they plan to extend the RL Tuner approach to more complex sequence generation tasks, such as text or image generation, and what potential challenges or limitations they anticipate in these domains.
Some specific questions I would like the authors to answer include: (1) How do the authors plan to balance the trade-off between the influence of data and heuristic rewards in the RL Tuner framework, and what are the implications of this trade-off for the quality of generated sequences? (2) Can the authors provide more details on the user study, including the demographics of the participants and the specific evaluation metrics used? (3) How do the authors plan to address the potential issue of overfitting to the music theory-based rewards, and what strategies can be used to promote more generalizable and creative sequence generation?
