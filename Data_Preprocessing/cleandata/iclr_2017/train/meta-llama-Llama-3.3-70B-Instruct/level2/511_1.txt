This paper presents a novel approach to approximating the solution to the Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs partial differential equation (HJI PDE) using a neural network. The authors propose an algorithm that utilizes a feedforward neural network as both a function approximator and a data generator, allowing for the approximation of the HJI PDE solution without the need for explicit data pairs.
The main claim of the paper is that this approach can effectively approximate the solution to the HJI PDE, and the authors provide several experiments to demonstrate the validity of their claim. The experiments show that the proposed algorithm can achieve satisfactory results in approximating the solution to the HJI PDE for various dynamical systems, including a linear system, a pursuit-evasion game with a single input, and a pursuit-evasion game with two competing inputs.
I decide to accept this paper with minor revisions. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their approach and the experiments they conducted. The results of the experiments are promising, and the authors provide a good discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of their approach.
One of the key strengths of the paper is the authors' ability to motivate their approach and provide a clear explanation of the underlying mathematics. The paper is also well-organized, and the authors provide a good overview of the related work in the field.
One potential area for improvement is the discussion of the limitations of the approach. While the authors mention some of the disadvantages of their method, such as the time requirement and the need to tune hyperparameters, they could provide a more detailed discussion of these limitations and how they might be addressed in future work.
Additionally, the authors could provide more details about the implementation of their algorithm, such as the specific neural network architecture used and the optimization algorithm employed. This would help to make the paper more reproducible and would provide more insight into the specifics of the approach.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer in their revision include:
* Can you provide more details about the neural network architecture used in the experiments, such as the number of hidden layers and the activation functions employed?
* How did you select the hyperparameters for the algorithm, such as the learning rate and the momentum decay?
* Can you provide more discussion about the potential applications of this approach to other areas of control theory and robotics?
* How do you plan to address the limitations of the approach in future work, such as the time requirement and the need to tune hyperparameters? 
Overall, the paper presents a novel and promising approach to approximating the solution to the HJI PDE, and with some minor revisions, it has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field.
