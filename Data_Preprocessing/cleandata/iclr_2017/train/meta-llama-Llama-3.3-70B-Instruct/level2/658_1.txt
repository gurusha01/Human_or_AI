This paper claims to contribute to the field of representation learning by leveraging Sum-Product Networks (SPNs) and Max-Product Networks (MPNs) as hierarchical feature extractors. The authors argue that SPNs can be used for unsupervised representation learning, and when converted to MPNs, they can be used as generative autoencoders. The paper presents a decoding procedure that allows for the reconstruction of the original input space from the learned representations.
I decide to accept this paper with minor revisions. The main reasons for this decision are:
1. The paper tackles a specific and well-defined problem in the field of representation learning, and the approach is well-motivated and placed in the literature.
2. The authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the technical details, including the decoding procedure and the experimental setup.
3. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, showing that SPN and MPN representations are competitive with other state-of-the-art methods.
However, I have some minor concerns that need to be addressed:
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the limitations of the proposed approach and potential avenues for future work.
* Some of the experimental results, such as the reconstruction errors, could be presented in a more detailed and comprehensive manner.
* The paper assumes a certain level of familiarity with SPNs and MPNs, which may not be the case for all readers. Adding a brief introduction or background section on these topics could make the paper more accessible to a broader audience.
To improve the paper, I suggest the following:
* Provide more detailed explanations of the decoding procedure and the experimental setup, including any hyperparameter tuning and model selection procedures.
* Consider adding more visualizations or illustrations to help readers understand the technical details, such as the structure of the SPNs and MPNs.
* Discuss potential applications and implications of the proposed approach, beyond the specific experimental setup presented in the paper.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer:
* How do the authors plan to address the potential issue of overfitting, given the complexity of the SPN and MPN models?
* Can the authors provide more insight into the interpretability of the learned representations, and how they can be used in practice?
* How do the authors plan to extend the proposed approach to more complex and high-dimensional datasets?
