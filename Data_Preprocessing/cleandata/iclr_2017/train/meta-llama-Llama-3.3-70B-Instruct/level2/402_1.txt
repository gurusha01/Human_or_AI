This paper presents HYPERBAND, a novel algorithm for hyperparameter optimization that adaptively allocates resources to randomly sampled configurations. The authors claim that HYPERBAND can provide more than an order of magnitude speedups over popular Bayesian Optimization methods on various neural network and kernel-based learning problems.
I decide to accept this paper with the following key reasons:
1. The paper tackles a specific and well-defined problem in the field of hyperparameter optimization, which is a crucial aspect of machine learning.
2. The approach is well-motivated and placed within the existing literature, demonstrating a clear understanding of the current state of the field.
3. The paper provides extensive empirical evaluations, comparing HYPERBAND with several well-established Bayesian Optimization methods on multiple datasets and tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness.
The supporting arguments for my decision include:
* The authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the HYPERBAND algorithm, making it easy to understand and implement.
* The empirical results demonstrate the superiority of HYPERBAND over other methods in terms of speed and performance, which is a significant contribution to the field.
* The paper discusses the limitations of the approach and provides potential avenues for future work, demonstrating a thorough understanding of the research area.
To further improve the paper, I suggest the authors:
* Provide more detailed analysis of the theoretical properties of HYPERBAND, including its convergence guarantees and bounds on the expected regret.
* Investigate the application of HYPERBAND to other machine learning tasks and domains, to demonstrate its broader applicability.
* Consider providing more visualizations and plots to help illustrate the performance of HYPERBAND and other methods, making the results more accessible to a wider audience.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper include:
* Can you provide more details on the choice of hyperparameters for HYPERBAND, such as the value of Î· and R, and how they affect the performance of the algorithm?
* How does HYPERBAND handle cases where the optimal hyperparameters are located in a region with high variance or noise, and how does it adapt to such scenarios?
* Are there any plans to release an implementation of HYPERBAND as an open-source library or tool, to facilitate its adoption and use by the broader machine learning community?
