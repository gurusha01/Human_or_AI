This paper proposes a novel attention-based framework for sentiment analysis, which incorporates local contexts with a global context attention. The authors claim that their model, inspired by human reading behavior, can effectively capture complex semantic compositions and achieve state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets.
I decide to accept this paper, with two key reasons: (1) the approach is well-motivated and grounded in the literature, and (2) the empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.
The paper provides a clear and thorough introduction to the background and related work, highlighting the limitations of existing methods and the potential benefits of the proposed approach. The authors also provide a detailed description of their model, including the two-scan approach with attention and the single-scan approach with attention.
The experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms several baseline models, including traditional machine learning methods and neural models, on three benchmark datasets. The attention visualization and case study also provide insights into how the model works and demonstrate its ability to effectively capture important local contexts.
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more analysis on the computational complexity of their model and compare it with other attention-based models. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more experiments on other NLP tasks, such as question answering or text classification, to demonstrate the generalizability of the proposed approach.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer include: (1) How do the authors plan to extend their model to handle multi-task learning or transfer learning? (2) Can the authors provide more insights into the attention weights and how they relate to the sentiment of the text? (3) How does the model perform on datasets with limited training data or noisy labels?
Overall, this paper presents a well-motivated and effective approach to sentiment analysis, and with some additional analysis and experiments, it has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of NLP.
