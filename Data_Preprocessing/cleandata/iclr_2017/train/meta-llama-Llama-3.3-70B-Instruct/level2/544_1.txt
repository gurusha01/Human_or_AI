The paper proposes a novel approach to optimizing controllers in robotics by introducing a differentiable physics engine. This engine allows for the computation of gradients of control parameters with respect to the fitness of a robot in a simulation, enabling the use of gradient-based optimization methods. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on several examples, including a quadrupedal robot, a robotic arm, and an inverted pendulum with a camera as a sensor.
I decide to accept this paper with the following reasons: 
1. The paper tackles a specific and important problem in robotics, namely the optimization of controllers, and proposes a well-motivated approach to solve it.
2. The approach is well-placed in the literature, building on existing work in physics engines, automatic differentiation, and deep learning.
The paper provides strong support for its claims, including experimental results that demonstrate the speedup of optimization processes using the proposed approach. The authors also provide a thorough discussion of the limitations and potential applications of their work. 
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the implementation of the differentiable physics engine, including the specific algorithms and techniques used to compute the gradients. Additionally, the authors could provide more extensive experimental results, including comparisons with other optimization methods and a more detailed analysis of the scalability of their approach.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper include: 
1. How do the authors plan to address the issue of sim-to-real transfer, where the optimized controller may not perform well on the physical robot due to differences between the simulation and reality?
2. Can the authors provide more details on the computational resources required to run the differentiable physics engine, including the memory and processing power needed?
3. How do the authors plan to extend their approach to more complex robotics tasks, such as those involving multiple robots or dynamic environments? 
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of robotics and has the potential to enable more efficient and effective optimization of controllers. With some additional details and experimental results, the paper could be even stronger.
