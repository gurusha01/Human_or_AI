This paper proposes a novel approach for learning feature representations of graph-structured data using an unsupervised encoder-decoder model. The authors claim that their method can learn generic feature representations for graphs, which can be used for various downstream tasks such as classification and clustering. The paper presents a well-motivated approach, building on existing work in natural language processing and graph representation learning.
The authors evaluate their method on several real-world datasets, achieving competitive results with state-of-the-art techniques. The paper provides a clear and detailed description of the proposed approach, including the encoder-decoder model, training procedure, and aggregation strategies for obtaining graph representations.
