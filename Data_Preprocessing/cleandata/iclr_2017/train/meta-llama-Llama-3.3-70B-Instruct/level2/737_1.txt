This paper proposes a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture called SqueezeNet, which achieves AlexNet-level accuracy on ImageNet with 50x fewer parameters. The authors employ three main strategies to design CNN architectures with few parameters: replacing 3x3 filters with 1x1 filters, decreasing the number of input channels to 3x3 filters, and downsampling late in the network. The proposed Fire module, which consists of a squeeze convolution layer and an expand layer, is the building block of SqueezeNet. The authors also explore the design space of SqueezeNet-like architectures by varying the squeeze ratio and the proportion of 1x1 and 3x3 filters.
I decide to accept this paper for the following reasons: 
1. The paper tackles a specific and well-motivated problem, which is to identify a CNN architecture with fewer parameters but equivalent accuracy compared to a well-known model.
2. The approach is well-placed in the literature, and the authors provide a comprehensive review of related work on model compression and CNN microarchitecture and macroarchitecture.
The paper provides strong support for its claims, including experimental results that demonstrate the effectiveness of SqueezeNet and its compressed versions. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the design space of SqueezeNet-like architectures, which sheds light on the impact of CNN architectural choices on model size and accuracy.
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the training protocol and the hyperparameter tuning process. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more experiments on the application of SqueezeNet to other datasets and tasks, such as fine-grained object recognition and autonomous driving.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer include: 
* How did the authors determine the optimal hyperparameters for SqueezeNet, and what was the effect of hyperparameter tuning on the model's performance?
* Can the authors provide more insights on the trade-offs between model size, accuracy, and computational efficiency in SqueezeNet and its compressed versions?
* How does SqueezeNet compare to other state-of-the-art CNN architectures in terms of performance and efficiency on various tasks and datasets?
