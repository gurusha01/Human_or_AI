This paper proposes an efficient variant of convolutional sparse coding with unit norm code vectors, where reconstruction quality is evaluated using an inner product (cosine distance). The authors introduce a model called Energy-Based Spherical Sparse Coding (EB-SSC), which combines top-down and bottom-up information to produce class-specific features. The model is evaluated on the CIFAR-10 dataset and shows improved performance compared to baseline models.
I decide to accept this paper with minor revisions. The main reasons for this decision are:
1. The paper tackles a specific question/problem in the field of sparse coding and provides a well-motivated approach to address it.
2. The approach is well-placed in the literature, and the authors provide a clear connection to previous works in the field.
3. The paper supports its claims with empirical results, and the experiments are well-designed and thoroughly executed.
Some minor revisions are needed to improve the clarity and readability of the paper. Specifically:
* The notation and terminology used in the paper could be more clearly defined and explained, especially for readers who are not familiar with the field of sparse coding.
* Some of the equations and derivations could be more explicitly stated and explained, to make it easier for readers to follow the authors' reasoning.
* The authors could provide more discussion and analysis of the results, to help readers understand the implications and significance of the findings.
Additionally, I would like the authors to address the following questions:
* How does the proposed EB-SSC model compare to other state-of-the-art models in the field, in terms of performance and computational efficiency?
* Can the authors provide more insights into the learned representations and features produced by the EB-SSC model, and how they relate to the class-specific coding?
* Are there any potential applications or extensions of the EB-SSC model to other domains or tasks, and how could they be explored in future work?
