This paper proposes a modification to the texture synthesis method introduced by Gatys et al. (2015a) to incorporate long-range structure into image generation. The authors introduce a new representation based on spatial co-occurrences of local features, which allows for the capture of long-range correlations in images. The approach is demonstrated to be effective in generating textures with various global symmetry properties and is applied to inpainting and season transfer tasks.
I decide to accept this paper, with the main reason being that the approach is well-motivated and effectively addresses the limitation of the original method in capturing long-range structure. The paper provides a clear and thorough explanation of the proposed method, and the experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness in various applications.
The paper supports its claims through a series of experiments, including the synthesis of structured and unstructured textures, inpainting, and season transfer. The results show that the proposed approach outperforms the original method in capturing long-range correlations and preserving global symmetry properties. The paper also provides a detailed analysis of the proposed representation and its relationship to existing methods, such as Markov Random Fields and Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrices.
One potential limitation of the paper is that the choice of δ values for each layer is not fully automated, and the authors rely on a fixed set of values per layer. However, the authors provide a guideline for selecting δ values and demonstrate that the approach is robust to the choice of δ values.
To further improve the paper, I would suggest that the authors provide more details on the computational cost of the proposed approach and its scalability to larger images. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more examples of the application of the proposed approach to other tasks, such as image editing and manipulation.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer include: How do the authors plan to automate the choice of δ values for each layer? Can the proposed approach be extended to capture more complex types of structure, such as hierarchical or compositional structure? How does the proposed approach compare to other methods for capturing long-range correlations, such as recurrent neural networks or graphical models?
