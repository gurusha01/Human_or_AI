This paper proposes a novel approach to generating handwriting sequences using a physiologically plausible model of handwriting as a feature representation for sequence generation with recurrent mixture density networks. The authors build on recent results in handwriting prediction and focus on generating sequences that possess the statistical and dynamic qualities of handwriting and calligraphic art forms.
The paper claims to contribute to the field by introducing a movement-centric approach to handwriting generation, which provides a number of advantages, including the ability to capture both the geometry and dynamics of a hand-drawn/written trace with a single representation. The authors also demonstrate the ability to mix "styles" (applying curvature and dynamic properties from one example to the motor plan of another), learn a generative model from a small number of samples, and generate resolution-independent outputs.
Based on the provided information, I decide to accept this paper. The main reasons for this decision are:
1. The paper tackles a specific and well-defined problem in the field of handwriting generation, and the approach proposed by the authors is well-motivated and grounded in the literature.
2. The authors provide a clear and detailed description of their method, including the preprocessing step, the RMDN models, and the experiments conducted to evaluate the performance of their system.
3. The results presented in the paper demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in generating handwriting sequences that capture the statistical and dynamic qualities of handwriting and calligraphic art forms.
Some potential limitations of the paper include:
1. The authors rely on a specific dataset (IAM) for their experiments, and it is not clear how well their approach would generalize to other datasets or handwriting styles.
2. The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the results, including a quantitative evaluation of the performance of the proposed approach compared to other state-of-the-art methods.
3. The authors mention that their method is limited by the accuracy of the preprocessing step, and it is not clear how robust their approach is to errors or variations in the input data.
To improve the paper, I would suggest that the authors:
1. Provide more details on the preprocessing step and the RMDN models, including the hyperparameters used and the training procedure.
2. Conduct a more thorough evaluation of the performance of their approach, including a comparison to other state-of-the-art methods and a quantitative analysis of the results.
3. Discuss the potential limitations and robustness of their approach, including the sensitivity to errors or variations in the input data.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer include:
1. How do the authors plan to extend their approach to handle more complex handwriting styles or datasets?
2. Can the authors provide more details on the computational resources required to train and evaluate their system?
3. How do the authors plan to address the potential limitations of their approach, including the reliance on a specific dataset and the sensitivity to errors or variations in the input data?
