This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of vocabulary selection techniques for neural machine translation, aiming to improve the efficiency of decoding and training by constraining the output vocabulary to a subset relevant to the source sentence. The authors investigate various selection methods, including word co-occurrence counts, bilingual embeddings, word alignments, phrase pairs, and discriminative SVM classifiers. The results show that decoding speed can be reduced by up to 90% without compromising accuracy, with word alignments, bilingual phrases, and SVMs achieving high accuracy even with fewer than 1,000 word types per sentence.
I decide to accept this paper, with the main reason being the thorough and well-motivated approach to exploring the trade-off between speed and accuracy for different vocabulary sizes. The authors provide a clear and detailed analysis of the results, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each selection method.
The paper is well-structured, and the writing is clear and concise. The authors demonstrate a good understanding of the field, citing relevant literature and providing a comprehensive overview of related work. The experiments are well-designed, and the results are thoroughly analyzed, providing valuable insights into the effectiveness of each selection method.
One area for improvement is the discussion of limitations, which could be more detailed. The authors mention that training with a reduced vocabulary could result in worse parameter estimates, especially for rare words, but this point could be elaborated upon. Additionally, the authors could provide more context about the potential applications of their work and the implications of their findings for the field of neural machine translation.
To further improve the paper, I would like the authors to address the following questions:
* Can the authors provide more details about the computational resources used for the experiments, such as the specific GPU model and the amount of memory available?
* How do the authors plan to make their code and data available to the research community, and what steps will they take to ensure reproducibility of their results?
* Can the authors discuss potential future directions for their work, such as exploring other selection methods or applying their approach to other natural language processing tasks? 
Overall, this is a well-written and well-researched paper that makes a significant contribution to the field of neural machine translation. With some minor revisions to address the above points, it has the potential to be a strong addition to the conference program.
