Summary of the Paper's Claims and Contributions
The paper proposes a novel multiagent system framework that reinterprets deep networks as a subset of feedforward networks without the traditional layer structure. The authors argue that this approach is more biologically plausible and can lead to more efficient and scalable models. They demonstrate the equivalence of their multiagent system with the standard Stacked Denoising Autoencoder (SDAE) and propose a variant called Sparse Connect SDAE, which shows computational advantages on the MNIST dataset.
Decision and Key Reasons
I decide to Accept this paper, with the key reasons being:
1. The paper presents a novel and well-motivated approach to reinterpreting deep networks as multiagent systems, which has the potential to lead to more efficient and scalable models.
2. The authors provide a thorough theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation of their approach, demonstrating its equivalence with the standard SDAE and its advantages on the MNIST dataset.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's contributions are significant, as they:
1. Provide a new perspective on deep networks, which can lead to more biologically plausible models.
2. Demonstrate the equivalence of their multiagent system with the standard SDAE, which shows that their approach is not only novel but also grounded in existing knowledge.
3. Propose a variant of their approach, Sparse Connect SDAE, which shows computational advantages on the MNIST dataset, demonstrating the potential of their approach to lead to more efficient models.
Additional Feedback and Questions
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors:
1. Provide more details on the potential applications of their approach, beyond the MNIST dataset.
2. Discuss the limitations of their approach and potential future directions for research.
3. Consider providing more visualizations or illustrations to help readers understand the multiagent system framework and its equivalence with the standard SDAE.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer:
1. How do the authors plan to extend their approach to more complex models, such as convolutional neural networks or recurrent neural networks?
2. Can the authors provide more insights into the computational advantages of their approach, beyond the reduction in computation time?
3. How do the authors plan to address the potential challenges of training and optimizing their multiagent system framework, particularly in large-scale settings?
