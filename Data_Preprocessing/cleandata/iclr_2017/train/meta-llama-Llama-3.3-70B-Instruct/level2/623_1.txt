This paper presents a fascinating study on the eigenvalues of the Hessian of a loss function in deep learning, revealing a two-phased spectrum with a bulk concentrated around zero and isolated eigenvalues dependent on the input data. The authors provide empirical evidence for this phenomenon, demonstrating its implications on the theoretical understanding of convergence properties of gradient-based algorithms and the potential for novel optimization methods.
I decide to accept this paper, with the primary reason being the novelty and significance of the observed two-phased spectrum. The authors provide a thorough analysis, supported by experiments on various architectures and datasets, which strengthens their claims. Additionally, the paper is well-motivated, with a clear connection to existing literature and a thoughtful discussion of the implications of their findings.
The supporting arguments for this decision include the paper's ability to identify a previously unexplored aspect of the Hessian's eigenvalue distribution, which has important consequences for the development of more efficient optimization algorithms. The authors also demonstrate a good understanding of the relevant literature, citing key works in the field and building upon existing research.
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors consider providing more detailed analysis on the relationship between the eigenvalue spectrum and the convergence properties of gradient-based algorithms. Additionally, it would be beneficial to explore the potential applications of their findings in more depth, such as devising separate methods for the directions corresponding to the top eigenvalues.
Some questions I would like the authors to clarify include: (1) How do the results change when using different optimization algorithms, such as stochastic gradient descent with momentum or Adam? (2) Can the authors provide more insight into the relationship between the eigenvalue spectrum and the generalization performance of the model? (3) How do the findings relate to existing work on flat minima and the geometry of the loss landscape? Answering these questions would provide additional evidence to support the authors' claims and further strengthen the paper's contributions.
