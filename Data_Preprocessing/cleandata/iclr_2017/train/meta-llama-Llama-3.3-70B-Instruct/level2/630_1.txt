The paper proposes two novel mechanisms to improve the performance of encoder-decoder models in sequence-to-sequence tasks, specifically in text summarization. The first contribution is a 'Read-Again' model that reads the input sequence twice, allowing the encoder to capture the meaning of each word in the context of the entire sentence. The second contribution is a copy mechanism that enables the decoder to handle out-of-vocabulary words by copying them from the input sequence, reducing the need for a large vocabulary size.
I decide to accept this paper with the following key reasons: 
1. The approach is well-motivated and addresses two significant shortcomings of current encoder-decoder models.
2. The paper provides a thorough evaluation of the proposed mechanisms, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on the Gigaword and DUC2004 datasets.
The supporting arguments for these reasons are as follows:
- The 'Read-Again' model is a simple yet effective way to improve the encoder's ability to capture the context of the input sequence, and the experimental results show significant improvements over baseline models.
- The copy mechanism is a principled way to handle out-of-vocabulary words, allowing the decoder to generate summaries that contain rare or unseen words, and the results show that it can reduce the decoder vocabulary size while maintaining performance.
Additional feedback to improve the paper includes:
- Providing more analysis on the importance weights learned by the 'Read-Again' model, such as visualizing the weights for different types of words or phrases.
- Investigating the applicability of the proposed mechanisms to other sequence-to-sequence tasks, such as machine translation or question answering.
- Comparing the performance of the 'Read-Again' model with other attention-based models, such as those using self-attention or hierarchical attention.
Questions to the authors:
- Can you provide more details on how the importance weights are learned and how they are used to bias the second reading pass?
- How do you handle cases where the input sequence is very long, and the 'Read-Again' model needs to read the sequence multiple times?
- Can you provide more examples of the copy mechanism in action, such as cases where the decoder copies rare words or phrases from the input sequence?
