The paper presents a novel approach to neural machine translation using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as an alternative to traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs). The authors propose a convolutional encoder that can encode the entire source sentence simultaneously, allowing for faster computation and improved performance. The paper claims that the convolutional encoder achieves competitive accuracy to state-of-the-art results on several machine translation tasks, including WMT'16 English-Romanian, WMT'15 English-German, and WMT'14 English-French.
I decide to accept this paper with minor revisions. The main reasons for this decision are:
1. The paper presents a novel and well-motivated approach to neural machine translation, which has the potential to improve the efficiency and accuracy of machine translation systems.
2. The authors provide a thorough evaluation of their approach on several benchmark datasets, demonstrating its competitiveness with state-of-the-art results.
3. The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with clear explanations of the proposed approach and its implementation.
However, I have some minor suggestions for improvement:
* The authors could provide more detailed analysis of the attention mechanisms used in the convolutional encoder, including visualizations of the attention weights and a discussion of their implications for the translation process.
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with other recent approaches to neural machine translation, including a discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.
* The authors could provide more information about the computational resources required to train and evaluate their model, including the amount of time and memory required for each experiment.
Some specific questions I would like the authors to address in their revision are:
* How do the attention mechanisms used in the convolutional encoder compare to those used in traditional RNN-based approaches?
* Can the authors provide more insight into the role of position embeddings in the convolutional encoder, and how they affect the translation process?
* How do the computational resources required to train and evaluate the convolutional encoder compare to those required for traditional RNN-based approaches?
