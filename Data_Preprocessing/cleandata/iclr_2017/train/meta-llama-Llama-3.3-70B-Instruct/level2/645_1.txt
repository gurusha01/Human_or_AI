The paper "Deep Generalized Canonical Correlation Analysis (DGCCA)" presents a novel method for learning nonlinear transformations of multiple views of data, such that the resulting transformations are maximally informative of each other. The authors claim that DGCCA is the first CCA-style multiview representation learning technique that combines the flexibility of nonlinear (deep) representation learning with the statistical power of incorporating information from many independent sources, or views.
I decide to accept this paper with the following key reasons: 
1. The paper tackles a specific and well-defined problem in multiview representation learning, which is a significant challenge in the field.
2. The approach is well-motivated, and the authors provide a clear and concise overview of the related work, including the limitations of existing methods.
The supporting arguments for this decision are as follows:
- The authors provide a thorough derivation of the DGCCA objective and its gradient, which is a significant contribution to the field.
- The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of DGCCA in learning informative representations from multiple views, outperforming existing methods in several downstream tasks.
- The paper is well-organized, and the writing is clear and concise, making it easy to follow and understand.
To further improve the paper, I suggest the following:
- Provide more visualizations of the learned representations, such as t-SNE or PCA plots, to help illustrate the quality of the learned representations.
- Consider adding more baselines or comparing DGCCA to other state-of-the-art methods in multiview representation learning.
- Provide more details on the hyperparameter tuning process and the sensitivity of the results to different hyperparameter settings.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper are:
- Can you provide more intuition on why the DGCCA objective is effective in learning informative representations from multiple views?
- How do you handle cases where the number of views is very large, and the computational cost of computing the gradient becomes prohibitive?
- Are there any plans to release the implementation of DGCCA as an open-source library or toolbox?
