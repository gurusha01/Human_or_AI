This paper proposes a novel approach to bioacoustic representation using a Fast Chirplet Transform (FCT), which is a trade-off between the scattering framework and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The authors claim that FCT can efficiently preprocess audio signals and improve the performance of CNNs in bioacoustic classification tasks. The main contributions of the paper are the definition and implementation of FCT, as well as its application to bird species classification and speech vowel recognition.
I decide to accept this paper with minor revisions. The main reasons for this decision are:
1. The paper tackles a specific and interesting problem in bioacoustic representation, which is a relevant topic in the field of artificial intelligence.
2. The approach proposed by the authors is well-motivated and grounded in the literature, and the use of FCT as a preprocessing step for CNNs is a novel and promising idea.
3. The experimental results presented in the paper demonstrate the effectiveness of FCT in improving the performance of CNNs in bioacoustic classification tasks.
However, there are some minor issues that need to be addressed in the revision. For example, the paper could benefit from a more detailed explanation of the FCT algorithm and its implementation, as well as a more thorough analysis of the experimental results. Additionally, the authors could provide more context and background information on the bioacoustic representation problem and its relevance to the field of artificial intelligence.
Some specific suggestions for improvement include:
* Providing a more detailed explanation of the FCT algorithm and its implementation, including the use of pseudocode or flowcharts to illustrate the process.
* Conducting a more thorough analysis of the experimental results, including a comparison with other state-of-the-art methods and a discussion of the limitations and potential biases of the approach.
* Providing more context and background information on the bioacoustic representation problem and its relevance to the field of artificial intelligence, including a discussion of the potential applications and implications of the proposed approach.
Overall, this is a well-written and well-structured paper that presents a novel and promising approach to bioacoustic representation. With some minor revisions to address the issues mentioned above, it has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of artificial intelligence.
I would like the authors to answer the following questions to clarify my understanding of the paper:
* Can you provide more details on the implementation of the FCT algorithm, including the specific parameters and hyperparameters used in the experiments?
* How do you plan to address the issue of scalability and computational efficiency in the FCT algorithm, particularly for large-scale audio datasets?
* Can you provide more context and background information on the bioacoustic representation problem and its relevance to the field of artificial intelligence, including a discussion of the potential applications and implications of the proposed approach?
