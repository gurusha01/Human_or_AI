This paper presents a novel approach to learning algorithmic tasks by leveraging the principle of divide and conquer, which is a fundamental concept in discrete mathematics and computer science. The authors introduce a recursive split and merge architecture that can be trained using only input-output pairs, without the need for explicit supervision or intermediate targets. The model is designed to optimize both accuracy and computational complexity, making it a promising approach for learning complex tasks.
The paper is well-organized, and the authors provide a clear and concise overview of their contributions, including the introduction of a recursive split and merge architecture, a learning framework that optimizes for both accuracy and complexity, and preliminary empirical evidence on simple tasks such as sorting and planar convex hull. The authors also provide a detailed description of their model, including the split and merge blocks, and the training procedure.
The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, showing impressive generalization performance and robustness to input distribution. The results are promising, and the authors provide a clear discussion of the limitations and potential extensions of their work.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to leverage the principle of divide and conquer to learn complex tasks. The authors provide a clear and concise overview of the related work, and their approach is well-motivated and well-placed in the literature.
However, there are some limitations to the paper. The authors acknowledge that their results are preliminary, and much work remains to be done to make the architecture competitive. Additionally, the authors note that the optimal value of the hyperparameter Î±M is unknown and depends on the scale and data distribution.
To improve the paper, I would suggest that the authors provide more details on the training procedure, including the optimization algorithm used and the hyperparameter tuning process. Additionally, it would be helpful to include more experiments on more complex tasks to demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of the approach.
Overall, I would recommend accepting this paper, as it presents a novel and promising approach to learning algorithmic tasks. The authors provide a clear and concise overview of their contributions, and the experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.
