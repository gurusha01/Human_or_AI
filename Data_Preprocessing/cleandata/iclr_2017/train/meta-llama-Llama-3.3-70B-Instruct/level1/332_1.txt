Summary of the Paper's Claims and Contributions
The paper proposes a novel approach to learning perceptual similarity judgment by re-training a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) with object persistence constraints. The authors claim that their approach, called Object Persistence Net (OPnet), can learn to associate different views of the same 3D object and capture the notion of object persistence and continuity in visual experience. The paper demonstrates that OPnet outperforms existing approaches, including AlexNet, in similarity judgment tasks on novel objects and categories.
Decision and Key Reasons
I decide to Accept this paper, with two key reasons:
1. The paper tackles a specific and well-motivated question in the field of computer vision and cognitive neuroscience, namely, how to develop a computational model of human perceptual similarity judgment.
2. The authors provide a thorough and well-structured evaluation of their approach, including comparisons with existing methods and analyses of the learned feature representations.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a clear and concise introduction to the problem of perceptual similarity judgment and its importance in understanding human visual perception. The authors also provide a thorough review of related work in the field, including recent approaches to representation learning and distance metric learning. The proposed approach, OPnet, is well-motivated and technically sound, and the authors provide a detailed description of the architecture and training procedure. The evaluation section is comprehensive and well-organized, with clear comparisons to existing methods and analyses of the learned feature representations.
Additional Feedback and Suggestions
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors:
* Provide more detailed analysis of the learned feature representations and their relationship to human perceptual similarity judgment.
* Explore the application of OPnet to other domains, such as image retrieval and object recognition.
* Consider using more diverse and challenging datasets to evaluate the robustness of OPnet.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
* Can you provide more details on how the object persistence constraints are incorporated into the training procedure, and how they affect the learned feature representations?
* How do you plan to extend OPnet to more complex and dynamic scenes, where objects may be occluded or undergo significant changes in appearance?
* Can you provide more insights into the relationship between the learned feature representations and human perceptual similarity judgment, and how OPnet can be used to inform our understanding of human visual perception?
