This paper proposes a novel approach to network morphism, which enables the transformation of a convolutional layer into an arbitrary module of a neural network. The authors introduce a graph-based representation for modules and formulate the network morphism process as a graph transformation problem. They define two atomic morphing operations and propose algorithms for simple morphable modules and complex modules.
The paper claims to contribute to the field of network morphism by providing a systematic study of the problem at a higher level, and by proposing a unified morphing solution for both simple and complex modules. The authors also demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet.
I decide to accept this paper with the following key reasons:
1. The paper tackles a specific and well-defined problem in the field of network morphism, which is a relevant and important area of research in deep learning.
2. The approach proposed by the authors is well-motivated and grounded in the literature, and they provide a clear and concise explanation of their methodology.
The paper supports its claims through theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the network morphism process and propose algorithms for different types of modules. They also conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach, and the results show significant improvements in performance over the original ResNet models.
To further improve the paper, I would like to see more discussion on the limitations of the proposed approach and potential future directions for research. Additionally, it would be helpful to provide more details on the implementation of the algorithms and the experimental setup.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper include:
* Can the authors provide more insight into the choice of the two atomic morphing operations and how they were derived?
* How do the authors plan to extend their approach to more complex network architectures and larger datasets?
* What are the potential applications of the proposed network morphism approach beyond image classification tasks?
