Summary
The paper proposes a novel method, Cat2Vec, for learning distributed representations of multi-field categorical data. Inspired by Word2Vec, Cat2Vec uses neural gates to capture interactions between categories and K-max pooling layers to select the most informative ones. The authors evaluate their model on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating its ability to capture significant patterns and improve performance in supervised learning tasks, such as click-through rate prediction.
Decision
I decide to Accept this paper, with the main reason being that the approach is well-motivated and supported by experimental results. The authors provide a clear explanation of the problem, related work, and their proposed solution, making it easy to follow and understand.
Supporting Arguments
The paper tackles a specific question of learning distributed representations for multi-field categorical data, which is a common problem in various applications. The approach is well-motivated, drawing inspiration from Word2Vec and association rule mining. The authors provide a thorough evaluation of their model, including experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, which demonstrates its effectiveness in capturing significant patterns and improving performance in supervised learning tasks.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest the authors consider the following:
* Provide more details on the implementation of the discriminant training method, including the choice of hyperparameters and the optimization process.
* Discuss the computational complexity of the Cat2Vec model and its scalability to large datasets.
* Consider applying Cat2Vec to other data mining problems, such as recommender systems or social link prediction, to demonstrate its broader applicability.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
* Can you provide more insight into the choice of gate functions (e.g., sum, multiplication, highway gate) and their impact on the model's performance?
* How do you handle cases where the number of categories in each field is large, and the K-max pooling layer may not be able to capture all significant interactions?
* Have you considered using other evaluation metrics, such as mean average precision or F1-score, to assess the model's performance in capturing significant patterns?
