Summary
The paper proposes NoiseOut, a novel pruning algorithm for neural networks that leverages the correlation between activations of neurons in the hidden layers. The authors introduce a technique to encourage higher correlation between neurons by adding noise outputs to the network, which enables more efficient pruning. The approach is tested on various networks and datasets, demonstrating significant compression rates without accuracy degradation.
Decision
I decide to Accept this paper, with the main reasons being the novelty and effectiveness of the proposed NoiseOut algorithm, as well as the thorough experimental evaluation on various networks and datasets.
Supporting Arguments
The paper tackles a specific and relevant problem in the field of neural networks, namely reducing the number of parameters in dense layers while maintaining accuracy. The approach is well-motivated and placed in the literature, building upon existing pruning methods and techniques to avoid overfitting. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of NoiseOut in achieving significant compression rates without accuracy loss, which is a substantial contribution to the field.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest the authors provide more insights into the theoretical foundations of the NoiseOut algorithm, particularly in relation to the correlation between neurons and the effect of noise outputs on the network's behavior. Additionally, it would be interesting to explore the applicability of NoiseOut to other types of neural networks, such as recurrent or graph neural networks.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
1. Can you provide more details on the choice of random distributions for the noise outputs, and how they affect the correlation between neurons?
2. How does the NoiseOut algorithm handle cases where the correlation between neurons is not strong, and what are the implications for pruning in such scenarios?
3. Have you explored the potential applications of NoiseOut in other areas, such as model interpretability or explainability, and if so, what are the preliminary findings?
