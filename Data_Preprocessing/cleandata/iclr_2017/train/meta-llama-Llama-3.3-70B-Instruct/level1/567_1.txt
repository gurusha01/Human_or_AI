The paper proposes a novel method for finding dependent subspaces across multiple views of data, with a focus on preserving neighborhood relationships between data samples. The approach is well-motivated, as it addresses a common problem in data analysis where relationships between multiple views of data need to be understood. The method is based on optimizing a criterion that measures the similarity of neighborhoods between views, which is a natural measure for similarity of data relationships.
I decide to accept this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the paper tackles a specific and important problem in data analysis, and the proposed method is well-motivated and grounded in the literature. Secondly, the paper provides a thorough evaluation of the method, including experiments on artificial and real-world data sets, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.
The paper provides a clear and detailed description of the method, including the optimization technique used to learn the dependent subspaces. The experiments are well-designed and provide a comprehensive evaluation of the method, including comparisons to other state-of-the-art methods. The results show that the proposed method outperforms other methods in preserving cross-view neighborhood similarities and yields insights into local dependencies between multiple views.
To further improve the paper, I would suggest providing more discussion on the choice of the neighborhood distribution and the optimization technique. For example, the paper uses a simple exponential falloff to define the neighborhood distribution, but it would be interesting to explore other choices and their impact on the results. Additionally, the paper uses a gradient-based optimization technique, but it would be useful to discuss the convergence properties of the algorithm and any potential limitations.
I would also like to ask the authors to clarify a few points. Firstly, how do the authors choose the dimensionality of the subspaces, and what is the impact of this choice on the results? Secondly, how do the authors handle cases where the views have different numbers of features or different scales? Finally, what are the potential applications of this method, and how does it relate to other methods in the field of multi-view learning?
Overall, the paper is well-written and provides a significant contribution to the field of data analysis. With some minor revisions and additional discussion, the paper has the potential to be a strong contribution to the conference.
