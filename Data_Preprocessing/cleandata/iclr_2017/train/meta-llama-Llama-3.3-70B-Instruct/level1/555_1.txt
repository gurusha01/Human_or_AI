Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper explores the application of deep neural networks (DNNs) to new domains, specifically supervised classification problems. The authors analyze a large set of DNNs across multiple domains and derive insights regarding their effectiveness. They also propose a novel meta-learning approach to rank DNN architectures based on their predicted performance, using topological features and modeling the changes in weights, biases, and activation functions during the initial training steps.
Decision and Key Reasons
I decide to Accept this paper, with two key reasons:
1. The paper tackles a specific and important problem in the field of deep learning, namely the difficulty of designing effective DNN architectures for new domains.
2. The authors propose a well-motivated and novel meta-learning approach to address this problem, which shows promising results in the experiments.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a thorough analysis of the challenges in applying DNNs to new domains and explores various aspects of DNN architectures, including their transferability across datasets and the effectiveness of parallel layers. The proposed meta-learning approach is well-motivated and based on a clear understanding of the problem. The experiments demonstrate the potential of the approach in ranking DNN architectures and identifying top-performing ones.
Additional Feedback and Questions
To further improve the paper, I suggest the authors consider the following:
* Provide more details on the computational resources required for the meta-learning approach and its scalability to larger architecture spaces.
* Explore the use of other meta-learning algorithms and compare their performance to the proposed approach.
* Consider adding more datasets to the evaluation to increase the diversity of the results.
* Provide more insights into the interpretation of the meta-features used in the approach and their contribution to the ranking performance.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer:
* How do the authors plan to address the limitation of the current approach, which only generates architectures with fixed parameters?
* Can the authors provide more details on the implementation of the meta-learning approach and the choice of hyperparameters?
* How do the authors envision the proposed approach being used in practice, and what are the potential applications and benefits?
