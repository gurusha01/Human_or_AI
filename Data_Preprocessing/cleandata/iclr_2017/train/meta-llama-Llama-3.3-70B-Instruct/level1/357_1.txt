Summary of the Paper
The paper proposes a deep neural network, called Motion-Content Network (MCnet), for predicting future frames in natural video sequences. The network decomposes the motion and content of the video into two separate encoder pathways, allowing for more accurate prediction of future frames. The motion encoder captures the temporal dynamics of the scene, while the content encoder extracts important spatial features from a single frame. The network is end-to-end trainable and can predict multiple frames into the future.
