Summary
The paper proposes a novel dynamical state space model, Relational Dynamic model with Gaussian representations (RDG), for modeling multiple simultaneous time series with correlated observations. The model represents latent factors as Gaussian distributions in a latent space and learns the series dynamics in this space. The approach is well-motivated, building on existing work in representation learning and spatio-temporal statistics. The paper claims to contribute a new dynamical model for relational time series and a stochastic component for modeling uncertainties at the observation and dynamic levels.
Decision
I decide to Accept this paper, with two key reasons for this choice: (1) the paper tackles a specific and important problem in time series analysis, and (2) the approach is well-motivated and supported by experimental results on four datasets.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a clear and concise introduction to the problem of relational time series analysis and motivates the need for a new approach. The proposed model, RDG, is well-described, and the experimental results demonstrate its competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art models. The paper also provides a thorough analysis of the results, including the ability of RDG to predict correctly at different horizons and to model the uncertainty associated with its predictions.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, I suggest the authors provide more details on the implementation of the model, including the choice of hyperparameters and the optimization procedure. Additionally, it would be helpful to include more visualizations of the results, such as plots of the predicted time series and the associated uncertainty. The authors may also consider discussing the potential applications of the RDG model in various domains, such as ecology, medicine, and finance.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
1. Can you provide more details on the choice of the Gaussian distribution for the latent factors, and how this choice affects the performance of the model?
2. How do you plan to extend the RDG model to handle more complex dynamic and prediction functions, as mentioned in the conclusion?
3. Can you provide more insights into the computational complexity of the RDG model, and how it compares to other state-of-the-art models for relational time series analysis?
