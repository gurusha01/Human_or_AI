Summary
The paper proposes a novel approach to improve vector-space word representations by alleviating the adverse effects of polysemy when using a lexicon. The authors introduce a fuzzy approach to control the contamination caused by polysemous words, annotating each paraphrase with a degree of reliability based on multilingual similarities. The approach is evaluated on various benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving word vectors and outperforming prior works.
Decision
I decide to Accept this paper, with two key reasons: (1) the approach is well-motivated and placed in the literature, addressing a significant problem in natural language processing; and (2) the paper provides thorough experimental evaluations, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method.
Supporting Arguments
The paper tackles a specific question/problem, namely, the adverse effects of polysemy on vector-space word representations. The approach is well-motivated, building on existing works that use lexicons to improve word vectors. The authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of their method, including the use of fuzzy paraphrases and a control function to regulate the replacement of words with their paraphrases. The experimental evaluations are comprehensive, covering various benchmarks and parameter settings, which demonstrates the robustness of the proposed method.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest the authors consider the following points: (1) provide more insights into the choice of bilingual similarity measures and their impact on the results; (2) explore the application of the fuzzy paraphrase approach to other NLP tasks, such as text classification and machine translation; and (3) investigate the use of other control functions or techniques to regulate the replacement of words with their paraphrases.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions: (1) How do the authors plan to extend the fuzzy paraphrase approach to other languages, considering the availability of bilingual resources? (2) Can the authors provide more details on the computational complexity of the proposed method, particularly in terms of the control function and the replacement of words with their paraphrases? (3) How do the authors envision the integration of the fuzzy paraphrase approach with other techniques, such as word sense disambiguation or part-of-speech tagging, to further improve the quality of word vectors?
