Summary
The paper introduces a hybrid CPU/GPU version of the Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) algorithm, named GA3C, which achieves a significant speedup compared to a CPU implementation. The authors analyze the computational traits of GA3C and propose a system of queues and a dynamic scheduling strategy to optimize GPU utilization. The paper demonstrates that GA3C converges faster than the CPU implementation of A3C, achieving state-of-the-art performance in a shorter time.
Decision
I decide to Accept this paper, with two key reasons: (1) the paper tackles a specific and important problem in reinforcement learning, namely, the computational efficiency of deep RL algorithms, and (2) the approach is well-motivated and supported by experimental results, demonstrating a significant speedup and improved convergence.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a thorough analysis of the computational aspects of GA3C, including the effect of resource utilization on training speed, the impact of TPS on learning speed, and the trade-offs between computational efficiency and convergence stability. The authors also provide a detailed comparison with the original A3C algorithm and demonstrate that GA3C achieves similar or better scores in a shorter time. The paper is well-organized, and the writing is clear and concise.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the dynamic scheduling strategy and the annealing process used to configure the system. Additionally, it would be helpful to include more experimental results on different systems and environments to demonstrate the robustness of GA3C. The authors may also consider providing more insights into the potential applications of GA3C in real-world problems, such as robotics or autonomous driving.
