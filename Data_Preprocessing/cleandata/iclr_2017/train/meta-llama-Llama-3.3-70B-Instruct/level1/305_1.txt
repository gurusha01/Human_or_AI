The paper presents a novel image compression method based on nonlinear transform coding, which achieves better rate-distortion performance and visual quality compared to standard methods like JPEG and JPEG 2000. The approach involves optimizing a nonlinear analysis transformation, a uniform quantizer, and a nonlinear synthesis transformation using stochastic gradient descent. The transforms are constructed in three successive stages of convolutional linear filters and nonlinear activation functions, inspired by models of biological neurons.
I decide to accept this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the paper tackles a specific and well-defined problem in image compression, which is a fundamental and well-studied problem in engineering. The approach is well-motivated, drawing on insights from biological visual systems and previous work on nonlinear transform coding. Secondly, the paper provides extensive experimental results, including comparisons with standard methods and evaluations using various metrics, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
The paper supports its claims through a thorough evaluation of the proposed method, including comparisons with JPEG and JPEG 2000 on a range of images and bit rates. The results show that the proposed method achieves better rate-distortion performance and visual quality, with fewer artifacts and a more natural appearance. The paper also provides a detailed analysis of the optimization process and the properties of the learned transforms, which helps to understand the strengths and limitations of the approach.
To improve the paper, I would suggest providing more insight into the optimization process, such as the choice of hyperparameters and the convergence behavior of the algorithm. Additionally, it would be helpful to include more comparisons with other state-of-the-art image compression methods, such as those based on deep learning. I would also like to see more analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed method, including the encoding and decoding times, to assess its practicality for real-world applications.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper include: How do the learned transforms differ from traditional linear transforms, such as the discrete cosine transform or wavelet transforms? Can the proposed method be extended to other types of data, such as video or audio? How does the choice of nonlinear activation function affect the performance of the proposed method? What are the potential applications of the proposed method, beyond image compression?
