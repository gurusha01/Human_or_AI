Summary
The paper proposes a novel approach to question classification by utilizing answer data to improve question representation. The authors introduce Group Sparse Autoencoders (GSA) and Group Sparse Convolutional Neural Networks (GSCNNs) to encode answer information into question representation. The GSA is a neural network-based model that learns a dictionary with group sparse constraints, while the GSCNNs incorporate GSA into traditional convolutional neural networks to learn question representations with respect to their corresponding answers. The proposed model shows significant improvements over strong baselines on four datasets.

The experimental results are convincing, and the authors have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed model on multiple datasets.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the hyperparameter tuning process for the GSA and GSCNNs models. Additionally, it would be helpful to include more visualizations of the learned dictionaries and activations to provide a better understanding of the models' behavior. Furthermore, the authors may want to consider exploring other applications of the proposed approach, such as question answering or text classification.
Questions for the Authors
I would like to ask the authors to clarify the following points:
* How did the authors select the hyperparameters for the GSA and GSCNNs models, and what was the impact of different hyperparameter settings on the performance?
* Can the authors provide more insights into the learned dictionaries and activations, and how they relate to the question classification task?
* How do the authors plan to extend the proposed approach to other natural language processing tasks, and what are the potential challenges and limitations?
