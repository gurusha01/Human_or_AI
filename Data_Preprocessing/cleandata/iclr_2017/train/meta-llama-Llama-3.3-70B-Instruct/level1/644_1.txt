Summary
The paper proposes Diverse Beam Search (DBS), a novel approach to decode diverse sequences from neural sequence models. DBS modifies the traditional beam search algorithm by introducing a diversity-augmented objective, which encourages the generation of diverse sequences. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of DBS on various tasks, including image captioning, machine translation, conversation, and visual question generation, and show that it outperforms traditional beam search and other baselines.
Decision
I decide to Accept this paper, with two key reasons for this choice: (1) the paper tackles a specific and important problem in neural sequence modeling, namely the lack of diversity in beam search outputs, and (2) the proposed approach, DBS, is well-motivated and supported by thorough experiments and analysis.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a clear and concise overview of the problem and the proposed solution. The authors motivate the need for diverse beam search and provide a thorough analysis of the limitations of traditional beam search. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of DBS on various tasks and datasets, and the authors provide a detailed analysis of the results, including sensitivity studies and human evaluations.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors consider the following points: (1) provide more insights into the choice of diversity function and its impact on the results, (2) explore the application of DBS to other tasks and domains, and (3) investigate the potential of combining DBS with other techniques, such as reinforcement learning or adversarial training, to further improve the diversity and quality of the generated sequences.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions: (1) How do the authors plan to extend DBS to other sequence modeling tasks, such as speech recognition or text summarization? (2) Can the authors provide more details on the computational cost of DBS compared to traditional beam search? (3) How do the authors plan to address the potential issue of over-diversification, where the generated sequences may become too diverse and lose coherence or fluency?
