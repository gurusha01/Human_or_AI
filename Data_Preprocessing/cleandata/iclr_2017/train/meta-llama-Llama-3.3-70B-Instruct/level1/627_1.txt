The paper proposes a novel neural machine translation model that incorporates a latent variable to capture the underlying semantic meaning of both text and images. This approach aims to improve the accuracy of machine translation by leveraging the complementary information provided by images. The model is an extension of the Variational Neural Machine Translation (VNMT) model, which introduces a latent variable to capture the semantic meaning of text. The proposed model uses a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to learn a continuous latent variable that represents the shared semantic meaning of text and images.
I decide to accept this paper with the following key reasons:
1. The paper tackles a specific and well-motivated problem in neural machine translation, which is to capture the entire meaning of a sentence using both text and image information.
2. The approach is well-placed in the literature, building upon existing work on VNMT and multimodal translation, and provides a novel extension by incorporating image information into the latent variable.
The paper provides supporting arguments for the claims, including experimental results on the Multi30k dataset, which show that the proposed model outperforms the baseline VNMT model in terms of METEOR and BLEU scores. The results also demonstrate that the model can generate more accurate translations for short sentences.
To improve the paper, I suggest the following additional feedback:
* Provide more detailed analysis of the results, including a breakdown of the performance on different sentence lengths and types of sentences.
* Consider adding more ablation studies to investigate the contribution of each component of the model, such as the VAE and the image encoding methods.
* Provide more examples of translations generated by the model, including both successful and failed cases, to illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of the approach.
I would like the authors to answer the following questions to clarify my understanding of the paper:
* Can you provide more details on how the image features are extracted and encoded, and how they are integrated into the latent variable?
* How do you handle cases where the image information is not relevant or is noisy, and how does this affect the performance of the model?
* Can you provide more insights into the qualitative analysis of the results, including the types of errors made by the model and how they relate to the use of image information?
