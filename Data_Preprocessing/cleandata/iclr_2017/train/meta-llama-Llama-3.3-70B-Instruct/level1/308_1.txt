Summary
This paper provides a theoretical analysis of the training dynamics of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The authors aim to understand the instability and mode dropping issues that arise during GAN training. They introduce a new direction for analyzing these issues and provide tools to study them properly. The paper is divided into three sections: introduction, sources of instability, and towards softer metrics and distributions. The authors prove several theorems that show the existence of perfect discriminators and the consequences of using different cost functions. They also propose a new metric, the Wasserstein distance, to evaluate the similarity between the generator and data distributions.
Decision
I decide to Accept this paper. The paper provides a thorough and well-motivated analysis of the training dynamics of GANs. The authors address a significant problem in the field and provide new insights and tools to understand the instability and mode dropping issues.
Supporting Arguments
The paper is well-structured and easy to follow. The authors provide a clear introduction to the problem and motivate their approach. The theoretical analysis is rigorous, and the proofs are well-explained. The paper also provides a clear conclusion and future directions for research. The use of the Wasserstein distance as a metric to evaluate the similarity between the generator and data distributions is a significant contribution.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more experimental results to validate their theoretical analysis. Additionally, they could discuss the implications of their results for other deep learning models and provide more insights into the properties of the Wasserstein distance. It would also be helpful to provide a clearer explanation of the differences between the original GAN cost function and the proposed alternative.
Questions for the Authors
1. Can you provide more experimental results to validate your theoretical analysis?
2. How do your results relate to other deep learning models, such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)?
3. Can you provide more insights into the properties of the Wasserstein distance and its advantages over other metrics?
4. How do you plan to extend your work to other types of GANs, such as conditional GANs or GANs with multiple generators and discriminators?
