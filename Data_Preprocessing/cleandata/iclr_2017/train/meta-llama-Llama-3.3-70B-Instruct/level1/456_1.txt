Summary
The paper proposes a new regularization method, Central Moment Discrepancy (CMD), for domain-invariant representation learning in neural networks. CMD minimizes the domain-specific latent feature representations directly in the hidden activation space by matching the higher-order central moments of the probability distributions. The authors prove that CMD is a metric on the set of probability distributions on a compact interval and that convergence in CMD implies convergence in distribution. The method is evaluated on two benchmark datasets, Office and Amazon reviews, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on most domain adaptation tasks.
