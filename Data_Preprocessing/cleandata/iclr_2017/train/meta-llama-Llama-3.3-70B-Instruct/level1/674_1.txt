This paper claims to contribute to the understanding of the approximate invertibility phenomenon of Convolutional Neural Nets (CNNs) by providing a theoretical explanation and developing a mathematical model of sparse signal recovery that is consistent with CNNs with random weights. The authors introduce three new concepts that guide their understanding of CNNs, including a model of sparse linear combinations of learned filters, the model-Restricted Isometry Property (model-RIP) for effective matrices, and the explanation of each layer of the feedforward CNN algorithm as one iteration of Iterative Hard Thresholding (IHT) for model-based compressive sensing.
I decide to accept this paper with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the paper tackles a specific and interesting question of understanding the invertibility of CNNs, which is a crucial aspect of deep learning. Secondly, the approach is well-motivated and well-placed in the literature, providing a clear connection to model-based compressive sensing and its recovery algorithms.
The paper supports its claims through a combination of theoretical analysis and empirical results. The authors provide a theoretical connection between the model-RIP property and the reconstruction error, and they demonstrate empirically that several learned networks are consistent with their mathematical analysis. They also show that with a simple theoretical framework, they can obtain reasonable reconstruction results on real images.
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the experimental setup and the evaluation metrics used to measure the reconstruction error. Additionally, they could discuss the limitations of their model and the potential extensions to more complex CNN architectures. Some questions that I would like the authors to answer include: How do the authors plan to extend their model to more complex CNN architectures, such as ResNets or DenseNets? How do the authors evaluate the quality of the reconstructed images, and what are the potential applications of their method? What are the implications of their results for the understanding of the invertibility of CNNs, and how do they relate to other works in the field? 
Overall, the paper provides a significant contribution to the understanding of CNNs and their invertibility, and with some revisions to address the above questions and suggestions, it has the potential to be a strong and impactful paper.
