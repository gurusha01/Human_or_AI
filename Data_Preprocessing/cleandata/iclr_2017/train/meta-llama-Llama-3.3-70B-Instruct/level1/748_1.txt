Summary
The paper presents a novel approach to neural machine translation using a convolutional encoder, which is faster and simpler than traditional recurrent neural network (RNN) based encoders. The authors demonstrate that their convolutional encoder can achieve competitive accuracy to state-of-the-art RNN-based systems on several machine translation tasks, including WMT'16 English-Romanian, WMT'15 English-German, and WMT'14 English-French. The convolutional encoder also leads to significant improvements in generation speed, with a 2.1x speedup compared to a strong bi-directional LSTM baseline on the WMT'15 English-German task.
Decision
I decide to Accept this paper, with two key reasons: (1) the paper tackles a specific and important problem in neural machine translation, and (2) the approach is well-motivated and supported by experimental results.
Supporting Arguments
The paper clearly addresses the problem of improving the efficiency and accuracy of neural machine translation systems. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the limitations of traditional RNN-based encoders and propose a convolutional encoder as a solution. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the convolutional encoder on several benchmark tasks, including comparisons to strong baselines and state-of-the-art systems. The paper also provides a detailed analysis of the convolutional encoder architecture, including the importance of position embeddings, residual connections, and separate CNNs for attention score computation and conditional input aggregation.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more insights into the interpretability of the convolutional encoder, such as visualizations of the attention scores and analysis of the learned representations. Additionally, it would be interesting to see experiments on other sequence-to-sequence tasks, such as summarization and dialog modeling, to demonstrate the generalizability of the convolutional encoder approach.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
1. Can you provide more details on the implementation of the convolutional encoder, including the specific architecture and hyperparameters used?
2. How do you plan to address the issue of slower convergence of the convolutional encoder compared to RNN-based systems?
3. Can you provide more insights into the trade-offs between the number of layers in the convolutional encoder and the accuracy of the system?
