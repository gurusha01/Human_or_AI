Summary
The paper proposes a modification to the texture synthesis approach introduced by Gatys et al. (2015a) to incorporate long-range structure into image generation. The authors introduce a new representation, called "transformed Gramians," which captures spatial co-occurrences of local features. This allows the model to generate textures with various global symmetry properties and apply texture generation to inpainting.
Decision
I decide to Accept this paper with two key reasons: (1) the approach is well-motivated and builds upon existing work in texture synthesis, and (2) the results demonstrate significant improvements in generating textures with long-range correlations and symmetry constraints.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a clear and concise introduction to the problem of texture synthesis and the limitations of existing approaches. The authors motivate their approach by highlighting the importance of capturing long-range structure in images. The technical sections are well-organized, and the experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in various applications, including texture generation, inpainting, and season transfer.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest the authors provide more details on the computational cost of their approach and explore ways to reduce the generation time. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more examples of applying the approach to other types of transformations, such as rotations or scaling.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
1. Can you provide more insights into the choice of Î´ values for each layer and how they affect the results?
2. How do you plan to address the computational cost of your approach, and are there any potential optimizations that can be made?
3. Have you explored applying your approach to other domains, such as video or 3D texture synthesis, and what are the potential challenges and opportunities in these areas?
