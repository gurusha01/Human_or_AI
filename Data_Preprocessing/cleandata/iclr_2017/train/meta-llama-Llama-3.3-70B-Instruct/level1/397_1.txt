Summary
The paper proposes a novel approach to representation learning by combining Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) with neural autoregressive models, such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Masked Autoencoder for Density Estimation (MADE), and PixelRNN/CNN. The authors introduce a Variational Lossy Autoencoder (VLAE) model that allows for explicit control over the type of information encoded in the latent representation. The model is evaluated on various image datasets, including MNIST, OMNIGLOT, Caltech-101 Silhouettes, and CIFAR10, and achieves state-of-the-art results in density estimation.
Decision
I decide to Accept this paper, with the main reasons being:
1. The paper tackles a specific and well-motivated problem in representation learning, which is to learn global representations of data that discard irrelevant information.
2. The approach is well-placed in the literature, building upon existing work on VAEs and autoregressive models, and provides a novel and principled solution to the problem.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a clear and well-structured introduction to the problem of representation learning and the limitations of existing approaches. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the information preference property of VAEs and how it can be exploited to design a lossy compressor. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed VLAE model in learning lossy codes that encode global statistics and achieve state-of-the-art results in density estimation.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors:
* Provide more visualizations and examples to illustrate the properties of the learned representations and the effect of different receptive field sizes on the lossy codes.
* Discuss the potential applications of the proposed approach in other domains, such as audio and video processing.
* Consider providing more details on the implementation and training of the VLAE model, including the choice of hyperparameters and the optimization procedure.
Questions for the Authors
I would like the authors to clarify the following points:
* How do the authors choose the receptive field size and the type of autoregressive model used in the decoder?
* Can the authors provide more insights into the trade-off between the expressiveness of the autoregressive model and the complexity of the latent representation?
* How do the authors plan to extend the proposed approach to other forms of data, such as audio and video?
