Summary of the Paper's Claims and Contributions
The paper claims to provide a theoretical understanding of why deep neural networks are preferred over shallow networks for function approximation. The authors show that for a large class of piecewise smooth functions, the number of neurons required by a shallow network to achieve a certain level of approximation error is exponentially larger than the number of neurons required by a deep network. The paper provides upper and lower bounds on the number of neurons required for function approximation using deep and shallow networks, respectively. The authors also demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach by applying it to various classes of functions, including univariate and multivariate polynomials, and compositions of functions.
Decision and Key Reasons
Based on the review of the paper, I decide to Accept the paper. The key reasons for this decision are:
1. The paper tackles a specific and well-motivated question in the field of neural networks, namely, the comparison of deep and shallow networks for function approximation.
2. The approach is well-placed in the literature, building on existing results and providing new insights into the advantages of deep networks.
3. The paper provides rigorous theoretical analysis, including upper and lower bounds on the number of neurons required for function approximation, which supports the claims made by the authors.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a clear and well-structured presentation of the theoretical results, including theorems, lemmas, and corollaries. The authors use a combination of mathematical techniques, such as Lagrangian interpolation and strong convexity, to derive the bounds on the number of neurons required for function approximation. The paper also includes a detailed analysis of the trade-offs between the depth and width of neural networks, which provides valuable insights into the design of efficient neural network architectures.
Additional Feedback and Questions
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more intuitive explanations of the theoretical results, particularly for readers who may not be familiar with the mathematical techniques used in the paper. Additionally, it would be helpful to include more numerical examples or simulations to illustrate the practical implications of the theoretical results.
Some questions that I would like the authors to address in their response are:
1. How do the results in the paper relate to existing work on the expressiveness of deep neural networks, such as the universal approximation theorem?
2. Can the authors provide more insights into the role of strong convexity in the analysis of function approximation using neural networks?
3. How do the results in the paper generalize to other types of neural network architectures, such as convolutional neural networks or recurrent neural networks?
