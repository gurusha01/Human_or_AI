Summary
The paper presents a novel approach to discovering word-like acoustic units in continuous speech signals and grounding them to semantically relevant image regions. The authors propose a multimodal neural network that learns to associate images with spoken audio captions, enabling the discovery of acoustic patterns and their corresponding visual patterns. The approach is language-agnostic, does not require text transcriptions, and operates in O(n) time, making it a significant improvement over previous state-of-the-art methods.
Decision
I decide to Accept this paper, with the primary reason being the innovative and well-motivated approach to spoken language acquisition and multimodal learning. The authors demonstrate a thorough understanding of the problem and the literature, and their methodology is sound and well-executed.
Supporting Arguments
The paper tackles a specific and important problem in computational linguistics and speech processing, and the authors' approach is well-placed in the literature. The use of a multimodal neural network to learn a shared embedding space for images and spoken audio captions is a key innovation, and the authors demonstrate its effectiveness in discovering acoustic patterns and grounding them to visual patterns. The experimental results are impressive, with the model achieving high recall scores on image search and annotation tasks, and the discovered acoustic patterns showing high purity and coverage.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the computational resources required to train the multimodal neural network, as well as the time complexity of the grounding and clustering algorithms. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more visualizations of the discovered image pattern clusters, and to explore the potential applications of this research in areas such as speech-to-speech translation and image synthesis.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
1. Can you provide more details on the voice activity detector (VAD) used to filter out silent segments from the proposed acoustic segments?
2. How do you plan to extend this research to learn acoustic correspondences for object categories in multiple languages, and what are the potential challenges and limitations of this approach?
3. Can you discuss the potential applications of this research in areas such as speech-to-speech translation, image synthesis, and multimodal dialogue systems?
