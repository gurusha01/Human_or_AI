The paper "The Effect of Mini-Batch Size and Number of Learners on the Convergence of Stochastic Gradient Descent" presents a thorough analysis of the impact of mini-batch size on the convergence of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and its asynchronous variant, Asynchronous Stochastic Gradient Descent (ASGD). The authors provide a detailed mathematical framework to justify the practical observations that smaller mini-batches and fewer learners can lead to faster convergence.
The paper claims to contribute to the understanding of the convergence properties of SGD and ASGD, particularly in the context of large-scale machine learning. The authors analyze the effect of mini-batch size on SGD convergence for general non-convex objective functions and extend their analysis to ASGD. They provide theoretical guarantees and experimental evidence to support their claims.
