Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper proposes a novel architecture for neural machine translation, which learns morphology by using two recurrent networks and a hierarchical decoder that translates at the character level. This approach addresses the issue of large vocabulary in word-level neural machine translation models and achieves a higher BLEU score than the subword-level model after training for one epoch on English-French and English-Czech translation tasks.
Decision and Key Reasons
I decide to accept this paper with minor revisions. The two key reasons for this choice are: (1) the paper tackles a specific and important problem in neural machine translation, namely the issue of large vocabulary, and proposes a novel and well-motivated approach to address it; and (2) the paper provides empirical evidence to support its claims, including experiments on multiple language pairs and comparisons with state-of-the-art models.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a clear and well-structured presentation of the proposed approach, including a detailed description of the model architecture and training procedure. The experiments are well-designed and provide convincing evidence of the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The paper also provides additional analyses and visualizations to support its claims, such as the ability of the model to learn morphology and translate misspelled or nonce words.
Additional Feedback and Questions
To further improve the paper, I suggest the authors provide more details on the computational resources required to train the model and the potential applications of the proposed approach beyond machine translation. I also have some questions regarding the implementation of the model, such as how the authors handle out-of-vocabulary words and how they tune the hyperparameters of the model. Specifically, I would like to know more about the construction of the matrix R used to unfold the outputs of the first-level decoder and how it is implemented in practice. Additionally, I would like to see more sample translations to further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
