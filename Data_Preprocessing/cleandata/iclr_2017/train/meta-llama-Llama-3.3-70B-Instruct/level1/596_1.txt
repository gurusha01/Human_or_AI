Summary
The paper proposes Implicit ReasoNets (IRNs), a novel neural network architecture designed to perform large-scale inference implicitly through a search controller and shared memory. IRNs are applied to the task of knowledge base completion, where they outperform previous approaches by more than 5.7% on the popular FB15k benchmark. The authors also demonstrate the effectiveness of IRNs on a shortest path synthesis task, showcasing their ability to perform multi-step inference.
Decision
I decide to Accept this paper, with the primary reason being the significant improvement in performance on the FB15k benchmark and the innovative approach to modeling large-scale structured relationships implicitly.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a clear and well-motivated approach to addressing the challenges of knowledge base completion. The use of a search controller and shared memory allows IRNs to perform inference efficiently, without the need for explicit path information. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of IRNs, with significant improvements in performance on both the FB15k and WN18 datasets. Additionally, the analysis of the shortest path synthesis task provides further insight into the inference capabilities of IRNs.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest the authors provide more details on the training process, including the optimization algorithm used and the hyperparameter tuning process. Additionally, it would be beneficial to include more visualizations or examples to illustrate the inference process of IRNs, particularly for the shortest path synthesis task. Finally, the authors may want to consider discussing potential applications of IRNs beyond knowledge base completion, such as natural language processing or computer vision.
Questions for the Authors
1. Can you provide more details on the initialization process of the shared memory and how it affects the performance of IRNs?
2. How do you plan to extend IRNs to other tasks, such as natural language processing or computer vision, and what challenges do you anticipate?
3. Can you provide more insight into the inference process of IRNs, particularly for the shortest path synthesis task, and how the search controller and shared memory interact to produce the final output?
