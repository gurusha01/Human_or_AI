The paper under review provides a comprehensive framework for understanding generative adversarial networks (GANs) and their connection to implicit generative models, likelihood-free inference, and density ratio estimation. The authors develop a rich view of GANs by relating them to various statistical concepts, including hypothesis testing, divergence minimization, ratio matching, and moment matching.
I decide to accept this paper with two key reasons: (1) the paper tackles a specific and important problem in the field of machine learning, namely, the understanding and development of GANs and implicit generative models; and (2) the approach is well-motivated and well-placed in the literature, providing a clear and comprehensive framework for understanding the connections between various concepts.
The paper supports its claims through a thorough analysis of the relationships between GANs, implicit generative models, and likelihood-free inference. The authors provide a detailed derivation of the objective function used in GANs and demonstrate its connection to various statistical concepts, including hypothesis testing and density ratio estimation. The paper also discusses the limitations and challenges of the proposed approach, including the choice of loss function, model misspecification, and non-differentiable models.
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more concrete examples and applications of the proposed framework, particularly in areas such as climate and weather, economics, population genetics, and epidemiology. Additionally, the authors could further discuss the implications of their work for Bayesian inference and evaluation metrics for generative models.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper include: (1) How do the authors plan to address the challenge of choosing a loss function for implicit generative models? (2) Can the authors provide more insights into the connections between GANs and approximate Bayesian computation (ABC)? (3) How do the authors envision the application of their framework to non-differentiable models, and what are the potential challenges and limitations of such an approach?
