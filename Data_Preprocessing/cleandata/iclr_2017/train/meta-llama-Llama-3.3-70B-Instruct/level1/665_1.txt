Summary
The paper presents the design and development of a new large-scale dataset, MS MARCO, for machine reading comprehension (RC) and open-domain question answering (QA). The dataset addresses the weaknesses of previous publicly available datasets, including the use of real anonymized user queries, human-generated answers, and context passages extracted from real web documents. The authors aim to release one million queries and corresponding answers, making it the most comprehensive real-world dataset of its kind.
Decision
I decide to Accept this paper, with the primary reason being the significant contribution of the MS MARCO dataset to the field of RC and QA. The dataset's unique features, such as real user queries and human-generated answers, make it an invaluable resource for researchers.
Supporting Arguments
The paper is well-motivated, and the authors provide a clear overview of the limitations of existing datasets. The MS MARCO dataset is well-placed in the literature, and its features, such as the use of real user queries and human-generated answers, make it a significant improvement over previous datasets. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the dataset in evaluating the performance of RC and QA models.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the data collection process, including the filtering criteria for user queries and the guidelines for human judges. Additionally, the authors could discuss potential applications of the MS MARCO dataset beyond RC and QA, such as in natural language processing and information retrieval.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
1. How did the authors ensure the quality and accuracy of the human-generated answers?
2. Can the authors provide more information on the distribution of query types and answer types in the MS MARCO dataset?
3. How do the authors plan to address the issue of multiple valid answers for a single question, as mentioned in the future work section?
