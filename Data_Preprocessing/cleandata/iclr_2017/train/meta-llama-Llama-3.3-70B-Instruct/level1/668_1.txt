Summary
The paper explores the use of output regularizers, specifically the confidence penalty and label smoothing, to improve the performance of large neural networks in supervised learning. The authors demonstrate that these regularizers, which have been shown to improve exploration in reinforcement learning, can also act as strong regularizers in supervised learning, improving state-of-the-art models across six common benchmarks without modifying existing hyperparameters.
Decision
I decide to Accept this paper, with two key reasons for this choice: (1) the paper tackles a specific and well-motivated question, namely, the use of output regularizers in supervised learning, and (2) the approach is well-supported by empirical results, with thorough evaluations on multiple benchmarks.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a clear and well-motivated introduction to the problem of overfitting in large neural networks and the potential benefits of output regularizers. The authors also provide a thorough review of related work, connecting their approach to existing techniques in reinforcement learning and supervised learning. The empirical results are impressive, with significant improvements in performance across multiple benchmarks, including image classification, language modeling, machine translation, and speech recognition.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more analysis on the relationship between the confidence penalty and label smoothing, and how they interact with other regularization techniques, such as dropout. Additionally, it would be helpful to include more discussion on the potential limitations and drawbacks of using output regularizers, and how they might be addressed in future work.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
* Can you provide more intuition on why the confidence penalty and label smoothing are effective in preventing overfitting, and how they relate to other regularization techniques?
* How do you think the results would change if the confidence penalty and label smoothing were combined with other regularization techniques, such as dropout or weight decay?
* Are there any potential limitations or drawbacks to using output regularizers, and how might they be addressed in future work?
