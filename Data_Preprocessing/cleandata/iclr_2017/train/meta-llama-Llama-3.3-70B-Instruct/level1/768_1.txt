Summary of the Paper
The paper proposes a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) model, called Group Orthogonal Convolutional Neural Network (GoCNN), which incorporates auxiliary annotations as privileged information to learn richer and more diverse feature representations. The GoCNN model is designed to maximize the inherent diversity of a CNN model by learning features from foreground and background in an orthogonal way, using privileged information for optimization. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of GoCNN on two benchmark datasets, ImageNet and PASCAL VOC, and show that it outperforms vanilla CNN models in terms of classification accuracy.
Decision
I decide to Accept this paper, with two key reasons: (1) the approach is well-motivated and well-placed in the literature, and (2) the paper provides strong empirical evidence to support its claims.
Supporting Arguments
The paper tackles a specific question of learning rich and diverse feature representations in CNNs, which is a well-known problem in the field. The authors provide a clear motivation for their approach, which is to utilize auxiliary annotations as privileged information to improve the learning of feature representations. The paper is well-placed in the literature, as it builds upon existing works on learning diverse feature representations and utilizing privileged information. The authors also provide a thorough analysis of the related work and demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more insights into the learned feature representations and how they differ from those learned by vanilla CNN models. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more analysis on the impact of the size of the privileged information on the performance of GoCNN. Furthermore, the authors may want to consider exploring other types of privileged information and their impact on the learning of feature representations.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like to ask the authors the following questions:
* Can you provide more details on how the foreground and background groups are constructed in the GoCNN model?
* How do you ensure that the learned feature representations are diverse and not redundant?
* Can you provide more insights into the computational cost of training GoCNN compared to vanilla CNN models?
* Have you explored other applications of GoCNN beyond image classification, such as object detection or segmentation?
