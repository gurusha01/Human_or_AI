Summary of the Paper's Claims and Contributions
The paper investigates the capacity and trainability of various Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architectures, including vanilla RNNs, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), and two novel architectures: the Update Gate RNN (UGRNN) and the Intersection RNN (+RNN). The authors claim that, with careful training, all common RNN architectures achieve nearly the same per-task and per-unit capacity bounds, and that the observed superiority of gated models over vanilla RNNs is primarily due to differences in trainability rather than capacity.
Decision and Key Reasons
Based on the review, I decide to Accept the paper. The two key reasons for this choice are:
1. The paper provides a thorough and well-motivated investigation of the capacity and trainability of various RNN architectures, which is a crucial aspect of understanding the strengths and limitations of these models.
2. The authors provide extensive experimental evidence to support their claims, including a range of tasks and architectures, which demonstrates the robustness of their findings.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's contributions are significant because they challenge the common assumption that gated RNNs are more powerful than vanilla RNNs due to their architectural design. Instead, the authors show that the difference in performance between these models can be largely attributed to differences in trainability. This has important implications for the design and training of RNNs, as it suggests that simpler architectures may be sufficient for many tasks, and that efforts should focus on improving training procedures rather than architectural complexity.
The paper's experimental methodology is sound, with a thorough hyperparameter tuning procedure and a range of tasks and architectures evaluated. The results are also well-presented and easy to follow, with clear figures and tables that support the authors' claims.
Additional Feedback and Questions
To further improve the paper, I would suggest the following:
* Provide more detailed analysis of the novel UGRNN and +RNN architectures, including their motivations and design choices.
* Consider adding more tasks or datasets to the experimental evaluation to further demonstrate the robustness of the findings.
* Provide more discussion on the implications of the results for the design and training of RNNs in practice.
Some questions I would like the authors to address in their response are:
* How do the authors plan to extend their work to more complex tasks or datasets, such as those with longer-term dependencies or more nuanced linguistic structures?
* Can the authors provide more insight into the design choices behind the UGRNN and +RNN architectures, and how they relate to existing RNN architectures?
* How do the authors think their findings will impact the development of new RNN architectures or training procedures, and what future directions do they see for this research?
