Summary
The paper proposes a novel approach to character-level language modeling using a statistical model parameterized by a program from a domain-specific language (DSL). The model is learned in two phases: synthesizing a program from the DSL and learning parameters from the training data. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on two datasets, Linux Kernel and Hutter Prize Wikipedia, and show that their model outperforms n-gram models and recurrent neural networks in terms of precision and error rate.
Decision
I decide to Accept this paper with two key reasons: (1) the approach is well-motivated and placed in the literature, and (2) the paper supports its claims with thorough experiments and results.
Supporting Arguments
The paper tackles a specific question of character-level language modeling and proposes a novel solution using a DSL. The approach is well-motivated, as it addresses the limitations of traditional n-gram models and neural networks. The authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of their model, including the syntax and semantics of the DSL, and demonstrate its effectiveness on two diverse datasets. The results show that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of precision and error rate, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of the results.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the synthesis algorithm used to learn the program from the DSL. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more examples of the synthesized programs and how they can be interpreted and debugged. The authors may also consider providing more comparisons with other state-of-the-art models, such as transformer-based models, to further demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like to ask the authors the following questions:
* Can you provide more details on the synthesis algorithm used to learn the program from the DSL, and how it handles the trade-off between expressiveness and efficiency?
* How do you plan to extend the DSL to handle more complex tasks, such as modeling multiple languages or domains?
* Can you provide more examples of the synthesized programs and how they can be interpreted and debugged, to demonstrate the advantages of using a DSL-based approach?
