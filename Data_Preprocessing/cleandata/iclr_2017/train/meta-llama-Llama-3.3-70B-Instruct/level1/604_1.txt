Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper proposes a novel approach to argumentation mining, specifically focusing on extracting links between argument components (ACs) and classifying AC types. The authors introduce a modified Pointer Network (PN) architecture, which is well-suited for this task due to its ability to model sequential relationships and enforce tree-like structures. The joint model simultaneously predicts AC links and types, achieving state-of-the-art results on two evaluation corpora.
Decision and Key Reasons
I decide to Accept this paper, with two key reasons:
1. Well-motivated approach: The authors provide a clear and well-motivated introduction to the problem of argumentation mining, highlighting the importance of extracting links between ACs and classifying their types. The proposed PN architecture is well-justified, and its modification to accommodate joint prediction tasks is innovative.
2. Strong empirical results: The paper presents thorough experimental evaluations on two corpora, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed model in achieving state-of-the-art results. The ablation study and analysis of results provide valuable insights into the importance of different features and model components.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a comprehensive overview of related work in argumentation mining, highlighting the limitations of existing approaches and the benefits of the proposed PN architecture. The authors also provide a detailed description of the model, including its components and training objectives, making it easy to follow and understand. The experimental design is thorough, with a clear description of the datasets, evaluation metrics, and hyperparameter settings.
Additional Feedback and Questions
To further improve the paper, I suggest the authors consider the following:
* Provide more detailed analysis of the results, including error analysis and discussion of potential limitations.
* Consider adding more visualizations, such as plots or diagrams, to help illustrate the model's performance and the structure of the argumentation graphs.
* How do the authors plan to address the issue of sequence length, which appears to affect the model's performance on link prediction?
* Can the authors provide more insights into the effectiveness of different pooling strategies for using individual token embeddings to create multi-word embeddings?
* How do the authors envision integrating subtasks 1 and 4 into the model, as mentioned in the conclusion?
