Summary
The paper proposes a novel approach to quantify human intention using competitive learning, applied to human behavior prediction as supervised learning. The authors aim to extract a driver's potential intentions for autonomous vehicle control, considering various potential situations. They design a neural network architecture based on a driving behavior model and apply competitive learning to time series supervised learning, specifically regression tasks. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms a conventional method, reducing the squared error to 1/25, and demonstrates the ability to distinguish valid data from disturbance data.
Decision
I decide to Accept this paper, with two key reasons: (1) the approach is well-motivated and placed in the literature, addressing a significant problem in autonomous driving, and (2) the paper supports its claims with empirical results, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a clear and concise introduction to the problem, motivating the need for a new approach. The authors thoroughly review related works and position their contribution within the existing literature. The proposed method is well-explained, and the experimental results are convincing, showing a significant improvement over a conventional method. Additionally, the paper demonstrates the ability of competitive learning to distinguish valid data from disturbance data, which is a valuable contribution to the field.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest the authors provide more details on the pre-training technique used for competitive learning and its impact on the results. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more analysis on the extracted potential intentions and their relation to the driver's behavior. Furthermore, the authors could discuss potential applications of their approach beyond autonomous driving, such as human-robot interaction or decision-making systems.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
1. Can you provide more insight into the choice of three competitive layers and the impact of this choice on the results?
2. How do you plan to extend this work to more complex driving scenarios, such as urban driving or multi-agent interactions?
3. Can you discuss the potential limitations of the proposed approach and how you plan to address them in future work?
