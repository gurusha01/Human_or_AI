Summary
The paper presents a supervised sequence-to-sequence transduction model with a hard attention mechanism, which combines traditional statistical alignment methods with the power of recurrent neural networks. The model is evaluated on the task of morphological inflection generation and achieves state-of-the-art results in various setups compared to previous neural and non-neural approaches. The authors also provide an analysis of the learned representations for both hard and soft attention models, shedding light on the features that these models extract to solve the task.
Decision
I decide to Accept this paper with the following key reasons:
1. The paper tackles a specific and well-defined problem in natural language processing, namely morphological inflection generation, and provides a novel solution that outperforms previous state-of-the-art models.
2. The approach is well-motivated and grounded in the literature, with a clear explanation of the limitations of previous models and the advantages of the proposed hard attention mechanism.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a thorough analysis of the learned representations and alignments, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the hard attention mechanism in capturing monotonic alignments between input and output sequences. The experimental results on three datasets (CELEX, Wiktionary, and SIGMORPHON) show that the proposed model outperforms or matches the performance of previous state-of-the-art models, including soft attention models and neural transduction models. The authors also provide a detailed comparison of the learned alignments and representations between the hard and soft attention models, which provides insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the training procedure, including the hyperparameter settings and the optimization algorithm used. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more analysis on the robustness of the model to different types of noise or errors in the input data. Finally, the authors may want to consider applying the proposed model to other tasks that require a monotonic align-and-transduce approach, such as abstractive summarization or transliteration, to demonstrate its generalizability.
Questions for the Authors
1. Can you provide more details on the character-level alignment process used to generate the training data for the hard attention model?
2. How do you handle cases where the input and output sequences have different lengths or structures, and how does the hard attention mechanism adapt to these cases?
3. Have you considered using other types of attention mechanisms, such as hierarchical or graph-based attention, and how do they compare to the proposed hard attention mechanism in terms of performance and interpretability?
