Summary
The paper proposes a novel non-linear dimensionality regularization technique for solving ill-posed inverse problems. The approach reformulates Kernel PCA as an energy minimization problem with low dimensionality constraints introduced as regularization terms. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method on two applications: matrix completion and non-rigid structure from motion. The results show that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art linear dimensionality regularizers and robust KPCA variants.
