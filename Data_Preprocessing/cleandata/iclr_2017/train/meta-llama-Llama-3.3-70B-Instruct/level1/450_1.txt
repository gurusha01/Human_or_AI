Summary
The paper proposes a novel approach to two-sample testing, called Classifier Two-Sample Tests (C2ST), which uses binary classifiers to distinguish between two samples. The authors analyze the theoretical properties of C2ST, including its asymptotic distribution, testing power, and interpretability. They also evaluate the performance of C2ST on various synthetic and real datasets, comparing it to state-of-the-art alternatives. Additionally, the paper explores the application of C2ST to evaluate the sample quality of generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and proposes a novel approach to causal discovery using Conditional GANs.
Decision
I decide to accept this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the paper tackles a specific and well-motivated problem in statistics, namely two-sample testing, and proposes a novel and well-supported approach to address it. Secondly, the paper provides a thorough analysis of the theoretical properties of C2ST and evaluates its performance on various datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness and potential applications.
Supporting Arguments
The paper is well-motivated, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem of two-sample testing and its importance in statistics. The proposed approach, C2ST, is novel and well-supported by theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of C2ST on various datasets, including synthetic and real data, and compare its performance to state-of-the-art alternatives. The paper also explores the application of C2ST to evaluate the sample quality of GANs and proposes a novel approach to causal discovery using Conditional GANs, which is a significant contribution to the field.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more detailed explanations of the theoretical analysis, particularly in Section 3. Additionally, it would be helpful to include more visualizations and plots to illustrate the results and make the paper more engaging. Furthermore, the authors may consider providing more discussions on the limitations and potential extensions of C2ST, as well as its relationships to other statistical tests and machine learning methods.
Questions for the Authors
I would like to ask the authors to clarify the following points:
1. How do the authors choose the hyperparameters for the binary classifier used in C2ST, and how do these hyperparameters affect the performance of the test?
2. Can the authors provide more details on the implementation of C2ST, particularly in terms of the computational complexity and scalability of the approach?
3. How do the authors plan to extend C2ST to handle more complex data types, such as time-series or sequential data?
