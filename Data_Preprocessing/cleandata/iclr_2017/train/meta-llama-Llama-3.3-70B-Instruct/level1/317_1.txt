The paper "Amortised MAP Inference for Image Super-Resolution" proposes a novel approach to image super-resolution (SR) using amortised Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) inference. The authors introduce a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that projects the model output to the affine subspace of valid SR solutions, ensuring that the high-resolution output is always consistent with the low-resolution input.
The paper claims to contribute to the field of image SR by providing a more desirable approach than empirical risk minimisation, which often results in blurry and over-smoothed outputs. The authors argue that their approach, which prefers solutions with high posterior probability, leads to more plausible and visually appealing results.
I decide to accept this paper, with the main reason being that the approach is well-motivated and supported by theoretical arguments. The paper provides a clear and concise explanation of the problem, and the proposed solution is well-placed in the literature. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through experiments on various datasets, including natural images and faces.
The results show that the proposed method, AffGAN, outperforms other approaches, including MSE and MAE-based methods, in terms of visual quality and cross-entropy values. The authors also provide a thorough analysis of the limitations of their approach and discuss potential future directions.
To support my decision, I provide the following arguments:
* The paper tackles a specific and well-defined problem in image SR, which is an important and active area of research.
* The approach is well-motivated, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the theoretical foundations of their method.
* The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of the results.
To improve the paper, I suggest the following:
* The authors could provide more details on the implementation of the AffGAN algorithm, including the architecture of the generator and discriminator networks.
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed approach, including the time and memory requirements.
* The authors could also provide more examples of the results obtained using their approach, including visual comparisons with other methods.
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
* Can you provide more details on the choice of the affine projection layer and how it is implemented in practice?
* How do you handle the case where the downsampling kernel A has an infinitely large kernel, and how do you approximate it in practice?
* Can you provide more insights into the connection between AffGAN and amortised variational inference, and how this connection can be used to improve the performance of the proposed approach?
