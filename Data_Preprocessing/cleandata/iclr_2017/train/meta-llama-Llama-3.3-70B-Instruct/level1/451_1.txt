Summary
This paper presents a comprehensive study on the loss surface of deep neural networks, focusing on the conditions that prevent the existence of bad local minima. The authors provide theoretical results on the topological connectedness of multilayer networks and introduce a dynamic programming algorithm to estimate the geometric regularity of level sets. The paper claims to contribute to the understanding of the optimization landscape of neural networks, providing insights into the role of overparametrization, data distribution, and model architecture.
Decision
I decide to Accept this paper, with the main reasons being:
1. The paper tackles a specific and important question in the field of deep learning, providing a thorough analysis of the loss surface of neural networks.
2. The approach is well-motivated, building upon existing literature and providing new theoretical results and algorithms to support the claims.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a clear and well-structured presentation of the problem, including a thorough review of existing literature and a detailed explanation of the theoretical results and algorithms. The authors demonstrate a good understanding of the subject matter, and the paper is well-written and easy to follow.
The theoretical results, particularly Theorem 2.4, provide a significant contribution to the understanding of the optimization landscape of neural networks. The introduction of the dynamic programming algorithm to estimate the geometric regularity of level sets is also a valuable contribution, allowing for a more detailed analysis of the loss surface.
The empirical results, although limited to a few examples, demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm and provide insights into the behavior of the loss surface in different scenarios.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest the authors consider the following:
* Provide more detailed explanations of the proofs, particularly for Theorem 2.4, to make the paper more accessible to a broader audience.
* Include more empirical results, exploring different architectures, datasets, and optimization algorithms to demonstrate the generality of the findings.
* Discuss the implications of the results for practical deep learning applications, such as the design of optimization algorithms and the choice of hyperparameters.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to address the following questions:
* Can you provide more intuition on why the linear case is fundamentally different from the half-rectified case, and how this difference affects the optimization landscape?
* How do the results on the topological connectedness of level sets relate to the concept of saddle points, and what implications do they have for the convergence of optimization algorithms?
* Can you elaborate on the limitations of the dynamic programming algorithm, particularly in terms of scalability and computational complexity, and how they might be addressed in future work?
