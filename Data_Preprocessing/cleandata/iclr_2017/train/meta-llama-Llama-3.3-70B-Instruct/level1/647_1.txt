Summary
The paper proposes a novel learning framework, Recurrent Inference Machines (RIMs), which abandons the traditional separation between model and inference in solving inverse problems. Instead, RIMs learn to solve inverse problems directly by training a recurrent neural network (RNN) to map observations to estimated signals. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of RIMs in various image reconstruction tasks, including denoising and super-resolution, and show that they can outperform state-of-the-art methods.
Decision
I decide to Accept this paper, with the key reason being that the approach is well-motivated and supported by empirical results. The paper tackles a specific question/problem in inverse problems, which is the separation of modeling from inference, and proposes a novel solution that bridges the gap between inverse problems and deep learning.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a clear and well-structured introduction to the problem of inverse problems and the limitations of traditional approaches. The authors motivate the need for a new framework that can learn to solve inverse problems directly, without the need for explicit modeling and inference. The proposed RIM framework is well-supported by theoretical insights and empirical results, which demonstrate its effectiveness in various image reconstruction tasks. The paper also provides a thorough comparison with state-of-the-art methods, which shows that RIMs can outperform them in many cases.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the implementation of RIMs, including the architecture of the RNN and the training procedure. Additionally, it would be helpful to provide more analysis on the convergence behavior of RIMs and the effect of the state variable on the reconstruction performance. Finally, the authors may want to consider applying RIMs to more complex inverse problems, such as non-linear inverse problems, to demonstrate the generality of the framework.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like to ask the authors the following questions:
* Can you provide more details on the choice of the RNN architecture and the training procedure for RIMs?
* How do the authors plan to extend the RIM framework to more complex inverse problems, such as non-linear inverse problems?
* Can you provide more analysis on the convergence behavior of RIMs and the effect of the state variable on the reconstruction performance?
