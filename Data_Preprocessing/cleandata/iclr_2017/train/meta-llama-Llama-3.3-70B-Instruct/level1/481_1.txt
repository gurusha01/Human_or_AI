Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper presents a comprehensive study on adversarial training for large-scale deep learning models, specifically on the ImageNet dataset. The authors investigate the effectiveness of adversarial training in improving the robustness of models to adversarial examples, which are malicious inputs designed to fool machine learning models. They propose recommendations for scaling adversarial training to large models and datasets, and demonstrate that adversarial training can significantly increase the robustness of models to single-step attack methods. Additionally, they observe that multi-step attack methods are less transferable between models, and provide insights into the "label leaking" effect, where adversarially trained models can learn to exploit regularities in the adversarial example construction process.

3. The paper presents extensive experimental results, including a detailed analysis of the effectiveness of adversarial training on the ImageNet dataset, which demonstrates the significance of the authors' contributions.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a clear and well-structured presentation of the research, including a thorough review of existing work on adversarial examples and adversarial training. The authors' proposed approach to scaling adversarial training to large models and datasets is well-motivated and supported by extensive experimental results.

Additional Feedback and Questions
To further improve the paper, I would suggest that the authors provide more detailed analysis of the computational costs associated with adversarial training, as well as a more comprehensive comparison with other existing methods for defending against adversarial examples. Additionally, I would like to see more discussion on the potential applications and implications of the authors' research, particularly in the context of real-world deep learning deployments.
Some specific questions I would like the authors to address include:
* How do the authors plan to extend their research to other types of deep learning models and datasets?
* What are the potential limitations and challenges of scaling adversarial training to even larger models and datasets?
* How do the authors propose to address the "label leaking" effect in practice, and what are the implications of this effect for the development of more robust deep learning models?
