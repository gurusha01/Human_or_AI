Summary of the Paper's Claims and Contributions
The paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the dynamic behavior of Residual Networks (ResNets) during training. The authors show that ResNets can be viewed as ensembles of relatively shallow networks, and that the effective depth of these ensembles increases as training progresses. This increase in depth allows ResNets to maintain their advantage over conventional networks while still being easy to optimize. The authors also identify the scaling introduced by Batch Normalization as the main mechanism controlling this dynamic behavior. Furthermore, they use generalized spin glass models to study the loss surface of ResNets and show that the number of critical points with low index decreases as the ensemble becomes deeper.

2. The approach is well-motivated and well-placed in the literature, building on existing work on ResNets and spin glass models.
3. The paper provides a thorough and rigorous analysis of the dynamic behavior of ResNets, including theoretical results and experimental evidence.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a clear and concise introduction to the problem and the proposed approach. The authors carefully motivate their analysis and provide a thorough review of related work. The theoretical results are rigorously derived and well-explained, and the experimental evidence is convincing and well-presented.

Additional Feedback and Questions
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors consider the following:
* Provide more intuition and explanation for the theoretical results, particularly for readers without a strong background in spin glass models.
* Consider adding more experimental results to further validate the findings and explore the robustness of the dynamic behavior.
* Clarify the relationship between the dynamic behavior of ResNets and other optimization techniques, such as stochastic gradient descent.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper are:
* Can you provide more details on how the scaling introduced by Batch Normalization affects the dynamic behavior of ResNets?
* How do the results of the paper relate to other work on ResNets and deep learning optimization?
* Are there any potential applications or implications of the dynamic behavior of ResNets beyond the context of image classification and object detection?
