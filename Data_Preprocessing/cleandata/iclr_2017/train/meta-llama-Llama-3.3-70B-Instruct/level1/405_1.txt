Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper presents a significant advancement in environment modeling by introducing recurrent neural networks that can make temporally and spatially coherent predictions for hundreds of time-steps into the future. The authors improve upon previous environment simulators from high-dimensional pixel observations and provide an in-depth analysis of the factors affecting performance. They also address the issue of computational inefficiency with a model that does not need to generate a high-dimensional image at each time-step. The approach is demonstrated to be adaptable to various environments, including Atari games, a 3D car racing environment, and complex 3D mazes.

Supporting Arguments
The paper presents a clear and well-structured approach to environment modeling, building upon previous work and addressing key challenges in the field. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the factors affecting performance, including the impact of different training schemes, prediction lengths, and action-dependent state transitions. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in various environments, including Atari games, a 3D car racing environment, and complex 3D mazes. The authors also provide a detailed comparison with previous work and discuss the limitations and potential extensions of their approach.
Additional Feedback and Questions
To further improve the paper, I would like to see more discussion on the potential applications and implications of the proposed approach, as well as more detailed analysis of the computational efficiency and scalability of the model. Some specific questions I would like the authors to address include:
* How do the authors plan to extend their approach to more complex and dynamic environments, such as those with multiple agents or changing rules?
* Can the authors provide more insight into the trade-offs between short-term and long-term accuracy in their model, and how these trade-offs might be optimized for specific applications?
* How do the authors plan to address the potential limitations of their approach, such as the reliance on high-dimensional pixel observations and the potential for overfitting to specific environments or policies?
