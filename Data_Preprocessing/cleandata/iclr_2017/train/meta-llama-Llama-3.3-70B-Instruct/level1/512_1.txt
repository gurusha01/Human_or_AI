The paper "Nonparametric Activation Functions for Deep Neural Networks" proposes a novel approach to learning activation functions in deep neural networks. The authors introduce a nonparametric framework for estimating activation functions using a Fourier basis expansion, which allows the network to learn more complex and flexible functions. The paper also provides a theoretical justification for the approach, demonstrating that the proposed method can achieve vanishing generalization error as the sample size increases.
The paper tackles the specific question of how to learn activation functions in deep neural networks, which is a crucial aspect of neural network design. The approach is well-motivated, as it addresses the limitation of current methods that rely on predefined activation functions. The paper also provides a thorough review of related work, highlighting the contributions of the proposed approach.
The claims made in the paper are supported by theoretical analysis and empirical results. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on several benchmark datasets, including MNIST and CIFAR-10, and show that it can achieve significant improvements in performance compared to traditional methods. The theoretical analysis provides a rigorous justification for the approach, demonstrating that it can achieve vanishing generalization error under certain conditions.
Based on the review, I decide to Accept the paper. The paper makes a significant contribution to the field of deep learning, proposing a novel approach to learning activation functions that can achieve state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets. The theoretical analysis provides a rigorous justification for the approach, and the empirical results demonstrate its effectiveness.
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed approach and its scalability to larger datasets. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more extensive experiments on other datasets and tasks, such as natural language processing and computer vision.
Some questions that I would like the authors to clarify include:
* How does the choice of the Fourier basis expansion affect the performance of the proposed approach?
* Can the proposed approach be extended to other types of neural networks, such as recurrent neural networks or graph neural networks?
* How does the proposed approach compare to other methods for learning activation functions, such as evolutionary algorithms or reinforcement learning?
