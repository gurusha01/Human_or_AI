Summary
The paper proposes a novel approach to state estimation in robotics by combining problem-specific algorithms with machine learning. The authors introduce end-to-end learnable histogram filters (E2E-HFs), which encode the structure of recursive state estimation using prediction and measurement update, while allowing the specific models to be learned end-to-end. The approach is demonstrated in two localization tasks, showing improved data efficiency and performance compared to traditional methods.
Decision
I decide to Accept this paper, with two key reasons: (1) the approach is well-motivated and placed in the literature, and (2) the paper provides strong empirical evidence to support its claims.
Supporting Arguments
The paper tackles a specific question in robotics, namely state estimation in unknown environments with partial observations. The approach is well-motivated, as it combines the strengths of problem-specific algorithms and machine learning, allowing for data-efficient learning and improved performance. The authors provide a clear and thorough explanation of the E2E-HF algorithm, including its components and training procedures. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in two localization tasks, showing improved data efficiency and performance compared to traditional methods.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest the authors provide more details on the computational complexity of the E2E-HF algorithm and its scalability to higher-dimensional problems. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods in robotics. The authors may also consider providing more insights into the learned models and their interpretation.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
1. Can you provide more details on the choice of the histogram size and its impact on the performance of the E2E-HF algorithm?
2. How do the authors plan to address the computational complexity of the E2E-HF algorithm for higher-dimensional problems?
3. Can you provide more insights into the learned models and their interpretation, particularly in the context of the two localization tasks?
