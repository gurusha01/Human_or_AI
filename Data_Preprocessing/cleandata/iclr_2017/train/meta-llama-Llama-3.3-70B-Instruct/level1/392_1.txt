Summary of the Paper
The paper proposes a new approach to optimizing autoencoders for lossy image compression. The authors introduce a simple yet effective way to deal with the non-differentiability of the compression loss, allowing them to train deep autoencoders that are competitive with JPEG 2000 and outperform recently proposed approaches based on RNNs. The paper also presents a computationally efficient architecture, making it suitable for high-resolution images.
Decision
I decide to Accept this paper, with the main reason being that the approach is well-motivated and supported by empirical results. The paper tackles a specific and important problem in the field of image compression, and the proposed solution is novel and effective.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a clear and concise introduction to the problem of lossy image compression and the challenges associated with optimizing autoencoders for this task. The authors propose a simple yet effective solution to deal with the non-differentiability of the compression loss, which is a key contribution of the paper. The empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, with the autoencoder outperforming JPEG 2000 in terms of SSIM and MOS scores.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the implementation of the entropy coding scheme and the range coder used in the experiments. Additionally, it would be helpful to include more visual examples of the compressed images, such as the complete images shown in Appendix A.6, to better illustrate the quality of the compressed images.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like to ask the authors the following questions:
1. Can you provide more details on the choice of the hyperparameters, such as the number of output channels and the value of Î±, used in the experiments?
2. How do you plan to extend the proposed approach to other types of media, such as video or audio, and what challenges do you anticipate in doing so?
3. Can you provide more insights into the trade-offs between the rate-distortion trade-off and the computational efficiency of the proposed approach, and how these trade-offs can be optimized in practice?
