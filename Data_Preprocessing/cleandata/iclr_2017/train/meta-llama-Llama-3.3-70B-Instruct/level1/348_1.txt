Summary
The paper presents Steerable Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a class of equivariant convolutional networks that achieve state-of-the-art results on the CIFAR image classification benchmark. The authors introduce a mathematical theory of steerable representations, which reveals a type system for composing elementary feature types, each associated with a particular kind of symmetry. This theory allows for the construction of CNNs that utilize parameters effectively, leading to improved statistical efficiency.
Decision
I decide to Accept this paper, with two key reasons for this choice:
1. The paper tackles a specific and important problem in computer vision, namely improving the statistical efficiency of deep learning methods.
2. The approach is well-motivated and well-placed in the literature, building on existing work on equivariant CNNs and group representation theory.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a clear and concise introduction to the theory of steerable representations, which is well-supported by mathematical derivations and examples. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through experiments on the CIFAR10 dataset, achieving state-of-the-art results. The paper also provides a thorough discussion of related work, highlighting the connections between steerable CNNs and other equivariant neural network architectures.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more intuition and visualizations to help readers understand the concept of steerable representations and their composition. Additionally, it would be helpful to include more details on the computational efficiency of the proposed method, particularly in terms of training time and memory requirements.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
1. Can you provide more examples of how the type system for steerable representations can be used to construct CNNs with specific symmetry properties?
2. How do the authors plan to extend the theory of steerable CNNs to continuous groups and high-dimensional data?
3. Can you provide more details on the implementation of the steerable CNNs, including the specific architectures and hyperparameters used in the experiments?
