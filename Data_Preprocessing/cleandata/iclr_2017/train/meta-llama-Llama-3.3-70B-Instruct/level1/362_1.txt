Summary
The paper proposes a novel approach to automating algorithm design by learning an optimization algorithm using reinforcement learning. The authors represent any particular optimization algorithm as a policy and learn it using guided policy search. The learned optimizer is demonstrated to outperform existing hand-engineered algorithms in terms of convergence speed and/or final objective value on various convex and non-convex optimization problems.
Decision
I decide to Accept this paper with minor revisions. The main reasons for this decision are: (1) the paper tackles a significant and well-motivated problem in the field of optimization, and (2) the approach is well-placed in the literature and demonstrates promising results.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a clear and well-structured introduction to the problem of automating algorithm design and motivates the use of reinforcement learning to learn an optimization algorithm. The authors provide a thorough review of related work in meta-learning, program induction, and hyperparameter optimization, highlighting the differences between their approach and existing methods. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the learned optimizer on various optimization problems, including logistic regression, robust linear regression, and neural net classification.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest the authors provide more details on the implementation of the guided policy search algorithm, including the choice of hyperparameters and the number of iterations used. Additionally, it would be helpful to include more visualizations of the optimization trajectories to gain insights into the behavior of the learned algorithm. Finally, the authors may want to consider discussing potential limitations and future directions of their approach, such as applying it to more complex optimization problems or exploring other reinforcement learning algorithms.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
1. Can you provide more details on how the neural net is designed and trained to model the mean of the policy?
2. How do you ensure that the learned optimizer generalizes to unseen objective functions and does not overfit to the training data?
3. Can you discuss potential applications of the learned optimizer to other areas of machine learning, such as reinforcement learning or deep learning?
