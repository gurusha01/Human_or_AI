Summary
The paper introduces a new dataset based on Higher-Order Logic (HOL) proofs, which can be used to develop machine learning-based theorem-proving strategies. The dataset consists of 2,013,046 training examples and 196,030 testing examples, originating from 11,400 proofs. The authors propose various machine learning tasks that can be performed on this dataset, including proof step classification, premise selection, and intermediate sentence generation. They also benchmark simple baseline machine learning models, including logistic regression, convolutional neural networks, and recurrent neural networks, which show promising results.
Decision
I decide to Accept this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the paper tackles a specific and important problem in the field of automated theorem proving, which is the development of machine learning-based strategies for filtering or generating proof steps. Secondly, the approach is well-motivated and well-placed in the literature, with a clear explanation of the related work and the potential applications of the proposed dataset and machine learning tasks.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a clear and detailed explanation of the dataset, the machine learning tasks, and the baseline models. The results of the baseline models are promising, with an accuracy of up to 83% on the proof step classification task. The paper also discusses the limitations of the current approach and proposes future directions, such as leveraging the graph structure of HOL statements using recursive neural tensor networks.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the baseline models. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more analysis on the types of proof steps that are most difficult to classify, and how the machine learning models can be improved to handle these cases. Furthermore, the authors may want to consider providing more examples of how the proposed dataset and machine learning tasks can be used in practice, such as in the development of automated theorem provers or in the formal verification of software.
Questions for the Authors
I would like to ask the authors to clarify the following points:
* How do the authors plan to address the issue of bias in the dataset, which may arise from the fact that the proof steps are generated by human provers?
* Can the authors provide more details on the types of machine learning models that they plan to explore in future work, and how these models can be used to leverage the graph structure of HOL statements?
* How do the authors envision the proposed dataset and machine learning tasks being used in practice, and what are the potential applications and benefits of this work?
