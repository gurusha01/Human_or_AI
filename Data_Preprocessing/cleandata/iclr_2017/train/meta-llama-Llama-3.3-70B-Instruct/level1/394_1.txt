Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper proposes a novel method for regularizing Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) called zoneout, which stochastically preserves hidden units' activations. The authors demonstrate that zoneout improves performance across various tasks, including character-level and word-level language modeling on the Penn Treebank and Text8 datasets, and classification on permuted sequential MNIST. Zoneout is shown to outperform other regularizers, such as dropout and recurrent dropout, and achieves state-of-the-art results on some tasks.
Decision and Key Reasons
I decide to accept this paper, with two key reasons: (1) the approach is well-motivated and placed in the literature, building upon existing regularization techniques for RNNs, and (2) the paper provides strong empirical evidence supporting the claims, with thorough experiments and comparisons to other regularizers.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a clear and concise introduction to the problem of regularization in RNNs and motivates the need for a new approach. The authors thoroughly review related work, including dropout and its variants, and highlight the limitations of existing methods. The experimental evaluation is comprehensive, covering various tasks and datasets, and demonstrates the effectiveness of zoneout in improving performance. The authors also provide insights into the benefits of zoneout, including its ability to introduce stochasticity and improve gradient flow.
Additional Feedback and Suggestions
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more analysis on the hyperparameter tuning of zoneout probabilities and explore the application of zoneout to other RNN architectures, such as Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) and bidirectional RNNs. Additionally, it would be interesting to see a more detailed comparison of zoneout with other regularization techniques, such as weight decay and early stopping.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions: (1) Can you provide more intuition on why zoneout works better than dropout on RNNs, and how the stochastic identity connections introduced by zoneout improve gradient flow? (2) How do you plan to extend zoneout to other deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformers? (3) Can you provide more details on the computational resources and training time required for the experiments, and how zoneout affects the training time and convergence of RNNs?
