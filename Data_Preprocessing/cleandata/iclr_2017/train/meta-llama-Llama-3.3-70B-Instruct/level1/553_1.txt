The paper claims to contribute to the field of near-data processing (NDP) by proposing a new SSD platform, called ISP-ML, which allows for the simulation of in-storage processing (ISP) of machine learning workloads. The authors evaluate the potential of NDP for machine learning using ISP-ML and compare the performance of ISP-based optimization with conventional in-host processing (IHP). The paper also identifies future research opportunities in exploiting the parallelism provided by multiple NAND channels inside SSDs.
I decide to accept this paper with two key reasons: (1) the paper tackles a specific and relevant problem in the field of computer architecture, and (2) the approach is well-motivated and supported by a thorough analysis of the literature. The authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of their methodology and experimental results, which demonstrate the effectiveness of their proposed approach.
The paper supports its claims through a thorough analysis of the literature and experimental results. The authors provide a detailed explanation of their ISP-ML platform and its components, as well as the methodology used to compare the performance of ISP-based optimization with IHP. The experimental results demonstrate the advantages of ISP-based optimization, particularly in terms of convergence speed and memory efficiency. The authors also provide a thorough discussion of the limitations and potential future research directions.
To improve the paper, I would suggest that the authors provide more details on the implementation of their ISP-ML platform, particularly in terms of the hardware and software components. Additionally, the authors could provide more insights into the potential applications and implications of their proposed approach, beyond the specific use case of machine learning. Some questions I would like the authors to answer include: (1) How does the ISP-ML platform handle data fragmentation and page size issues in NAND flash memory? (2) Can the authors provide more details on the communication protocol used between the channel controllers and the cache controller? (3) How do the authors plan to extend their approach to support more complex machine learning algorithms and models? Overall, the paper provides a solid contribution to the field of NDP and machine learning, and with some minor revisions, it has the potential to be a strong publication.
