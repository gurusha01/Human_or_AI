This paper proposes a novel approach to learning algorithmic tasks by leveraging the principle of divide and conquer, which is a fundamental concept in discrete mathematics and computer science. The authors introduce a recursive split and merge architecture that can be trained using only input-output pairs, without the need for intermediate supervision. This approach is particularly interesting because it allows the model to learn complex functional dependencies while optimizing for both accuracy and computational complexity.
The paper is well-motivated, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the problem they are trying to solve. They also provide a thorough review of related work, highlighting the limitations of existing approaches and the advantages of their proposed method. The technical contributions of the paper are significant, and the authors provide a detailed description of their architecture and training procedure.
Based on the content of the paper, I would accept this paper for publication. The key reasons for my decision are:
1. The paper tackles a specific and well-defined problem in the field of AI, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their approach.
2. The approach is well-motivated, and the authors provide a thorough review of related work, highlighting the limitations of existing approaches and the advantages of their proposed method.
3. The technical contributions of the paper are significant, and the authors provide a detailed description of their architecture and training procedure.
Some potential areas for improvement include:
* Providing more experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on a wider range of tasks and datasets.
* Investigating the scalability of the proposed approach to larger and more complex tasks.
* Providing more analysis and discussion of the results, including a more detailed comparison with existing approaches and a discussion of the potential limitations and challenges of the proposed method.
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
* Can you provide more details on how the split and merge blocks are trained, and how the parameters are shared across different scales?
* How do you handle the case where the input size is not a power of 2, and how do you ensure that the model can generalize to larger input sizes?
* Can you provide more experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on a wider range of tasks and datasets?
