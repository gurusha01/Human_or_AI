Summary
The paper proposes a novel adversarial learning formulation that enables Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to produce direct energy estimates for samples. The authors develop a flexible adversarial training framework, which ensures the generator converges to the true data distribution and the discriminator retains density information at the global optimum. They derive the analytic form of the induced solution and analyze its properties. The paper also introduces two effective approximation techniques to optimize the training objective and verifies the results empirically.
Decision
I decide to Accept this paper with minor revisions.
Reasons
The paper tackles a specific question/problem in the field of GANs, which is the inability of GANs to provide sensible energy estimates for samples. The approach is well-motivated, and the authors provide a clear and thorough analysis of the proposed formulation. The empirical results support the theoretical analysis, and the paper is well-written and easy to follow.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a rigorous characterization of the learned discriminator in the non-parametric setting and proposes two methods for instantiating it in the typical parametric setting. The experimental results verify the theoretical analysis about the discriminator properties, and the paper shows that the proposed framework can obtain samples of state-of-the-art quality. The authors also provide a detailed comparison with baseline models and analyze the performance difference between the proposed models.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest the authors provide more insights into the choice of the convex function K(pgen) and its impact on the optimal discriminator. Additionally, it would be helpful to include more detailed analysis of the limitations of the variational inference-based approximation and the nearest-neighbor based approximation. Finally, the authors may want to consider providing more quantitative results on the quality of the learned discriminator and its ability to capture density information.
Questions for the Authors
1. Can you provide more intuition on the choice of the convex function K(pgen) and its impact on the optimal discriminator?
2. How do you plan to address the limitations of the variational inference-based approximation and the nearest-neighbor based approximation in future work?
3. Can you provide more quantitative results on the quality of the learned discriminator and its ability to capture density information, especially on high-dimensional datasets?
