Summary
The paper proposes a new ensemble method called Boosted Residual Networks (BRN), which combines Residual Networks with Deep Incremental Boosting to create an ensemble of Residual Networks by growing the member network at each round of boosting. The authors demonstrate that BRN outperforms a single Residual Network, AdaBoost with Residual Networks, and Deep Incremental Boosting on MNIST and CIFAR datasets without using augmentation techniques.
Decision
I decide to Accept this paper with two key reasons: (1) the approach is well-motivated and placed in the literature, and (2) the paper supports its claims with empirical results on benchmark datasets.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a clear and concise introduction to Residual Networks and Deep Incremental Boosting, and motivates the need for a "white-box" ensemble method that leverages the underlying architecture of the base classifier. The authors also provide a thorough description of the proposed BRN method and its variants, including Distilled Boosted Residual Networks (DBRN) and Bagged Residual Networks (BARN). The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of BRN in improving accuracy and reducing training time compared to other ensemble methods.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more analysis on the computational complexity of BRN and its variants, as well as a more detailed comparison with other state-of-the-art ensemble methods. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more experiments on larger and more complex datasets to demonstrate the scalability of BRN.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
* Can you provide more intuition on why the proposed BRN method outperforms other ensemble methods, such as AdaBoost and Deep Incremental Boosting?
* How do you plan to extend the BRN method to other types of neural networks, such as Densely Connected Convolutional Networks?
* Can you provide more details on the distillation process used in DBRN and how it affects the performance of the ensemble?
