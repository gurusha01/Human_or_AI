Summary of the Paper
The paper proposes a novel model called Recurrent Hidden Semi-Markov Model (R-HSMM) for unsupervised segmentation and labeling of high-dimensional time series data. The model combines the strengths of Hidden Semi-Markov Models (HSMMs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to capture complex dependencies within each segment. The authors also introduce a stochastic distributional penalty method to train the model and a bidirectional RNN encoder to mimic the exact inference. The experimental results demonstrate that the R-HSMM outperforms existing models on both synthetic and real-world datasets.
Decision
I decide to Accept this paper.
Reasons for the Decision
1. The paper tackles a specific and important problem in machine learning, namely unsupervised segmentation and labeling of high-dimensional time series data.
2. The approach is well-motivated and builds upon existing work in HSMMs and RNNs. The authors provide a clear explanation of the limitations of existing models and how their proposed model addresses these limitations.
3. The paper provides strong empirical evidence to support the claims made by the authors. The experimental results demonstrate that the R-HSMM outperforms existing models on a range of datasets, including synthetic and real-world data.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a clear and concise explanation of the proposed model and its components. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the experimental results, including visualizations of the segmentation results and reconstruction of the original signals. The use of a bidirectional RNN encoder to mimic the exact inference is a novel contribution, and the authors demonstrate its effectiveness in reducing the computational cost of inference.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the hyperparameter tuning process and the sensitivity of the model to different hyperparameter settings. Additionally, it would be useful to include more visualizations of the segmentation results and reconstruction of the original signals for the real-world datasets.
Questions for the Authors
1. Can you provide more details on the computational cost of training the R-HSMM model compared to existing models?
2. How sensitive is the model to the choice of hyperparameters, such as the number of hidden states and the dimension of the hidden vector in the RNN?
3. Can you provide more visualizations of the segmentation results and reconstruction of the original signals for the real-world datasets, such as the human activity and drosophila datasets?
