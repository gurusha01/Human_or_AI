Summary
The paper proposes a modified objective function for Denoising Autoencoders (DAEs) that explicitly enforces denoising to be carried out during the encoding phase. The authors argue that the original DAE objective function does not guarantee robustness in the encoding phase, and their modification aims to address this limitation. The paper provides a theoretical analysis of the modified objective function and demonstrates its effectiveness through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets.
Decision
I decide to Accept this paper, with the main reason being that the authors have clearly identified a limitation in the original DAE objective function and proposed a well-motivated modification that addresses this issue. The paper provides a thorough analysis of the modified objective function and demonstrates its effectiveness through experiments.
Supporting Arguments
The paper tackles a specific question/problem in the field of autoencoders, which is the lack of robustness in the encoding phase of DAEs. The authors provide a clear motivation for their modification, which is to enforce denoising to be carried out during the encoding phase. The theoretical analysis of the modified objective function is sound, and the experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The paper is well-written, and the authors have done a good job of explaining the background, methodology, and results.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I would suggest that the authors provide more comparisons with other related approaches, such as contractive autoencoders. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more experiments on larger datasets and more complex tasks, such as image classification. The authors may also want to consider providing more details on the implementation of the modified DAE, such as the choice of hyperparameters and the optimization algorithm used.
Questions for the Authors
I would like to ask the authors to clarify the following points:
* How did the authors choose the value of the trade-off parameter Î» in the modified objective function?
* Can the authors provide more insights into the relationship between the modified DAE objective function and other related approaches, such as contractive autoencoders?
* How do the authors plan to extend their approach to more complex tasks, such as image classification, and larger datasets?
