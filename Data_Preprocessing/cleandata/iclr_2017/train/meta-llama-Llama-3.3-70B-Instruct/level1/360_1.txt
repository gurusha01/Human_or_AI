Summary of the Paper
The paper proposes a novel approach to semi-supervised reinforcement learning (SSRL), which enables an agent to learn from both labeled and unlabeled experiences. The authors formalize SSRL as a problem where the reward function is only available in a limited set of "labeled" Markov decision processes (MDPs), and the agent must generalize its behavior to a wider range of "unlabeled" MDPs. The proposed method, called semi-supervised skill generalization (S3G), uses an inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) algorithm to infer the reward function in the unlabeled MDPs, leveraging the agent's prior experience in the labeled MDPs.
Decision
I decide to Accept this paper, with two key reasons: (1) the paper tackles a well-motivated and important problem in reinforcement learning, and (2) the proposed approach is well-supported by theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a clear and concise formulation of the SSRL problem, which is a significant contribution to the field. The authors also provide a thorough analysis of the proposed S3G algorithm, including its theoretical foundations and empirical evaluations on several challenging tasks. The results demonstrate that S3G can improve the generalization performance of a learned policy, outperforming traditional RL methods and reward regression approaches.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more detailed analysis on the sample complexity of the S3G algorithm, as well as its potential applications to real-world problems. Additionally, it would be interesting to see comparisons with other semi-supervised learning methods, such as transfer learning and meta-learning.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
1. How does the S3G algorithm handle cases where the reward function is highly complex or non-linear?
2. Can the authors provide more insights on the choice of the entropy regularizer in the S3G algorithm, and its impact on the learning process?
3. How does the S3G algorithm scale to more complex tasks, such as those with high-dimensional state and action spaces?
