The paper proposes a novel memory architecture for neural networks called Hierarchical Attentive Memory (HAM), which achieves a significant improvement in memory access complexity, reducing it from Θ(n) to Θ(log n). This is a substantial contribution to the field, as it enables neural networks to efficiently process large-scale problems with long-range dependencies.
I decide to accept this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the approach is well-motivated and placed in the literature, building upon existing work on neural networks with external memories. The authors provide a clear and concise overview of the related work, highlighting the limitations of current architectures and the need for more efficient memory access mechanisms. Secondly, the paper supports its claims with thorough experiments, demonstrating the effectiveness of HAM on a range of algorithmic tasks, including sorting, merging, and searching.
The experimental results are impressive, showing that HAM can learn to solve complex problems with high accuracy and generalize well to longer input sequences. The comparison to other models, such as LSTM with attention, highlights the advantages of HAM in terms of efficiency and scalability. The additional experiments with the "raw" HAM module, which can act as a drop-in replacement for classic data structures like stacks and queues, further demonstrate the versatility and potential of the proposed architecture.
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more insights into the algorithms learned by the LSTM+HAM model, potentially using visualization techniques or analyzing the hidden representations learned by the network. Additionally, it would be interesting to explore the application of HAM to real-world sequential data, such as text or time series data, to demonstrate its practical impact.
I would like the authors to answer the following questions to clarify my understanding of the paper: (1) Can you provide more details on the training procedure, including the specific hyperparameters used and the convergence criteria? (2) How do you plan to address the potential limitations of HAM, such as the need for a large number of parameters to represent the binary tree structure? (3) Can you discuss the potential applications of HAM in other areas, such as computer vision or natural language processing, and how it could be adapted to these domains?
