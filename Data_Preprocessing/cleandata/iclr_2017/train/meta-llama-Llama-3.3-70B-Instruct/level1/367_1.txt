This paper proposes a novel approach to learning binary autoencoders by formulating it as a biconvex optimization problem. The authors show that the optimal decoder is a single layer of artificial neurons, emerging entirely from the minimax loss minimization, and with weights learned by convex optimization. The approach is well-motivated, and the authors provide a clear and thorough explanation of the problem setup, notation, and theoretical results.
The paper tackles the specific question of learning binary autoencoders with worst-case optimal loss, which is a well-defined and important problem in the field of machine learning. The approach is well-placed in the literature, as it builds upon existing work on autoencoders, principal component analysis, and minimax optimization.
The paper supports its claims with theoretical results, including Theorem 1, which establishes the form of the optimal decoder, and Proposition 2, which characterizes the optimal encoding function. The authors also provide experimental results, which demonstrate the competitiveness of their approach with standard autoencoders trained with backpropagation.
I accept this paper because it presents a novel and well-motivated approach to learning binary autoencoders, with a clear and thorough explanation of the problem setup, notation, and theoretical results. The paper also provides experimental results that demonstrate the competitiveness of the approach.
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more intuition and discussion on the implications of their results, particularly in terms of the trade-offs between the proposed approach and existing methods. Additionally, the authors may want to consider providing more experimental results, such as comparisons with other autoencoder architectures or evaluations on more diverse datasets.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper include:
* Can the authors provide more insight into the relationship between the proposed approach and existing methods, such as principal component analysis and standard autoencoders?
* How do the authors plan to extend their approach to more complex autoencoder architectures, such as convolutional or recurrent autoencoders?
* Can the authors provide more discussion on the potential applications and limitations of their approach, particularly in terms of its scalability and interpretability?
