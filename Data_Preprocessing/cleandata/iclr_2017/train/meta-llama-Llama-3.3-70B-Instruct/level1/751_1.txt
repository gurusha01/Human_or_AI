Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper tackles the problem of catastrophic mistakes in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents, specifically the "Sisyphean curse" where agents may periodically relive catastrophic mistakes due to the use of function approximation. The authors propose a novel approach called "intrinsic fear" that mitigates these problems by avoiding dangerous states. They demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on two toy problems, Adventure Seeker and Cart-Pole, and provide preliminary results on the Atari game Seaquest.
Decision and Key Reasons
I decide to Accept this paper, with two key reasons: (1) the paper addresses a critical problem in DRL, providing a well-motivated and well-placed approach in the literature, and (2) the authors provide convincing empirical results demonstrating the effectiveness of their approach.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a clear and concise introduction to the problem of catastrophic mistakes in DRL, and the authors' approach is well-motivated by the need to avoid such mistakes in real-world applications. The intrinsic fear model is a novel and interesting solution that addresses the limitations of traditional DRL methods. The empirical results are convincing, demonstrating significant improvements over traditional DQN methods on the toy problems and promising results on the Atari game.
Additional Feedback and Questions
To further improve the paper, I would like to see more discussion on the limitations and potential failures of the intrinsic fear model. For example, what types of environments or problems may not be suitable for this approach? How does the choice of fear radius and fear factor affect the performance of the model? I would also like to see more comparison with other related work, such as traditional safety-constrained RL methods. Some specific questions I would like the authors to address include: (1) How does the intrinsic fear model handle cases where the catastrophe detector is not perfect or reliable? (2) Can the authors provide more insight into the relationship between the fear radius and the performance of the model? (3) How does the intrinsic fear model generalize to more complex environments or problems with multiple catastrophe states?
