Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper proposes a novel framework called Generative Adversarial Parallelization (GAP), which trains multiple Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) simultaneously, exchanging their discriminators to reduce the tight coupling between generator and discriminator. This approach aims to improve mode coverage, convergence, and the quality of the generative model. The authors also introduce a new metric, GAM-II, to evaluate the performance of GANs.
Decision and Key Reasons
I decide to Accept this paper, with two key reasons:
1. The paper tackles a specific and important problem in GAN training, namely mode coverage and convergence, and proposes a well-motivated approach to address it.
2. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of GAP in improving mode coverage, generalization, and the quality of the generative model, as evaluated by the proposed GAM-II metric.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a clear and well-structured introduction to the problem of GAN training, highlighting the limitations of existing approaches. The proposed GAP framework is well-motivated, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of its benefits, including improved mode coverage and convergence. The experimental results are extensive and demonstrate the effectiveness of GAP on various datasets, including synthetic and real-world data.
Additional Feedback and Questions
To further improve the paper, I suggest the authors:
* Provide more detailed analysis of the computational cost and scalability of the GAP framework.
* Investigate the application of GAP to other types of generative models, such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs).
* Clarify the relationship between GAP and other regularization techniques, such as dropout and weight decay.
I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
* How does the choice of swapping frequency affect the performance of GAP, and are there any guidelines for selecting the optimal frequency?
* Can the authors provide more insights into the behavior of GAP when training multiple GANs with different architectures, such as DCGAN and GRAN?
* How does GAP perform on datasets with complex and nuanced modes, such as those found in natural images or text data?
