This paper proposes a novel approach to sequence-to-sequence transduction by formulating it as a noisy channel decoding problem. The authors use recurrent neural networks to parameterize the source and channel models, allowing them to leverage unpaired output data to improve performance. The paper claims to achieve state-of-the-art results on several natural language processing tasks, including abstractive sentence summarization, machine translation, and morphological inflection generation.
I decide to Accept this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the approach is well-motivated and placed in the literature, building on the idea of noisy channel models and leveraging recent advances in recurrent neural networks. Secondly, the paper provides strong empirical evidence to support its claims, with experiments on multiple tasks and datasets demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
The paper provides a clear and detailed explanation of the proposed model, including the use of a latent alignment variable to enable tractable decoding. The experiments are well-designed and thorough, with a range of baselines and comparisons to existing state-of-the-art models. The results are impressive, with the proposed model outperforming existing approaches on several tasks.
To improve the paper, I would suggest providing more analysis and discussion of the results, particularly in terms of the trade-offs between the direct model and the noisy channel model. Additionally, it would be helpful to provide more details on the hyperparameter tuning process and the sensitivity of the results to different hyperparameter settings. Some questions I would like the authors to answer include: How do the results change when using different types of recurrent neural networks, such as GRUs or LSTMs with different numbers of layers? How does the performance of the model vary when using different amounts of unpaired output data? Are there any plans to apply this approach to other sequence-to-sequence tasks, such as speech recognition or dialogue generation?
