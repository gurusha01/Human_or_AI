This paper presents MUS-ROVER II, an extension of the authors' previous work on automatic music theorists, which aims to learn and represent music concepts in a human-interpretable way. The system is designed to produce personalized syllabi for learning compositional rules, with a focus on hierarchical rule learning and adaptive memory selection.
The paper tackles the specific question of how to induce hierarchical representations of music concepts, which is a key problem in music theory and pedagogy. The approach is well-motivated, drawing on insights from music theory, cognitive science, and machine learning. The authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of their methodology, which involves constructing a conceptual hierarchy of features and inferring informational hierarchy through the rule-learning process.
The paper supports its claims with empirical results, demonstrating the effectiveness of MUS-ROVER II in producing personalized syllabi and extracting meaningful rules from Bach's chorales. The results are scientifically rigorous, with a clear evaluation methodology and comparison to existing music theory and pedagogy.
I decide to accept this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the paper presents a novel and well-motivated approach to hierarchical rule learning in music, which has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field. Secondly, the paper provides a clear and detailed explanation of the methodology and results, which demonstrates a high level of scientific rigor.
To improve the paper, I would suggest providing more context and background information on music theory and pedagogy, to help non-experts understand the significance and relevance of the work. Additionally, it would be helpful to include more visualizations and examples of the extracted rules and syllabi, to illustrate the effectiveness of the system.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper include: How do the authors plan to evaluate the effectiveness of MUS-ROVER II in real-world music education settings? How do the authors intend to extend the system to other genres and styles of music? What are the potential applications of MUS-ROVER II beyond music education, such as in music recommendation or generation systems?
