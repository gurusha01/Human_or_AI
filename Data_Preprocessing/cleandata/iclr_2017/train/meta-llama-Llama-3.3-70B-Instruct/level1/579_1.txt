Summary
The paper proposes a novel hybrid neural network, TreNet, for predicting local trends in time series data. TreNet combines the strengths of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks to extract salient features from local raw data and capture long-range dependencies in historical local trends. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of TreNet by outperforming various baselines on real datasets.
