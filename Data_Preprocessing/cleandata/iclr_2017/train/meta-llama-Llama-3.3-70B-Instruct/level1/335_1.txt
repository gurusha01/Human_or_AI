Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper presents a novel framework for unsupervised learning of representations based on the infomax principle for large-scale neural populations. The authors propose a hierarchical infomax approach to optimize the mutual information between the input and output of a neural network, which is approximated using an asymptotic formula. The method is shown to be robust and efficient for extracting salient features from input datasets, outperforming existing methods such as independent component analysis (ICA) and sparse coding.
