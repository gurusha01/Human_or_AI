Summary
The paper proposes a novel type of function learning network, called Equation Learner (EQL), that can learn analytical expressions and extrapolate to unseen domains. The EQL network is a multi-layered feed-forward network with computational units specifically designed for extrapolation regression tasks. The network is fully differentiable, allowing for end-to-end training using backpropagation. The authors also introduce a model selection procedure to select for good extrapolation quality by a multi-objective criterion based on validation error and sparsity.
Decision
I decide to Accept this paper with two key reasons: (1) the paper tackles a specific and important problem in machine learning, namely extrapolation in regression tasks, and (2) the approach is well-motivated and supported by experimental results on synthetic and real data.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a clear and well-structured introduction to the problem of extrapolation in regression tasks and motivates the need for a new approach. The proposed EQL network is well-designed and supported by theoretical arguments. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the EQL network in learning analytical expressions and extrapolating to unseen domains. The authors also provide a thorough discussion of the related work and the limitations of their approach.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest the authors provide more details on the implementation of the EQL network, such as the choice of hyperparameters and the optimization algorithm used. Additionally, it would be helpful to include more visualizations of the learned expressions and the extrapolation results to better illustrate the performance of the EQL network.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
1. How do the authors choose the number of layers and units in the EQL network?
2. Can the authors provide more details on the model selection procedure and how it is used to select the best model?
3. How do the authors plan to extend the EQL network to handle more complex expressions and larger datasets?
