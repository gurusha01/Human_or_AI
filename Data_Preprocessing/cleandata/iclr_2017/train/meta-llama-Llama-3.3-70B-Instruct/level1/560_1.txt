Summary of the Paper's Claims and Contributions
The paper explores the challenges of training deep neural networks and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with long-term dependencies, specifically the vanishing and exploding gradient problems. The authors propose a novel approach to address these issues by controlling the orthogonality of weight matrices, which can help preserve gradient norms during backpropagation. They introduce a factorization technique that allows for bounding matrix norms and controlling the degree of expansivity induced during backpropagation. The paper presents empirical results on various tasks, including synthetic memory tasks and real-world datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of their approach in improving optimization convergence and model performance.
