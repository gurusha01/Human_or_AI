Summary
The paper introduces a metacontroller framework for adaptive, imagination-based optimization in neural networks. The metacontroller learns to optimize a sequence of internal simulations over predictive models of the world, allowing it to construct a more informed and economical solution. The approach is demonstrated on a challenging decision-making problem under complex non-linear dynamics, where the metacontroller learns to adapt the amount of computation it performs to the difficulty of the task and chooses which experts to consult based on their reliability and computational resource costs.
Decision
I decide to accept this paper, with the main reasons being the novelty and potential impact of the proposed metacontroller framework, as well as the thorough experimental evaluation and analysis of the results.
Supporting Arguments
The paper tackles a specific and important problem in machine learning, namely the need for adaptive and efficient optimization methods that can balance computational cost and performance. The approach is well-motivated and placed in the literature, drawing inspiration from cognitive science and neuroscience. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the metacontroller framework in achieving lower overall cost (task loss plus computational cost) than traditional fixed policy approaches. The paper also provides a detailed analysis of the results, including the ability of the metacontroller to adapt to different task difficulties and expert reliabilities.
