Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper tackles the problem of detecting misclassified or out-of-distribution examples in machine learning models. It presents a simple baseline approach that utilizes probabilities from softmax distributions to detect such examples. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of this baseline across various tasks in computer vision, natural language processing, and automatic speech recognition. They also introduce an abnormality module that can sometimes surpass the baseline, highlighting the potential for future research in this area.

I decide to Accept this paper, with the key reasons being:
1. The paper tackles a well-motivated and important problem in machine learning, and the approach is well-placed in the literature.
2. The paper provides a thorough evaluation of the proposed baseline and abnormality module across various tasks and datasets, demonstrating their effectiveness.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a clear and concise introduction to the problem, and the proposed baseline approach is simple yet effective. The authors also provide a thorough analysis of the results, highlighting the strengths and limitations of the approach. The introduction of the abnormality module and its evaluation on various tasks demonstrates the potential for future research in this area. The paper also provides a clear discussion of the implications of the results and potential avenues for future work.
Additional Feedback and Questions
To further improve the paper, I would suggest providing more details on the implementation of the abnormality module and its training procedure. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more analysis on the types of errors that the baseline approach is able to detect, and how the abnormality module improves upon this. Some questions I would like the authors to answer include:
* Can the abnormality module be applied to other types of machine learning models, such as recurrent neural networks or transformers?
* How does the choice of evaluation metric (e.g. AUROC, AUPR) affect the results, and are there other metrics that could be used to evaluate the performance of the baseline and abnormality module?
* Are there any potential applications of the abnormality module in real-world scenarios, such as detecting anomalies in medical images or detecting out-of-distribution examples in natural language processing tasks?
