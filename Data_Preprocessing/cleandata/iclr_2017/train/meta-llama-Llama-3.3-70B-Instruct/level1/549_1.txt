Summary
The paper proposes an efficient variant of convolutional sparse coding with unit norm code vectors, where reconstruction quality is evaluated using an inner product (cosine distance). The authors introduce a model called Energy-Based Spherical Sparse Coding (EB-SSC), which combines top-down and bottom-up information to produce class-specific features. The model is evaluated on the CIFAR-10 dataset and shows improved performance compared to baseline models.
