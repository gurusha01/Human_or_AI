Summary of the Paper's Claims and Contributions
The paper proposes a novel approach, called GRAM (Graph-based Attention Model), to address two significant challenges in healthcare predictive modeling: data insufficiency and interpretation. GRAM leverages medical ontologies to supplement electronic health records (EHR) data, enabling the model to learn robust and interpretable representations of medical concepts. The authors claim that GRAM outperforms various baseline models, including recurrent neural networks (RNN), in predicting diseases with limited data and provides more intuitive attention behaviors.
Decision and Key Reasons
Based on the review, I decide to Accept this paper. The two key reasons for this decision are:
1. Well-motivated approach: The authors provide a clear motivation for using medical ontologies to address data insufficiency and interpretation challenges in healthcare predictive modeling. The proposed approach is well-placed in the literature, and the authors demonstrate a good understanding of the limitations of existing methods.
2. Strong empirical results: The authors present comprehensive experimental results, demonstrating the effectiveness of GRAM in predicting diseases with limited data and providing more intuitive attention behaviors. The results show significant improvements over baseline models, including RNN, in various evaluation metrics.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a thorough description of the proposed approach, including the attention mechanism and the end-to-end training process. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the results, highlighting the benefits of using medical ontologies to supplement EHR data. The experimental setup is well-designed, with multiple datasets and evaluation metrics used to demonstrate the effectiveness of GRAM.
Additional Feedback and Questions
To further improve the paper, I suggest the authors:
* Provide more insights into the interpretability of the learned representations and attention behaviors, potentially using visualizations or case studies to illustrate the benefits of GRAM.
* Discuss potential limitations and future directions for the proposed approach, including the applicability of GRAM to other domains or tasks.
* Consider adding more baseline models or comparison methods to further demonstrate the effectiveness of GRAM.
Some questions I would like the authors to address:
* How do the authors plan to handle cases where the medical ontology is incomplete or inaccurate?
* Can the authors provide more details on the computational resources required to train GRAM, and how it compares to other deep learning models?
* How do the authors envision GRAM being used in practice, and what are the potential implications for healthcare decision-making and policy?
