Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper proposes a novel approach to analyzing bioacoustic signals using a Bayesian non-parametric (BNP) formulation of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), specifically the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Hidden Markov Model (HDP-HMM). This approach allows for the automatic identification of song units in bioacoustic signals without requiring prior knowledge of the number of hidden states. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on two real-world bioacoustic applications: humpback whale song decomposition and multi-species bird song unit structuration.
Decision and Key Reasons
I decide to accept this paper, with two key reasons:
1. The paper tackles a well-motivated problem in bioacoustics, and the proposed approach is well-placed in the literature, building upon existing work on HMMs and BNP models.
2. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on two challenging bioacoustic applications, with promising results and insightful discussions on the limitations and potential improvements.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a clear and well-structured introduction to the problem of bioacoustic signal analysis, highlighting the limitations of existing approaches and the need for a more flexible and robust method. The authors provide a thorough review of related work, positioning their approach within the context of existing research. The technical presentation of the HDP-HMM model is clear and well-motivated, and the experimental results are well-organized and easy to follow. The authors also provide a thoughtful discussion on the limitations of their approach and potential avenues for future work.
Additional Feedback and Questions
To further improve the paper, I would suggest providing more details on the computational efficiency of the proposed approach, as well as exploring ways to accelerate the MCMC sampling process. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more extensive evaluations of the proposed approach on larger datasets and more diverse bioacoustic applications. Some questions I would like the authors to address include:
* How do the authors plan to address the issue of scalability, given the computational expense of the MCMC sampling process?
* Can the authors provide more insights into the choice of hyperparameters for the HDP-HMM model, and how these parameters affect the performance of the approach?
* How do the authors envision their approach being used in practice, and what potential applications or collaborations do they see in the field of bioacoustics?
