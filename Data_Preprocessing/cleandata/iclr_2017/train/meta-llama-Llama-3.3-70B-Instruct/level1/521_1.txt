Summary
The paper proposes a novel approach to bioacoustic representation using a Fast Chirplet Transform (FCT), which is a trade-off between the scattering framework and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The authors motivate the use of Chirplet kernels as an efficient representation for bioacoustic signals and demonstrate the effectiveness of FCT in accelerating CNN training and improving classification performance on bird species and speech vowel datasets.
Decision
I decide to accept this paper with minor revisions. The main reasons for this decision are:
1. The paper tackles a specific and interesting problem in bioacoustic representation, which is a relevant and timely topic in the field of AI.
2. The approach is well-motivated and grounded in the literature, with a clear explanation of the advantages and limitations of the proposed method.
3. The paper provides empirical evidence to support the claims, with experiments on real-world datasets that demonstrate the effectiveness of FCT in improving CNN performance.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a thorough introduction to the problem of bioacoustic representation and the limitations of existing approaches. The authors clearly explain the motivation behind using Chirplet kernels and provide a detailed description of the FCT algorithm. The experimental results are well-presented and demonstrate the benefits of using FCT in terms of reduced training time and improved classification performance.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest the following:
* Provide more details on the computational complexity of the FCT algorithm and its scalability to larger datasets.
* Consider adding more comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods in bioacoustic representation, such as Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) and spectrograms.
* Provide more insights into the interpretability of the FCT features and their relationship to the underlying bioacoustic signals.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
* Can you provide more details on the choice of hyperparameters for the FCT algorithm, such as the number of octaves and the polynomial degree?
* How do you plan to extend the FCT approach to other types of bioacoustic signals, such as animal vocalizations or environmental sounds?
* Can you provide more information on the potential applications of the FCT approach in real-world scenarios, such as wildlife monitoring or speech recognition?
