The paper proposes a framework to analyze the activity of individual neurons in a convolutional neural network (CNN) by quantifying their inherent selectivity to specific properties, such as color and class labels. The authors introduce the concept of a "neuron feature" (NF), which is a weighted average of the images that maximally activate a neuron, and use this to define two selectivity indexes: a color selectivity index and a class selectivity index. The paper presents empirical results on the VGG-M network trained on ImageNet, showing that color is strongly entangled at all levels of the CNN representation and that class selectivity increases with depth.
I decide to accept this paper with two key reasons: (1) the paper tackles a specific and well-motivated question about understanding the internal representations of CNNs, and (2) the approach is well-placed in the literature and provides a novel framework for analyzing individual neurons.
The paper provides a clear and well-structured presentation of the methodology and results, and the authors have done a good job of situating their work in the context of existing research on CNNs and visual perception. The empirical results are interesting and provide insights into how color and class labels are represented in the network. The paper also raises interesting questions about the nature of neural coding in CNNs and how it relates to human visual perception.
To improve the paper, I would suggest providing more detailed analysis of the results and exploring the implications of the findings more thoroughly. For example, the authors could discuss the potential applications of their framework for understanding and improving CNN performance, or explore the relationship between the selectivity indexes and other measures of neural activity. Additionally, the authors could consider providing more visualizations of the NFs and selectivity indexes to help illustrate the results.
I would like to ask the authors to clarify a few points: (1) How do the selectivity indexes relate to other measures of neural activity, such as activation patterns or feature importance? (2) Can the authors provide more insight into the relationship between the color selectivity index and the human visual system, and how this might inform our understanding of color perception? (3) How do the authors plan to extend their framework to other properties, such as shape or texture, and what potential applications do they see for this work?
