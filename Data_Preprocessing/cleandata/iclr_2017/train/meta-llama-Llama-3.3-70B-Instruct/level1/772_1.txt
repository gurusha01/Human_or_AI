Summary
The paper proposes a thorough evaluation of various factors that impact the discriminative ability of features extracted from Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for instance-level image retrieval. The authors identify five key factors: feature aggregation and normalization, output layer selection, image resizing, multi-scale feature representation, and PCA and whitening. Through extensive experiments, they analyze the impact of each factor on retrieval performance and propose a new multi-scale image representation method that outperforms state-of-the-art methods on four benchmark datasets.
