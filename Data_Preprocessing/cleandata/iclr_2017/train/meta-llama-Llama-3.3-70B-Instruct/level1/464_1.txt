Summary
The paper proposes a novel approach to learning tree-structured neural networks for computing representations of natural language sentences using reinforcement learning. The model learns to construct trees that optimize performance on a downstream task, without relying on explicit treebank annotations or predefined structures. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on four tasks: sentiment analysis, semantic relatedness, natural language inference, and sentence generation, outperforming models with predefined structures.
Decision
I decide to Accept this paper, with two key reasons: (1) the paper tackles a specific and important problem in natural language processing, and (2) the approach is well-motivated and supported by empirical results.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a clear and well-structured presentation of the problem, related work, and the proposed approach. The authors motivate their approach by highlighting the limitations of existing methods that rely on predefined structures or explicit treebank annotations. The empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, with significant improvements over baseline models on all four tasks. The authors also provide a thorough analysis of the induced trees, showing that they incorporate linguistically intuitive structures while being different from conventional English syntactic structures.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the training time and computational resources required for their model, as well as explore ways to reduce the training time. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more examples of the induced trees and a more in-depth analysis of the structures learned by the model. The authors may also consider comparing their approach to other reinforcement learning-based methods for natural language processing tasks.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
1. Can you provide more details on the policy network architecture and the hyperparameters used for the reinforcement learning algorithm?
2. How do you handle out-of-vocabulary words and rare words in the input sentences?
3. Can you provide more examples of the induced trees and discuss the implications of the learned structures for natural language understanding and generation tasks?
