Summary of the Paper's Claims and Contributions
The paper introduces Deep Variational Bayes Filters (DVBF), a novel method for unsupervised learning and identification of latent Markovian state space models. DVBF leverages stochastic gradient variational Bayes to overcome intractable inference distributions, enabling it to handle highly nonlinear input data with temporal and spatial dependencies. The authors claim that DVBF can learn latent state-space models that enforce state-space assumptions, allowing for reliable system identification and plausible long-term prediction of observable systems. They also demonstrate that DVBF can scale to large data sets and perform well on various vision-based experiments.
Decision and Key Reasons
Based on the review, I decide to Accept this paper. The key reasons for this decision are:
1. The paper tackles a specific and well-motivated problem in the field of probabilistic modeling and filtering of dynamical systems.
2. The approach is well-placed in the literature, building upon recent advances in stochastic gradient variational Bayes and addressing the limitations of existing methods.
3. The paper provides a clear and detailed explanation of the proposed method, including the underlying graphical model, inference procedure, and lower bound objective function.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a thorough introduction to the problem of estimating probabilistic models for sequential data and the challenges associated with it. The authors clearly motivate the need for a new approach that can handle highly nonlinear input data and provide a detailed explanation of the proposed method. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of DVBF in learning latent state-space models that can identify underlying physical quantities and generate stable long-term predictions.
Additional Feedback and Questions
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors:
1. Provide more intuition about the reparametrization trick used in the transition model and its implications for the learning process.
2. Discuss the potential limitations of the proposed method, such as the assumption of a Markovian transition model and the requirement for a sufficient amount of training data.
3. Consider providing more visualizations of the learned latent spaces and the corresponding generative samples to help illustrate the performance of the method.
Some questions I would like the authors to address are:
1. How does the choice of the transition prior affect the performance of the method, and are there any guidelines for selecting an appropriate prior?
2. Can the authors provide more details about the implementation of the recognition model and the transition network, such as the specific architectures used and the hyperparameters selected?
3. How does the method perform on more complex systems with higher-dimensional state spaces, and are there any plans to extend the method to handle such cases?
