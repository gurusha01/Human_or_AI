Summary
The paper proposes an LSTM-based meta-learner model to learn the optimization algorithm for training a neural network classifier in the few-shot learning regime. The model learns to update the classifier's parameters based on the gradient and loss information, and also learns a general initialization for the classifier that allows for quick convergence. The authors demonstrate that their approach is competitive with state-of-the-art deep metric-learning techniques for few-shot learning.
Decision
I decide to Accept this paper, with the main reason being that the approach is well-motivated and supported by experimental results. The paper tackles a specific and important problem in few-shot learning, and the proposed solution is novel and interesting.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a clear and well-structured introduction to the problem of few-shot learning and the limitations of traditional gradient-based optimization methods. The authors also provide a thorough review of related work in meta-learning and few-shot learning. The proposed LSTM-based meta-learner model is well-described, and the experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness in few-shot learning tasks. The authors also provide a visualization of the optimization strategy learned by the meta-learner, which provides insight into its behavior.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the hyperparameter selection process for the meta-learner model, and also explore the use of other optimization algorithms, such as Adam or RMSProp, in the meta-learner. Additionally, it would be interesting to see an analysis of the learned initialization and update rules for the classifier, to gain a deeper understanding of how the meta-learner works.
Questions for the Authors
I would like to ask the authors to clarify the following points:
* How did the authors select the hyperparameters for the meta-learner model, such as the number of layers and the learning rate?
* Can the authors provide more insight into the learned optimization strategy, such as the values of the input and forget gates, and how they change over time?
* How does the meta-learner model perform on tasks with a larger number of classes or examples, and are there any plans to extend the approach to more challenging scenarios?
