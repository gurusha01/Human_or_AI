Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper proposes a novel approach to variational inference, introducing a flexible and efficient prior distribution that can capture complex, multi-modal aspects of data distributions. The authors develop the multi-modal variational encoder-decoder framework, which is applied to document modeling and dialogue modeling tasks. The framework uses a piecewise constant prior distribution, allowing the model to learn richer structure from data and achieve state-of-the-art results on several document modeling tasks.
