Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper provides a significant contribution to the field of deep learning by offering the first convergence guarantee applicable to modern convolutional neural networks (convnets). The authors introduce the neural Taylor approximation, a straightforward application of Taylor expansions to neural networks, and the associated Taylor loss. This allows them to analyze the dynamics of neural optimization and provide a convergence guarantee that matches a lower bound for convex nonsmooth functions. The paper also investigates the success of adaptive optimizers in rectifier nets, attributing it to their ability to explore the space of activation configurations more thoroughly.
Decision
Based on the review, I decide to Accept this paper. The key reasons for this choice are:
1. The paper tackles a specific and important problem in the field of deep learning, providing a convergence guarantee for modern convnets.
2. The approach is well-motivated, building on existing techniques from convex optimization and providing a clear and concise analysis of the neural Taylor approximation and its properties.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a thorough analysis of the neural Taylor approximation and its application to modern convnets. The authors demonstrate that the Taylor loss is a convex approximation to the loss of the network, allowing them to provide a convergence guarantee using techniques from online convex optimization. The empirical analysis in Section 2.3 provides strong evidence for the accuracy of the theoretical analysis, showing that the regret matches the theoretical bound under a wide range of settings. The investigation of adaptive optimizers in Section 3 provides additional insights into their success, highlighting the importance of exploration in the space of activation configurations.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors consider providing more detailed comparisons with existing work on convergence guarantees for neural networks. Additionally, it would be helpful to include more discussion on the implications of the results for practical deep learning applications. The authors may also want to consider exploring the relationship between the neural Taylor approximation and other techniques for analyzing neural networks, such as neural tangent kernels.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to address the following questions:
1. Can you provide more intuition on why the neural Taylor approximation is a good approximation to the loss of the network?
2. How do the results in this paper relate to existing work on convergence guarantees for neural networks?
3. Can you provide more discussion on the implications of the results for practical deep learning applications, such as image classification or natural language processing?
