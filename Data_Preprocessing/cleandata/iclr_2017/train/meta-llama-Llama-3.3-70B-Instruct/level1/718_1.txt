Summary
The paper proposes a novel multiagent system framework that reinterprets deep networks, specifically Stacked Denoising Autoencoders (SDAEs), without the traditional layer structure and matrix-vector scheme. The authors demonstrate the equivalence of their multiagent SDAE with the standard SDAE, both theoretically and empirically, and introduce a variant called Sparse Connect SDAE, which shows computational advantages.
Decision
I decide to Accept this paper, with two key reasons: (1) the paper tackles a specific and interesting problem of reinterpreting deep networks as multiagent systems, and (2) the authors provide a thorough theoretical and empirical analysis of their proposed framework.
Supporting Arguments
The paper is well-motivated, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the limitations of traditional deep network architectures. The proposed multiagent system framework is well-defined, and the authors demonstrate its equivalence with the standard SDAE. The introduction of Sparse Connect SDAE is a nice extension of the framework, and the experimental results show promising computational advantages.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest the authors consider the following points:
* Provide more discussion on the potential applications of the proposed framework, beyond the SDAE example.
* Investigate the scalability of the framework to more complex deep network architectures.
* Consider comparing the performance of the Sparse Connect SDAE with other sparse neural network models.
* Provide more details on the implementation of the multiagent system, such as the communication protocol between agents.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
* Can you provide more intuition on why the multiagent system framework is more biologically plausible than traditional deep network architectures?
* How do you plan to extend the framework to more complex deep network architectures, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or recurrent neural networks (RNNs)?
* Can you provide more details on the computational advantages of the Sparse Connect SDAE, such as the reduction in computational time or memory usage?
