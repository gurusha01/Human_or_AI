Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper proposes a novel volatility model, called Neural Stochastic Volatility Model (NSVM), which integrates statistical models with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to estimate and forecast volatility in financial time series. The model consists of a pair of complementary stochastic neural networks: a generative network that models the joint distribution of the stochastic volatility process, and an inference network that approximates the conditional distribution of the latent variables given the observable ones. The authors demonstrate that NSVM outperforms standard econometric models, such as GARCH, EGARCH, and GJR-GARCH, as well as a MCMC-based model and a Gaussian processes-based model, on both synthetic and real-world financial data.
Decision and Reasons
Based on the review, I decide to Accept the paper. The reasons for this decision are:
1. The paper tackles a specific and important problem in financial time series analysis, namely volatility estimation and forecasting.
2. The approach is well-motivated and placed in the literature, building on recent advances in variational inference and stochastic neural networks.
3. The paper provides a clear and detailed derivation of the NSVM model, including the generative and inference networks, and demonstrates its effectiveness on various metrics, including negative log-likelihood, mean-squared error, and smoothness of fit.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a thorough introduction to the problem of volatility estimation and forecasting, highlighting the limitations of traditional econometric models and the potential benefits of using neural networks. The authors also provide a clear and detailed explanation of the NSVM model, including the architecture of the generative and inference networks, and the variational inference procedure used to learn the model parameters. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of NSVM on both synthetic and real-world financial data, including a comparison with several baseline models.
Additional Feedback and Questions
To further improve the paper, I would like to see:
* More discussion on the interpretability of the NSVM model, including the role of the latent variables and the implications of the model's parameters.
* Additional experiments on multivariate time series data, to demonstrate the scalability and flexibility of the NSVM model.
* A more detailed comparison with other deep learning-based models for volatility estimation and forecasting, such as those using convolutional neural networks or long short-term memory (LSTM) networks.
Some questions I would like the authors to address are:
* How do the authors plan to extend the NSVM model to handle non-stationary time series data, where the volatility process may change over time?
* Can the NSVM model be used for other applications, such as signal processing or denoising, and if so, how would the model need to be modified?
* How do the authors plan to address the potential issue of overfitting, given the complexity of the NSVM model and the limited amount of training data available in some cases?
