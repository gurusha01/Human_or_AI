Summary
The paper proposes a novel architecture, called neural equivalence networks (EQNETs), for learning continuous semantic representations of mathematical and logical expressions. The goal is to assign continuous vectors to symbolic expressions such that semantically equivalent but syntactically diverse expressions are mapped to identical or highly similar vectors. The authors evaluate EQNETs on a diverse class of symbolic algebraic and boolean expression types and demonstrate significant outperformance compared to existing architectures.
Decision
I decide to Accept this paper with two key reasons: (1) the paper tackles a fundamental problem in machine learning and artificial intelligence, and (2) the proposed approach is well-motivated and supported by extensive experimental evaluations.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a clear and well-structured introduction to the problem of representing and inferring procedural knowledge, highlighting the limitations of existing approaches. The proposed EQNET architecture is well-motivated, and the use of subexpression forcing and output normalization is justified through extensive ablation studies. The experimental evaluation is thorough, covering various datasets and baselines, and demonstrating the effectiveness of EQNETs in learning compositional representations.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest the authors provide more insights into the interpretability of the learned representations and explore potential applications of EQNETs in downstream tasks, such as automated theorem proving or program synthesis. Additionally, it would be interesting to investigate the scalability of EQNETs to more complex expression types and larger datasets.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
1. Can you provide more details on the computational complexity of EQNETs and how they scale to larger expression types and datasets?
2. How do you plan to extend EQNETs to handle more complex procedural knowledge, such as recursive functions or loops?
3. Can you discuss potential applications of EQNETs in areas like automated reasoning, program synthesis, or natural language processing?
