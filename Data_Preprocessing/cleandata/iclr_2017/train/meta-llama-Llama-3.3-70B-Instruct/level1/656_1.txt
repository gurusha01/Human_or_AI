Summary
This paper proposes a novel deep hybrid architecture that combines scattering networks with convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The authors demonstrate that this architecture achieves state-of-the-art results on several benchmark datasets, including CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and STL10. The scattering network is used as a generic and fixed initialization of the first layers of the deep network, while the remaining layers are learned in a supervised manner. The authors also show that the learned operators explicitly build invariances to geometrical variabilities, such as local rotation and translation.
Decision
I decide to Accept this paper, with two key reasons for this choice:
1. The paper tackles a specific and well-motivated question: can a scattering network replace the first layers of a deep network, and what are the benefits of this approach?
2. The paper provides strong empirical evidence to support its claims, including numerical experiments on several benchmark datasets and a detailed analysis of the learned operators.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a clear and well-motivated introduction to the problem of deep network design, and explains how the proposed architecture addresses the limitations of existing approaches. The authors also provide a detailed description of the scattering network and its properties, including its stability and covariance with respect to geometric transformations. The experimental results are thorough and well-presented, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed architecture on several benchmark datasets.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more insight into the interpretation of the learned operators and their relationship to the scattering network. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more experiments on larger datasets, such as ImageNet, to further demonstrate the scalability of the proposed architecture. Finally, the authors may want to consider providing more details on the implementation of the ScatWave software and its potential applications in other domains.
Questions for the Authors
1. Can you provide more insight into the relationship between the learned operators and the scattering network, and how they interact to produce the final representation?
2. How do you plan to extend the proposed architecture to larger datasets, such as ImageNet, and what challenges do you anticipate in doing so?
3. Can you provide more details on the potential applications of the ScatWave software in other domains, such as medical imaging or natural language processing?
