Summary
The paper proposes a novel approach to accelerate the training of deep neural networks by learning the weight evolution pattern from a simple network and utilizing it to update the weights of other networks. The authors introduce an "introspection network" that predicts the future values of weights based on their past values, allowing for faster convergence. The method is tested on various networks and datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet, and demonstrates significant reductions in training time.
Decision
I decide to Accept this paper, with two key reasons: (1) the approach is well-motivated and grounded in the literature, and (2) the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the method in accelerating training times.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a clear and concise introduction to the problem of slow training times in deep neural networks and motivates the need for a new approach. The authors provide a thorough review of related work, highlighting the limitations of existing methods and the novelty of their approach. The experimental results are extensive and demonstrate the effectiveness of the introspection network in accelerating training times across various networks and datasets.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest the authors provide more insight into the choice of hyperparameters, such as the number of layers and units in the introspection network, and the selection of jump points. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more analysis on the generalization capacity of the introspection network to other tasks and datasets. Some questions I would like the authors to address include: (1) How does the introspection network perform on tasks with different optimization landscapes, such as those with multiple local minima? (2) Can the introspection network be used to accelerate training in other domains, such as natural language processing or reinforcement learning? (3) How does the introspection network compare to other methods, such as transfer learning or meta-learning, in terms of its ability to generalize to new tasks and datasets?
