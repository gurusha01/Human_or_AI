Summary of the Paper's Claims and Contributions
The paper proposes a reparameterization of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks that incorporates batch normalization, which has been shown to be beneficial in feed-forward neural networks. The authors demonstrate that batch-normalizing the hidden states of recurrent neural networks can improve optimization and generalization performance on various tasks, including sequence classification, language modeling, and question answering. The paper also provides an analysis of the importance of proper initialization of batch normalization parameters and presents experiments on several benchmark tasks.
Decision and Key Reasons
Based on the review, I decide to Accept the paper. The two key reasons for this decision are:
1. The paper tackles a specific and well-motivated problem in the context of recurrent neural networks, which is the reduction of internal covariate shift between time steps.
2. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the benefits of batch normalization in recurrent neural networks, including empirical results on several benchmark tasks, which demonstrate the effectiveness of their proposed approach.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a clear and well-structured presentation of the proposed approach, including a detailed analysis of the benefits of batch normalization in recurrent neural networks. The authors also provide a thorough evaluation of their approach on several benchmark tasks, which demonstrates its effectiveness in improving optimization and generalization performance. Additionally, the paper provides a detailed analysis of the importance of proper initialization of batch normalization parameters, which is a crucial aspect of the proposed approach.
Additional Feedback and Suggestions
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more detailed information about the hyperparameter searches performed for each experiment. Additionally, it would be helpful to include more visualizations of the results, such as plots of the learning curves and histograms of the activations, to provide a better understanding of the benefits of the proposed approach.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like to ask the authors the following questions:
1. Can you provide more details about the initialization of the batch normalization parameters, and how this affects the performance of the proposed approach?
2. How do the authors plan to address the issue of exploding gradients in the context of batch normalization, particularly in the case of very deep recurrent neural networks?
3. Can you provide more information about the computational cost of the proposed approach, and how it compares to other methods for reducing internal covariate shift in recurrent neural networks?
