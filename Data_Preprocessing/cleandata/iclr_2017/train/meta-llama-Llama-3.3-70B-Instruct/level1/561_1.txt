Summary
The paper proposes a novel approach to constructing a phylogenetic tree, also known as the tree of life, using the deep representation of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained for image classification. The authors leverage the idea that species with similar visual features will have high cross-activations in the softmax layer of a CNN, and use this information to build a distance matrix and construct a tree of life. The paper presents experiments on various species, including fish, canine, and vehicle categories, and demonstrates that the proposed method can build trees that are competitive with human-constructed trees based on visual similarity.
Decision
I decide to accept this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the paper tackles a specific and interesting problem in evolutionary biology, and proposes a well-motivated approach that leverages the strengths of deep learning techniques. Secondly, the paper presents a range of experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, including comparisons with human-constructed trees and other baseline methods.
Supporting Arguments
The paper is well-placed in the literature, drawing on recent advances in deep learning and computer vision to address a long-standing problem in evolutionary biology. The authors provide a clear and concise overview of the background and motivation for the work, and the proposed method is well-described and easy to follow. The experiments are thorough and well-designed, and the results are presented in a clear and intuitive manner. The paper also provides a range of additional insights and analyses, including comparisons with other methods and discussions of the limitations and potential extensions of the work.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I would suggest that the authors consider providing more detailed information about the specific CNN architectures and training procedures used in the experiments. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more analysis of the types of features that are being learned by the CNNs, and how these features relate to the visual similarities and differences between species. Finally, the authors may want to consider exploring other potential applications of the proposed method, such as using it to identify new species or to study the evolution of specific traits or characteristics.
Questions for the Authors
I would like to ask the authors to clarify a few points in the paper. Firstly, can you provide more information about how the distance matrix is constructed, and how the different methods (e.g. ACP, MST, MDS) are used to build the tree of life? Secondly, how do you handle cases where the CNNs are not able to learn effective features for a particular species or group of species? Finally, have you considered using other types of deep learning models, such as recurrent neural networks or generative adversarial networks, to build the tree of life?
