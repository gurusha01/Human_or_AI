Summary
The paper explores the ability of neural networks to learn cryptographic techniques, specifically encryption and decryption, without being explicitly taught specific algorithms. The authors propose a framework where neural networks, representing Alice, Bob, and Eve, are trained adversarially to achieve confidentiality goals. The results demonstrate that neural networks can learn to protect communications and even apply encryption selectively to meet specific confidentiality objectives.
Decision
I decide to Accept this paper, with two key reasons: (1) the paper tackles a novel and intriguing question about the capabilities of neural networks in learning cryptographic techniques, and (2) the approach is well-motivated and grounded in the literature, with a clear explanation of the objectives and training procedures.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a thorough explanation of the problem, the approach, and the results. The authors demonstrate that neural networks can learn to encrypt and decrypt messages, and even apply encryption selectively to protect specific information. The use of adversarial training and the "mix & transform" architecture are well-justified and contribute to the success of the approach. The results are also supported by experiments, which show that the trained neural networks can achieve robust encryption and decryption.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more analysis on the learned encryption methods and their relation to traditional cryptographic techniques. Additionally, it would be interesting to explore the limitations and potential vulnerabilities of the learned encryption methods. The authors may also consider providing more details on the training procedures and the hyperparameters used in the experiments.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
1. Can you provide more insight into the learned encryption methods and how they relate to traditional cryptographic techniques?
2. How do you plan to address potential vulnerabilities in the learned encryption methods, and what are the implications for their use in practice?
3. Can you provide more details on the training procedures and the hyperparameters used in the experiments, and how they were chosen?
