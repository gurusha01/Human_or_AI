The paper proposes a novel framework called Generative Multi-Adversarial Network (GMAN), which extends the traditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to multiple discriminators. The authors argue that this extension allows for more robust training of the generator and improves the quality of the generated samples. The paper provides a thorough analysis of the GMAN framework, including its theoretical foundations, design perspectives, and experimental evaluations.
I decide to accept this paper with the following key reasons: 
1. The paper tackles a specific and well-defined problem in the field of GANs, which is the difficulty of training GANs with a single discriminator.
2. The approach is well-motivated and grounded in the literature, with a clear explanation of the limitations of traditional GANs and the potential benefits of using multiple discriminators.
The paper provides a comprehensive evaluation of the GMAN framework, including experiments on various image generation tasks, such as MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CelebA. The results demonstrate that GMAN outperforms traditional GANs in terms of convergence speed and sample quality. The authors also introduce a new metric, called Generative Multi-Adversarial Metric (GMAM), to evaluate the performance of GMAN.
To further improve the paper, I suggest the authors provide more details on the implementation of the GMAN framework, including the architecture of the generator and discriminator networks, and the hyperparameter settings used in the experiments. Additionally, it would be helpful to include more visualizations of the generated samples to better illustrate the quality of the results.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper include: 
1. How do the authors ensure that the multiple discriminators are diverse and do not collapse to a single solution?
2. Can the authors provide more insights into the choice of the softmax function and its hyperparameters in the GMAN framework?
3. How does the GMAN framework perform on more complex image generation tasks, such as ImageNet or COCO? 
Overall, the paper presents a well-motivated and well-executed extension of the traditional GAN framework, with promising results on various image generation tasks. With some additional details and clarifications, the paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of generative models.
