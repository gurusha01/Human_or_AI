The paper proposes a novel approach to training undirected graphical models with latent variables, called Variational Walkback. This method tackles the problem of maximum likelihood training, which requires sampling from Monte-Carlo Markov chains that may not mix well. The authors introduce a variational bound on the marginal log-likelihood of the data, which corresponds to a new learning procedure that involves walking away from data points by following the model's transition operator and then training the operator to walk backwards towards the data.
I decide to Accept this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the approach is well-motivated and placed in the literature, building upon previous work on contrastive divergence, denoising autoencoders, and generative stochastic networks. The authors provide a clear explanation of the limitations of existing methods and how their approach addresses these limitations. Secondly, the paper provides a sound theoretical foundation for the proposed method, including a variational bound on the marginal log-likelihood and a clear explanation of the training procedure.
The supporting arguments for my decision include the fact that the authors provide a series of experimental results on several datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CelebA, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Additionally, the paper provides a detailed analysis of the related work, including a comparison with other methods such as contrastive divergence and generative stochastic networks.
To improve the paper, I would suggest that the authors provide more details on the implementation of the Variational Walkback algorithm, including the choice of hyperparameters and the architecture of the transition operator. Additionally, it would be helpful to include more visualizations of the results, such as samples generated by the model and plots of the walkback chain.
I have several questions that I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper. Firstly, can the authors provide more details on how the temperature schedule is chosen and how it affects the performance of the model? Secondly, how does the choice of the transition operator affect the performance of the model, and are there any specific design considerations that need to be taken into account? Finally, can the authors provide more details on how the Variational Walkback algorithm can be extended to incorporate latent variables, and what are the potential benefits and challenges of doing so?
