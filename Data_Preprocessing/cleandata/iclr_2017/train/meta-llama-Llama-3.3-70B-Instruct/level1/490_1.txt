Summary
The paper introduces the pointer sentinel mixture architecture for neural sequence models, which combines the advantages of standard softmax classifiers with those of a pointer component. This architecture allows the model to either reproduce a word from the recent context or produce a word from a standard softmax classifier. The authors apply this model to the LSTM and achieve state-of-the-art results on the Penn Treebank dataset while using fewer parameters than other models with comparable performance. Additionally, the authors introduce a new benchmark dataset for language modeling called WikiText, which allows for the evaluation of longer-term dependencies and more realistic vocabularies.
Decision
I decide to Accept this paper with two key reasons: (1) the paper tackles a specific and important problem in language modeling, namely the prediction of rare or unseen words, and (2) the approach is well-motivated and supported by empirical results.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a clear and well-motivated introduction to the problem of language modeling and the limitations of current approaches. The authors also provide a thorough analysis of the related work and demonstrate how their approach improves upon existing models. The empirical results on the Penn Treebank dataset and the new WikiText dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the pointer sentinel mixture model. Furthermore, the authors provide a detailed analysis of the impact of the pointer component on rare words and the qualitative analysis of pointer usage provides insights into how the model works.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the hyperparameter tuning process and the sensitivity of the model to different hyperparameters. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more comparisons with other state-of-the-art models on the WikiText dataset. Finally, the authors may want to consider providing more insights into the potential applications of the pointer sentinel mixture model beyond language modeling.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
* Can you provide more details on how the sentinel value is computed and how it affects the gating function?
* How do you handle out-of-vocabulary words in the pointer component, and what is the impact on the model's performance?
* Can you provide more insights into the trade-offs between the pointer component and the softmax component, and how the model decides when to use each component?
