This paper proposes a novel approach, called Diet Networks, to tackle the problem of high-dimensional input data in deep learning, particularly in the context of genomic data. The authors claim that their method can significantly reduce the number of free parameters in the model, leading to better generalization and reduced overfitting.
I decide to Accept this paper, with the main reason being that the approach is well-motivated and supported by experimental results. The authors provide a clear explanation of the problem and the proposed solution, and the results show that the Diet Networks approach can achieve better performance than traditional methods, such as principal component analysis (PCA).
The supporting arguments for this decision are as follows. Firstly, the authors provide a thorough analysis of the problem of high-dimensional input data and its challenges in deep learning. They also provide a clear explanation of the proposed Diet Networks approach and its advantages over traditional methods. Secondly, the experimental results show that the Diet Networks approach can achieve better performance than traditional methods, such as PCA, in terms of misclassification error and robustness to variations in the learned feature embedding.
To further improve the paper, I would suggest that the authors provide more details on the computational complexity of the Diet Networks approach and its scalability to larger datasets. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more comparisons with other deep learning methods, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), to further demonstrate the advantages of the Diet Networks approach.
I would like to ask the authors to clarify the following points: (1) How do the authors plan to extend the Diet Networks approach to other domains, such as image and speech recognition, where high-dimensional input data is also a challenge? (2) Can the authors provide more insights into the choice of feature embeddings and their impact on the performance of the Diet Networks approach? (3) How do the authors plan to address the issue of interpretability of the Diet Networks approach, given the complexity of the model and the high-dimensional input data?
