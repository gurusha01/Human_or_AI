Summary
The paper proposes a novel approach to sequence learning, called Incremental Sequence Learning (ISL), which involves gradually increasing the length of sequences used for training as the network learns to predict the early parts of the sequences. The authors evaluate ISL on a new dataset, MNIST pen stroke sequences, and demonstrate that it significantly improves sequence learning performance, reducing the test error by 74% and achieving a 20-fold speedup in computation time compared to regular sequence learning. The authors also analyze the origins of the performance improvement and show that it is due to the ability of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to build up internal representations of the sequences.
Decision
I decide to Accept this paper, with two key reasons: (1) the paper tackles a specific and well-motivated problem in sequence learning, and (2) the approach is well-supported by empirical results and analysis.
Supporting Arguments
The paper is well-motivated, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the problem and the proposed approach. The experimental results are thorough and demonstrate the effectiveness of ISL on the MNIST pen stroke sequences dataset. The analysis of the origins of the performance improvement is also convincing, and the authors provide evidence that the improvement is due to the ability of RNNs to build up internal representations of the sequences.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors consider providing more details on the construction of the MNIST pen stroke sequences dataset and the preprocessing steps involved. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more examples of the generated sequences and a more detailed analysis of the network's behavior during sequence classification. The authors may also want to consider comparing ISL to other curriculum learning approaches and evaluating its performance on other sequence learning tasks.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
1. Can you provide more details on the construction of the MNIST pen stroke sequences dataset, including the thresholding and thinning steps?
2. How did you choose the hyperparameters for the ISL approach, such as the initial sequence length and the threshold value for increasing the sequence length?
3. Can you provide more examples of the generated sequences and a more detailed analysis of the network's behavior during sequence classification?
