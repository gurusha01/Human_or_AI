Summary of the Paper
The paper proposes a framework for analyzing and comparing sentence embeddings by designing auxiliary prediction tasks that measure the extent to which different sentence representations capture low-level properties of sentences, such as length, word content, and word order. The authors evaluate several sentence representation methods, including continuous bag-of-words (CBOW) and encoder-decoder models, and demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach in shedding light on the strengths and weaknesses of different sentence embedding methods.
Decision
I decide to Accept this paper, with the main reasons being that the approach is well-motivated and well-placed in the literature, and the paper supports its claims with thorough experiments and analysis.
Supporting Arguments
The paper tackles a specific and important question in the field of natural language processing, namely, understanding the properties encoded in sentence representations. The approach is well-motivated, as it addresses the limitations of existing methods for comparing sentence embeddings, which often rely on coarse-grained evaluations on downstream tasks. The paper is also well-placed in the literature, as it builds on existing work on sentence embeddings and provides a novel perspective on the problem. The experiments and analysis are thorough and well-designed, providing insights into the strengths and weaknesses of different sentence representation methods.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors consider the following points:
* Provide more discussion on the implications of the findings for downstream tasks, such as sentiment analysis or question answering.
* Consider evaluating the sentence representation methods on a wider range of tasks and datasets to increase the generality of the results.
* Provide more details on the experimental setup, such as the hyperparameters used for training the models and the specific datasets used for evaluation.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
* Can you provide more intuition on why the CBOW model performs well on the length task, despite not encoding word order information?
* How do you think the results would change if the sentence representation methods were evaluated on a different set of tasks, such as semantic role labeling or coreference resolution?
* Can you provide more details on the significance tests used to evaluate the results, and how they were used to determine the statistical significance of the findings?
