Summary
The paper presents an efficient analog of the universal approximation theorem for neural networks on the boolean hypercube. It proves that any noise-stable boolean function can be well-approximated by a two-layer linear threshold circuit with a small number of hidden-layer nodes and small weights, independent of the input size. The paper also provides a polynomial-time learning algorithm that outputs a small two-layer linear threshold circuit approximating a given noise-stable boolean function.
Decision
I decide to Accept this paper, with the main reason being that the approach is well-motivated and well-placed in the literature. The paper provides a clear and concise introduction to the problem, and the results are supported by rigorous proofs.
Supporting Arguments
The paper tackles a specific question/problem, which is to understand why neural networks can efficiently simulate many natural concepts. The approach is well-motivated, as it combines techniques from Fourier analysis over the boolean hypercube and size-weight-depth trade-off results on linear threshold circuits from circuit complexity. The results are supported by correct and scientifically rigorous proofs, including Theorems 1, 2, and 3.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, I suggest providing more intuition behind the definition of noise-stability and its relation to the number of relevant attributes. Additionally, it would be helpful to include more examples or applications of the results to illustrate their practical significance. Furthermore, the paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the obstacles to improvements and potential future directions.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
1. Can you provide more insight into the choice of the noise-stability parameter and its effect on the number of hidden-layer nodes and weights?
2. How do the results generalize to continuous domains, and what are the potential challenges in extending the Bourgain-type theorem to these settings?
3. Are there any potential applications of the results to other areas of machine learning or artificial intelligence, such as computer vision or natural language processing?
