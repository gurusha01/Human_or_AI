Summary: The paper presents the Neural Physics Engine (NPE), a framework for learning simulators of intuitive physics that generalize across variable object count and different scene configurations. The NPE combines the strengths of symbolic physics engines and neural networks, using a factorized representation of physical scenes and a neural network architecture that models pairwise interactions between objects. The authors evaluate the NPE on simple rigid body dynamics in two-dimensional worlds and demonstrate its ability to predict movement, generalize across variable object count and scene configurations, and infer latent properties of objects such as mass.
Decision: Accept
Reasons: The paper tackles a specific and well-defined problem in the field of artificial intelligence, namely learning a physics simulator that can generalize across different scenarios. The approach is well-motivated and builds on existing work in the field, combining the strengths of symbolic and neural network-based approaches. The paper provides a clear and detailed explanation of the NPE framework and its components, and the experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach.
Supporting arguments: The paper provides a thorough analysis of the NPE's performance on various tasks, including prediction, generalization, and inference. The results show that the NPE outperforms several baseline models, including a No-Pairwise model and an LSTM model, and that it can generalize to previously unseen scenarios and infer latent properties of objects. The paper also provides a detailed discussion of the NPE's architecture and its components, including the factorized representation of physical scenes and the neural network architecture that models pairwise interactions between objects.
Additional feedback: To further improve the paper, it would be helpful to provide more details on the training procedure and the hyperparameters used to train the NPE. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more examples of the NPE's performance on more complex scenarios, such as 3D worlds or scenarios with multiple types of objects. The paper could also benefit from a more detailed discussion of the potential applications of the NPE, such as model-based planning and reinforcement learning.
Questions for the authors: Can you provide more details on the training procedure and the hyperparameters used to train the NPE? How do you plan to extend the NPE to more complex scenarios, such as 3D worlds or scenarios with multiple types of objects? What are the potential applications of the NPE, and how do you see it being used in practice?
