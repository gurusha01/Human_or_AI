This paper proposes a novel approach to attention mechanisms in deep neural networks, introducing structured attention networks that incorporate graphical models to generalize simple attention. The authors tackle the specific question of how to model richer structural dependencies within attention mechanisms, which is a well-motivated problem given the limitations of standard attention-based architectures.
The approach is well-placed in the literature, building upon existing work on attention networks, graphical models, and structured prediction. The authors provide a clear and concise overview of the background and related work, making it easy to understand the context and significance of their contribution.
The paper supports its claims through a series of experiments on various tasks, including tree transduction, neural machine translation, question answering, and natural language inference. The results demonstrate that structured attention networks can learn interesting structural properties and improve upon standard models. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the learned representations and attention distributions, which helps to understand the strengths and limitations of their approach.
One of the key strengths of this paper is its clarity and readability. The authors provide a thorough explanation of the technical machinery and computational techniques involved in implementing structured attention networks, making it accessible to a wide range of readers. The writing is concise and well-organized, with clear headings and sections that facilitate navigation.
To improve the paper, I would suggest providing more detailed comparisons with existing approaches, particularly in terms of computational efficiency and scalability. While the authors mention that structured attention networks can be slower to train than simple attention models, they do not provide a thorough analysis of the trade-offs between accuracy and computational cost. Additionally, it would be helpful to see more extensive evaluations on larger datasets and more challenging tasks, to further demonstrate the robustness and generalizability of the proposed approach.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper include:
* Can you provide more details on how the graphical models are parameterized and learned within the structured attention networks?
* How do the authors handle cases where the structural dependencies are not clearly defined or are highly ambiguous?
* Are there any plans to extend the proposed approach to other domains or tasks, such as computer vision or speech recognition?
* How do the authors see the proposed approach relating to other recent advances in attention mechanisms, such as self-attention or hierarchical attention?
Overall, I believe that this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of natural language processing and attention mechanisms, and I would recommend it for acceptance. The proposed approach has the potential to improve upon existing models and provide new insights into the representation and processing of structural dependencies in language.
