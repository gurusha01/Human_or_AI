Summary
The paper explores the possibility of learning a static analyzer from data using deep learning techniques. The authors design a simple toy language and a corresponding static analysis task, which is to ensure that every variable is defined before it is used. They experiment with various machine learning methods, including feature engineering, hidden Markov models, recurrent neural networks, and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. The results show that LSTM networks achieve a high accuracy of 98.3% on the task, outperforming other approaches. The authors also demonstrate how to make the static analyzer useful by using a language model to help the programmer locate potential errors.
Decision
I decide to Accept this paper, with the main reason being that it presents a well-motivated and well-executed experiment that demonstrates the feasibility of learning a static analyzer from data using deep learning techniques. The paper is well-written, and the results are convincing, with a clear comparison to other approaches.
Supporting Arguments
The paper tackles a specific and well-defined problem, which is to learn a static analyzer for a simple toy language. The approach is well-motivated, as it addresses the limitations of traditional static analysis methods and explores the potential of deep learning techniques in this area. The authors provide a thorough comparison of different machine learning methods, which helps to establish the effectiveness of LSTM networks for this task. The use of a language model to help the programmer locate potential errors is also a nice touch, as it demonstrates the practical usefulness of the learned static analyzer.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I would suggest providing more details on the dataset generation process and the experimental setup. For example, how were the training and test sets split, and what were the hyperparameters used for the LSTM networks? Additionally, it would be interesting to see more examples of the language model's output and how it helps the programmer locate potential errors. Finally, the authors may want to consider discussing the potential limitations and challenges of applying this approach to more complex programming languages and larger codebases.
