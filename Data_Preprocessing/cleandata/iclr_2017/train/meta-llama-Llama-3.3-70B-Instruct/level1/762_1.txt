Summary
The paper presents a framework for investigating the ability of connectionist architectures to perceive visual details not explicitly present in the input. The authors propose a novel autoencoder-based approach, called Defoveating Autoencoders (DFAEs), which learns to reconstruct high-detail images from low-fidelity, distorted inputs. The framework is inspired by the human visual system's ability to perceive missing information and is designed to study the extent to which artificial neural networks can perform similar perceptual filling-in.
Decision
I decide to Accept this paper, with two key reasons for this choice: (1) the paper tackles a specific and well-motivated question, and (2) the approach is well-placed in the literature and supported by empirical results.
Supporting Arguments
The paper clearly articulates the problem of perceptual filling-in and its relevance to both engineering better networks and understanding the neural mechanisms of the human visual system. The authors provide a thorough review of related work, including denoising autoencoders, image super-resolution, and attention mechanisms. The proposed DFAE framework is well-designed, and the experiments demonstrate the ability of the network to perceive missing details, such as shape, color, and contrast, from low-fidelity inputs.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more detailed analysis of the learned features and their relationship to the input distortions. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more comparisons with other architectures, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and to explore the application of DFAEs to more complex tasks, such as image captioning or visual question answering.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
1. How do the learned features in the DFAE framework relate to the input distortions, and can you provide more visualizations of the features learned by the network?
2. Can you provide more details on the training procedure, including the optimization algorithm, learning rate, and batch size used in the experiments?
3. How do the results of the DFAE framework compare to other architectures, such as CNNs, in terms of perceptual filling-in and image reconstruction quality?
