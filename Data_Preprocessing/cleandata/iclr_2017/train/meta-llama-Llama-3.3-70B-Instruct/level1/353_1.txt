Summary of the Paper's Claims and Contributions
The paper introduces PixelVAE, a novel variational autoencoder (VAE) model that combines the strengths of VAEs and PixelCNNs. PixelVAE uses an autoregressive decoder based on PixelCNN, which allows it to capture small details in images while still learning a useful latent representation. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on binarized MNIST, competitive performance on 64 Ã— 64 ImageNet, and generates high-quality samples on the LSUN bedrooms dataset. The authors also extend PixelVAE to a hierarchical model with multiple stochastic layers and autoregressive decoders, which enables the model to capture large structures in images.
Decision and Key Reasons
Based on the review, I decide to Accept this paper. The two key reasons for this decision are:
1. The paper tackles a specific and well-motivated problem in the field of unsupervised learning, namely the challenge of modeling natural images using VAEs and PixelCNNs.
2. The approach is well-supported by empirical results, including state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets and high-quality samples generated by the model.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a clear and well-motivated introduction to the problem of natural image modeling, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of VAEs and PixelCNNs. The authors propose a novel solution, PixelVAE, which combines the benefits of both models. The empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of PixelVAE, including its ability to capture small details and learn useful latent representations. The extension of PixelVAE to a hierarchical model with multiple stochastic layers and autoregressive decoders is also well-motivated and supported by experimental results.
Additional Feedback and Questions
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the computational cost of training and sampling from PixelVAE, as well as its scalability to larger images. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more visualizations of the learned latent representations and their properties.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper are:
* How do the authors choose the number of autoregressive layers in the PixelVAE decoder, and what is the effect of varying this number on the model's performance?
* Can the authors provide more insights into the properties of the learned latent representations, such as their interpretability and disentanglement?
* How does PixelVAE compare to other state-of-the-art models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), in terms of sample quality and diversity?
