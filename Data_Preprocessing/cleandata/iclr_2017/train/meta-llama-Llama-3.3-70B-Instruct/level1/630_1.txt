The paper proposes two novel mechanisms to address the shortcomings of current encoder-decoder models in sequence-to-sequence prediction tasks, specifically in text summarization. The first contribution is a 'Read-Again' model that reads the input sequence twice, allowing the encoder to capture the meaning of each word in the context of the entire sentence. The second contribution is a copy mechanism that enables the decoder to handle out-of-vocabulary words by copying them from the input sequence, reducing the need for a large vocabulary size.
I decide to Accept this paper, with the primary reason being that the approach is well-motivated and supported by empirical results. The authors provide a clear explanation of the limitations of current encoder-decoder models and propose a simple yet effective solution. The experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the Gigaword and DUC2004 datasets.
The supporting arguments for this decision include the fact that the paper provides a thorough analysis of the related work, clearly positioning the proposed approach within the existing literature. The authors also provide a detailed description of the model architecture and the training procedure, making it easy to reproduce the results. Additionally, the paper includes a thorough evaluation of the proposed approach, including quantitative results and qualitative examples that demonstrate the effectiveness of the copy mechanism.
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more insight into the computational cost of the proposed approach, particularly in terms of the increased number of parameters and the computational requirements of the 'Read-Again' model. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more examples of the copy mechanism in action, particularly for rare words and phrases. Some questions I would like the authors to answer include: How do the authors plan to extend the proposed approach to handle longer input sequences and more complex summarization tasks? How does the 'Read-Again' model perform on other sequence-to-sequence tasks, such as machine translation? What are the potential applications of the proposed approach beyond text summarization?
