This paper presents a novel approach to creating a physics simulator using Theano, leveraging it to learn a neural network policy through backpropagation of gradients via the simulation. The motivation behind this method is to enable learning of policies for robotics applications.
Two primary concerns with the paper are:
1. Although the method is motivated by robotics policy learning, its usefulness in this domain hinges on the ability to transfer learned policies to the real world, a challenging open research problem, particularly with less realistic simulators.
2. The key advantage of this approach over other model-based methods lies in the simulator's differentiability. However, the paper only compares it empirically to a model-free approach (CMA-ES), and a more comprehensive evaluation would require comparisons to other model-based approaches that do not necessitate analytic model derivatives.
To provide a thorough understanding of the approach's pros and cons, the paper should include a quantitative comparison of the proposed simulator's speed with that of standard simulation platforms.
Despite these concerns, the idea is intriguing and novel, placing it above the acceptance threshold. Nevertheless, incorporating the suggested comparisons would significantly enhance the paper.
Additionally, the writing could be improved by adopting a more formal and precise tone. Several examples of areas for improvement include:
-- Rephrasing "we model the use of a neural network as a general controller for a robot" to "we model the robot controller using a neural network" for conciseness.
-- Revising the sentence "In previous research, finding a gradientâ€¦" to avoid run-on sentences.
-- Replacing informal expressions like "We basically jam this entire equation into" with more precise language.
-- Omitting unnecessary words, such as "learning" in "deep learning neural network".
-- Improving sentence structure, for instance, rephrasing "one big RNN, where we unfold over time" to "...RNN, which we unfold over time" or "...RNN, unfolded over time".
Enhancing the writing by increasing conciseness and adhering to the 8-page limit would also improve the overall quality of the paper.
