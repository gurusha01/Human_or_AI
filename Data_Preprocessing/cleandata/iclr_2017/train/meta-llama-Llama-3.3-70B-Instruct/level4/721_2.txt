This paper presents a novel approach to unsupervised learning by modifying sparse coding to explicitly model transformations, such as shifts and rotations, rather than relying on simple pooling as in traditional convnets. The authors demonstrate the algorithm's ability to learn features and their transformations from natural images, showcasing a comparison to traditional sparse coding that highlights the representation of images with fewer degrees of freedom.
Although this approach appears interesting and promising, the work seems to be in its initial stages, lacking a conclusive and impactful outcome. For instance, one of the motivations is to represent object pose alongside its identity, but the current work falls short of achieving this goal, leaving several key connections unestablished.
Several aspects of the paper require clarification:
* The central concept of utilizing a transformational sparse coding tree to facilitate the inference of Lie group parameters is not clearly explained. The statement "The main idea is to gradually marginalize over an increasing range of transformations" is suggestive but lacks clarity. A more detailed definition of marginalization in this context is necessary.
* The relationship between the Lie group operator, tree leaves, and weights is unclear. While the learning rule provides the gradient for the Lie group operator, its application to learning the tree leaves is not evident, leaving significant gaps in understanding.
* The statement "Averaging over many data points smoothens the surface of the error function" is puzzling, as each data point would likely have its own unique transformation.
* The training data and its generation process are not adequately described. It is unclear whether the data consists of patches with known transformations and whether the algorithm can recover these transformations.
The results presented in Figure 4 appear intriguing, but the lack of clarity in the preceding explanations makes it challenging to interpret and understand their significance.
I would recommend that the authors revise the paper to improve clarity and further develop these promising ideas, which have the potential to make a meaningful contribution to the field.
