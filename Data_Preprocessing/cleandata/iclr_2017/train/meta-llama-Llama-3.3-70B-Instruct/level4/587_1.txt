This paper proposes a key concept of substituting pooling layers with convolutions that have a stride of 2, followed by retraining the model. The authors integrate this approach into a novel layer, which they claim represents a new type of layer. However, this presentation is deceptive and introduces unnecessary complexity to the field. Moreover, utilizing strided convolutions instead of pooling layers is not a groundbreaking idea, as evidenced by existing work (e.g.
