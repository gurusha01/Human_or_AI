This study explores conditional image synthesis within the autoregressive framework, building upon PixelCNN by incorporating text, segmentation masks, and keypoints as conditioning variables. Experimental results are presented for keypoint conditional synthesis on the CUB and MHP datasets, as well as segmentation conditional synthesis on the MS-COCO dataset, highlighting the novel extension of PixelCNN to keypoint and segment conditioning. A qualitative comparison with GAN-based approaches for image synthesis is also provided.
Strengths:
(1) The research showcases the autoregressive framework's capability to generate images with additional conditional variables, demonstrating its potential to rival the capabilities of GANs in image generation.
(2) Figure 9 illustrates that PixelCNN and GAN-based methods may exhibit distinct error patterns, with PixelCNN appearing more resilient to artifact introduction.
(3) An effort is made to establish a quantitative evaluation framework using log-likelihoods, as presented in Table 1.
Weaknesses:
(1) The comparison with existing work is challenging and primarily relies on qualitative results, which can be somewhat ambiguous. Including supplementary materials or an appendix with extensive additional examples could help mitigate this issue.
(2) The adaptation of PixelCNN to accommodate additional conditioning data, although a notable engineering achievement, is a relatively straightforward extension and does not introduce a groundbreaking new concept.
