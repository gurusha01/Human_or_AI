This manuscript presents a novel approach to enabling variable computational complexity at each time step in Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), leveraging a clever and straightforward methodology. The proposed architecture appears to surpass traditional RNNs in various sequence modeling tasks, with visualizations illustrating the model's ability to dynamically allocate computational resources in accordance with the need to capture longer-term dependencies.
The model is extensively evaluated across multiple tasks, demonstrating consistent superiority over comparable architectures. Notably, certain tasks facilitate an intriguing analysis of the computational resources allocated at each time step, revealing the model's tendency to utilize more resources at the onset of each word or ASCII character. The investigation into the impact of imposing a computational budget assignment pattern, informed by prior task knowledge, is also commendable. Although the architecture's superior performance is impressive, concerns regarding the baseline models' hyperparameter tuning parity remain, which will be revisited in the subsequent paragraph as a clarity issue.
The abstract asserts the model's computational efficiency compared to regular RNNs; however, this claim lacks substantiation through wall time measurements. While the model theoretically offers computational savings, the paper's focus is more conceptual, emphasizing the model's capacity for resource allocation. This renders the paper intriguing in its own right, but the claims of computational gains are misleading without empirical support. Furthermore, the selection process for the hyperparameter \bar{m} is unclear, which is crucial in ensuring a fair comparison with RNNs lacking similar regularization controls, such as dropout or weight noise. Although not a critical flaw, given the architecture's impressive performance in allocating resources, the omission of such details is notable.
To the best of my knowledge, the proposed architecture is novel, with a distinctive method for determining computational complexity that sets it apart from other variable computation approaches. The paper's originality is a significant strength.
The potential practical applications of this variable computation method are uncertain, as they depend on the feasibility of achieving actual computational gains at the hardware level. Nevertheless, the architecture may prove useful in learning long-term dependencies, and the interpretability of the value m_t is a valuable property, offering insightful visualizations that could shed light on the challenges faced by RNNs in certain tasks.
Pros:
- Original and clever idea
- Interesting and informative visualizations
- Engaging experiments
Cons:
- Lack of clarity in certain experimental details
- Baseline strength is not convincingly established
- Claims of computational savings are unsubstantiated without wall-clock times
Edit:
I am positively impressed by the authors' comprehensive address of my primary concerns, which has led to an increase in my score. The addition of an LSTM baseline and results from a GRU version of the model significantly enhances the paper's empirical quality. The authors have also clarified key experimental details and committed to revising the paper to eliminate confusion regarding computational savings, acknowledging that these are conceptual rather than actual wall time savings. It is essential to note that my revised score pertains to an updated version of the paper, assuming the promised changes have been implemented.
Edit:
Upon learning of the significant difference between the model's performance and the state-of-the-art for certain tasks, I have reassessed my score. While I still consider the paper to be of good quality, its results no longer stand out as exceptional in light of this new information.
