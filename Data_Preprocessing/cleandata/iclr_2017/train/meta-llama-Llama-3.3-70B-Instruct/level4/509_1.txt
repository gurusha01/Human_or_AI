This manuscript introduces a novel methodology for rendering a Forth programming language interpreter differentiable, thereby enabling it to learn high-level instruction implementations from exemplar data. The paper's clarity and motivation are commendable, making for an engaging and intriguing read. Nevertheless, the experimental component primarily serves as a proof-of-concept, and more comprehensive empirical analyses would substantially enhance the manuscript's robustness.
Key observations include:
- The proposed methodology appears to be innovative, effectively bridging the gap between programming by example and programmer-provided sketches, while incorporating concepts from probabilistic programming and Neural Turing Machines in a distinct manner. Additionally, the interpreter is optimized for accelerated training.
- Further investigation into the application of this approach to diverse programming problems, as well as an assessment of the complexity of low-level code that can be generated, would provide valuable insights and warrant consideration for future studies.
