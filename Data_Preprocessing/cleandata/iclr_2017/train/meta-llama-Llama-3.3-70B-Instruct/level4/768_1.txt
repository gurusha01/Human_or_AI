This paper presents a novel approach to learning orthogonal feature groups in a convolutional neural network (convnet) by introducing a penalty term to minimize correlation among features within each group. The method is applied to image classification tasks with "privileged information" in the form of foreground segmentation masks, where the model learns orthogonal groups of foreground and background features using the correlation penalty and an additional "background suppression" term.
The strengths of this paper include:
* The introduction of a "group-wise model diversity" loss term, which is a new concept to my knowledge.
* The innovative use of foreground segmentation masks to enhance image classification performance.
* The evaluation of the method on two large-scale vision datasets, ImageNet and PASCAL VOC 2012.
However, there are some weaknesses:
* The evaluation is incomplete, as it lacks a baseline that isolates the effect of the background suppression term, making it difficult to determine its contribution to the overall performance.
* The use of the background suppression term is unclear, as it seems redundant with the group orthogonality term, which should already suppress the use of background features by the foreground feature extractor.
* It would be beneficial to see the results with "Incomplete Privileged Information" on the full ImageNet dataset, rather than just 10%, to verify the method's effectiveness in scenarios with more labeled classification data.
* The presentation is somewhat confusing and hard to follow, with sections that do not accurately reflect their content, such as Section 4.2.
* Minor issues include the unnecessary use of the term "regression loss" and the unconventional notation "||0 - x||" instead of "||x||", which can hinder understanding.
* Additionally, the labels in Figure 1 appear to be swapped, with the "suppress foreground" mask having 1s in the foreground and 0s in the background.
Furthermore, I have a question regarding the discrepancy in results between Table 4 and Tables 1-2, which seem to represent the same setting but yield different outcomes.
While the ideas presented in this paper show promise, they require further ablation to clarify the importance of each component. Additional experiments and revisions to improve clarity would strengthen the paper. 
After considering the revised results, including the full ImageNet evaluation in Table 5, which demonstrates the benefit of background segmentation "privileged information" even with the full labeled ImageNet dataset, I have upgraded my rating. However, I still suggest swapping the "0" and "1" labels in the top part of Figure 1 to maintain consistency with other labels.
