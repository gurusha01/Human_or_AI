This 18-page paper, accompanied by an appendix, presents a mathematical derivation of infomax for a noisy neural population, extending the original noise-free framework of Bell and Sejnowski. The results, demonstrated on natural image patches and the MNIST dataset, exhibit qualitative similarities to those obtained through other methods.
The approach appears to be an interesting and potentially more general method for unsupervised learning. However, the paper's length and complexity made it challenging to follow, with certain sections, such as the introduction of the hierarchical model, requiring multiple readings to understand. The term "hierarchical" may be misleading, as it does not refer to a deep network hierarchy, but rather a decomposition of the tuning curve function into distinct components. To improve clarity, the authors are advised to condense the paper, conveying the central message and key steps concisely, and relegating the more detailed mathematical development to a supplementary document.
Additionally, the authors should consider the work of Karklin and Simoncelli (2011), which shares a similar infomax framework for a noisy neural population, deriving on and off cells in the retina and demonstrating the emergence of orientation selectivity under specific conditions.
