This manuscript explores the application of adversarial training and virtual adversarial training to LSTM-based models within a text context. The overall quality of the writing is good, making the paper easily comprehensible. The extension of adversarial training concepts to text tasks, while straightforward, is a notable contribution. On the whole, the paper merits publication. One minor suggestion for consideration is an examination of the potential benefits of adversarial training on the performance of RNNs, a simpler model that may offer easier analysis and insight.
