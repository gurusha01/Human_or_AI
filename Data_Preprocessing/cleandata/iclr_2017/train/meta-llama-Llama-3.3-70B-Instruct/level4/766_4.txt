This manuscript reports on the experimental outcomes of utilizing an EdgeBoxes + Fast R-CNN detector for pedestrian localization, leveraging a modified AlexNet (CaffeNet) backbone that incorporates batch normalization. The results are presented on the INRIA and ETH datasets.
Strengths
- The manuscript is well-organized and straightforward to comprehend
Weaknesses
- The two primary contributions of the paper are insufficiently substantial to warrant publication
- The experimental results ought to be supplemented with evaluations on the Caltech pedestrian dataset and potentially the KITTI pedestrian dataset
- A notable recent study from ECCV 2016 [a], which achieved superior results and conducted more comprehensive experimental evaluations, is not referenced or discussed
My assessment is primarily attributed to the paper's unimpressive contributions. The first claimed contribution, employing EdgeBoxes as proposals for pedestrian detection, is overly minor unless it yields unexpectedly significant experimental results. To justify this choice, the manuscript should demonstrate that alternative proposal methods are inferior in terms of performance metrics such as speed, accuracy, or memory usage. The second contribution, incorporating batch normalization (BN) into the network architecture, may be noteworthy if it explores the uncharted territory of BN in Fast R-CNN. However, the narrow focus on pedestrian detection limits the significance of this contribution. A more comprehensive exploration of BN + Fast R-CNN for generic object category detection, using established baselines on PASCAL VOC and COCO, would provide more substantial insights. Furthermore, potential technical issues, such as the typically small batch size in Fast R-CNN, which may render the naive application of BN ineffective, are not addressed.
