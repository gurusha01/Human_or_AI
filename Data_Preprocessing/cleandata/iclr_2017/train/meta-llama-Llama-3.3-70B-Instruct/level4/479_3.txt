This manuscript presents a novel iterative query updating approach for cloze-style question answering, which is both innovative and intriguing. Although the method is only validated on two cloze-style tasks, namely CBT and WDW, the underlying read/compose/write operations appear to be broadly applicable and could potentially be extended to other reasoning tasks beyond cloze-style QA. A notable strength of the proposed model is its ability to adaptively determine the termination of iterations through a computation model, thereby avoiding the common pitfall of treating iteration counts as hyperparameters, a prevalent issue in iterative and multi-hop reasoning models.
To further enhance the paper, a few suggestions are proposed. Firstly, incorporating results from the CNN/Daily Mail dataset would provide a more comprehensive comparison and strengthen the evaluation. Secondly, visualizing the entire M^q sequence over time, rather than just the query gating or z, would facilitate a deeper understanding of the query regression process and its interpretability, allowing for a more nuanced assessment of the model's performance and its alignment with human intuition.
