This paper presents a novel memory module designed to augment existing neural network architectures.
Strengths:
* The manuscript is well-written and introduces an innovative concept.
* The proposed memory module demonstrates its utility and yields notable performance enhancements.
* The authors have evaluated its effectiveness on several substantial tasks.
Weaknesses:
* The study lacks a comparative analysis with other existing memory modules, such as associative LSTMs, which would have provided a more comprehensive understanding of its relative strengths and limitations.
