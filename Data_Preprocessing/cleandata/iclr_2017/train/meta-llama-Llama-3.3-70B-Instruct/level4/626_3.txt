I commend the authors on the promising direction they have undertaken, and I believe it has the potential to yield intriguing outcomes. I encourage them to continue pursuing this line of inquiry, as I anticipate they will produce something noteworthy in the near future. Nevertheless, in its current state, the paper falls short of being ready for presentation. The results of this study are not yet clear to me, and the preimage construction, although intuitively appealing, does not obviously contribute to the overall understanding. While the approach seems to be headed in the right direction, it has not yet reached a point where it can be leveraged to elucidate the underlying mechanisms driving our models. As we know, ReLU models must partition and reunite distinct regions of space, and it is acknowledged that such mechanisms can be constructed, given that ReLU models are universal approximators. However, this theoretical foundation does not necessarily reflect practical applications. Ultimately, I believe this work requires further development before it is ready for presentation.
