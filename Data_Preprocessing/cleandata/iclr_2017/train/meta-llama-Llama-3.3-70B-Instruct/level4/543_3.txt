This manuscript introduces a JavaScript framework that incorporates WebCL components to facilitate the training and deployment of deep neural networks. The authors demonstrate that this approach can achieve competitive performance, even surpassing the speed of a compiled application utilizing ViennaCL on AMD GPUs. Although it remains approximately three times slower than optimized high-performance software on NVIDIA GPUs, the framework offers attractive possibilities for straightforward deployment in training and application settings for deep learning.
My primary criticisms are:
1. Table 4 employs varying batch sizes, which, despite being potentially due to technical limitations of the JavaScript library, raises concerns about fairness in comparison. To ensure a level playing field, it would be reasonable to apply the smaller batch sizes consistently across all frameworks, including those on GPUs, which might actually favor the proposed framework.
2. Figure 6 could benefit from additional data to enhance its informative value. Notably, the inclusion of node.js values would be valuable, as this would provide insight into scenarios involving either a single server with multiple low-performance clients or a setup with a few dedicated high-performance servers. For the sake of completeness and consistency, I recommend including Firefox, Chrome, and node.js in both subfigures.
Overall, the manuscript is well-structured, clear, and effectively conveys its conclusions, with the aforementioned points being the only significant areas for improvement.
