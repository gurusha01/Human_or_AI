This paper introduces a groundbreaking metacontroller optimization framework, which, although designed for one-shot learning tasks, exhibits potential for broader applications. The metacontroller, a model-free reinforcement learning agent, determines the optimal number of optimization iterations and selects the most suitable function or "expert" from a predefined set, such as an action-value or state transition function. The authors present experimental results from simulations where a spacecraft must navigate to a target location while being influenced by between 1 and 5 heavy bodies, demonstrating the metacontroller's efficacy.
The metacontroller system achieves comparable performance to traditional iterative optimization procedures in one-shot learning tasks, with the added benefit of considering computational complexity as a "resource loss" term, thereby enhancing efficiency. Notably, the metacontroller agent successfully identifies the optimal expert to consult, eliminating the need for manual selection by a domain-expert model designer. The experimental results constitute a significant contribution, meriting publication, and also showcase the application of an interaction network for learning the dynamics of a simulated physical system. Furthermore, the developed dataset has the potential to serve as a new baseline for future research on one-shot physical control systems, representing an ancillary contribution that could positively impact the field.
However, the paper could benefit from a clearer explanation of how this approach can be applied to other types of optimization problems. Additionally, the use of the REINFORCE gradient estimation method, known for its high variance, raises questions about the methods employed to mitigate these issues and any additional performance enhancements used during training. A detailed discussion of these aspects could be included as a useful appendix.
Several suggestions are offered to improve the communication of results:
- Although the formal explanation of the paper's content is clear, Figures 1A and 3 could be enhanced. Figure 1A lacks a distinct visual representation of the metacontroller agent, which could be addressed by adding a plate or bounding box around the relevant components to facilitate quicker understanding of the formal description.
- Figure 3 is generally clear, but the absence of x-axis tick marks in the subplots hinders comparison among the experts. The overlap of points and confidence intervals in the upper-left subplot obscures their quantitative meaning. Using thinner bars of different colors could improve clarity. Moreover, the figure lacks a legend, making it challenging to compare the different lines.
- Lastly, a typo is noted in the second sentence of Appendix B.2, which appears to be incomplete.
