This manuscript revisits a timeless concept of utilizing regularization for compression in contemporary CNN architectures, particularly on devices with limited resources. Given the current resurgence of interest in model compression, with numerous researchers re-exploring established ideas, it is refreshing to see a paper that deliberately builds upon foundational approaches from the 1990s to achieve competitive performance on widely-used benchmarks.
Ultimately, this research embodies a straightforward yet effective concept applied to a pressing issue, presented in a clear and insightful manner that appropriately acknowledges classic methodologies. The inclusion of filter visualizations further strengthens the contribution, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the proposed approach.
