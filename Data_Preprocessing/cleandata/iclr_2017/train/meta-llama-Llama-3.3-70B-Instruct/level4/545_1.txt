This manuscript introduces a novel learning framework, "Compositional Kernel Machines (CKMs)", which builds upon traditional kernel machines by leveraging sum-product networks to construct compositional kernel functions. The authors view convolutional neural networks (convnets) as effectively learned nonlinear decision functions, attributing their classification success to their compositional nature. This perspective underlies the design of compositional kernel functions, with the sum-product implementation being a notable aspect. While I concur that compositionality is crucial for convnets, it is not the sole factor contributing to their success. A key distinction between convnets and CKMs lies in the fact that convnets learn all kernels directly from data, whereas CKMs rely on pre-defined feature descriptors, potentially limiting their representational capacity. The work of Anselmi, F. et al., "Deep Convolutional Networks are Hierarchical Kernel Machines", may be of interest to the authors in this context.
The experimental evaluation presented in this paper appears to be preliminary. Although the promising results on the small NORB dataset are encouraging, it is essential to demonstrate competitive performance on more comprehensive and contemporary classification benchmarks, such as MNIST, CIFAR10/100, and ImageNet, to establish the validity of the proposed CKM model. Notably, CKMs seem to outperform convnets in classifying images based on dominant objects in the NORB compositions, possibly due to the utilization of sparse ORB features. A comparison of the accuracy of ORB features with matching kernel SVMs would be a valuable addition. Furthermore, certain experimental details require clarification, including the high and low probabilities of sampling from each collection and the number of generated images. In the NORB Symmetries experiment, CKMs exhibit superior performance to convnets with limited data; however, the convnets appear to be unconverged. It would be beneficial to provide results using a larger dataset to further substantiate the findings.
