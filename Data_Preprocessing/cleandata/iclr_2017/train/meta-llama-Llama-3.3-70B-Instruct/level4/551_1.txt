This paper proposes a novel differentiable histogram filter for state estimation and tracking, which is a specialized Bayesian filter representing discretized states as beliefs. The prediction step utilizes a locally linear and translation-invariant motion model, while the measurement model is represented by a multi-layer neural network. The system is trained using both supervised and unsupervised objectives, with experiments conducted on two synthetic robot localization tasks in 1D and 2D environments. The primary claim is that incorporating problem-specific model structure, namely Bayesian filters for state estimation, can enhance the data efficiency and generalization capabilities of pure deep learning approaches.
The paper presents compelling arguments for the importance of prior knowledge in deep learning methods for specific tasks. Additionally, an end-to-end histogram filter is derived for state estimation, allowing for unsupervised learning.
However, the paper appears to be based on the implicit assumption that deep learning, particularly recurrent neural networks (RNNs), is a natural choice for recursive state estimation. This assumption underlies the rest of the paper, including the use of LSTM baselines. Nevertheless, it is essential to justify the necessity of deep learning for solving the presented tasks, as Bayesian filters are a well-established approach for this classic problem. Therefore, including pure Bayesian filter baselines in the experiments would be beneficial.
Furthermore, the derived histogram filter seems to be specifically designed for discretized state spaces, and it is unclear how well it can be generalized to continuous state spaces using the notation "x". Notably, the observation is also discrete (binary), which enables the derivation of a closed-form measurement update model. This setup may be overly constrained, as generalizing to continuous observations is a non-trivial task, and using images as observations, as in Haarnoja et al. (2016), would be even more challenging. These design choices limit the scope of applicability of the proposed method.
