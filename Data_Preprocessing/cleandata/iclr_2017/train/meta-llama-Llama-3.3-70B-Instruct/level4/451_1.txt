I would like to express my gratitude to the authors for providing clarifications. However, after careful consideration, I still believe that this paper warrants a strong rejection. The authors' responses have not adequately addressed the primary concerns I initially raised. The paper suffers from poor writing, incremental results that are presented in an unclear manner, and proofs that are not transparent enough for me to verify the validity of the proposed theoretical claims, despite my familiarity with the underlying mathematical tools.
I recommend that the authors consider resubmitting this paper to a journal, but only after undertaking a major revision. The results presented are incremental, building upon previously published related work, and the authors' claim of eliminating technical assumptions from earlier papers is not convincing, as their proposed results are significantly weaker and overly technical. Specifically, Theorem 2.4, a key theoretical result, is unconvincing. Furthermore, the paper lacks theoretical intuition, has a weak experimental section, and exhibits formatting errors in several places, contributing to its overall poor quality.
