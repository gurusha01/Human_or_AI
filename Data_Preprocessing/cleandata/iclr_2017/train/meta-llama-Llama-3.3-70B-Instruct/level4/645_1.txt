The authors present a novel approach that integrates non-linear two-view representation learning methods and linear multiview techniques, resulting in a new non-linear representation learning framework that effectively combines information from multiple sources. 
Overall, the methodology is well-explained and appears to yield benefits in various experiments, including phonetic transcription and hashtag recommendation. Although the approach primarily builds upon established techniques, learning a deep network for each view, the fusion of diverse information sources demonstrates efficacy in the examined datasets. 
To further enhance the work, consideration of the following aspects would be valuable:
- An analysis of the proposed method's complexity, particularly in the representation learning component, would provide insight into its computational efficiency.
- Exploring alternative solutions for combining the different networks or views could potentially make the proposed approach more innovative.
- More detailed descriptions of the experimental settings, especially in the synthetic experiments, are necessary. Whenever possible, making the datasets publicly available would facilitate reproducibility.
- The related work section requires expansion, as it currently lacks a comprehensive overview of the multitude of multiview, multi-modal, and multi-layer algorithms proposed in recent years across various application domains, such as image retrieval, classification, and bibliographic data. While a comparison to all relevant works is not necessary, a more thorough discussion of related research would help to better appreciate the unique benefits of the proposed method, particularly in relation to contributions from researchers like A. Kumar, X. Dong, Ping-Yu Chen, M. Bronstein, and others.
