This paper presents a rapid image semantic segmentation network, which integrates multiple techniques to achieve significantly improved speed over the baseline SegNet approach, albeit with comparable or slightly reduced accuracy across most of the three evaluated datasets.
The authors outline and explain the various techniques and design choices employed to optimize speed, providing accompanying intuitions. Nevertheless, this discussion is notable for its lack of quantitative measurements and experimental results that illustrate the impact of these decisions. In my opinion, such an analysis would be a crucial aspect of the paper, as it currently only presents final performance metrics, which suggest a tradeoff between speed and accuracy without offering much insight into the contributing factors.
Furthermore, I believe a more comprehensive comparison with existing systems would be beneficial. While SegNet is the only system included in the comparison tables, the related work section highlights numerous other contemporary systems. The inclusion of additional datasets, such as Pascal or COCO, and possibly an expanded version of the ENet model, could also provide valuable insights.
The proposed system demonstrates impressive speed and acceptable accuracy on most benchmarks. However, as a paper focused on practical implementation, I think it is essential to provide a more detailed examination of the effects of each component, as well as potential sizing and tuning considerations, in order to present a more complete and robust understanding of the system's performance.
