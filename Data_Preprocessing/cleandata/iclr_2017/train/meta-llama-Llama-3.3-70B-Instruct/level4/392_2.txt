This manuscript presents a novel autoencoder-based approach for lossy image compression, which aims to minimize the weighted sum of reconstruction error and code length. The proposed architecture comprises a convolutional encoder and a sub-pixel convolutional decoder. The experimental evaluation assesses the performance of the proposed method in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and MS-SSIM, comparing it to established compression standards such as JPEG and JPEG-2000, as well as a recent RNN-based compression method. Additionally, a mean opinion score test was conducted to validate the results.
The strengths of this paper include:
+ The clarity and quality of the writing, making the content easily accessible to readers.
+ The incorporation of recent advances in convolutional image super-resolution techniques into the decoder architecture.
+ The sensible and well-justified approaches to quantization and rate estimation.
However, a notable limitation is:
- The experimental baseline comparisons appear to be incomplete, which may impact the comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method.
The application of autoencoders to image compression is a crucial task with significant practical implications. Although directly optimizing the rate-distortion tradeoff is not entirely new, the distinctions in this work, such as the quantization approach and the use of a sub-pixel convolutional decoder, sufficiently differentiate it from prior research. As a non-expert in image compression, the approach and results seem promising. The primary drawback is the incomplete implementation of Toderici et al. 2016b and the lack of comparison to Balle et al. 2016. Nevertheless, the competitive performance achieved by this architecture, particularly against JPEG-2000, and its potential to pave the way for future research exploring variations in encoder/decoder size and data domain, render this work highly relevant to the community.
At this time, I do not have additional specific comments, as the pre-review questions adequately addressed my initial concerns.
