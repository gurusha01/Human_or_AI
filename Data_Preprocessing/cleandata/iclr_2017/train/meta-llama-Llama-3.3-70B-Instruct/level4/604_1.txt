This manuscript explores the application of pointer networks to automated argumentation mining, presenting an intriguing task and discussion. However, the overall contribution and novelty of the work are somewhat limited, as it represents a single-task implementation of pointer networks, which have the potential to be applied to a wide range of tasks.
