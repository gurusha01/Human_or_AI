I find the overall approach of this work to be promising, but it is hindered by three significant limitations. Although the motivation and core concept appear sound, the mathematical derivation lacks conviction. The experimental component is restricted, and the presentation requires substantial enhancement. The writing is generally disorganized, making it challenging to follow the proposed ideas at times. The overall structure needs improvement, and the connections between sections are not adequately established. A thorough rewriting of the paper could significantly enhance its quality.
I remain unconvinced by the rationale behind the proposed non-linearity (|c|^2) outlined on page 5. The authors cite (Waldspurger, 2016) as suggesting that higher-order nonlinearities may enhance sparsity. However, upon review, this work seems to imply that higher-order nonlinearities can typically be neglected in the general case. I would appreciate clarification on this point.
On a positive note, incorporating a second-order term into the descriptor appears to be an intriguing direction, provided that stability against minor variations is maintained, which should be experimentally demonstrated.
The experimental section is somewhat limited, and a comprehensive numerical evaluation would strengthen the paper. In my view, the presented results do not convincingly demonstrate a clear advantage of the proposed method over a standard implementation of the scattering transform. A direct comparison of running times and compression rates would be beneficial in highlighting the merits of the proposed approach.
Questions arise, including:
- Can empirical evidence be provided to show that the proposed higher-order nonlinearity yields sparser representations than the complex modulus?
Several minor issues also need attention:
- The proof in Section 2.1 should be preceded by a clear proposition statement.
- Typographical errors, such as "Hadamart" instead of Hadamard, "Valid set" instead of Validation set, and "nonzeros coefficients" instead of nonzero coefficients, should be corrected.
- Figure 3 requires more detailed explanation to enhance understanding.
- Figure 5, intended to compare the proposed method with a standard Scattering network implementation, does not seem to fulfill this purpose. Further explanation is needed.
- The references should be verified, particularly the first reference, which is cited as "MALLAT".
