I would like to begin by acknowledging the delay in submitting my review. 
Summary: This paper presents a innovative memory-based artificial neural network designed for reading comprehension tasks, demonstrating enhanced performance compared to current state-of-the-art methods. The uniqueness of this approach appears to lie in its implementation of an iterative process that incorporates a loop to verify the accuracy of the current answer.
To gain a deeper understanding of the factors contributing to the observed improvement, it would be beneficial to include a complexity analysis and/or a time complexity evaluation of the algorithm. Upon reviewing the provided experiments, I noticed that the actual number of iterations required for the loop in each case is not reported, which might be an oversight.
The description of the dataset in section 2.2 seems out of place and would be more appropriately positioned in section 4, where the other datasets are discussed, to maintain a logical flow and organization of the content.
