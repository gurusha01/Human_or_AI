This manuscript proposes minor yet significant adjustments to differentiable programs, yielding enhanced learning outcomes. Notably, these modifications appear to considerably accelerate the convergence of optimization problems associated with program learning via gradient descent. However, the scope of learnable programs remains limited, rendering them unlikely to have immediate practical applications.
