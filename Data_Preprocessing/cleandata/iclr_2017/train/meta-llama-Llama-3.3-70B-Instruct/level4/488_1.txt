The authors suggest utilizing virtual adversarial training for semi-supervised classification purposes.
At this point, evaluating the algorithm's novelty is challenging due to the extensive existing literature on semi-supervised learning, including SVM-related research and its applications to neural networks; however, the authors do not reference or compare their approach to this body of work, instead focusing solely on the adversarial aspect.
In terms of adversarial novelty, the authors introduce the concept of applying perturbations to word embeddings rather than the input itself, which is particularly relevant for NLP applications.
The experimental section concentrates on text classification methods, and a comparison with established SVM-related literature would be beneficial in determining the proposed approach's effectiveness; for instance, Wang et al. (2012) achieved an 8.8% result on IMBD using a simple linear SVM without a transductive setup.
Overall, the paper is well-written and presents a functional semi-supervised learning algorithm; nonetheless, it lacks a theoretical and experimental comparison with prior research, which is essential for a comprehensive evaluation.
