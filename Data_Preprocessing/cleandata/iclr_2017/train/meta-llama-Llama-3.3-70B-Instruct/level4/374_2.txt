The problem tackled in this work is well-justified, and the proposed approach is both insightful and intuitive, yielding convincing results that effectively demonstrate the viability of the method, albeit with limited diversity in application scenarios. A notable strength of the paper is the utilization of Part-of-Speech (POS) and Named Entity Recognition (NER) as intermediate signals to inform decision-making, alongside a comprehensive comparison against a range of baseline models that convincingly showcases the proposed model's efficacy. Furthermore, the authors' responses to my inquiries were satisfactory, providing sufficient empirical evidence in the results to substantiate the effectiveness of the inductive bias introduced by the fine-grained gating model.
