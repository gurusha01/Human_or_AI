This paper presents a methodology for multimodal machine translation, specifically addressing scenarios where an image corresponds to both the source and target sentences. 
The proposed methodology involves utilizing a latent variable model conditioned on the image. However, upon examining Equation 3 and Figure 3, it becomes apparent that the image's role is limited to the training phase for inference purposes. This raises concerns about the approach's validity, as the image does not substantially contribute to the translation process.
The experimental results are underwhelming. If model selection had been conducted appropriately, using the validation set, the proposed model would yield only marginal improvements of 0.6 METEOR and 0.2 BLEU over the baseline. Considering the overall variability in the results, these gains are negligible and lack statistical significance.
The qualitative assessment in Subsection 4.4 is unconvincing and fails to provide conclusive insights. 
Ultimately, the paper is plagued by significant shortcomings in both its conceptual framework and execution, undermining its overall impact.
