The revised paper demonstrates notable improvements compared to its initial arXiv version released in June. Although the results remain unchanged, the presentation is more balanced and no longer exaggerates their significance as it previously did. It would be beneficial to refrain from using colloquial terms such as "mantra" to maintain a formal tone. 
I still maintain that my critique, as stated in my comment on December 3, 2016, regarding the "randomly generated task", holds validity, and I disagree with the authors' response to this point.
