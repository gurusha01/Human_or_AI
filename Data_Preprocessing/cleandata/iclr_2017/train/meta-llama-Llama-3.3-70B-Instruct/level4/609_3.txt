This study presents a convolutional framework designed to process graph-like input data, where the structure varies by example, or more broadly, any data characterized by input dimensions interconnected through a similarity matrix. Alternatively, if each input example is linked to a transition matrix, a random walk algorithm is employed to derive a similarity matrix from it.
The development of convolutional or recurrent architectures for graph-like data is a crucial challenge, as it enables the creation of neural networks capable of handling complex inputs such as molecular structures or social networks. However, upon examination, it appears that this work does not substantially advance the existing body of research in this field.
The paper's primary contributions seem to be two-fold:
1) For data tied to a transition matrix, it suggests converting this matrix into a similarity matrix, a step that seems inherently intuitive.
2) For data associated with a similarity matrix, it proposes computing the k nearest neighbors for each node to provide context, another approach that appears straightforward.
Given the presentation's lack of clarity, and unless the contribution has been misunderstood, it is challenging to support the publication of this paper.
Specific observations include:
1) The claim on page 4 that the proposed convolution uniquely preserves locality while being applicable across graphs of different structures is inaccurate. Other architectures, such as those proposed by Duvenaud et al. and Lusci et al. for neural networks applied to molecular structures, have already demonstrated flexibility across varying input structures.
