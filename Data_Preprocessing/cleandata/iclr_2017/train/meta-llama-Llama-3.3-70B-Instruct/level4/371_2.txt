This paper introduces a neural physics engine (NPE) that decomposes physical scenes into modular, object-centric representations. The NPE predicts the future state of an object by composing the pairwise interactions between the object and its nearby counterparts, mirroring the physical principle of additive forces. The authors demonstrate the NPE's potential in 2D environments featuring balls and obstacles.
The proposed approach is intriguing, combining neural networks with fundamental physical principles in a novel way. This fusion may lead to significant and interesting follow-up research in the field. However, the evaluation methodology raises some concerns, which are outlined below.
In terms of significance and originality, the approach is notable. Although other methods have attempted to model physical predictions, the concept of summing pairwise terms aligns closely with mechanical principles and appears to be a new contribution. Its simplicity belies its potential importance.
The paper is generally well-written, but the introductory section is overly abstract and difficult to follow until the fifth paragraph. To improve clarity, the authors could revise the early introduction to include more specific details about the approach or provide examples to make the text more concrete.
The experimental section has two main issues. Firstly, the indirect comparison with Fragkiadaki et al. (2015) does not seem to favor the proposed approach quantitatively. Secondly, the authors should conduct and report quantitative experiments to investigate the impact of the mask size on performance. While they mention that the mask is beneficial, its effectiveness and sensitivity to this parameter are unclear. Including such experiments would strengthen the paper.
Despite these limitations, which could be addressed to enhance the paper's quality, the submission is interesting and warrants publication.
