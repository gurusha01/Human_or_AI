I appreciate the opportunity to review this paper, which presents a thought-provoking exploration of communication between two agents.
The paper has several strengths, including:
- Its focus on a critical issue in the field, namely understanding how machines communicate, which is particularly relevant given the growing number of reinforcement learning applications. This work prompts a fundamental question: do machines approach problem-solving in a manner similar to humans?
- The simplicity of the task, which facilitates intuitive post-learning analysis.
- The intriguing observation that informed agents utilize multiple symbols for message transmission, whereas agnostic agents rely on only two symbols.
However, there are some limitations to consider:
- The task can be reduced to a basic image classification problem when the two sent images belong to different categories. In essence, the symbols employed are equivalent to the image class, which the second agent learns to assign to one of the images. This approach essentially becomes a transfer learning problem, which could potentially be trained more efficiently and quickly using methods other than reinforcement learning.
