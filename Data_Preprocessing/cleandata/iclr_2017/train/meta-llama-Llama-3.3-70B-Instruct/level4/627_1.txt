This manuscript presents a multimodal neural machine translation approach, building upon existing variational methods, with the aim of grounding semantics in images. Leveraging visual information to enhance translation quality appears to be a reasonable approach when such data is readily available.
However, as noted by a previous reviewer, the model selection methodology employed in the paper is flawed. Consequently, the reported improvements by the authors are negligible. Furthermore, as acknowledged by the authors in their response, it remains uncertain whether the model is effectively capturing meaningful image semantics. Therefore, it is challenging to determine whether this paper makes a significant contribution to the original research direction that motivated it.
