Previous studies have utilized a data-derived adjacency matrix A to identify neighboring nodes, which serve as the basis for graph convolution. The authors propose an extension of this approach by incorporating nodes that are reachable within i<=k steps in the graph, thereby expanding the set of neighbors. However, this modification introduces an additional tunable parameter, k, which requires justification for its use over the previously established k=1 approach. Notably, in the Merk experiment, employing k=1 yielded superior results, whereas in the MNIST experiment, the authors also utilized k=1, consistent with prior work by Coats and Ng (2011). To provide a more convincing argument, a comparative experiment demonstrating that using k>1 yields significant improvements that outweigh the addition of an extra hyper-parameter would be necessary.
