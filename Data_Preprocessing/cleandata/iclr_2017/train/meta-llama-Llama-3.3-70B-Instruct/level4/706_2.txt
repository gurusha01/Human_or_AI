This paper presents a novel approach to neural variational models by introducing a piecewise constant parameterisation, enabling the exploration of multi-modality in latent variables and potentially leading to more powerful neural models. 
The experimental results on neural variational document models and variational hierarchical recurrent encoder-decoder models demonstrate that incorporating a piecewise constant distribution yields improved perplexity in document modelling and seemingly enhanced performance in dialogue modelling.
Although the concept of employing a piecewise constant prior for latent variables is intriguing, the paper's presentation is subpar, even considering its 14-page length, and the experimental design falls short in substantiating many of the claims made.
The detailed comments are as follows:
--The author highlights the limitations of VAEs with standard Gaussian priors in the last paragraphs of sections 3.1 and 5.1, suggesting that a multimodal prior could help VAEs overcome optimisation issues. However, there is a notable lack of evidence demonstrating that the multimodality of the prior effectively addresses these bottlenecks.
--In the last paragraph of section 6.1, the author asserts that the decoder parameter matrix is directly influenced by the latent variables. Nevertheless, the connection to the decoder involves a combination of piecewise constant and Gaussian latent variables. Regardless of the experimental findings, they only illustrate the relationship z=
