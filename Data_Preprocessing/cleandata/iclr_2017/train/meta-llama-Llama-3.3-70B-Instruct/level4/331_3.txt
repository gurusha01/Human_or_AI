This paper addresses the challenge of skill transfer between robots with distinct morphologies, focusing on agents that must execute multiple tasks. The proposed approach relies on a task-invariant future space that can be shared across tasks and agents, serving as a core component.
In comparison to prior research, such as Ammar et al. (2015), the primary contribution of this work appears to be the assumption that suitable correspondences in episodic tasks can be extracted through time alignment, as stated in Section 2. This hypothesis is intriguing, and similarities can also be drawn to the work of Raimalwala et al. (2016), with the authors arguing that their method is better suited to handle non-linear dynamics. However, these hypotheses have not been adequately verified through the presented empirical results. Notably, the issue of pairing correspondence is critical, and it is unclear how the method performs when time alignment is not suitable. The use of dynamic time warping or similar methods to achieve reasonable results could be explored. Robustness to misspecification of the pairing correspondence P is a significant concern that warrants further investigation.
A more comprehensive comparison to other transfer methods, including those listed in Section 2, would be highly valuable. The inclusion of Section 5.1 is a step in the right direction, but it only represents a small portion of the recent work on transfer learning. While other methods transfer different pieces of information, such as policies, it is essential to explore what information is worth transferring to achieve better performance. The question of what to transfer, in addition to how to perform the transfer, is a crucial one that deserves attention.
Overall, the paper tackles a critical problem in an active area of research. The proposed method of transferring representations is well-motivated, clearly described, and conceptually sound. However, the assumption that time alignment can be used for state pairing is problematic and requires further validation. Additional comparisons to other methods would be beneficial to strengthen the paper's contributions.
