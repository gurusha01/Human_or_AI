The authors present a competitive learning framework that trains multiple RNN predictors in isolation, analogous to a panel of experts selected dynamically at runtime using a hard switch. This approach is applied to predicting diverse driving behaviors in human drivers, combining predictions at test time and frequently switching between behaviors within short timeframes, typically seconds. The proposed architecture yields a lower prediction loss compared to a similar non-competitive baseline.
However, the interpretation of the results remains somewhat ambiguous, and the practical implications of the model are not entirely clear. The frequent switching between behaviors raises questions about the model's ability to effectively choose the most suitable driving mode for a given situation, potentially undermining the motivation behind the approach. A rephrased motivation that more convincingly justifies the competitive learning strategy might be necessary.
While the competitive approach is intriguing, its novelty is limited, which may restrict the paper's impact at a premier conference like ICLR.
