This paper presents an intriguing concept of quantized networks that operate on temporal difference inputs, which can significantly reduce computational complexity, particularly when processing natural video data. By only focusing on the differences between frames, the network can efficiently process the informative sections of the image, mirroring the human visual system's functionality. This idea extends beyond the machine learning community, making it a noteworthy contribution.
It's worth noting that the event-based vision community, such as Tobi Delbr√ºck's group, may be interested in this work, and exploring connections to this community could provide valuable insights and references, including those mentioned on page 1.
The most significant novel contribution appears to be the replacement of rounding networks with sigma-delta networks, highlighting the importance of the order of discretization and summation on processing load. After carefully following the steps outlined in the paper, most of my initial questions were addressed during the pre-review period. However, one remaining question concerns the statement on page 3: "It should be noted that when we refer to 'temporal differences', we refer not to the change in the signal over time, but in the change between two inputs presented sequentially." This clarification seems confusing, as the network essentially calculates the difference between two consecutive frames, regardless of the terminology used. Either this statement should be removed or further explanation is necessary to clarify the distinction.
Additionally, Figure 1 would benefit from being enlarged for better visibility. To further enhance the paper, a more in-depth discussion on the relevance and implications of the findings would be beneficial. While the sigma-delta network is shown to reduce operations compared to thresholding, it is essential to explore whether this difference is crucial for specific tasks or has significant implications for neuroscience, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the contribution.
