This manuscript presents a character-aware attention residual network designed for sentence embedding, which is evaluated on several text classification tasks. The proposed model achieves superior performance to several baselines on two out of three tasks, although it fails to outperform the TFIDF-SVM baseline on the remaining task.
The novelty of this work is limited, as the incorporation of character information and the use of residual networks have been explored in prior research, as acknowledged by the authors. The lack of innovation in this proposal is a significant concern.
To further assess the model's effectiveness, it would be beneficial to test it on additional widely-used datasets for short text classification, such as TREC, which would allow for comparisons with more competitive baselines. Furthermore, the creation and domain of the "Question" dataset are unclear and require clarification.
Additionally, the citation format used throughout the paper is incorrect. For instance, citations should be formatted as "like Word2Vec (Mikolov et al., 2013)" rather than "like Word2Vec Mikolov et al. (2013)". It is essential to follow standard citation conventions, as seen in other published papers, to maintain consistency and clarity.
