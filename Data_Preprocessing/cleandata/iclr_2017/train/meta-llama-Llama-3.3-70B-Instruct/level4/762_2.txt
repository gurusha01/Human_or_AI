I appreciate the concept explored in this paper, but several concerns with the analysis need to be addressed:
- To better evaluate the results' quality, incorporating state-of-the-art comparisons is essential, such as setting d times d pixel patches to their average and applying a denoising autoencoder. If the presented model outperforms these significantly, it suggests that the model is not fully utilizing the input image's information.
- The SCT-R and FOV-R experiments aim to compare information restoration from the Fovea alone versus the Fovea with low-resolution periphery. However, an additional difference between the conditions is that in SCT-R, part of the image is set to zero, while in FOV-R, it is entirely removed. This discrepancy could impact the results, particularly with only one or two hidden layers.
- On page 4, the comparison between FOV-R (1% error) and DS-D (1.5%) attributes the performance difference to the autoencoder's extraction of peripheral information from the Fovea. While plausible, the reduced error may also be due to the perfect reconstruction of the Fovea. To accurately assess the additional information extracted from the Fovea about the periphery, calculating the error only in the periphery (where DS-D and FOV-R have identical inputs) would be more informative.
Additional concerns include:
- The images in Figure 2 (a) and (b) for "factor 2", "factor 4", and "factor 8" appear blurry, suggesting interpolation (different from bilinear interpolation). Using "nearest" interpolation for these images would provide more insight into the information they contain.
- The Figure 3 caption is too vague and could be clarified with an addition similar to footnote 2.
- Figures often appear too early in the paper, resulting in significant distance between the text and figures, which can disrupt the reading flow.
