This study presents three key enhancements to scattering networks, comprising: (1) a non-linear transformation enabling Fourier-domain computation, (2) compact-supported representations in the Fourier domain, and (3) the incorporation of additional variance features. 
The technical advancements appear to be valuable, as the first two contributions may lead to improved computational efficiency, while the third may enhance accuracy. However, the descriptions and evaluations of these contributions are inadequate. With clearer writing and more comprehensive evaluation, the paper would have been recommendable for acceptance, given the potential of the proposed ideas.
A significant issue with the presentation is the prevalence of overly complex sentences and unnecessary technical jargon, as exemplified in the last paragraph of Section 1, which is representative of the entire paper's writing style.
Similarly, the equations are often unnecessarily complicated. For instance, Equation 5 can be simplified to two lines:
X_0 = x
Xl = |X{l-1} * Psi_l|
where the |.| operator denotes element-wise operation. Many of the hyperparameter dependencies, indexes, and repetitive iterations in Equations 5-13 can be eliminated, making the equations more concise.
The argument regarding cardinality (Equation 14) fails to convincingly demonstrate that variance is more informative. In fact, it can be easily argued that the cardinality of S concatenated with any other quantity is greater than or equal to the cardinality of S. A more robust argument grounded in machine learning theory would be more persuasive.
The authors should aim to make the paper's arguments less exaggerated and more substantiated. The claims of discovering invariants for any input (Abstract) and identifying fundamental structures (last paragraph of Section 1.2.1) lack mathematical backing. It is unclear how the approach can guarantee the identification of semantically relevant representations. While machine learning procedures offer some guarantees, the feature construction method presented here appears more heuristic, which does not diminish the main idea but requires further research to strengthen this aspect.
