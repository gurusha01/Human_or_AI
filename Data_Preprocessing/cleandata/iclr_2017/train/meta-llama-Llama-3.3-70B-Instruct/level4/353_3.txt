Overall, this paper presents a compelling contribution. 
The proposed model demonstrates ingenuity by combining the strengths of latent variable models and auto-regressive models, and the implementation details, including the specific architectural decisions as previously discussed, appear to be well-founded.
From an experimental perspective, it would be beneficial to see a more comprehensive evaluation beyond NLL measurements and samples, such as demonstrating its utility in tasks like classification.
Although the paper may not represent a significant breakthrough, it is nonetheless a solid contribution, and I recommend accepting it.
