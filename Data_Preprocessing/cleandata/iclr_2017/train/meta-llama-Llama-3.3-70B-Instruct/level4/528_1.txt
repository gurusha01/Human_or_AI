The authors present design recommendations for program induction using gradient descent, emphasizing good programming practices such as immutable data and higher-order language constructs. 
As I noted in my comments, I strongly believe that this contribution is marginal at best, building upon the already published TerpreT system, which has a strong experimental and theoretical foundation. The TerpreT paper is indeed deserving of significant attention and is truly inspirational.
However, this paper challenges one of the key findings of the original TerpreT paper without providing sufficient evidence to support the superiority or even suitability of gradient-based evaluators for program induction. This contradiction raises concerns and makes me question why gradient-based methods were not more thoroughly evaluated initially or why more comprehensive comparisons with existing alternatives were not included in this study.
In my opinion, if the goal is to bring more attention to the original TerpreT paper, which I believe is warranted, then this paper meets the threshold. Nevertheless, due to its poor readability, unconvincing contradictions with its predecessor, and lack of reproducibility without additional context, I unfortunately consider it to be below the threshold.
