This paper proposes a novel approach where a dedicated introspection neural network is utilized to forecast future weight values based on their historical progression. The introspection network is trained using parameter trajectories gathered from training a distinct set of meta-learning models with a conventional optimizer, such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD).
Strengths:
+ The paper's structure is generally well-organized and easy to follow
+ The introduced meta-learning approach deviates from traditional learning-to-learn methods, offering a fresh perspective
Weaknesses:
- More comprehensive experiments are necessary to validate the approach on diverse neural network architectures, such as fully connected and recurrent networks, which exhibit distinct parameter space geometries compared to convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
- The experimental sections for MNIST and CIFAR lack detailed architectural descriptions
- The mini-batch size used in the experiments is not specified in the paper
- Incorporating comparisons with alternative baseline optimizers, like Adam, or providing a clear explanation for the selection of hyper-parameters (e.g., learning rate and momentum) for the baseline SGD method would strengthen the paper
Overall, the current revision's omission of crucial experimental details makes it challenging to derive conclusive insights regarding the proposed methodology.
