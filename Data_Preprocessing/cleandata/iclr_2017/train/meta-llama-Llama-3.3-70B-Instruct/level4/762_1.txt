This paper endeavors to investigate the perceptual capabilities of a neural network under varying input conditions by manipulating the input image and training an auto-encoder to reconstruct the original image. The results, presented in terms of MSE and qualitative assessments, are compared across different input conditions.
However, upon examination, the paper appears to lack a clear direction, presenting a collection of preliminary observations without drawing concrete conclusions. For instance, in section 4.4, the authors note that the results are unsurprising given the additional information in FOV-R, and suggest that a limited number of foveations with rich details may be sufficient for neural networks. Nevertheless, this hypothesis is not further explored, leaving questions regarding the specific detailed regions required, their origin, and the tasks for which they are necessary.
Furthermore, it is unclear whether the reconstruction behaviors observed are a result of the network's fundamental perception of the input or artifacts of the auto-encoder and pixel-wise L2 loss. A notable example is the network's inability to recover textures, which may be attributed to the generation of high-frequency textures during training, rather than a perception issue. The use of a pixel-wise loss may lead to the prediction of a pixel-wise average of training samples, resulting in a flat region. This raises the question of whether a differently trained network, such as an adversarial network, might infer the presence of a texture even if it cannot generate it.
Similarly, the network's ability to perform color reconstruction given a color glimpse may be related to disambiguating object or scene color. If ambiguity exists, the network may output an average, resulting in sepia tones. However, the paper only measures reconstruction error for different amounts of color provided, without thoroughly exploring hypotheses for this behavior.
While some interesting measurements are presented, such as the amount of color required in the foveation to reconstruct a color image, and the discussion on global features, which may shed light on the mechanism by which glimpses propagate to an entire reconstruction, the paper's overall lack of focus makes it challenging to discern the key takeaways. What are the broader, concrete conclusions that can be drawn from the details, and what mechanisms underlie them? Can these be more thoroughly investigated with increased focus?
