I find the concept of learning deep feature representations that supervise the grouping of dissimilar views of the same object to be intriguing. Although the paper may not introduce particularly groundbreaking technical innovations, this aspect does not detract from its value. The work effectively explores a novel form of supervision using a new dataset, which is a notable contribution. While the use of a synthetic dataset is acceptable, I believe it would be beneficial to include additional experiments using real-world data to further validate the findings.
The paper's attempt to draw connections to human vision, however, seems excessive. I would suggest toning down the cognitive science and neuroscience references in the introduction, particularly in the second to fourth paragraphs. These sections appear to overemphasize the paper's contribution to our understanding of human vision. A more straightforward narrative would be more effective: "Deep feature representations that are viewpoint-invariant are often desirable. We achieve this through supervised training of a deep network. Additionally, humans possess some capability for viewpoint invariance, which has been extensively studied [citations]." I am skeptical of any claims suggesting a more profound connection between the paper's findings and human vision.
In Section 3.1, I recommend basing the analysis on the entire matrix of instance-to-instance similarity assessments rather than relying on tree-to-tree distance comparisons. The conversion to trees seems unnecessary, and the loss of information may be detrimental. Furthermore, the use of the word "Remarkably" in the statement "Remarkably, we found that OPnets similarity judgement matches a set of data on human similarity judgement, significantly better than AlexNet" seems unwarranted.
As a non-expert in human vision, my cursory review of online resources and prior knowledge suggest that "object persistence" is often related to the concept of occlusion. However, occlusion is not mentioned in the paper. I am concerned that the use of human vision terminology may be misleading or an overstatement, potentially exaggerating the paper's implications for our understanding of human vision.
