The manuscript proposes a sequence generation approach that leverages a known technique applied to features extracted using an existing method. However, the paper's focus on specific technologies leads to a lack of comprehensive literature review on sequence generation, neglecting the rich body of work on motion prediction that could be highly relevant. Notably, recent advancements in sequence prediction models, such as those used for skeleton data, demonstrate the ability to learn complex motions from primed inputs without requiring pre-processing.
A significant concern lies in the evaluation methodology. The absence of quantitative evaluation and comparison with other existing methods raises questions about the proposed approach's efficacy. Furthermore, the utility of the intermediate representation, as developed by Plamondon et al., within the context of a fully trained sequence generation model is uncertain. It remains to be seen whether the model could inherently learn the necessary transformations, highlighting the need for a thorough evaluation.
Upon closer examination, several minor errors, including typos and omitted words, are evident and could be rectified through meticulous proofreading.
The introduction to Section 3 lacks clarity regarding the application's purpose, specifically the prediction of dynamic parameters and its intended use. A more compelling motivation for the work presented in this section would enhance the manuscript's coherence.
The justification for selecting a less precise method, as referenced in Berio & Leymarie (2015), for generating virtual target sequences that are perceptually similar to the original trace, is not adequately explained. This omission detracts from the paper's self-contained nature.
The description of the V2V-model's conditioning variables is insufficient, necessitating more detailed explanations to facilitate understanding.
To improve the manuscript's overall quality, additional efforts should be made to ensure it is self-contained, providing clear explanations of referenced methods and including necessary details.
The use of the IAM dataset, which is an offline dataset comprising images, raises questions about the process employed to generate stroke sequences from this data. Given the existence of recent, state-of-the-art models for sequence prediction that can learn complex motions without pre-processing, it is pertinent to consider their applicability to this work and to evaluate the proposed method against these benchmarks.
