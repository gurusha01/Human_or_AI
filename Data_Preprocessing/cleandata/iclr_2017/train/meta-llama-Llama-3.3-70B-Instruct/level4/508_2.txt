This paper presents a novel approach to utilizing neural networks on graph-structured data, building upon recent research in this area. From my understanding, the proposed methodology can be broken down into the following key components:
1. A hierarchical framework is established, comprising a set of "objects" within the graph, where each object is composed of multiple "parts" from the preceding level. These parts can be associated with an object in various ways, denoted by different π labels, which can be referred to as "membership types." In the experiments, the bottom-level objects are vertices, while the next level consists of radius 0 and radius 1 neighborhoods surrounding each vertex, with membership types categorized as "root" or "element" depending on whether a vertex is central or a neighbor. The top level features a single object encompassing all these neighborhoods, with membership types designated as "radius 0 neighborhood" or "radius 1 neighborhood."
2. Each object is assigned a representation. The representation of each vertex is initialized as a one-hot encoding of its degree. To construct an object's representation at the subsequent level, the following steps are taken:
    a. The representations of all parts belonging to an object with the same membership type are summed.
    b. The sums obtained from different membership types are concatenated.
    c. The resulting vector is passed through a multi-layer neural network.
I have outlined this summary to verify my comprehension of the paper, as the original description is somewhat convoluted and pertinent details are dispersed throughout the text. To clarify, I have several additional questions: What is the number of layers and hidden units employed in the neural network? What are the dimensionalities of the representations at each layer? How is the final classification performed? What motivates the choice of the "ego-graph" representation?
The proposed approach is intriguing and innovative, with the compression technique appearing to be effective and the results seeming compelling. Nevertheless, the writing's clarity and structure are subpar. It required considerable effort to grasp the methodology, as the initial description lacks illustrative examples and necessitates navigating the paper to understand how the π labels are utilized. Crucial details regarding network architecture are omitted, and minimal motivation is provided for the choices made. Were alternative decomposition or object-part structures explored, given the generality of the shift-aggregate-extract formulation? What motivated the selection of "ego-graphs"? Why were one-hot degrees chosen for the initial attributes?
In conclusion, while the paper offers a valuable technical contribution, its presentation requires significant refinement before I can recommend acceptance.
