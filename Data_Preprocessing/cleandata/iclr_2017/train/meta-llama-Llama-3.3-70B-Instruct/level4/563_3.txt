This paper presents a novel formulation of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) from the perspective of density ratio estimation, utilizing Bregman divergences. Although GANs are already capable of performing density estimation, the use of Bregman divergences aims to yield an objective function with more robust gradients. However, I have several concerns regarding this submission.
Firstly, the manuscript's presentation needs substantial enhancement. The current version is often incomprehensible and fails to effectively motivate, describe, and justify the contributions made.
Secondly, the authors present numerous alternative approaches and heuristics throughout the description of the proposed b-GAN, introducing considerable complexity that hinders understanding, implementation, and utilization of the b-GAN. Further research is required to systematically eliminate many of the proposed algorithmic variants.
Thirdly, interpreting the experimental results, particularly in Figures 2, 3, and 4, is exceedingly challenging. The authors assert that these figures demonstrate "continuous learning," but this behavior can also be characteristic of the inherent chaotic dynamics of GANs. Despite consulting Appendix A, I remain unconvinced about the practical benefits of the proposed approach, especially in the absence of comparisons to other GAN methods with similar architectures.
In conclusion, I firmly believe that this submission requires significant revisions before it can be considered for publication.
