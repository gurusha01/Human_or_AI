This paper introduces a novel network architecture, termed Gated Residual Networks, which incorporates gating mechanisms into shortcut connections using a scalar gate regulator. The authors assert that this design enhancement will lead to improved training of Residual Networks.
However, upon examination, it appears that the authors' claims of competitive performance on the CIFAR-10 dataset, rivaling state-of-the-art models with only Wide Res Nets, are tempered by the fact that Wide Gated ResNet requires substantially more parameters than DenseNet and other Res Net variants to achieve marginal improvements over Dense Net. Moreover, the authors' reported results on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 are eclipsed by the updated DenseNet (Huang et al., 2016b), specifically the DenseNet-BC variant, which achieves superior performance with fewer parameters (3.46 for CIFAR-10 and 17.18 for CIFAR-100 with 25.6M parameters, outperforming the authors' results with 15.3M parameters, significantly less than the 36.5M parameters required by Wide Gated ResNet). Notably, state-of-the-art Res Net variants have reported results on Image Net, highlighting the need for the authors to provide comparable results to substantiate their claimed improvements.
The proposed approach, drawing inspiration from Highway Neural Networks and Residual Networks, lacks sufficient novelty, and the empirical results fail to convincingly demonstrate the effectiveness of this incremental method.
Several questions and concerns arise from the manuscript:
- The assumption that the squared parameter-wise distance between surrogate paths is equivalent to the path length warrants further elaboration and justification.
- The substitution of mean and variance with initialization mean variance in the derivation of Eq 15 and 16 requires clarification.
- The comparison of the Total Squared Distance to Identity is mentioned but not presented; its inclusion would be beneficial.
- The absence of Highway Neural Networks results in Table 5 is notable and should be addressed.
- The discrepancy between the reported result of 6.61 for He et al. (2015b) in Table 5 and the actual result of 6.43 in the original paper needs correction.
- The statement regarding the expectation of surpassing state-of-the-art results, despite not achieving this in the presented results, seems unjustified and requires further explanation.
- Given that baselines have been evaluated on Image Net, it is essential to provide comparable results to ensure a satisfactory comparison; are there any plans to include Image Net comparison results?
