This study introduces a novel 3D CNN architecture designed for detecting climate events, which integrates an unsupervised auto-encoder reconstruction loss with YOLO-like bounding box prediction. The methodology is trained and evaluated on a large-scale simulated climate dataset that has been labeled using the TECA heuristic approach, known for its high cost.
Overall, the paper is well-written (with some minor suggestions for improvement provided below) and tackles a significant and well-motivated problem. The authors have provided sufficient details about the model to facilitate reproduction, although making the code publicly available would be preferable. While the experiments are somewhat unconvincing (as discussed in more detail below), the consideration of model capacity through the number of parameters when comparing 2D and 3D model variants is appreciated.
However, there are concerns regarding the sufficiency of the evaluation methodology for assessing the effectiveness of this approach. Utilizing an IoU threshold of 0.1 may lead to the inclusion of numerous poor detections as true positives. Although this might be justifiable if the objective is to count instances, it seems overly lenient for localization purposes. Furthermore, the 3D CNN architecture, a core novelty of this work compared to previous efforts, appears incapable of generating variable-sized boxes (as noted on page 7), potentially resulting in poorer performance at higher IoU thresholds due to the small size of many weather events.
The experiments also yield inconclusive results regarding the impact of temporal modeling and semi-supervision. In supervised settings, the temporal component does not seem to have a significant effect (2D: 51.45 mAP, 3D: 51.00 mAP), but it offers some improvement in semi-supervised cases (2D: 51.11 mAP, 3D: 52.92 mAP). Additionally, the inclusion of unlabeled data appears to hinder performance in the 2D case while enhancing it for the 3D model. It would be beneficial for the authors to provide confidence intervals for these metrics and engage in a more in-depth discussion of these trends, particularly concerning the effect of loss weights (alpha, beta, and gamma).
It is also unclear whether both the 2D and 3D models were trained for equivalent durations (suggesting they were not, based on the last paragraph of page 7). A plot comparing the training and validation accuracy of each model over time would be helpful for a more comprehensive comparison.
Lastly, the inclusion of a baseline approach for comparison would be valuable, as it would provide a reference point to evaluate the performance of the proposed method in relation to the problem's difficulty.
Preliminary Rating:
This paper presents an interesting and well-motivated concept but falls short in terms of experimental adequacy to support conclusive trends. Further analysis, including mAP trends across a broader range of IoU values and a more detailed discussion of the training procedure, loss weight settings, and the limitations of the 3D model in producing variable-sized bounding boxes, would be necessary.
Clarification:
The paper mentions, "While climate models are run on a 3D grid, with the vertical dimension corresponding to 30 levels; we only consider surface quantities (i.e., 2D data) in this study." Could the authors elaborate on what these surface quantities represent? Specifically, do they correspond to the highest cloud level?
Minor Notes:
- The references to Prabhat et al. should include years instead of being labeled as "a" and "b."
- The footnote in section 4.2 could be integrated into the main text to improve readability.
- In section 4.3, the second paragraph contains the word "table" in lowercase, whereas it is capitalized elsewhere.
- Similarly, in section 4.3, the fourth paragraph contains the word "section" in lowercase, which is inconsistent with the rest of the document.
Edit: Despite appreciating the authors' responses to the questions raised, the relatively poor localization performance at stricter IoU thresholds remains a concern that does not fully justify the complexity of the proposed approach. It is encouraged that the authors continue to develop this line of research.
