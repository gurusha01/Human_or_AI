This manuscript explores the application of denoising autoencoders to enhance the performance of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Specifically, it utilizes the features extracted by the discriminator from generated images as input for a denoising autoencoder, aiming for accurate reconstruction. The concept of leveraging the "additional information" provided by the discriminator's feature representations is intriguing and aligns with the innovative spirit of ICLR. However, my primary concern lies in understanding the nature of the improvement achieved by this method. Although it yields higher inception scores in certain cases, I find it challenging to interpret the significance of these scores, which diminishes my enthusiasm for the results. The authors have not convincingly demonstrated that the benefits of this approach outweigh the added complexity, both in terms of concept and implementation. Furthermore, I am curious about the practicality of implementing this method and whether the code will be made available. 
I consider GANs as a tool for achieving broader goals, and while generating realistic images, particularly at 32x32 resolution, does not greatly excite me, I am enthusiastic about the potential applications of GAN-based systems. It would have been beneficial to see the improvements in inception scores translate to enhancements in a more practical task. Although this criticism may apply to many GAN-related papers, making it potentially unfair to raise here. Nonetheless, the idea of exploiting "extra information," such as discriminator features, is compelling within and beyond the context of this study.
