This paper presents a modified version of the ELU activation function, termed PELU, which introduces two trainable parameters per layer to potentially mitigate vanishing gradients in neural networks. 
My primary concern with this submission lies in the authors' assertions regarding the efficacy of PELU. The theoretical analysis provided in Sections 2 and 3 focuses on how PELU may enhance training by addressing gradient propagation issues, which in itself only suggests that models could become easier to train, without necessarily implying improved generalization performance. However, the experimental section aims to demonstrate enhanced generalization capabilities. It is conceivable that any observed improvements could stem from a more favorable inductive bias rather than the proposed optimization advantages. Notably, none of the experiments are specifically designed to validate the theoretical benefits of PELU over ELU in terms of model optimization.
In their response to the pre-review query, the authors maintain that the claims made in Sections 2 and 3.3 pertain to generalization performance. Upon review, I find it challenging to reconcile this stance with the content, except for the claim related to flexibility. As acknowledged by the authors, superior training outcomes do not invariably translate to better out-of-sample performance. I concur that increased flexibility can, in certain instances, aid the network in adapting its inductive bias to the problem at hand, thereby potentially reducing overfitting. Nonetheless, this represents a significantly more nuanced claim than the mathematical arguments advanced for enhanced optimization.
Regarding the selection of learning hyperparameters, the authors note in the OpenReview discussion that the chosen learning rates were more favorable to ReLU than to PELU. However, this does not preclude the possibility that these rates might have been unfavorable to ELU. This raises an important question: Is it possible to identify a regime in which ELU outperforms PELU? If such a scenario exists, it complicates the conclusion that PELU is inherently superior.
In conclusion, I remain unconvinced by the experimental design and the alignment between theoretical contributions and empirical evidence presented in this paper.
