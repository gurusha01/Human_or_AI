This paper presents Eve, a semi-automatic learning rate schedule designed for the Adam optimizer, showcasing its potential in enhancing neural network training. Although the novelty of the approach is somewhat constrained, the method exhibits promising outcomes. The manuscript is well-structured, and the accompanying visual aids are relevant and effective.
The strengths of this work include:
- The introduction of a potentially more advanced scheduling technique that surpasses the simplicity of a basic decay term
- The demonstration of plausible results on the CIFAR dataset, albeit with a relatively small neural network architecture
However, several aspects warrant further consideration:
- Investigating the impact of the momentum term on the optimizer's performance could provide valuable insights
- The reference to Adam cites an arXiv publication rather than the original conference paper, which may be seen as inconsistent
- The comparative analysis with Adam is not entirely definitive, suggesting a need for more comprehensive evaluations to fully ascertain the benefits of Eve.
