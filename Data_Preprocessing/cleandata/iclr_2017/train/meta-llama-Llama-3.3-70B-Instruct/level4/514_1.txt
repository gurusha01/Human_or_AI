The paper presents several strengths, including:
- A novel and well-defined framework for achieving invariance in signals with established structure, offering clarity in its formalism
- The numerical results provided are of good quality, supporting the theoretical contributions
However, there are also several weaknesses to consider:
- A significant limitation is the requirement for the structure to be predefined, which may not always be feasible
- The dataset used for the set structure is overly simplistic and may not adequately represent more complex real-world scenarios
- There is a noticeable disconnect between the comprehensive and sometimes intricate theoretical foundation introduced and the numerical experiments conducted, which could lead to confusion for new readers due to the lack of illustrative examples
Additionally, from my perspective, the subject matter and content of the paper have the potential to be suitable for a major conference, provided the author enhances the content. If the paper is rejected, I would advise against considering the workshop option if the intention is to publish it later in a conference, as major conferences may view workshop papers from ICLR as prior publications, a issue I have personally encountered.
