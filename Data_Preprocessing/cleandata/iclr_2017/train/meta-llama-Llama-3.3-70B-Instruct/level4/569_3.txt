This paper presents a novel approach to estimating image similarity by iteratively attending to each image in a recurrent manner, mirroring human behavior. Although the concept is intriguing, the paper has several drawbacks:
1. The writing quality is subpar, with numerous placeholders such as 'TODO' and 'CITE' present in the final version, suggesting a rushed submission or lack of attention to detail. In its current state, the paper is not suitable for publication.
2. The experimental results are incomplete, notably the absence of results on the LFW dataset, which is mentioned in the paper. As of the December 13th version, no such results could be found.
3. The experiments conducted on the Omniglot dataset are insufficient. To enhance clarity, the paper should include visualizations illustrating how the model attends to two images, such as the attention trajectory. It is perplexing that the paper describes the LFW dataset without providing corresponding results, which raises questions about the thoroughness of the experimental evaluation.
