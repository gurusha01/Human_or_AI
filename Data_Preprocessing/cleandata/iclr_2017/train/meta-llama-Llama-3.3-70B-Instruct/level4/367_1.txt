This paper offers a fresh perspective on binary auto-encoders by redefining the objective function in terms of a min-max reconstruction error across the training set, conditioned on the observed intermediate representations. A key finding is that this formulation yields a bi-convex problem, which can be effectively addressed through alternating minimisation techniques - a non-trivial contribution that constitutes the core of the paper. The authors support their approach with proof-of-concept experiments, demonstrating enhanced performance for single-hidden-layer auto-encoders compared to a standard method.
However, the experimental component of the paper is somewhat limited, given the extensive literature on auto-encoders, where numerous variants have been shown to outperform basic approaches without added complexity, such as denoising auto-encoders. Nonetheless, the paper's analytical framework leads to the development of a novel learning algorithm for a long-standing problem, making it a worthwhile topic for discussion.
