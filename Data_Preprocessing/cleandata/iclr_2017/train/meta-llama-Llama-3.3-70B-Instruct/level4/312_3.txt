This manuscript presents a novel approach to designing network architectures for specific tasks by leveraging reinforcement learning (RL) and recurrent neural networks (RNN). The underlying concept is intriguing, and the empirical results on two datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.
The strengths of this paper include:
1. The innovative use of RNN to generate network descriptions and RL to train the RNN is a compelling and promising idea.
2. The generated architectures exhibit similarities to those designed by humans, indicating a degree of compatibility between human expertise and the proposed network architectures.
However, there are some limitations:
1. The training process is computationally expensive and time-consuming, even with substantial computational resources.
2. The experiments lack a demonstration of the generalizability of the generated architectures, and it would be beneficial to evaluate their performance on other related datasets, particularly for the generated sequential models.
In conclusion, this is a well-written paper with a solid foundation. Nevertheless, additional experiments are necessary to fully demonstrate its potential advantages over human-designed models and to further establish its validity.
