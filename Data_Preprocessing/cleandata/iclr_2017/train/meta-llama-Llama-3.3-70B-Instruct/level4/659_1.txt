This manuscript presents a recurrent transducer that employs hard monotonic alignments, wherein a discrete decision is made at each step to either generate the next symbol or advance to the next input token. 
The proposed model exhibits a moderate level of novelty, as a similar architectural framework has been previously explored in the context of speech recognition.
