This paper presents a series of enhancements to PixelCNN, a generative model characterized by its tractable likelihood. Through empirical ablation experiments, the authors demonstrate the efficacy of each proposed modification, culminating in a new state-of-the-art performance on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The pursuit of improving generative models, particularly for image generation, is a vibrant area of research, and this contribution meaningfully advances the field.
The authors provide a compelling rationale for each modification they propose, substantiating their importance through ablation experiments. Notably, they adopt a discretized mixture of logistic distributions to model the conditional distribution of sub-pixels, eschewing the traditional 256-way softmax approach. This innovation reduces the output dimensionality and enhances the model's capacity to learn ordinal relationships between sub-pixel values. Furthermore, it accelerates training times and improves convergence during model optimization, as illustrated in Figure 6.
An intriguing observation is made regarding the dependencies between color channels of a pixel, suggesting they are relatively simple and do not necessitate a deep network for modeling. This insight enables a simplified architectural design, obviating the need to segregate feature maps into three groups based on their visibility of the R/G/B sub-pixel at the current location.
However, the predictive distribution for the green and blue channels lacks clarity, particularly in how the means of the mixture components linearly depend on the red sub-pixel's value. The inclusion of equations detailing this relationship would be beneficial.
Minor clarifications are needed: Figure 2 refers to a "Sequence of 6 layers," whereas the text (Section 2.4) describes 6 blocks of 5 ResNet layers, leaving the nature of the remaining layer unclear. Additionally, the initial "green square -> blue square" transition outside the white rectangle in Figure 2 requires explanation. Lastly, the rationale behind sharing the mixture indicator across all three channels warrants further discussion.
