I appreciated the opportunity to review this submission, which offers a thought-provoking exploration of generative modelling.
The paper's focus on connections between non-maximum likelihood training methods is particularly well-timed, given the current interest in this field. A key takeaway is the clarification that generative and discriminative losses can be decoupled, providing a valuable observation for the research community. Overall, this work provides insightful guidance for practitioners seeking to select appropriate objective functions for training implicit generative models.
My enthusiasm for the paper is tempered by uncertainty regarding the ICLR acceptance criteria. The writing style bears similarities to that of Sugiyama et al., whose papers are cited, which raises questions about evaluating novelty in this context. Furthermore, the absence of experimental results or mathematical theorems leaves me unsure about the types of contributions the ICLR committee prioritizes, prompting me to withhold a strong acceptance recommendation.
