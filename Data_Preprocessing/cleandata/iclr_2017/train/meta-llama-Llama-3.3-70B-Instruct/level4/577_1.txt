This paper presents a methodology aimed at interpreting the internal workings of neural networks by integrating linear classifier probes at multiple network levels.
The overall concept is commendable as it enables network architects to gain deeper insights into the representational capabilities of each layer. However, the execution appears somewhat premature. Notably, the absence of experimental results on state-of-the-art networks that compete in benchmarks undermines the strength of the findings, as it fails to provide sufficient evidence for researchers seeking to design competitive architectures.
To further enhance this research, it would be beneficial for the authors to explore the potential of utilizing the insights garnered from these linear classifiers to inform the development of improved network architectures. 
In its current form, however, the work lacks sufficient innovation to warrant acceptance at the conference.
