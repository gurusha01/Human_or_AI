This study presents an intriguing exploration of utilizing the Sine function as an activation function, demonstrating effective model training with Sine. Nevertheless, the range of applications investigated is somewhat restricted, which diminishes the persuasiveness of the findings. To bolster the argument, it would be beneficial to showcase promising outcomes on more substantial and practically significant tasks, in addition to the currently examined simplistic tasks.
