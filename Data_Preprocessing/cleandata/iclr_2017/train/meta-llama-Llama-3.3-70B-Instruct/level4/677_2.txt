The authors adapt the skip-graph architecture, initially proposed by Kiros in 2015, for the purpose of classifying labeled graphs, specifically molecular graphs. This adaptation involves generating numerous sentences through random walks on the graph, with the model tasked to predict both the preceding and succeeding parts from a given middle part. The activations from the decoder component of this model, derived from walks on a novel graph, serve as features for a binary classifier. This classifier is then utilized to predict whether a molecule exhibits anti-cancer properties.
The paper is well-structured and clearly written, with the exception of the evaluation section, which lacks specific details regarding the application of the embedding in the actual classification process, such as the type of classifier employed.
However, my familiarity with the dataset is limited, and thus I am unable to fully assess the significance of the results presented, particularly in terms of the difficulty in achieving them. This factor would be crucial in evaluating the paper's merits for acceptance.
