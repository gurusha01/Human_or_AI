This manuscript is clearly and effectively presented, with a well-structured approach. The utilization of a denoise autoencoder to learn an implicit probability distribution is a notable aspect, as it simplifies the training process. From my perspective, the joint training approach with an autoencoder offers supplementary gradient information that enhances the generator's performance. This methodology of providing auxiliary information could be a viable means to improve Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). 
Additional suggestion: It would be beneficial to include a more in-depth comparison with Energy-based GAN (EBGAN) in future revisions to further contextualize the contributions of this work.
