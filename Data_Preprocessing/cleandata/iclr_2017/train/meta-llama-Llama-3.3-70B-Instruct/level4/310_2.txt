The concept of training natural language systems through interactive referential communication games involving multiple agents is intriguing. As acknowledged by the authors, prior research has explored the use of multi-agent games for teaching communication, albeit to a limited extent, and this approach appears to be a promising direction for further investigation. The methodology of alternating between these games and supervised learning, as demonstrated in Section 5 and proposed in Section 6, seems particularly effective.
Regarding clarity, it appears that some network connections in Figure 1 may have been omitted, which, combined with the customized architecture and somewhat convoluted description in Section 3, may lead to confusion. The diagram may require refinement, and at the minimum, a caption should be added to facilitate the reader's understanding of the figure.
Overall, the framework presented in Section 2 is well-designed and appears to be highly effective and versatile, with reasonable results. It is likely that this work will inspire interesting variations in the future. However, it is worth noting that while I am confident in my comprehension of the paper, my familiarity with the most closely related literature is limited, which may impact my ability to accurately assess the work's position within its context.
