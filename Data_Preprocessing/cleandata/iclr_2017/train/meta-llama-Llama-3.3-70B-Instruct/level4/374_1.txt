This paper introduces a novel gating mechanism that integrates word and character representations, achieving a new state-of-the-art performance on the CBT dataset. Additionally, the proposed mechanism outperforms scalar gates without linguistic features on both the SQuAD dataset and a Twitter classification task.
It is expected that the vector-based gate would surpass the scalar gate, given its similarity to the gates used in LSTM and GRU architectures. In my opinion, the key contribution of this paper lies in its demonstration that incorporating features such as POS tags and NER enhances the learning of gates. The visualization provided in Figure 3 and the examples listed in Table 4 effectively illustrate the benefits of utilizing these features, which is a notable strength of the paper.
Overall, although the proposed gate may not be technically revolutionary, the paper offers a targeted and useful contribution that is likely to benefit the NLP community. As such, I recommend its acceptance.
