This paper explores bilingual word representation learning within a specific framework, where bilingual representation is acquired offline, utilizing pre-existing monolingual representations for both the source and target languages to learn a shared mapping. Additionally, it operates without direct word-to-word alignments between the languages. This setting is practically relevant, and the authors have successfully unified existing solutions by providing a theoretical foundation. Although the paper does not introduce a novel method for offline bilingual representation learning, its significance stems from several key contributions: 
1. A theoretical framework for offline bilingual representation learning.
2. The introduction of the inverted softmax technique.
3. The utilization of cognate words for languages with similar scripts.
4. Demonstrating the applicability of this approach at the sentence level, albeit to a limited extent.
The authors have adequately addressed my initial questions, and I find their responses satisfactory. However, I have a few additional observations and suggestions:
1. The header for Table 3, labeled as "word frequency," may be misleading, as it could imply that rare words are listed in row 1, whereas it appears that rare words are actually in row 5.
2. The removal of precision @5 and @10 from Table 6 prompts the question of whether this was due to space constraints or if the results showed a different trend. Including these results in the appendix would be beneficial.
3. The distinction between row 3 and row 4 in Table 6 is not entirely clear. Is the sole difference the use of NN versus inverted softmax, or are there other distinguishing factors? Further clarification would be helpful.
4. An additional experiment could involve using both an expert dictionary and a cognate dictionary. Comparing all three methods in this context would provide more insightful information about the utility of the cognate dictionary.
