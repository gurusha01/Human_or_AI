This manuscript introduces a novel non-linear activation function tailored for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and deep neural architectures. The proposed non-linearity demonstrates improved performance on a majority of relevant datasets, and its integration into operational networks is shown to incur only a negligible increase in computational overhead.
