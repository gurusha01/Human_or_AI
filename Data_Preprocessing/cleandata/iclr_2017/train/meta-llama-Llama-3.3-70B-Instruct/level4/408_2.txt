This paper presents a method for jointly learning word vector representations from character sequences and acoustic spans. The approach and experimental design are well-executed and clearly described. However, the motivation and tasks appear somewhat artificial, relying on the assumption that acoustic spans are available for words that have already been segmented from continuous speech. The evaluation tasks also seem somewhat contrived, and it would be beneficial to include phoneme-based comparisons, particularly when assessing character-based comparisons.
The discussion of character edit distance in relation to acoustic span similarity is extensive, but it would be natural to also consider phoneme string edit distance in this context. This is especially relevant to the word similarity test, where evaluating the edit distance of phone strings relative to acoustic embedding distances would provide a more comprehensive understanding. Furthermore, comparing character embeddings with phone string embeddings would make the paper more engaging, and this could be achieved by simply replacing characters with phones as the symbol set. The discussion and experiments should also examine homophones, as it is not immediately clear how the network would handle these cases.
The small vocabulary size and limited training data render this a relatively simplistic problem, with many of the constructed pairs likely being easily distinguishable. To strengthen the experiments and conclusions, a larger vocabulary and word segment dataset with subsampling of pairs, potentially biased towards more challenging or similar pairs, would be beneficial.
It appears that this approach is not suited for the task of keyword spotting in longer spoken utterances. If this is indeed the case, it would be helpful to include a discussion on why the problem of word embeddings given existing word segmentations is being addressed. The motivating example of using this approach for word retrieval seems flawed, as it would require a recognizer to segment words beforehand, which undermines the purpose of the proposed method.
