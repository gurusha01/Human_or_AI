Review- Strengths
-- The proposal presents a compelling approach to downsizing CNN architecture, making it suitable for embedded applications.
-- A well-rounded examination of both CNN macroarchitecture and microarchitecture is achieved through the incorporation of fire modules, demonstrating a balanced design.
-- Notably, the model achieves a significant reduction in memory usage, utilizing approximately 50 times less memory than AlexNet while maintaining comparable accuracy.
-- The experimental results are robust and supportive of the proposed methodology.
Weaknesses
-- To further enhance the validity of the findings, it would be beneficial to evaluate the performance of SqueezeNet across a diverse range of tasks.
-- A more in-depth analysis is required to elucidate the key factors contributing to SqueezeNet's success. For instance, a comparative analysis with architectures like ResNet and GoogleNet could provide valuable insights. Furthermore, drawing from established theoretical frameworks, such as the analysis of correlation structures in neural predictive models (as seen in Neural Networks, 1994), which highlights the benefits of "by-pass" architectures in capturing long-term dependencies, could enrich the discussion. A more rigorous theoretical underpinning, potentially leveraging perturbation analysis, would strengthen the current work and situates it within the broader context of neural network research.
