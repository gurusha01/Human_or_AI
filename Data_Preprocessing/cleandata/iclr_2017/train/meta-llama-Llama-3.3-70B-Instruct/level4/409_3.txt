The paper presents MusicNet, a novel dataset comprising over 30 hours of classical music with dense ground truth labels, provided in raw audio format. This dataset has the potential to significantly enhance music information retrieval (MIR) research, as its scale and scope surpass that of previously available datasets, thereby facilitating the application of modern machine learning techniques, such as deep learning. The paper's clarity and writing style are commendable.
However, the included experimental results, which utilize the dataset for a specific task, are less impressive. The authors focus on pitch identification in isolated audio segments, a relatively straightforward problem that may not necessitate machine learning, as traditional methods like peak picking on spectral representations could yield satisfactory results. The value added by the machine learning component in the proposed approach is unclear, and it is the authors' responsibility to demonstrate its usefulness.
A more convincing approach would be to showcase the dataset's versatility by exploring multiple prediction tasks, encompassing both low-level characteristics (e.g., pitch, onsets) and high-level attributes (e.g., composer), potentially using simpler models and spectrogram inputs. As it stands, the experiments, although rigorously conducted and properly evaluated, detract from the paper's primary contribution: the introduction of a unique and valuable dataset.
The observation in Section 4.5, that a pitch detector learns filters resembling pitches, is unsurprising, although the requirement for a substantial amount of data is noteworthy. A more compelling demonstration would involve higher-level tasks, and the comparison to prior work on end-to-end learning from raw audio is limited by the difference in task complexity.
While some may question the suitability of ICLR as a venue for introducing a new dataset, it is arguable that this platform will effectively reach the intended audience. Nevertheless, the paper's acceptance should not be based solely on its experimental results, which are not sufficiently impressive to warrant acceptance on their own merit.
