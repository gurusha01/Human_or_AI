This manuscript presents a compelling concept that builds upon the GAN framework by incorporating a bidirectional network, offering a fresh perspective. Overall, the paper is well-structured and clearly conveys its contributions. The theoretical analysis reveals that the proposed BiGAN method retains similar properties to those of traditional GANs. The empirical results demonstrate that BiGAN is competitive with existing approaches. One limitation of the method is the presence of a non-convex optimization problem; however, in my view, this does not detract from the paper's merit, and it remains a suitable candidate for acceptance.
