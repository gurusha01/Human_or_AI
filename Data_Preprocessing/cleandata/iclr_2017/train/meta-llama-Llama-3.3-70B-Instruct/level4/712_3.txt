I appreciated the opportunity to review this submission, which presented an intriguing application of VRNN-type generative models to financial data. However, due to my limited expertise in this area, I am unable to assess the significance of the reported performance gap, and therefore, I would not recommend acceptance at this time.
The primary concern I have with this paper is that it may not introduce substantial novelty. The combination of RNN and VAE has been explored in existing literature for over a year, and this work does not appear to propose significant modifications to this approach. As a result, it may be more suitable for a conference focused on applications rather than ICLR. Nevertheless, I am uncertain about ICLR's specific acceptance criteria, and it is possible that the committee prioritizes impressive performance and interesting applications, which could potentially outweigh the lack of novelty in this submission.
