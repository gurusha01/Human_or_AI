REVIEW SUMMARY:
This paper presents a novel dataset for assessing end-to-end goal-oriented dialog systems, specifically in a restaurant setting where users interact with a bot to find and book a table based on given parameters. The data is generated through simulation using an underlying knowledge base and rule-based transformations to create natural language descriptions. The primary objective is to rank candidate responses for each dialog turn, with evaluation metrics including per-response and per-dialog accuracy. The authors demonstrate that Memory Networks outperform basic bag-of-words baselines.
COMMENTS:
I appreciate the authors' contribution and find it interesting. However, I have reservations about the practicality of end-to-end trained systems in narrow-domain settings. In open-domain scenarios, end-to-end methods are justified due to the scalability issues of hand-coding states and responses. Nevertheless, in narrow-domain settings where domain knowledge is readily available, it seems more effective to leverage this knowledge to design optimal systems. 
Given the restricted domain, I am somewhat disappointed that the focus is on ranking rather than generating responses, although I acknowledge the ease of evaluation this approach provides. I am also unclear about how candidate responses are obtained in practice, as it appears that the models rank responses from the training, validation, and test sets. A key advantage of end-to-end training is its ability to scale to new domains without manual re-engineering; however, it is unclear how this information would be acquired for new domains. Generating responses would facilitate better generalization to new domains compared to ranking pre-collected generic responses, which I consider the weakest aspect of this work.
Furthermore, the simulation-based data generation approach, which expands tuples using natural language generation rules, inherently limits response variability in the training data. Although this allows for unlimited data generation, I could not find the list of rules used in the process. It would be beneficial to make this information publicly available.
Despite my reservations, I believe this is an interesting and worthy contribution to the conference.

I have revised my evaluation score in light of the additional clarifications and results provided.
