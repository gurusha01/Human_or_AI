This manuscript presents a modified version of the Graves model, incorporating a representation inspired by Plamondon's work. 
Notably, this approach deviates from a primary objective of deep learning, which aims to eliminate hand-engineered features and instead enable the network to learn from raw representations. 
The paper primarily relies on qualitative examples to demonstrate the system's capabilities, lacking a compelling justification for the purported advancements. 
Furthermore, the manuscript falls short of achieving true text-conditional handwriting synthesis, a capability demonstrated in Graves' original research. 
To enhance the manuscript's overall quality, it is essential to ensure consistency in the bibliography, including uniform references to authors such as Plamondon and standardized use of "et al." in citations.
