This paper builds upon the foundations established by QA-biLSTM and QA-biLSTM with attention mechanisms, as introduced by Tan et al. in 2015 and 2016, through two primary enhancements:
1. The development of a topic-specific word embedding, leveraging topic and title information from the dataset, employs an approach analogous to Paragraph2vec.
2. The paper addresses the multi-unit answer selection problem, where answers may be derived from multiple sections, such as the answer section and supplemental section, differing from the single answer selection problem explored in Tan et al.'s 2015 and 2016 studies. To maintain coherence across answer components, the paper utilizes a mechanism inspired by the attention mechanism presented in Tan et al.'s 2016 work.
Although the paper presents intriguing practical results, its core contributions are somewhat restricted in scope.
