This manuscript proposes a video modeling approach that decomposes videos into a background and 2D sprites with a latent hidden state, which is reasonably presented. Although the methodology appears sound, a significant limitation of this work is the absence of experimental evaluations on real-world, non-synthetic datasets. Consequently, while the research questions motivated by graphics are intriguing, it remains unclear whether this study provides effective tools for modeling a broader range of videos. In its current state, I believe this paper would be better suited as a workshop contribution.
