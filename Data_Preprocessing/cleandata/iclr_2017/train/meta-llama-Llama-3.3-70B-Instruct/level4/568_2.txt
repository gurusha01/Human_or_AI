This paper introduces a novel neural network architecture for sentence representation, drawing inspiration from the successes of residual networks in Computer Vision and observations of word morphology in Natural Language Processing. Although the paper demonstrates the model's potential by achieving top results on several datasets, it falls short in providing substantial evidence, intuition, or motivation to justify the design of the network architecture.
Specifically:
- The contribution of this paper is unclear, as it is difficult to discern whether the key innovation lies in the character-aware word embedding, the residual network, or a combination of both.
- The incorporation of residual networks, as described in section 3.3, appears to overlook fundamental differences between image and sentence representation. Despite the results indicating an improvement with the addition of residual networks, the explanation of what the residual component captures from a sentence modeling perspective is lacking, making it challenging to be convinced of its efficacy.
- The classification framework integrates multiple components, including a character-aware model for word embedding, residual networks, and attention weights in Type 1 features. To better understand the impact of each component on the final performance, it would be beneficial to see a more comprehensive ablation study, as the current results in Table 3 only partially address this.
- In equation (5), the variable $i$ in $G_i$ is not clearly defined, requiring further clarification.
- Additionally, the citation format used throughout the paper is not in line with standard practices, which could lead to confusion and inconsistencies in referencing prior work.
