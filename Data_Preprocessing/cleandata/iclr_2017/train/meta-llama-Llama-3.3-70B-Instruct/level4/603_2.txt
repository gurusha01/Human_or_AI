Review- Strengths:
  The application of neural networks to a novel domain is a notable aspect of this work.
Weaknesses:
  A major concern is the lack of clarity regarding the guarantee of syntactically correct code generation by the network.
Questions and Comments:
  Could the authors provide further details on how the top 5 accuracy for NT2N+NTN2T is calculated? Is it based on maximizing the product of the posterior probabilities of the two classifications?
  Was an exhaustive examination of all possible combinations of NT2N decisions with NTN2T considerations conducted?
  The inclusion of UNK seems like an obvious choice and should have been integrated into all models from the outset, given that the authors had control over the lexicon size and thus the range of possible predictions.
  A more pertinent inquiry would be determining the optimal alpha value for UNK, which aligns with my previous commentary on estimating and utilizing UNK.
  In Section 5.5, the second paragraph presents a comparison of numbers that are not directly comparable, which may lead to misleading conclusions.
