This manuscript presents a multiview learning framework designed to identify dependent subspaces by maximizing cross-view similarity between data sample neighborhoods, motivated by applications in information retrieval. The authors position their approach as an alternative to Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)-based multiview learning, although it is noted that CCA techniques serve a distinct purpose and are more broadly applicable. Key observations include:
- The authors' discussion of time complexity appears to be limited to the computational cost of evaluating the objective function in equation (7), without providing insight into the number of iterations required for the L-BFGS method. Given the complexity of the optimization problem, it would be beneficial to offer some guidance on the practicality of optimizing the objective in equation (7) and how this varies with different problem dimensions. While the authors acknowledge that scalability is not their primary concern, any remarks about computational cost should be clarified to indicate that the reported cost pertains to a specific component of their approach rather than overall time complexity.
- In comparing their approach to CCA, the authors should acknowledge that CCA, despite being a nonconvex optimization problem, can be solved exactly with a computational cost that scales linearly with data size and quadratically with dimensionality, even with a naive implementation. In contrast, the proposed method does not immediately appear to be tractable.
- The empirical results using synthetic data are somewhat perplexing. The data generation process is overly complicated, involving separate processing of each coordinate in different groups, followed by permutation and combination. A simpler benchmark, where different linear transformations of a shared representation are applied with independent noise, would be sufficient to demonstrate the proposed method's efficacy. Furthermore, it is unclear why CCA fails to recover the true subspace, as the level of additive noise would be expected to impact recoverability. The proposed method achieves nearly exact recovery, suggesting that the noise level may not be severe. Additionally, it is essential to clarify whether regularization is used with CCA, as the absence of regularization can lead to unusual behavior.
