This manuscript presents a novel expert model that selects a sparse subset of the most reliable experts, deviating from the conventional logarithmic opinion pool of a Product of Experts (PoE). 
However, I found the paper to be lacking in clarity. Despite efforts to identify a clear definition of the joint model p(x,z), it remained elusive, and consequently, the connection to the proposed "EM-like" algorithm was unclear. It is uncertain whether such a definition exists, and if so, whether the algorithm's iterates are guaranteed to converge on the training data by optimizing a specific objective function.
Additionally, it is worth noting that the "product of unifac models" approach, as explored by Hinton, shares similarities with the proposed method, where a subset of experts is activated to generate the input, achieving a related goal.
