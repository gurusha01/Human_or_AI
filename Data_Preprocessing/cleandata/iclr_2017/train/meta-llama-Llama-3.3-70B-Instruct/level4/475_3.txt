This paper presents a compelling approach to addressing reparameterization in VAEs with discrete variables by introducing a shared smoothing transformation between the generative and recognition models, which facilitates cancellations. 
A notable additional contribution is the incorporation of an RBM as the prior model P(z) and the utilization of autoregressive connections within both the generative and recognition models. However, the overall framework becomes somewhat intricate, making it challenging to discern the primary factors driving the reported strong performance; separate experiments investigating each contribution would have provided valuable insights. 
Although the complexity of the framework may pose a challenge, the development of user-friendly software that enables plug-and-play functionality could mitigate this issue. 
Ultimately, the paper's richness in ideas and potential impact lead me to believe it would be a significant and valuable addition to the conference.
