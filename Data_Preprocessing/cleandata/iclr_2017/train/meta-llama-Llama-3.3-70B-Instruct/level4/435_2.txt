This study presents an intriguing examination of learning rate schedules, incorporating the concept of restarts, a frequently neglected aspect in deep learning. A comprehensive analysis is conducted on complex datasets, yielding promising results, although the conclusions are not entirely definitive. Nevertheless, the approach demonstrates sufficient novelty to justify publication, with the obtained results being notably favorable. 
I appreciate the authors' efforts in revising the manuscript in response to my feedback.
Minor corrections:
- "flesh" should be replaced with "flush" to ensure accuracy.
