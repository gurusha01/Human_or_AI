This paper introduces an enhanced visual attention model that incorporates a deformable sampling lattice, offering a notable improvement over the fixed sampling lattice approach used in prior research. The proposed method demonstrates that varying sampling strategies can emerge based on the specific visual classification tasks, with empirical evidence showing that the learned sampling lattice outperforms fixed strategies. Notably, when the attention mechanism is limited to translation, the model learns a sampling lattice that bears a resemblance to the primate retina. 
The strengths of the paper include:
+ Its clear organization and writing style, making it easy to follow.
+ The comprehensive qualitative analysis presented in the experimental section, which provides valuable insights.
However, there are areas for improvement:
- The paper would significantly benefit from additional experiments conducted on diverse datasets to enhance its validity and generalizability.
- The tables do not clearly indicate whether the proposed learned sampling lattice offers computational advantages over a fixed sampling strategy with zooming capabilities, such as that employed in the DRAW model.
Overall, the paper is engaging and shows promise. To strengthen the experimental section, it would be beneficial to include more experiments and quantitative analyses with other baselines. Given that the current version of the paper only presents experiments on a digit dataset with a black background, it is challenging to generalize the findings or verify the claims, such as the linear relationship between eccentricity and sampling interval leading to the structure of the primate retina, based solely on the results from a single dataset.
