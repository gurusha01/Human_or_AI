This paper presents a novel approach to question answering with lengthy contextual documents, introducing a dynamic coattention network architecture. 
The proposed model effectively captures interdependent representations of both the question and the document, utilizing a dynamic decoder that iteratively identifies potential answer spans to determine the final answer.
In general, the paper is well-structured and clearly written. 
Despite the complexity of the model, which incorporates a coattention encoder, an iterative dynamic pointing decoder, and a highway maxout network, the authors provide a lucid explanation of the underlying intuitions and technical details. 
Furthermore, the model demonstrates strong performance on the SQuAD dataset. 
Based on the overall quality and contribution of the paper, I strongly recommend it for acceptance.
