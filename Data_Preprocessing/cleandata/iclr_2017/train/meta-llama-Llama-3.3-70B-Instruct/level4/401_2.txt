The manuscript is well-written and presents a novel concept. However, several key details necessary for result replication, including CNN layer sizes and learning rates, are omitted. A more thorough description of the introspection network's training process would be beneficial. Furthermore, utilizing a more contemporary state-of-the-art model in the ImageNet experiments would have strengthened the findings. Despite these shortcomings, I suggest accepting the paper due to its innovative idea. Addressing these concerns in a revised draft would warrant a higher rating.
