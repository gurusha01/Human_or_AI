This manuscript proposes a heuristic approach to mitigate the impact of large negative rewards by encapsulating past adverse experiences into a "danger model", thereby informing future decision-making. The writing is engaging, with notable instances of eloquent language.
The efficacy of this heuristic is demonstrated through experiments in two simplified domains. However, a more comprehensive evaluation would ideally utilize established benchmarks, such as Atari games, which are replete with catastrophic outcomes like sudden death, making them a suitable testbed for this concept.
Notable phrases that succinctly capture the essence of the manuscript include: 
"Envisioning an autonomous vehicle that must occasionally collide with pedestrians to recall the undesirability of such actions."
"A child can adapt its behavior without needing to inflict harm on others."
"The ever-present risk of catastrophe just beyond the optimal boundary."
