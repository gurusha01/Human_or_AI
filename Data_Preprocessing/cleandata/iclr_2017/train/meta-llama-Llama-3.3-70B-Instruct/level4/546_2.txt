The authors undertake the crucial task of deriving analytical equations that govern physical systems from observational data, a pursuit of significant importance due to its potential to uncover concise and interpretable rules underlying these systems. Nevertheless, their approach relies on simplistic and outdated methodologies that lack the sophistication required to tackle complex problems, thereby failing to introduce novel insights or meaningful advancements to the field.
The essence of the paper, including its introductory four pages, can be distilled into a single statement: 
"Training a small network with activation functions based on the product of cosine, sinusoid, and input elements to yield sparse weights (L1 regularization)".
The network's learned weights, constrained by a predefined structure, are then presented as the derived equation.
This study employs methodologies reminiscent of literature from the 1990s, as evidenced by the use of antiquated terminology (e.g., ANN on page 3), and neglects to incorporate contemporary techniques that have substantially advanced the field since then. It is recommended that the authors familiarize themselves with current literature and continue exploring this important research direction.
