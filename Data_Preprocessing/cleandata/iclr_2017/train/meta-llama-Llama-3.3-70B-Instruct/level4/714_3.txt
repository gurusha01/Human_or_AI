This manuscript presents a method utilizing unsupervised learning techniques for feature learning within a reinforcement learning framework. However, the terminology "unsupervised" is misleading, as the incorporation of a "causality prior" that relies on reward signals for training essentially renders this a reinforcement learning approach rather than unsupervised learning.
The experimental component of the study appears underdeveloped. The task undertaken is straightforward, involving the movement of a robot's head in two directions, and lacks a comparative analysis against established baselines.
Furthermore, the conclusions drawn by the authors regarding the potential of the proposed method for transfer learning are not substantiated by empirical evidence. 
Ultimately, the paper suffers from conceptual ambiguity and premature presentation, failing to provide a convincing or comprehensive exploration of its subject matter.
