This paper presents a novel regularizer designed to facilitate escape from saddle points in optimization processes, drawing inspiration from physical principles. The core idea is to view the optimization process as the movement of a positively charged particle over the error surface, which would be repelled by saddle points due to their positive charge. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method across various datasets.
The strengths of this paper include its intriguing concept and the diverse range of experimental results provided. However, several weaknesses detract from its overall impact. Firstly, the justification for the proposed method is not sufficiently robust. Additionally, the paper suffers from poor writing quality, which hinders clarity and understanding. The experimental results, while diverse, are not convincing enough to fully support the authors' claims.
A major criticism is the lack of clear exposition in the paper. Variables are introduced without proper explanation or definition, such as the variable $p$ in section 2.3, which is first mentioned in Equation 6 without prior introduction. The equations themselves require refinement to improve the paper's flow, including the proper introduction of variables before they are used.
Equation 6, in particular, appears without adequate explanation or justification, despite its significance to the paper. A detailed analysis of its implications from an optimization perspective would be valuable. Furthermore, it is essential to clarify that $\phi$ is a function with its own hyperparameter $\alpha$, rather than a parameter itself.
To strengthen the paper, it would be beneficial to include validation or test results on a few tasks, as the introduced method is presented as an additional cost function. The impact of this method on validation and test results would be noteworthy. The authors should also provide a more in-depth discussion on the selection of hyperparameters for their models.
Figures 2 and 3 do not significantly contribute to the paper and are challenging to interpret. The numerous figures under section 3.4.2 lack labels and captions, making them difficult to understand due to their small size and barely readable labels.
One specific question arises regarding the backpropagation process: Do the authors also backpropagate through $\tilde{\mW}_i^t$?
