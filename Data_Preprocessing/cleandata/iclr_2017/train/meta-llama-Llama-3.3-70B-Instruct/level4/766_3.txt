The authors employ the widely utilized Fast RCNN detection framework for pedestrian detection, leveraging "EdgeBoxes" object proposals and integrating batch normalization into their network architecture. Experimental results are presented on the INRIA and ETH pedestrian datasets, yielding reasonable yet unremarkable performance that falls short of current state-of-the-art standards. Notably, the paper omits results on the Caltech Pedestrians dataset, which has become the de facto benchmark for evaluating pedestrian detection algorithms. A more significant concern, however, is the lack of innovative contributions in this work. The described detection system represents a straightforward application of Fast RCNN to pedestrian detection, without introducing any novel elements. The use of EdgeBoxes in conjunction with Fast RCNN has been explored previously, and the authors appear to be unaware of recent advancements in object detection, such as Faster RCNN.
