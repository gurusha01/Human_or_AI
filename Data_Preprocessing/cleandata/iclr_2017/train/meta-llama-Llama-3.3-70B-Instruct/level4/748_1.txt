The proposed system achieves performance comparable to the bi-directional LSTM baseline for Neural Machine Translation (NMT), leveraging the inherent parallelizability of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
The core concepts involve utilizing two stacked CNNs, one for encoding and one for decoding, incorporating residual connections and position embeddings for translation. Although previous attempts have been made to apply CNNs to translation tasks, as noted by the authors, it appears that the unique combination of architectural elements, such as attention mechanisms and position embeddings, enables the current system to rival Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) in terms of performance, whereas earlier efforts were less successful. The authors conduct sensitivity analyses, including experiments to determine the optimal number of layers in each CNN.
The experimental results are thoroughly and clearly presented. However, the inclusion of one or two additional figures would significantly enhance the clarity of the system's architecture.
This paper focuses more on the effective combination of existing techniques rather than introducing novel representation learning methods, demonstrating how the authors' specific choices yield strong results on the reported NMT tasks. While I am convinced that the paper represents solid work in the machine learning domain, I have some reservations regarding its alignment with the specific focus of this conference.
