This paper presents an intriguing concept, wherein the authors investigate the utilization of multiple discriminators in ensemble form for generative adversarial network training, yielding several advantages. Notably, this approach enables the use of less powerful discriminators, which can provide a more suitable training signal to the generator, particularly in the early stages of training when more powerful discriminators might overwhelm it.
My primary concern lies in the presentation of the paper. The caption of Figure 1 and Section 3.1 imply selecting the best discriminator by taking the maximum performance of individual ensemble members. However, this strategy may not be optimal, as it would likely result in a stricter training signal than any individual ensemble member. In contrast, the paper's exploration of relaxing this maximum and examining various averaging techniques to derive a 'soft-discriminator' appears more compelling, with the results lending support to this approach. Upon initial review, it seemed that the authors primarily advocated for using the strongest discriminator, as evidenced by my initial question prior to thoroughly reviewing the paper.
In summary, I believe this paper makes a valuable contribution, and the concept of employing multiple discriminators is a promising direction worth exploring.
