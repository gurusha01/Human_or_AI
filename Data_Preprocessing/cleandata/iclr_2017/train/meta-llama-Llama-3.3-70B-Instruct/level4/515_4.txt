This paper presents a novel application of the Tensor Train factorization method for modeling feature interactions in supervised classification tasks. By approximating tensors of arbitrary dimensions using low-rank matrix products, Tensor Train enables control over the complexity of the approximation through the rank parameter. The authors demonstrate the efficacy of this approach on various binary classification datasets.
The paper's core contribution lies in adapting the TT formalism, developed by one of the authors, to model feature interactions, as well as introducing a gradient algorithm that leverages the geometrical structure of the factorization. These concepts are likely innovative in the machine learning domain. The algorithm's complexity is reasonable for inference and could potentially be scaled up to larger problems, although the experiments presented are limited in scope.
However, the experimental section is disorganized, incomplete, and requires improvement. Notably, the description of dataset characteristics is lacking, and performance metrics are not provided for all datasets. While each dataset is used to illustrate a specific aspect of the model, a more comprehensive evaluation, including classification performance and baseline comparisons, would be beneficial. The experiments on the UCI datasets only report optimization performance on the training set, and it would be informative to include similar curves for the test sets to demonstrate the algorithm's generalizability. The comparison to other approaches in section 8.4 is restricted to artificial data, which may not accurately represent diverse real-world scenarios. Similarly, the analysis of Dropout's role is incomplete, and the comparison on the Movielens dataset is lacking. Furthermore, all experiments are conducted on small-scale problems.
In summary, the paper offers original contributions that warrant publication. Nevertheless, the experimental evaluation is incomplete and inconclusive. A more thorough comparison with competing methods, such as Factorization Machines, would enhance the paper's validity and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the proposed approach.
