This manuscript explores the concept of morphing neural network and CNN architectures, presenting notable research in this area. However, the authors' evaluation is limited, as it does not include results from larger, more complex models such as ResNet on the ImageNet dataset, or newer architectures like Xception and DenseNet, which may be considered state-of-the-art. Furthermore, the majority of the results are obtained using small datasets and networks, which raises concerns about the scalability and applicability of these techniques in real-world, production environments. A major concern is the lack of detailed information regarding the computational resources and time required for these methods, which is crucial for assessing the practicality and feasibility of implementing such techniques, particularly when the performance gains are modest.
