The authors have adequately addressed my inquiries, and I appreciate their response. My evaluation remains unchanged.
This paper presents a hierarchical transfer learning framework for sequence tagging, designed to leverage the source task to enhance the target task by sharing multiple levels of representation. The proposed framework is generalizable to various neural models. The paper boasts comprehensive and robust experiments, with competitive performance on multiple benchmark datasets. The framework is well-defined, although additional details regarding the training procedure, specifically in Section 3.3, would be beneficial.
The experimental results demonstrate that the framework can improve the performance of low-resource target tasks in certain task pairs {s, t}, with the degree of improvement increasing as more levels of representation are shared. I recommend that the authors provide more precise definitions for the terms "source" and "target" within the current framework, as the task sampling method described in Section 3.3 renders the distinction between s and t somewhat interchangeable. In essence, the difference lies in the resource availability, suggesting a multi-tasking approach between tasks with imbalanced resources. This raises questions about whether the framework can simultaneously benefit both tasks in a pair by learning more generalizable representations, or if it primarily aids the low-resourced task at the expense of the high-resourced one.
Furthermore, while the paper shows improvements for low-resourced tasks in selected task pairs, it would be interesting to investigate the frequency of such occurrences. Specifically, when tasks are randomly paired from low-resource and high-resource pools, how often can the framework improve the performance of the low-resourced task? Additionally, the choice of T-A, T-B, or T-C is intuitively based on the number of shareable representation levels, implying that sharing more leads to greater benefits. Although this assumption is plausible, empirical comparisons, such as selecting cross-domain pairs to verify if T-A > T-B > T-C, would be valuable.
Overall, I consider this a solid paper with potential for further exploration. Therefore, I am inclined to accept this paper.
