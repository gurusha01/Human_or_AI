This paper lacks clarity in presenting several crucial details, which hinders its potential impact. Although the proposed model exhibits promise, its current form is not suitable for publication.
Specifically:
The explanation of R_l,pi convolutions in Section 2.1 is ambiguous, particularly with regards to the labels pi, which are not clearly defined, leaving the reader uncertain about their meaning.
The description of the SAEN structure in Section 2.2 is poorly articulated. Based on Equation 1, it appears that the 'shift' operation involves summing the representations of member objects, while the 'aggregate' operation concatenates representations from multiple relations. However, it seems more logical to average the representations of the object's members, denoted as h_j, rather than summing them, in the 'shift' step.
The compression technique outlined in Section 2.3 relies on multiple objects at a given level having identical representations. Given that these representations are high-dimensional and real-valued, it is unclear why this would occur. The provided text is confusing, stating that "two objects are equivalent if they are made by same sets of parts for all the pi-parameterizations of the R_l,pi decomposition relation," which lacks clarity.
Furthermore, the 'ego graph patterns' depicted in Figure 1 and the 'Ego Graph Neural Network' used in the experiments are not explained in the text, and no relevant references are provided. As a result, it is challenging to assess the quality and validity of the experiments presented.
