This manuscript explores the challenge of acquiring concise binary data representations, but I struggled to comprehend the context and the presentation of the paper failed to clarify my understanding. A straightforward explanation of the problem is lacking, and my unfamiliarity with this research area was not alleviated by the text. Despite thoroughly reviewing the authors' responses to reviewers' queries and re-examining the paper, the setting remains unclear, hindering my ability to assess the contributions of this study. The absence of a dedicated related work section is notable, with relevant literature analysis dispersed throughout the paper instead. Furthermore, the paper lacks derivations and often omits references to support statements, such as those in the fourth paragraph of Section 3. Consequently, I believe the manuscript requires substantial revision before it can be considered suitable for publication.
