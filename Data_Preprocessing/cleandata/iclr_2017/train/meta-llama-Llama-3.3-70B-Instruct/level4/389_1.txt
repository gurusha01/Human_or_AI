The paper presents a novel approach using SampleRNN for direct waveform signal modeling, demonstrating superior performance in both objective test NLL and subjective A/B testing outcomes.
However, as noted in the discussion, the current manuscript lacks sufficient detail in its model description, an omission that ideally should be rectified in the final submission.
The comparison to the wavenet model, as attempted by the authors, is undermined by their inability to surpass the baseline LSTM-RNN performance, rendering the wavenet comparisons less persuasive. Consequently, a more fruitful approach might involve dedicating more space to elaborating on the proposed SampleRNN model rather than pursuing comparisons with wavenet that do not yield conclusive insights.
