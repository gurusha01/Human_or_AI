This study builds upon existing research on pointer models by integrating its outputs with conventional softmax outputs, presenting an intriguing concept for context biasing through a relatively straightforward approach. 
Although the notion of combining pointer-based and standard models has been explored in prior literature, the unique aspect of this paper lies in its implementation as a mixture model, which distinguishes it to some extent.
The paper's clarity and the promising results it yields are notable strengths. Additionally, the newly introduced WikiText dataset created by the authors appears to be highly relevant and of significant interest.
One notation-related observation warrants mention: the symbol $p{ptr}$ is utilized in distinct ways in equations 3 and 5, specifically as $p{ptr}(w)$ versus $p{ptr}(yi|x_i)$. This dual usage is potentially confusing, given that the domains differ substantially - a set of words in equation 3 versus a list of context words in equation 5. To enhance readability and avoid confusion, it would be beneficial to employ distinct symbols for these two entities.
