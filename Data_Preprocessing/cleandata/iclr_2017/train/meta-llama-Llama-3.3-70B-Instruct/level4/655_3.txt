This paper presents a proposal for utilizing the BPA criterion in the context of classifier ensembles.
A primary issue with the paper is its tendency to conflate multiple concepts, resulting in a lack of clarity for some fundamental ideas. Specifically:
(1) The term "distributed" in this context refers solely to classifier ensembles and does not pertain to distributed training or computation mechanisms, although it is acknowledged that individual classifiers can be trained in a distributed manner, which is not the focus of the paper.
(2) The paper employs "transfer learning" in a limited sense, essentially involving the fine-tuning of the last layer of a pre-trained classifier.
Beyond the conceptual overlap, additional concerns with the paper include:
(1) It is unclear how the BPA criterion more effectively addresses class imbalance compared to simple re-weighting methods. The BPA criterion assigns equal weights to different classes, regardless of the number of training data points in each class. This can be readily addressed in conventional training by introducing a class-specific weight term for each data point, with the weight being the inverse of the number of data points.
(2) Algorithm 2 is misrepresented, suggesting the use of test data during training, which is incorrect. Only training and validation datasets should be utilized. The paper's terminology, often combining "train/validation" and distinguishing it from "test," is confusing and lacks clear differentiation between these datasets.
(3) If understood correctly, the proposal involves computing the BPA in batches, meaning it can only be calculated after running the model on the entire train/validation dataset. This approach seems to contradict the stochastic gradient descent methods typically used in deep network training. An explanation of how BPA accommodates this discrepancy, along with an experimental report on computational cost and timing, appears to be missing.
Overall, the paper suffers from a lack of clarity and ambiguous key definitions, which hinders a comprehensive understanding of the proposed methodology.
