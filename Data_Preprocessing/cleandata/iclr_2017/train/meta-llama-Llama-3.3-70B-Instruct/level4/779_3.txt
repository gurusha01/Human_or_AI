This paper proposes multiple approaches to identify a limited set of target vocabulary for each source sentence, yielding substantial improvements in efficiency. The findings are persuasive, and in my opinion, this work provides tangible benefits to broadly applicable sequence-to-sequence methods for language tasks. Nevertheless, the novelty of this research is somewhat limited, as it primarily builds upon and expands the existing work of (Mi et al., 2016) by introducing additional vocabulary selection strategies and conducting more comprehensive experiments. The content of this paper would be more suitably presented at a natural language processing conference.
