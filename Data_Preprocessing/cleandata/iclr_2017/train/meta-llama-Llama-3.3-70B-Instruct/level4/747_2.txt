The authors suggest assessing "feature importance" by identifying the pixels that most significantly influence a network's image classification. A basic approach to measuring feature importance involves calculating the gradients of the predicted class with respect to each pixel in the input image, assigning a score to each pixel that indicates how much the output prediction would change if that pixel were altered. This paper expands on this concept by proposing to measure feature importance through the computation of gradients of the output with respect to scaled versions of the input image, obtained by multiplying the image by a scalar alpha between 0 and 1, and then summing these gradients across all alpha values. This scaling process, referred to as generating "counterfactuals," is essentially a linear scaling of pixel values, ranging from a completely black image (alpha=0) to the original image (alpha=1).
The authors present various visualizations demonstrating that their proposed feature importance score yields more reasonable results than simply examining gradients with respect to the original image. They also provide some quantitative evidence suggesting that the pixels highlighted by their measure are more likely to coincide with objects in the image rather than spurious regions, as illustrated in figure 5. Additionally, the method is applied to other types of networks. However, the quantitative analysis is limited, and the majority of the paper focuses on qualitative results.
While understanding deep networks is a crucial goal, it is unclear whether this paper significantly contributes to this understanding. The primary interesting observation is that scaling an image by a small alpha value (creating a faint image) assigns more importance to pixels related to the object associated with the correct class prediction. Beyond this, the paper builds upon this observation but does not provide deeper insights. The authors offer an intuitive explanation for why using small alpha values may force the network to focus on the object, but this argument is not convincing. Further exploration of this concept could be valuable but may be challenging.
Ultimately, the usefulness of the proposed scheme for feature importance ranking is uncertain. The scheme is still quite noisy and does not substantially enhance our understanding of a deep network's behavior on a particular image. Performing a single gradient descent step on an image or its scaled versions barely scratches the surface of the network's internal workings. Moreover, as the authors acknowledge, the scheme assumes pixel independence, which is clearly an oversimplification.
Given the simplicity of the idea presented, the paper is excessively long, spanning 14 pages in the main body and up to 19 pages with references and appendices. The writing is often verbose and long-winded, which detracts from the paper's overall impact. The introduction of unnecessary terminology, such as "Gradients of Counterfactuals," adds complexity without contributing significant value to the ideas explored. It would be beneficial for the authors to condense the writing and figures into a more concise and readable format, clearly articulating the key concepts early on.
