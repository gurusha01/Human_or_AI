The primary contribution of this paper appears to be the development of a set of differential graph transformations, enabling the application of gradient descent to graph-to-graph classification tasks. This conceptually aligns with learning a cellular automaton, represented as a sequence of graphs, where the graph expands at each iteration with nodes interconnected and special nodes denoting values. The proposed architecture facilitates learning this graph sequence, although the experimental results for the Rule 30 task fell short of a comprehensive solution.
This concept is integrated with elements from preceding research (GGS-NN) to enhance the model's capability to generate textual output, leveraging graphs as an intermediate representation. This synergy allows the model to surpass the state-of-the-art performance on BaBi tasks.
