This paper introduces a novel framework for addressing the super-resolution (SR) problem, leveraging amortized MAP inference and incorporating a pre-learned affine projection layer to ensure output consistency with low-resolution (LR) inputs. Additionally, it proposes three distinct methods for minimizing cross-entropy. Overall, the paper is well-written and presents a significant contribution. However, several aspects warrant further clarification:
1) The proposed amortized MAP inference approach is innovative and diverges from traditional SR methods. When combined with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), this framework yields plausible and promising results. Nevertheless, in comparison to other GAN-based SR methods, such as Photo-Realistic Single Image Super-Resolution Using a Generative Adversarial Network, it is essential to assess what novel insights this formulation brings to the current state-of-the-art.
2) The use of an affine projection architecture as a constraint eliminates the need for corresponding high-resolution (HR) and LR image pairs during training. However, the training process for the affine projection layer still requires these pairs. It is unclear whether this simply shifts the training procedure to the affine projection layer.
3) The paper presents an array of results for the proposed framework, including those obtained from natural images in the ImageNet dataset. To facilitate a comprehensive comparison with prior work, it would be beneficial to include results from conventional SR test datasets, such as Set5, Set14, and BSD100.
4) The results for natural images presented in the paper are limited to a size of 128x128 pixels. It is essential to determine whether this framework can perform effectively on larger images, as SR applications often involve inputs of arbitrary sizes.
5) Typically, GANs incorporate a noise term as a latent space, enabling the learning of a distribution. It would be interesting to know if the authors explored the use of a noise vector in their approach.
In conclusion, this paper offers a novel framework for SR, backed by rigorous theoretical analysis. The idea is innovative, and the authors explore multiple methods. Although some questions remain, and additional experiments are necessary, this work has the potential to inspire the community and provide valuable insights into SR research.
