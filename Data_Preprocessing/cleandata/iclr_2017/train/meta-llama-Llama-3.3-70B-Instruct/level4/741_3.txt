This submission presents an analysis of 1029 tic-tac-toe boards, categorized into 18 classes based on the location and color of the next play that can end the game. A convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained to predict these categories with 100% accuracy, with the supervision essentially indicating the winning move, such as "placing a black square in the middle right results in a black win." The paper's primary focus is on utilizing Zhou et al's Class Activation Mapping (CAM) to visualize the CNN's decision-making process. By inputting a specific class, for instance, class 1, which corresponds to a black win with a play in the bottom right square, CAM identifies the area of focus for the CNN's decision. The results show that the CNN concentrates on the empty bottom right square, as expected, and also conditions its decision on other parts of the board to determine potential three-in-a-row combinations.
While this finding is somewhat interesting, the paper's implications regarding the discovery of game rules and its connection to weakly supervised learning and multi-modal learning are not entirely clear. The writing is generally good, despite some minor grammatical errors, but the significance of the discovery is not readily apparent. Furthermore, the scenario seems somewhat contrived, as it involves using a complex CNN for a relatively simple game domain and a specific visualization method. As someone without expertise in reinforcement learning, which is related to but not directly involved in this work, it is possible that the paper's value may be underestimated. Nevertheless, the use of a large, expressive CNN for this task and the reliance on a particular visualization technique raise concerns about the approach's appropriateness.
