This study endeavors to elucidate and visualize the representations of deep neural networks as one progresses from lower to higher levels of the architecture. Consistent with prior research, the findings indicate that lower levels of the network are primarily focused on local image features, whereas higher levels are associated with more abstract properties, such as object identity. An analysis of the semantic space reveals that higher-level nodes exhibit greater semantic selectivity, in contrast to lower-level nodes, which display more diffuse characteristics.
The investigation appears to be a worthwhile effort to dissect the representations of deep neural networks. A key discovery is the pervasive influence of color across all levels of the network, accompanied by a significant decline in performance when processing grayscale images. The newly introduced NF measure seems reasonable, although it is still grounded in the images presented to the network. Ultimately, a more profound understanding of the functional role of these nodes is desired, specifically in terms of determining which images, out of all possible images, maximally activate a given unit. Although this poses a challenging problem, the color analysis presented here contributes to a deeper understanding of this issue. The semantic analysis is well-executed, but its novelty and impact are not entirely clear, as it is uncertain what new perspectives or insights are gained from this aspect of the study.
