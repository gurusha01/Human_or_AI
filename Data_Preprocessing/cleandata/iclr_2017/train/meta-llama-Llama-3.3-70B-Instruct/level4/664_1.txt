This manuscript presents a novel application of the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework to the field of steganography. The proposed approach employs an additional steganalyser discriminator, which receives negative examples from the generator and positive examples from generated images containing a hidden payload, alongside the standard GAN discriminator. Consequently, the generator learns to produce realistic images that deceive the GAN discriminator, while also becoming a secure container that evades detection by the steganalyser discriminator. The methodology is evaluated by training an independent steganalyser, S*, on both real and generated images.
However, considering the limited familiarity with steganography literature within the ICLR community, I believe the paper would benefit from providing more contextual information on the practical applications of this method, as well as a more comprehensive review of related works on steganalysis-secure message embedding and a more extensive set of experiments across multiple datasets.
The proposed SGAN framework, as illustrated in Figure 2, appears to be logically sound and has the potential for broader applications beyond steganography. Nevertheless, it is unclear why successfully deceiving the steganalyser discriminator S would necessarily imply the ability to deceive an independent discriminator S*. Furthermore, I find it noteworthy that varying the seed value can significantly impact accuracy.
In summary, while the ideas presented in this paper are intriguing and potentially valuable, I think the presentation could be improved to make it more accessible and suitable for the ICLR and machine learning communities.
