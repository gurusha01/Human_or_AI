This manuscript presents a modified version of the A3C algorithm, tailored to be more compatible with high-throughput GPU devices by relaxing certain synchronicity constraints. The authors provide a comprehensive analysis of the effects of introduced latency and conduct an extensive systems analysis of the algorithm.
However, comparing the performance figures in Table 3 is challenging due to significant variations in protocols. Although DeepMind did not release reproducible code for A3C, the authors have reportedly re-implemented the vanilla A3C algorithm. It would be beneficial to include results from this re-implementation in the same settings as those used by DeepMind and in the GA3C experiment (1 day) to facilitate a more accurate comparison. Clarification is needed regarding the differences in experimental protocols (e.g., top 5 out of 50 vs single run) and the reasoning behind these discrepancies, even if it is due to limitations in time or resources. Additional attention to these details would strengthen the argument that the approximations made do not compromise performance.
The decision to open-source the code is commendable, particularly given the scarcity of thoroughly tested open-source implementations in this area. Implementing these algorithms correctly is a complex task, and this contribution is valuable to the community.
It is worth noting that, as someone without personal experience implementing A3C, my assessment of the algorithmic aspects of this work is made with limited confidence.
