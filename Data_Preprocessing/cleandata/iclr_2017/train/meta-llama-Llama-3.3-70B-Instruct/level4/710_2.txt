This manuscript proposes an unsupervised methodology for automatically segmenting bioacoustic data, leveraging an established framework, namely Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Hidden Markov Models. The novelty of this research lies in its application to bioacoustic segmentation, a task the authors contend is particularly challenging due to the lack of consensus among human experts on standard segmentation practices. Although the authors effectively highlight the complexity of this task, the efficacy of their approach is not convincingly demonstrated, as it frequently fails to accurately replicate segmentations defined by human expert baselines. Furthermore, the manuscript is marred by poor writing clarity, replete with grammatical errors and awkwardly constructed sentences, which hinders the comprehension of the presented research.
