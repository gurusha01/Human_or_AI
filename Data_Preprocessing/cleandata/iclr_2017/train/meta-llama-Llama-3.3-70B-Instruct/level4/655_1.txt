This study presents a novel approach to enhancing deep transfer learning by leveraging basic probability assignment. The authors introduce a re-weighting scheme, drawing inspiration from Dempster-Shaffer theory and utilizing the source task's confusion matrix. Additionally, they propose learning convolutional filters separately as a means to mitigate non-convexity.
However, the paper's primary limitation lies in its presentation. Numerous typographical errors and unclear explanations hinder comprehension. For instance, the methodology behind constructing the training set for weak classifiers remains ambiguous, despite the authors' attempts to clarify. The justification for using both training and validation sets to calculate basic probability assignment is also unconvincing. Furthermore, the authors fail to provide an ablation study to substantiate the necessity of separate filter learning, leaving doubts about the significance of non-convexity in this context. Another concern arises from the differing number of channels in the CIFAR and MNIST datasets used in the second set of experiments, prompting questions about how this discrepancy is addressed.
While the proposed re-weighting concept shows promise, the overall work requires significant improvement and clarification. Therefore, I recommend rejection.
