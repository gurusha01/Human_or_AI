While the concept of integrating machine learning processing into silicon within solid-state drive (SSD) data storage devices is innovative and promising for low-power computation, its niche nature may limit its appeal to the broader ICLR audience. The paper presents simulated outcomes rather than actual hardware implementations and focuses on existing algorithm implementations. 
The comparison of train/test performance among algorithms appears unnecessary, given the lack of novelty in the algorithms themselves. Furthermore, the use of a single-layer perceptron on the MNIST dataset raises concerns about the system's practicality, as this represents a relatively small neural network by current standards. It is unclear from the paper how the proposed system could be scaled to accommodate contemporary large-scale networks, particularly in terms of parameter storage and bandwidth requirements.
As a non-expert in this field, my evaluation is limited to a high-level assessment.
