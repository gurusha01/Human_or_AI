This manuscript presents three primary methodological advancements:
- The introduction of Neural Feature (NF) as the average pixel value of the top N images that strongly activate a neuron
- A ranking system for neurons based on their color selectivity
- A ranking system for neurons based on their class selectivity
A significant limitation of the paper is that none of these methodological contributions are particularly groundbreaking, and the application of these methods does not yield a singularly notable result.
However, a major strength of the paper lies in its collection of moderately-sized, intriguing findings regarding the fundamental behavior of neural networks. Notable examples include:
- The discovery of highly class-selective neurons, such as digital-clock at conv2, cardoon at conv3, and ladybug at conv5, prior to the fully connected layers, which, to my knowledge, has not been previously reported.
- The presence of color-selective neurons in higher layers, with 25% color selectivity observed in conv5.
- The emergence of primary color axes, including black-white, blue-yellow, orange-cyan, and cyan-magenta, which correlates with evidence from the human visual system, as noted in Shapley & Hawken (2011). This is a remarkable observation.
Overall, I recommend accepting the paper, as it is possible that one of the smaller conclusions may prove to be significant in the future, even if it is difficult to predict at this time.
Additional minor comments:
- The citation for "Learning to generate chairs..." is incorrect, resulting from the combination of the first two authors.
- The Color Selectivity Index is not clearly defined, and the Opponent Color Space is not well-explained. Intuitively, it appears to select units that respond to a constant color, but the highest color selectivity NF in Fig 5 is for a unit with two colors, not one. Furthermore, the unit with the lowest color selectivity has a similar edge pattern but with a different color scheme. It is unclear why these are considered drastically different, and this should be more clearly described.
- Consider a hypothetical scenario where a neuron in conv5 is sensitive to mushrooms of any color but not to other objects. If the dataset only contains red-capped mushrooms, would the color selectivity index for this neuron be high or low? If it is high, it may be misleading, as the unit itself is not color-selective, but rather the dataset is biased towards red mushrooms. This subtle point is worth considering and discussing in the paper.
