This paper proposes an unsupervised approach to learning graph embeddings utilizing random walks, which is clearly and accurately presented. The field of learning comprehensive graph representations remains relatively underexplored, resulting in limited competition for the proposed method.
The core concept involves linearizing the graph through random walks and computing the embedding of the central segment of each walk based on the skip-thought criterion. Although I lack expertise in biology and cannot assess the biological validity of this approach, the reported gains in Table 2 are substantial.
A public comment drew comparisons with other studies focused on learning node representations, which, while distinct, could provide a useful baseline through mean- or max-pooling of these representations. Given the reliance on pooling in the proposed approach (as seen in Figure 3(c)), such a comparison would be particularly insightful.
In summary, this is a well-written paper with potential, and the inclusion of additional baselines could further enhance its merits, potentially leading to a higher numerical score.
