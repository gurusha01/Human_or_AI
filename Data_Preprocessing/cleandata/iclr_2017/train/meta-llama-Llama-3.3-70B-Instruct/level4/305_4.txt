This well-crafted paper proposes a comprehensive learning approach for image compression, achieving efficient compression by optimizing rate-distortion performance through a clever relaxation technique, trained on a large dataset of natural images. Given the method's novelty, the intriguing results, and the thorough analysis provided, I strongly support accepting this paper for presentation.
