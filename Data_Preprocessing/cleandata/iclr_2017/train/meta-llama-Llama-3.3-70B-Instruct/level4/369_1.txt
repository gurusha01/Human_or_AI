This paper presents a novel approach to ternary weight quantization, offering an alternative methodology. 
Key strengths of the paper include:
1. It demonstrates enhanced performance compared to existing solutions, showcasing the potential of this new approach.
2. The concept of learning quantization parameters rather than relying on predefined algorithms aligns well with contemporary machine learning principles, presenting an innovative and forward-thinking strategy.
However, several weaknesses are notable:
1. The contribution of the paper is somewhat incremental, building upon previous work without a significant breakthrough.
2. The paper's scope and presentation are tailored to a specialized audience, assuming a prior familiarity with ternary quantization research. This narrow focus results in a concise, yet insufficiently detailed explanation of the main algorithm for a broader audience, limiting its accessibility and impact.
3. A compelling motivation for this research is lacking. While the approach may have potential applications, its practical necessity and relevance to real-world problems are not clearly established. The justification based on its relation to mobile applications is insufficient, as it does not demonstrate a critical need for this specific refinement in current or emerging technologies.
In essence, this paper represents a modest advancement in a specialized area of research. Without a more substantial practical justification for pursuing this line of inquiry, its suitability for a diverse and broad audience, such as that of ICLR, is questionable. Furthermore, the absence of released code may hinder the reproducibility and further development of the proposed methodology.
