This manuscript explores the application of HDP-HMM to complex bioacoustics segmentation tasks, such as humpback whale sound and bird sound segmentation. While the methodology itself is not groundbreaking, its implementation in the context of bioacoustics segmentation poses significant challenges and has the potential to reveal noteworthy scientific insights, thereby making a valuable addition to the field of bioacoustics. However, a limitation of this study is the lack of a comprehensive comparison with other straightforward approaches, including BIC and AIC, which would be a worthwhile inclusion. Notably, given the substantial computational cost associated with HDP-HMM, as acknowledged by the authors, a comparison with simpler methods could provide an alternative solution to this issue.
