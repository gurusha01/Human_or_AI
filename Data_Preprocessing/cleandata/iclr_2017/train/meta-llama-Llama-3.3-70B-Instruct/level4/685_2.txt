This paper presents a novel approach to representing out-of-vocabulary words in a neural language model, although the reported performance is underwhelming in terms of language modeling and only marginally surpasses that of a baseline model.
A more thorough examination of this work is warranted, as several key aspects are currently lacking:
- A comparative analysis with existing research that tackles the same challenge is absent, which would provide valuable context and help assess the proposed model's effectiveness.
- The authors have not conducted an intrinsic evaluation of their model, nor have they investigated the underlying reasons for its performance, which limits the understanding of its strengths and weaknesses.
- To substantiate more significant claims, further investigation is necessary, particularly with languages that exhibit complex morphology, and should include a more diverse range of machine translation scenarios, such as translating from morphologically rich languages to English or between different morphologically rich languages.
