This manuscript presents an enhanced version of the PixelCNN approach, incorporating conditional dependencies on text and spatial constraints such as segmentation and keypoints, analogous to Reed 2016a but differentiated by its foundation on PixelCNN rather than GAN architecture. Following the authors' response, it's clear that the primary argument isn't about the superiority of conditional PixelCNN over conditional GAN, but rather an exploration of their differences. The authors could enrich the discussion by elaborating on the advantages and disadvantages of each model. I concur with another reviewer's suggestion that an analysis of training and generation times would provide valuable insights. While the PixelCNN method's sampling process is acknowledged to be O(N) compared to O(1) for other methods, it's unclear if this solely accounts for the limitation to low-resolution (32x32) experiments. Given the absence of quantitative comparisons, showcasing a broader range of visual examples beyond the current three would be beneficial. The generated images exhibit reasonable quality and diversity, although the color inaccuracies, addressed by the authors in their comments, remain a concern. The technical innovation, while not groundbreaking, is a logical extension of previous work. I am inclined to recommend acceptance due to the paper's relevance to the ICLR community and its potential to stimulate future research and comparisons among deep image synthesis methodologies.
