This paper provides an assessment of recent advancements in competitive ILSVRC CNN architectures, focusing on their resource utilization. The evaluation is thorough, and the presentation of findings is clear, highlighting the importance of the topic.
However, the results may not offer significant surprises for those familiar with regular CNN applications. Furthermore, the practical implications of these findings are not entirely convincing, particularly when considering their application to new problems with computational constraints or production environments. This limitation stems from the paper's lack of discussion on realistic scenarios.
Key concerns include:
1) The evaluation's relevance to realistic scenarios is limited, as it primarily focuses on ILSVRC as a starting point, whereas fine-tuning networks is a common practice. For instance, VGG, although cumbersome to train from scratch, excels in fine-tuning and compression, making it a potentially excellent choice when considering these standard steps, which have significant practical implications.
2) The comparison of compressed networks is crucial, given their higher accuracy/parameter density. At the very least, a comparison with well-known, publicly available compressed networks would be beneficial.
3) An analysis of the networks' topology and identification of bottlenecks would be highly valuable, as it is currently lacking.
A minor concern is:
1) The decision to use batch normalization in NiN and AlexNet is not clearly justified, prompting the question of why this choice was made by the authors.
