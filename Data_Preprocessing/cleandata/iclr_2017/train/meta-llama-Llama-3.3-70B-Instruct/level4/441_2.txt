This paper presents a highly innovative approach, making for an engaging read. However, my evaluation is largely influenced by the concerns I initially raised, which still require attention. The proposed variable computation mechanism demonstrates intriguing properties, but the empirical results need to be contextualized within the current state of the art. Notably, the comparison with LSTMs, a dominant benchmark, is essential, even if outperforming them is not a prerequisite for acceptance. 
In their pre-review response, the authors highlighted that LSTMs undertake more computations per timestep than Elman networks. While this is accurate, it suggests a comparative axis that should be explored further, potentially by controlling for this factor (e.g., by adjusting the number of LSTM cells) to provide a more nuanced analysis. Additionally, a brief analysis of the proposed gating mechanism in relation to popular existing mechanisms would enhance the manuscript's clarity and impact.
Following the authors' address of my concerns and their commitment to incorporate additional comparisons, I am revising my assessment to a score of 7, with the understanding that the manuscript will be revised to include these new comparisons as outlined in their comment posted on 2017/1/20.
