This paper introduces a novel metric, central moment discrepancy (CMD), for distribution matching, with a focus on domain adaptation applications. Compared to the established MMD variant, CMD offers the advantage of avoiding excessive penalization of the mean, allowing it to concentrate on the distribution's shape around its center.
In terms of discriminatory capability, MMD and CMD are theoretically equivalent, but in practice, CMD may exhibit superior performance since MMD's attempt to match raw moments can overly penalize non-zero-centered data.
The paper's implementation of CMD only considers moments up to the Kth order and solely utilizes diagonal entries in the CMD objective, likely due to computational efficiency concerns. A more comprehensive comparison with MMD could be conducted by incorporating raw moments up to the Kth order. Additionally, considering all moments, rather than just diagonal terms, in the objective could provide further insight, albeit at a higher computational cost, which could be feasible for lower-order moments (e.g., first and second orders).
However, the experimental comparison between CMD and kernelized MMD does not sufficiently support the claim that explicit moment matching is beneficial. To substantiate this claim, a comparison between CMD and MMD with explicit raw moments is necessary.
The assertion that the kernel parameter in MMD is challenging to tune, whereas CMD does not require such parameters, only applies to kernelized MMD, not explicit MMD. Research has been conducted on setting these parameters for kernel MMD, such as the work by Sriperumbudur et al. and Gretton et al., and using multiple kernels (Li et al., 2015) can eliminate the need for tuning. The approach used in this paper to tune the beta parameter is unconventional, and simpler heuristics, like normalizing by dimensionality or mean pairwise distance, should be explored before adopting this method.
Overall, CMD has the potential to outperform MMD and may have numerous applications across various domains. Nevertheless, it also faces the challenge of being difficult to kernelize, although this can be argued from different perspectives. The experimental demonstrations of CMD's superiority could be more convincing, and further research is needed to fully establish its benefits.
