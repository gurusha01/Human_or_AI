The concept of a differentiable physics engine is undoubtedly intriguing. 
A major advantage of the proposed software is its claimed speed, yet a comparative analysis with existing physics engines is notably absent. While the engine's performance is described using innovative units, such as "model seconds per day", it remains unclear whether this constitutes a fast or slow pace. For context, Todorov's engine, a benchmark for me, can compute a dynamics step along with its derivatives with respect to both states and controls in under 1ms for a comprehensive humanoid model, utilizing finite-differences (with accessible code at mujoco.org/book/programming.htmlsaDerivative). This suggests that Todorov's engine might outperform the one presented in this paper, although a definitive conclusion cannot be drawn without direct comparison.
Given the proposed engine's limited collision capabilities, restricted to sphere/sphere and sphere/plane interactions, it would be straightforward to replicate the example models in other prominent engines like ODE, Bullet, and MuJoCo, and then assess their performance relative to the proposed engine. Until such a comparative study is conducted, the paper's findings appear incomplete, lacking the necessary context to fully evaluate its claims.
