I would like to begin by acknowledging the delay in my response.
Summary: The authors propose a framework for a two-sample statistical test utilizing binary classification, which enables multi-dimensional sample testing and offers interpretability that is lacking in other tests. The paper provides a theoretical analysis and reports on various empirical tests.
I find this approach to be highly intriguing. However, I have two primary concerns that I would like to highlight.
The presentation's clarity is compromised by the sheer volume of content, which makes it difficult to follow. Consideration should be given to making the presentation more self-contained, potentially by dividing the content into two separate papers.
The paper presents a multitude of experiments, but the experimental setup is not adequately explained. The assumption that readers are familiar with prior works, such as Jitkrittum et al., 2016, Radford et al., 2016, and Yu et al., 2015, limits the accessibility of the paper to a narrow audience. For instance, the term SCF is used without explanation, despite its performance being reported.
As a secondary point, in light of the increasing number of submissions to this conference, I would like to pose the following question: What is the significance of this work to the representation learning community, and how does it contribute meaningfully to the field?
