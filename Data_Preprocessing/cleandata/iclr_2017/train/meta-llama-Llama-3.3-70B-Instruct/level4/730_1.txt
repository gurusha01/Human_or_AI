This paper presents an analysis of three techniques - Monte Carlo test-time model averaging, average pooling, and residual connections - applied to conventional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models, demonstrating their potential to improve performance in sentiment analysis tasks.
While the paper is well-structured and clearly written, its experimental section falls short. The results, although showing some improvement over traditional LSTMs, do not match the current state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, if the intention is to establish these extensions as robust baselines for future research, the experimental scope is insufficient, limited to two datasets with similar characteristics despite differing statistics. To strengthen the paper, I recommend conducting additional experiments across a broader range of tasks, similar to those explored in "LSTM: A Search Space Odyssey", to validate the generalizability of the proposed methods.
Moreover, the introduced extensions lack novelty. The experimental findings are unconvincing due to the similarity of the two datasets used, both focusing on sentiment analysis. It would be beneficial to investigate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed models and methods on more diverse tasks, such as machine translation or question answering, to comprehensively assess their value.
