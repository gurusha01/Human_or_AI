This manuscript investigates the application of ensemble optimisation to policy-gradient training, a topic that has been overlooked for far too long. The authors' exploration of this concept is a welcome addition to the field. The paper is clearly written, making it easily understandable, and the inquiries raised in section 4 are thought-provoking and pertinent.
However, the study also has some notable limitations, primarily that its findings are confined to a specific domain and parameter setting. To strengthen the research, it would be beneficial to see the experiments replicated across a diverse range of source domain, target domain, and parameter combinations, which is anticipated to be addressed in the forthcoming journal version.
