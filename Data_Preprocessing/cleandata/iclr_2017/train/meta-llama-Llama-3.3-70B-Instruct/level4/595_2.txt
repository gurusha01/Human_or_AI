I would like to start by acknowledging the delay in submitting my review.
Summary: This paper presents an adaptation of variational inference for deep generative models, demonstrating enhanced performance on non-negative sparse datasets. Additionally, the authors propose a methodology for interpreting data through model parameters.
The overall clarity of the writing is satisfactory, and the methods appear to be theoretically sound. The introspection approach seems to be a novel contribution. I was particularly intrigued by the experimental results on polysemic word embedding, which I found to be a compelling aspect of the paper. However, I would have appreciated a comparison of the performance of the obtained embedding with other commonly used embeddings in the context of a supervised task to further assess its effectiveness.
Minor issues:
Eq. 2 contains an excessive number of closing parentheses, which may hinder readability.
