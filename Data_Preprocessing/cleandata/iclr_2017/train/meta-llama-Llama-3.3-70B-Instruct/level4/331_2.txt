This manuscript investigates the concept of transfer learning in reinforcement learning across agents with potential morphological differences. The central notion revolves around the source and target agents acquiring a common skill, which is then utilized to establish abstract feature spaces. This enables the transfer of a novel, unshared skill from the source agent to the target agent. The work draws parallels with existing research on transfer learning that leverages shared latent spaces, including techniques such as Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) and its variants, manifold alignment, and kernel CCA.
The authors present experimental results using a basic physics simulator, comparing robot arms with three links to those with four links. For the sake of comparison, a straightforward CCA-based method is implemented, although a more comprehensive evaluation would have benefited from comparisons with more contemporary approaches, such as manifold alignment or kernel CCA. The construction of latent feature spaces is achieved through the use of a three-layer neural network.
The issue of transfer in reinforcement learning is of paramount importance yet remains understudied. The proposed approach, which focuses on constructing transfer based on shared skills between the source and target agents, presents an intriguing hypothesis and a promising direction. However, the comparisons to related methods appear somewhat outdated, and the experimental domains are relatively simplistic. Furthermore, the manuscript lacks a rigorous theoretical foundation, particularly in relation to Markov Decision Process (MDP) theory, which would strengthen the development of the ideas presented.
