The optimization of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) is significantly hindered by the issues of vanishing and exploding gradients, which are exacerbated in tasks that require modeling long-term dependencies and thus necessitate longer RNNs. A proposed strategy to enhance optimization involves ensuring that the transfer matrix remains nearly orthogonal. This manuscript explores the crucial role of orthogonality in optimization and learning, a topic of considerable importance. The text is well-structured, the arguments are coherent and easy to follow, and the proposed optimization method is intriguing. However, a major limitation of the paper lies in its experimental section, which I believe requires substantial enhancement. The following points outline specific comments regarding the experiments:
1. The current experimental setup seems insufficient. As a minimum, results from the adding problem and language modeling tasks on the Penn Treebank dataset should be included to provide a more comprehensive evaluation.
2. While the copying task becomes more challenging with non-linearity, its removal alters the optimization process significantly, making it difficult to draw meaningful conclusions from the results obtained without non-linearity.
3. The number of hidden units used for RNNs in different tasks is not specified, which is essential for reproducibility and understanding the scalability of the proposed method.
4. It would be beneficial to report the running time of the proposed method for various numbers of hidden units, compare it with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), and specify the neural network package used, as this information is crucial for assessing the method's efficiency and practicality.
5. The results presented in Tables 1 and 2 suggest that orthogonality might not offer significant benefits, as the performance metrics are closely matched between the scenarios with and without an optimal margin. Could the authors clarify this observation?
6. Figure 2 is presented without accompanying discussion, leaving its implications and the insights it offers unclear. Elucidating the findings from this figure would enhance the understanding of the proposed method's effectiveness.
