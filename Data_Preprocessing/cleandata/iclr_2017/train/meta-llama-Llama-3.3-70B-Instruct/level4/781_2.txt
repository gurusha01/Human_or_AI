This paper aims to develop "a collection of experts that are individually meaningful and have disjoint responsibilities," deviating from traditional mixture models by utilizing a distinct mixture for each dimension. Although the results appear promising, the paper's presentation requires substantial enhancement.
The paper lacks introductory context, failing to provide motivation, application, algorithm, or architectural framework, which should be established from the outset.
The subsequent explanation is unclear, with unsubstantiated assertions, such as the claim that "the experts only have a small variance for some subset of the variables while the variance of the other variables is large," which requires justification.
As the paper learns both experts and weights, it would be beneficial to frame this concept in terms of dictionary learning, accompanied by a discussion of relevant related literature to provide context.
The horse data set, being relatively small compared to the feature dimension, may not yield conclusions that generalize broadly, highlighting a potential limitation of the study.
