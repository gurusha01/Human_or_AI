This paper presents an intriguing approach to sparse coding, leveraging insights from neuroscience and biology to develop an adaptive method that dynamically generates or eliminates codes in response to new data from non-stationary distributions.
I have several key points to highlight:
1. A more in-depth discussion of the algorithm would be beneficial to provide a clearer understanding of the contribution. Although the underlying concept is not entirely new, with codes being added as needed and removed when redundant, a more detailed explanation would strengthen the paper.
2. It would be valuable to explore the relationship between the organization of the data and the behavior of this adaptive sparse coding method. The paper's progression from structured images of buildings to less structured natural images raises questions about whether this approach is essentially a form of curriculum learning. Furthermore, it is unclear how the method would perform when the data structure changes without a clear transition from simple to complex, such as shifting between different categories of objects like flowers, birds, fish, leaves, and trees.
The observed improvement when training data follows a structured progression from simpler to more complex domains is intuitively reasonable. However, the paper's potential and the usefulness of its idea, along with some noteworthy insights, are somewhat overshadowed by the need for further development before it is ready for publication.
