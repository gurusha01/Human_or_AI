This manuscript presents a neural network-based approach for predicting car state during driving, leveraging competitive learning. The competitive learning methodology involves creating multiple replicas of the baseline neural architecture, with only the architecture exhibiting the minimum loss being updated during training. The experimental evaluation compares the competitive learning strategy to a single baseline architecture using a driving benchmark task. While the paper is generally comprehensible, it would benefit from additional editing to enhance clarity.
The competitive learning strategy appears to be somewhat arbitrary, and the manuscript feels incomplete due to the lack of substantial discussion and comparison to ensemble methods. Recent studies have demonstrated that duplicating and ensembling neural architectures can yield significant improvements, and it is unclear why competitive learning is preferred over ensembling, as it seems less theoretically grounded.
A significant concern in the experimental design is the disparity in the number of free parameters between the competitive learning architecture and the baseline architecture. To validate the proposed approach, it is essential to compare it to ensembling methods using the same number of duplicated architectures and to a single baseline architecture with larger hidden layers, ensuring a comparable number of free parameters.
The graphical representation of the driving process in Figure 1 appears to be flawed. If "e" is observed, all variables become known given the depicted dependencies. Furthermore, the notation used is misleading, as it suggests that the driving action "d" decided at time "t" affects the vehicle state "s" at the same time, whereas it should be that "st" depends on "d(t-1)". Additionally, according to this figure, the driving decision "d" does not depend on the observed vehicle state "x", which seems invalid.
The abstract contains an unusual paragraph break. Moreover, the caption for Figure 1 should provide a concise explanation of the variables presented.
