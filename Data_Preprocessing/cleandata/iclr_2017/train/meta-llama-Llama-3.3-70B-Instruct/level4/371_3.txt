The paper presents a novel differentiable Neural Physics Engine (NPE) architecture, comprising an encoder and a decoder function. The NPE processes the state of object pairs within a neighborhood of a focus object at two preceding time-steps, with the encoder summarizing their interactions and the decoder predicting the focus object's velocity change at the next time-step. The NPE is evaluated in environments featuring bouncing balls.
In terms of novelty, the differentiable NPE is an innovative concept, although a similar model was concurrently proposed by Battaglia et al. (NIPS 2016). While this work introduces novel aspects, such as considering object interactions within a neighborhood based on Euclidean distance, the advantages of the NPE over Battaglia et al.'s model are unclear. Furthermore, the performance of the NPE in scenarios like n-ball systems, where gravitational forces can act over large distances, is uncertain.
The paper includes all relevant citations, and the writing is clear and easy to understand. However, the experimental evaluation is limited compared to Battaglia et al., who assessed their model in a wider range of scenarios, including n-bodies under gravity and falling strings. Although this work provides more in-depth experiments on bouncing balls, including mass estimation and varying world configurations with obstacles, a comprehensive comparison to Fragkiadaki et al. (2015) is missing.
The authors only evaluate the error in velocity in the bouncing balls scenarios, which may not be sufficient, as small velocity errors can lead to significantly different scene configurations. A more thorough analysis, including errors in ground truth ball position, would be more informative.
In conclusion, the main issue with this work is the unclear novelty with respect to Battaglia et al.'s work. A quantitative and qualitative comparison with their model is lacking, despite the authors' claim of independent development. The practical advantages of differentiable physics engines like the NPE, which require extensive synthetic data generation and retraining for new scenarios, are uncertain. In contrast, "bottom-up" approaches like Fragkiadaki et al. (2015), which combine vision and learning dynamics, may be more useful for robots in everyday tasks, as they require fewer input parameters and can estimate parameters from visual components. Overall, the potential applications of a differentiable physics engine like the NPE are unclear, and further research is needed to demonstrate its advantages and usefulness.
