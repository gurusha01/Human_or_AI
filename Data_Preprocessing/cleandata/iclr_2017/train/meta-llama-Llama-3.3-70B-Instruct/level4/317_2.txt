I regret the delay in submitting my review.
This manuscript presents a novel approach to Super-Resolution, framing it as amortised MAP estimation. The authors propose a projection step to maintain consistent dependencies between high-resolution (HR) and low-resolution (LR) images, which is experimentally validated to yield improved results. Additionally, they introduce three distinct methods to address the cross-entropy problem outlined in Eq.9, and provide experimental evaluations for each.
In summary, this is an excellent paper, well-structured and clearly presented. The experimental results are comprehensive, featuring appropriately selected toy examples and real-world applications. In my assessment, the contributions to the field of super-resolution (specifically sections 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4) are innovative, although certain aspects related to GAN training may bear similarities to existing work in varying forms (as also noted in the discussion). I firmly believe this paper will have a lasting impact on future research in super-resolution, and the finding that GAN-based model training produces the most visually appealing results warrants further exploration in this area.
Before finalization, I recommend a thorough proofreading of the manuscript to correct a few minor typos that were encountered, ensuring the text is polished and error-free.
