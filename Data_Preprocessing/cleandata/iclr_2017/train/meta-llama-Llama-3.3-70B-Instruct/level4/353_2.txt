This paper proposes a novel approach by integrating a hierarchical Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with PixelCNNs to model the distribution of natural images, achieving reasonable likelihoods, albeit not surpassing the state of the art. The authors also initiate an exploration into the information encoded by the latent representations within the hierarchical VAE.
The combination of PixelCNN with a VAE, as initially suggested in the PixelCNN paper, is deemed a significant and intriguing contribution. The hierarchical encoding of variations at different latent stages is noteworthy, although it appears somewhat expected given the scale of image regions modeled by the latent variables. A more compelling outcome would be demonstrating the PixelCNN's enhancement of the VAE's latent representation in the context of a meaningful task. Furthermore, while the paper asserts that incorporating PixelCNN into the VAE reduces the need for computationally intensive autoregressive layers, the overall efficiency gain of their model compared to a PixelCNN with similar likelihood remains ambiguous.
Overall, the presentation lacks clarity. For instance, the exact architecture of the proposed model is not clearly articulated in the paper, making reproduction challenging, a concern also raised by reviewer 1.
