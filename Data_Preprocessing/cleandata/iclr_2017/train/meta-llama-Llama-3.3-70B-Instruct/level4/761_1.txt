This manuscript initiates an exploration into the static analysis of source code through machine learning. A simplified programming language, incorporating control structures such as loops and conditional statements, is developed with the objective of verifying whether all program variables are defined prior to their utilization. The authors employ various existing sequence classification models and propose a novel approach utilizing a "differentiable set" to track defined variables. The results indicate that a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model achieves 98% accuracy, while the differentiable set model attains 99.3% accuracy with sequence-level supervision and 99.7% accuracy with token-level supervision. Additionally, an LSTM language model is trained on correct code to identify potential errors by highlighting low-probability tokens.
A crucial question arises regarding the reasoning patterns required for the model to solve these tasks. Specifically, it is unclear whether the model must statically evaluate the truth value of conditional statements or simply verify the order of variable definitions and uses within the program's textual representation.
The manuscript's strengths include:
- The innovative concept of learning a static analyzer, which holds promise for future research.
- The fundamental importance of determining variable definitions prior to their use, a prerequisite for more complex static analysis tasks.
- A reasonable experimental setup.
- The introduction of the differentiable set as a potentially useful, albeit simple, modeling tool.
However, the manuscript also has several weaknesses:
- The experimental setup is overly simplistic, which may not adequately address the challenges associated with learning a static analyzer for real-world programming languages.
- The models employed are relatively simple, with the differentiable set providing a modest improvement, but its general applicability and usefulness remain uncertain.
In conclusion, while this work represents an intriguing initial step, it may be premature for acceptance to ICLR in its current form. The authors' future efforts to extend the system to analyze more complex code properties and leverage the strengths of machine learning in static analysis are eagerly anticipated, as this line of research has the potential to yield significant advancements.
