This manuscript presents a novel approach to sequence decomposition, specifically tailored for speech recognition applications, with potential implications for other fields like machine translation. The proposed method tackles a significant challenge and demonstrates promising results. However, to further validate its effectiveness, a comparative analysis with byte pair encoding (BPE) would be beneficial, considering both dynamic and fixed decomposition strategies. It would be informative to evaluate BPE's performance across a range of vocabulary sizes to provide a comprehensive baseline assessment.
Several minor aspects warrant further consideration:
- The phonetic meaningfulness of the learned decompositions is not entirely clear. Although the appendix provides an example, it is difficult to discern whether the model is capturing phonemes or merely identifying frequent character n-grams.
- While the primary focus is on speech recognition, exploring potential applications in other domains could significantly enhance the contribution of this work, although this may be beyond the current scope.
