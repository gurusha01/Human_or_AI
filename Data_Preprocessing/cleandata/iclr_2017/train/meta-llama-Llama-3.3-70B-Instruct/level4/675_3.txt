This manuscript provides an in-depth examination of various curriculum learning approaches. However, a significant concern is the utilization of a highly specific dataset, which lacks clear justification, as also noted by AnonReviewer3. It would be beneficial to conduct experiments on more conventional tasks to enhance the generalizability of the findings. Furthermore, the exceptionally strong performance of FFNN models is unclear and warrants additional explanation, as requested in the last comment.
The paper is well-structured and clearly written, with intriguing comparisons between the described methods that may be applicable to other datasets. Nevertheless, the manuscript's excessive length (18 pages) is a notable issue; it is recommended that the authors condense the content or relocate some results to a supplementary appendix.
Moreover, the proposed method bears a strong resemblance to the approach outlined in Reinforcement learning neural Turing machines (Zaremba et al., 2016), which raises concerns regarding the novelty and originality of the presented work.
