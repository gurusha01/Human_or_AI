SUMMARY 
This manuscript explores the efficient representation of data from a specific low-dimensional structure, namely a monotonic chain, using neural networks with a two-hidden-layer architecture.
PROS 
The paper offers a clear and intriguing perspective on the capabilities of neural networks, particularly in terms of dimensionality reduction, and identifies potential avenues for further research.
CONS 
Although the paper presents a constructive example of structures that can be captured by a neural network and includes experiments demonstrating the emergence of such structures, it fails to address the associated learning problem.
COMMENTS 
Further investigation into the implications of the presented findings for deeper networks would be worthwhile, as would examining the extent to which the proposed framework encompasses all functions representable by these networks.
MINOR COMMENTS 
- It would be beneficial to reference Figure 1 earlier in the text.
- The term "color coded" is unclear, as it does not specify what the colors represent.
- The revision of points from the initial questions is appreciated, particularly regarding isometry on the manifold.
- On page 5, a description of how the orthogonal projection on S_k is implemented in the network would be helpful.
- The term "segments" on page 6 may not be the most suitable choice of words.
- The statement "The mean relative error is 0.98" on page 6 lacks context, as it does not provide a baseline or clarify the significance of this value.
