This paper presents a commendable effort in establishing a unified framework for recent neural models, a pursuit that holds considerable value. 
However, the significance of the DRAGNN framework, in its current iteration, as a standalone contribution is not entirely clear. The core concept, which involves utilizing a transition system to unfold a computation graph, is relatively straightforward. This approach enables code reuse by allowing modules to be interchanged, a benefit that, in my view, stems more from sound software engineering practices than from innovative machine learning research.
Furthermore, the motivation for adopting the DRAGNN framework appears limited, as it does not offer inherent advantages or 'free benefits' that would incentivize its use. For instance:
- Implementing neural networks using automatic differentiation libraries like TensorFlow or Dynet provides gradients without additional effort.
- The VW framework offers efficiency enhancements through its credit assignment compiler, along with a range of algorithms for principled model training that avoids exposure bias, features that would be cumbersome to replicate manually.
My inquiry regarding the framework's limitations remains unanswered to my satisfaction. To rephrase: Could you provide examples of models that cannot be elegantly expressed within the DRAGNN framework? How would one implement models that might not fit neatly into this structure?
