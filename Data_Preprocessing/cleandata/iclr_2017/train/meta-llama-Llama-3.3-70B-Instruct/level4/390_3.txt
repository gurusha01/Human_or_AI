This manuscript presents a novel approach to reinforcement learning and control, wherein a metacontroller is employed to manage a base-level controller and multiple accessory experts. The metacontroller's primary function is to determine the number of times to invoke the controller and experts, as well as the specific expert to call at each iteration. Notably, the controller receives not only the current state but also a summary of its previous calls and those of the experts. The sequence of controls and expert advice is then embedded into a fixed-size vector using an LSTM. The proposed method is evaluated on an N-body control task, demonstrating the benefits of multiple iterations and the metacontroller's ability to achieve improved accuracy and computational efficiency compared to fixed-iteration controls.
The manuscript is generally well-written and easy to follow. Although the concept of metareasoning has been explored in AI, its application as a differentiable and fully trainable component within a reinforcement learning system appears to be a new contribution. However, it is challenging to assess the potential impact of this approach at this stage, and its scalability to other domains remains to be investigated. The experimental validation is interesting and well-executed, but its scope is limited. Given the complexity of the architecture, a discussion of potential training difficulties and convergence issues would be beneficial.
Several specific comments and suggestions are provided below:
1. In Figure 1A, the graphical notation should be explicitly explained, including the meaning of arrows with varying thickness and line styles.
2. The caption for Figure 3 should provide a clearer explanation of the figure's contents, including the significance of the different colors used for the lines. Additionally, the description of the dots and error bars in the top row should be more prominent.
3. In Figure 4, it would be helpful to report the standard error of the regression slope, as well as the fraction of explained variance (R^2), in addition to the 95% confidence interval represented by the shaded area.
4. In Figure 5, the fraction of samples using the MLP expert does not appear to decrease monotonically with increasing cost. This inconsistency should be addressed, and potential sources of variance in these fractions across experiments should be discussed.
5. The supplementary materials are appreciated for providing additional details, and their inclusion is acknowledged.
