This paper tackles the challenge of argument mining, which involves identifying argument types and predicting the relationships between them. The authors propose a pointer network architecture to recover argument relations and introduce modifications to enable joint training for both type and link prediction tasks. While the model appears reasonable, its suitability for ICLR is questionable.
One of my primary concerns is the novelty of the proposed model. Although the multi-task learning approach is intriguing, its verification on only one task raises doubts about the submission's relevance to ICLR, making it seem more appropriate for a NLP conference. The pointer network has been previously proposed, which further reinforces this concern.
The authors claim that their pointer network is less restrictive than existing tree-predicting methods. However, the datasets used only contain single trees or forests, and the stack-based method can be adapted for forest prediction by introducing a virtual root node, as seen in dependency parsing tasks. Unfortunately, the current experiments do not effectively demonstrate the advantages of the pointer network model.
My second concern lies in the target task. Given the authors' focus on analyzing sentence structures, it is unclear whether argumentation mining is the optimal dataset. The model could be validated by applying it to other tasks that require tree structures, such as dependency parsing. Furthermore, the assumption that the boundaries of Argumentative Constituents (AC) are given is a significant constraint, potentially limiting the model's usefulness in NLP applications.
Overall, from a machine learning perspective, the baseline methods used for comparison may be suitable for argument mining but might not be robust enough for general tree or forest prediction tasks. Additionally, the assumption of having AC boundaries is overly restrictive, leading me to question whether ICLR is the best fit for this submission.
