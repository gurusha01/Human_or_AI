The paper presents an online adaptation of segment-to-segment transducers, enabling target predictions without requiring the observation of the entire sentence. The authors primarily build upon their previous work, further incorporating independent priors on target hypotheses, such as language grammar or sentence length, into their framework.
Notable strengths of the paper include:
- The clear and engaging writing style, which effectively conveys the innovative idea of integrating multiple information sources within a Bayesian framework for sequence-to-sequence models.
- The approach of handling predictions in an online manner, which typically increases complexity, is of significant interest to the community.
- A robust experimental section with notable results, although some aspects are incomplete (as discussed in the weaknesses).
Weaknesses of the paper are:
- The authors do not achieve an improvement in computational complexity compared to Tillmann's proposal, which may render the algorithms challenging to apply in scenarios with long inputs, even considering a constrained model of alignment latent variables.
- The omission of a baseline that combines direct, language model, and bias contributions without a channel is noticeable. It is unclear if there were algorithmic constraints that prevented its inclusion.
Additional minor comments:
- Regarding the first weakness, it would be beneficial to elaborate on the conceptual differences between the current work and that of Tillmann et al. (1997), beyond the use of connectionist discriminative models for deriving conditional probabilities.
- The sensitivity of the model to different hyper-parameter choices in equation (3) is of interest. Is a naive search through the parameter space employed, or is a more sophisticated approach utilized?
- Further details on the auxiliary direct model would be appreciated.
- The importance of correctly choosing the pruning variables (K1 and K2) is unclear.
- In Section 2, it is stated that no Markovian assumptions are made. Does this imply the absence of first-order Markovian assumptions?
Typos:
- In Table 1, "chanel" should be corrected to "channel" (one row before the last).
Apologies are offered for the delayed review.
