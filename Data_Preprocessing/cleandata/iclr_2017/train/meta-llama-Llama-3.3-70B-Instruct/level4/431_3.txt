This manuscript demonstrates technical competence and effectively identifies the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed simplified model.
Regarding its impact, the novelty of the work is somewhat restricted, as the authors have essentially followed established procedures and achieved anticipated results. The concept of modeling deep learning computation is not inherently innovative. However, as an accompanying paper to an open-source release of the model, it would satisfy my criteria for acceptance, similar to a paper presenting a novel dataset, which may not offer revolutionary insights but still holds value for the community.
Initially, I was uncertain about the paper's merit due to the unavailability of the code, despite the authors' assurance of an imminent release, as the true worth of the work lies in the code itself. The situation would be different if the authors had utilized this framework to inform novel architectural decisions, enhancing training scalability and incorporating these new findings into the paper.
UPDATE: With the code now available, my assessment has been revised accordingly.
