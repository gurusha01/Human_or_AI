This manuscript investigates the application of Open Bigrams as a word representation technique in the context of handwriting image recognition.
Strengths:
- The incorporation of Open Bigrams presents a fresh and intriguing approach.
- The text is well-organized and easy to follow.
Weaknesses:
- The study lacks a comparative analysis with established state-of-the-art methods, relying solely on internally generated results.
- Further ablation studies are necessary to provide a more comprehensive understanding, such as completing Table 3 with additional configurations (e.g., rnn0,1, rnn0,1,2, rnn0,1', etc.). The current results do not clearly attribute the performance gains to specific components, suggesting that single character modeling (0) and word endings (') may be the primary contributing factors.
- Although the use of Open Bigrams is innovative, the manuscript overlooks relevant prior work that utilizes bag of bigrams and n-grams as models, which warrants comparison and exploration, for example.
