This manuscript proposes a polynomial linear model for supervised classification tasks, leveraging the Tensor Train (TT) tensor decomposition method and stochastic Riemannian optimization. Although the empirical experiments demonstrate promising results compared to relevant baselines, several aspects of the paper warrant further consideration.
From a theoretical perspective, the approach is intriguing and sophisticated, building upon established techniques such as TT decomposition and the geometric structure of the manifold of tensors with fixed TT-rank. The novelty of this work lies in combining these elements to create an efficient polynomial linear model. However, the paper could benefit from a more in-depth examination of the efficacy of this combination and its advantages over alternative approaches. For instance, a comparison of the model's performance when optimized over the manifold of positive definite matrices, as suggested by another reviewer, would be valuable.
The empirical analysis has room for improvement. Notably, the significant performance gain achieved by initializing with the ordinary logistic regression solution is puzzling and deserves further investigation, particularly to determine whether similar performance boosts can be obtained with other models. Additionally, the inclusion of a vanilla feed-forward neural network as a baseline on the synthetic data would provide insight into the complexity of the interactions and the difficulty of modeling the dataset. Several other potential enhancements to the experimental section have been noted by previous reviewers.
Minor errors, such as 'Bernoulli distrbution', 'reproduce the experiemnts', and 'generilize better', should be corrected.
Ultimately, my assessment of this paper is mixed. While the core idea is compelling, the analysis falls short in exploring the unique aspects of the model that make it innovative and worthy of attention.
