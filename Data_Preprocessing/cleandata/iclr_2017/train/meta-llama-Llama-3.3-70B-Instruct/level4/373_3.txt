This manuscript proposes a well-organized and hierarchical framework for categorizing transfer learning techniques in the context of sequence tagging tasks, effectively integrating and contextualizing prior research focused on specific aspects of this framework. Furthermore, the authors demonstrate that uninvestigated regions within this taxonomy can achieve performance comparable to or exceeding the current state of the art on prominent benchmark tasks.
Future investigations could further elucidate the trade-offs involved, such as quantifying the loss incurred when transitioning from more constrained to less constrained transfer learning approaches. Nonetheless, the paper is deemed interesting and acceptable in its current form.
