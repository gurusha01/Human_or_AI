This manuscript presents a well-structured approach to learning activation functions in a nonparametric manner within deep neural networks, accompanied by a solid theoretical rationale for the authors' selection of nonparametric activation functions. The theoretical contributions are sound and convincing. A notable strength of the paper lies in its experimental design, where the proposed methods are rigorously evaluated on image recognition datasets, yielding a significant improvement of up to 15% in test performance relative to the baseline. The paper is well-written and introduces novel theoretical methodologies. While the intuition underlying the proof of Theorem 4.7 could be elucidated more clearly within the main text, the appendix provides sufficient clarification, ensuring that the technical aspects of the work are comprehensively addressed.
