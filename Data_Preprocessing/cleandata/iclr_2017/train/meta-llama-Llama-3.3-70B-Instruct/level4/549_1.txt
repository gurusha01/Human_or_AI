This paper presents a novel variant of sparse coding, leveraging it as a fundamental component in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification tasks. The sparse coding technique integrates two key objectives: the reconstruction of the input signal and the incorporation of top-down information derived from a class label. The efficacy of the proposed approach is benchmarked against the recently introduced CReLU activation block.
Strengths:
The methodology outlined in the paper appears to be technically robust, offering an innovative approach to training CNNs in a layer-wise manner. This is achieved by synergistically combining reconstruction and discriminative objectives, which could potentially enhance the efficiency of the training process.
Weaknesses:
However, the margin of improvement in classification accuracy over existing state-of-the-art methods is not unequivocally established. The evaluation, limited to the CIFAR-10 dataset, shows only a marginal superiority of the proposed method over the CReLU baseline, with a modest increase of 0.5% in test set accuracy.
To bolster the paper, it would be beneficial for the authors to provide evidence of the proposed method's broader applicability across diverse CNN architectures and datasets, accompanied by consistent and significant performance enhancements over robust CNN benchmarks. Without such comprehensive validation, the practical implications and utility of this research remain ambiguous.
