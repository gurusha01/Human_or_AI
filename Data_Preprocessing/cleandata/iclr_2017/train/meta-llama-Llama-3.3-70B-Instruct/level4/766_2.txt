This manuscript presents a pedestrian detection approach leveraging the Fast RCNN framework, incorporating batch normalization, and utilizing EdgeBoxes for generating pedestrian proposals as an alternative to the selective search method employed in the original Fast RCNN technique. The efficacy of the proposed approach is assessed using the INRIA and ETH datasets.
Advantages:
- The method demonstrates satisfactory performance, although it does not achieve state-of-the-art results.
Disadvantages:
- The approach lacks innovation, as it is based on the well-established Fast RCNN and its variants, such as Faster RCNN,
