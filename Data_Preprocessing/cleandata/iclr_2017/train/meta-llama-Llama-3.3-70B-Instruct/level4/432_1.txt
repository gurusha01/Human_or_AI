This paper presents a well-structured and coherent narrative that effectively integrates value-based and policy-based methodologies, including regularized policy gradient approaches, by highlighting novel connections between the value function and policy. The theoretical contributions are innovative and perceptive, offering significant potential for impact within the reinforcement learning (RL) community beyond the specific algorithm proposed. Notably, the authors leverage these theoretical foundations to derive a unified framework for Q-learning and policy gradient methods, demonstrating performance comparable to or surpassing state-of-the-art algorithms on the Atari suite. The empirical analysis is thoroughly explained, with clear details on the optimization processes employed.
A minor observation pertains to the stationary distribution associated with a policy, where distinctions between discounted and non-discounted distributions introduce subtleties that, although negligible in tabular cases, will require consideration in function approximation scenarios. However, this does not pose a significant issue for the current manuscript.
In conclusion, the paper merits acceptance due to its groundbreaking contributions, which are poised to influence a wide range of RL research. By paving the way for future theoretical and algorithmic developments, this work has the potential to leave a lasting impact on the field.
