The authors present a time-series model incorporating discrete states, tailored for robotics applications. However, I believe the proposed approach is overly simplistic in its current form, as evidenced by several limitations: the state space is precisely calibrated to the experimental setup in terms of dimensionality and topology, the transition model assumes linear displacements based on actions, and the observations are restricted to a single dimension. This seems to lag behind the current state of the art, such as the "Embed to Control" method by Watter et al. (2015), which learns state representations directly from pixel data. 
Moreover, the authors' comparative analysis is limited to an out-of-the-box LSTM model, neglecting other relevant methods. Additionally, given the extensive prior research on combining Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) with Neural Networks (NNs), I think it is essential for the authors to contextualize their work within this existing literature, highlighting its novelty and contributions relative to established approaches.
