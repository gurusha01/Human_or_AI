The authors propose an algorithm for constructing sum-product networks (SPNs) from data, assuming a Gaussian distribution for all observed data dimensions. Due to the restrictive structure of SPN architectures, creating a valid and dataset-specific architecture is a challenging task, necessitating the use of structure-learning algorithms. Due to the complexity of SPN construction, previous state-of-the-art methods, such as those presented in Jaini 2016, have relied on randomly selecting an SPN that satisfies completeness and decomposability constraints, followed by parameter learning. 
In contrast, the contributed algorithm commences with a fully factorized model and incrementally builds structure by iterating through the data, updating node statistics to maintain SPN validity. The Jaini reference plays a significant role in understanding the paper, as it represents the previous state-of-the-art in SPNs for Gaussian distributed data and serves as a comparison point for the authors' performance evaluations on various datasets. 
Although the authors report improved results on 5 out of 7 datasets compared to alternative methods, such as randomly constructed SPNs, Stacked Restricted Boltzmann Machines, and Generative Moment Matching networks, the lack of familiarity with these datasets limits the ability to assess the significance of the reported log-likelihood values. 
In general, while not an expert in SPNs, the manuscript appears to be well-written and novel, with the algorithm demonstrating good performance on selected datasets. However, the presentation lacks theoretical inspiration and justification, making evaluation more challenging. Furthermore, the manuscript bears some resemblance to Jaini, with similar text and experiments, which may indicate a limited amount of new work, although this assessment may be influenced by unfamiliarity with the datasets. 
Some minor issues were noted, including the desire to see non-uniform covariances in the toy task data (Fig 3) for each Gaussian component, which would provide additional insight into the algorithm's capabilities. Additionally, the SPN construction method involves two hyperparameters, and investigating their impact on the graph structure would be beneficial, a point that was raised in a pre-review question and acknowledged by the authors.
