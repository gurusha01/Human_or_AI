This paper presents a methodology for extracting rules from vector space representations derived from knowledge bases using nonnegative RESCAL. The manuscript is well-organized and clearly written. However, the underlying rationale for mining rules from embedding spaces remains ambiguous. 
If the primary motivation is to enhance performance in link prediction tasks, the paper falls short by not providing a comparative analysis of the proposed framework (FRM) against the original vector space model's performance. 
Alternatively, if the goal is to improve the interpretability and debuggability of vector space models' learned representations, the paper lacks sufficient discussion and supporting elements to substantiate this claim.
Additional concerns include:
- The absence of baseline comparisons for the methods presented in Figures 1 and 2 is a notable omission.
- The limited scalability of the rule mining algorithm is a significant drawback that warrants attention.
- Figure 3 fails to convincingly demonstrate the utility of rule-based systems for predictive or interpretive purposes, as the learned rules appear suboptimal for both applications.
