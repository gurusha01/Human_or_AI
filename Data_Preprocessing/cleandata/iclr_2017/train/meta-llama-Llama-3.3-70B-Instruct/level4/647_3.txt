This manuscript introduces a novel approach that simultaneously learns a model and an inference procedure using recurrent neural networks, specifically in the context of inverse problems. 
The methodology proposed is intriguing, yielding impressive results, and the overall presentation of the paper is well-organized and clear.
To further enhance the paper, it would be beneficial to include an analysis on the practical insights the network gains regarding natural images, particularly in denoising applications. For instance, an examination of the learned filters could provide insight into their characteristics. Additionally, investigating the network's sensitivity to various image structures, such as edges, would be worthwhile. Furthermore, a detailed explanation of the role of the state in the recurrent unit, including the operation of the gates, would add depth to the discussion.
Overall, this is a valuable contribution that deserves acceptance.
