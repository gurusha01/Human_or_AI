This manuscript presents a novel approach to modeling correlated time series by combining multiple loss functions that leverage neural networks. The loss functions comprise a data fit term, an autoregressive latent state term, and a term that captures relationships between pairs of time series, which requires prior knowledge of these relationships.
Although modeling relational time series is a well-established problem, it has received limited attention in the neural network community, potentially due to the importance of incorporating uncertainty into the representation. The authors acknowledge this need and propose an approach that considers distributions in the state space.
The formulation is relatively straightforward, combining loss functions to extend the work of Ziat et al. (2016) in certain aspects. However, the implementation is unconvincing, particularly in its treatment of uncertainty. The inference in the model is naive, and a more principled approach, such as employing a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) framework, would be expected for better uncertainty handling. Furthermore, the Gaussian covariance collapses into a variance, which is undesirable for modeling correlated time series. Alternative approaches, such as those discussed in [2], can effectively capture correlations in the states.
The model's treatment of uncertainty also restricts the decoding function to linear functions, significantly limiting its power. State-of-the-art methods in time series modeling have moved beyond this constraint, particularly in the Gaussian process community, as seen in [2-5]. Comparing the proposed method to these approaches or discussing them would be beneficial.
One innovative aspect of the model is the requirement for prior structure of the correlation, which can be a useful and original component. However, this also constitutes a limitation, as it is often unrealistic to have this prior information in many scenarios. The regularizer used to encourage "similar" time series to have closeness in the state space is also problematic, as it cannot capture the complexity of variations in similarity across different groups. The use of binary indicator variables (e_ij) to model these relationships further limits the model's ability to capture rich correlations.
The experiments demonstrate the proposed method's effectiveness but are not entirely convincing. They fail to provide sufficient insight into the model's properties and the effects of its different components, such as the sensitivity of the regularizers. The results are also not particularly exciting, especially given the uncertainty surrounding the choice of loss function, which makes it challenging to use the method in practice. Reporting the optimized values of the parameters Î» would provide valuable insight into the behavior of the different losses.
Given the well-established nature of time series analysis, it is unclear why this model would be preferred over other approaches. Methodologically, there are no novel components that offer a proven advantage over past methods. The potential advantages of incorporating uncertainty in the states and correlation of the time series are not adequately explored in this paper, making it difficult to justify the use of this model over existing approaches.
