This paper presents a well-designed end-to-end image compression and decompression system, trained using deep learning techniques, which outperforms traditional image compression algorithms such as JPEG-2000 in terms of bit-rate versus quality trade-offs. A significant contribution of this work is the development of a differentiable "rate" function, enabling effective training with various rate-distortion trade-offs, and demonstrating the potential of deep learning in new applications. The impact of this research is expected to extend beyond image compression, as the introduced differentiable approximations can be applied to other tasks that require similar functions.
The authors have provided a thorough response to my initial query. However, I still maintain that a sufficiently complex network, when optimized to minimize distortion under fixed range and quantization constraints, would inherently learn to generate codes within the specified range with maximum entropy, thus achieving the upper bound. Nevertheless, the authors' second argument is persuasive, suggesting that imposing such a constraint would necessitate a specific structure for the compressor output, which, to match the current system's compression efficiency, would require a more complex network capable of performing the computations currently handled by a separate variable rate encoder for storing quantization values.
