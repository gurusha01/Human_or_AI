This manuscript presents a challenging narrative to follow. The explanation of the proposed algorithm would benefit from supplementary materials, such as pseudo-code to illustrate the computational workflow or a graphical representation to clarify the update process. In its current form, certain aspects remain unclear. Additionally, Figure 1 lacks explicit descriptions for its labels, notably "SGD task-wise, 1 comm," which raises questions about the intended meaning, potentially referring to a layer-wise approach instead.
The evaluation methodology raises significant concerns: firstly, the absence of a comparison with established asynchronous baseline methods, such as those utilizing a parameter server, is notable. Secondly, the use of AlexNet as a benchmarking tool is not particularly insightful. Given its architectural differences from current state-of-the-art image recognition models, especially in terms of layer count which is a crucial factor in the discussion presented in section 6.3, and its reliance on numerous fully-connected layers, AlexNet's compute/communication ratios may not accurately reflect those of more contemporary and relevant architectures.
