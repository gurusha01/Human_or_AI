This manuscript proposes the notion of fuzzy paraphrases to enhance the learning of distributed word representations from a corpus supplemented by a lexicon or ontology, addressing the context-dependent nature of polysemy that prior approaches have overlooked. The core concept involves introducing a context-sensitivity function for paraphrase candidates, which is derived from bilingual translation agreement, to down-weight context-dependent candidates. The rationale behind the model selection is logical, and the inclusion of suitable paraphrases and exclusion of unsuitable ones during training should, in theory, improve word representation quality.
However, two key questions arise: whether the proposed method effectively achieves this objective, and if so, whether it yields significant practical benefits. Concerning the first question, the parameterization of the control function f(x_ij) appears suboptimal, and exploring alternative configurations, such as baseline experiments where the function's effect is diminished, would be valuable. Additionally, incorporating nearby word embeddings into the function could be beneficial, although this may incur computational costs. The experimental results, as presented, do not clearly differentiate the fuzzy paraphrase approach from existing work, as evidenced by the lack of distinct trends in tables 3 and 4.
Regarding the second question, drawing conclusions from analogy tasks alone is challenging due to the potential impact of extraneous factors, such as corpus size and content, window size, and vocabulary size. 
In summary, this paper presents a sound idea, but the experiments do not convincingly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. With enhanced experiments and analysis, this paper would be a strong candidate for acceptance; in its current form, however, its merits are uncertain, leaving me undecided.
