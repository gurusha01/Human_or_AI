This manuscript investigates the graph embedding problem utilizing an encoder-decoder approach. The empirical evaluation on real-world network datasets demonstrates that the features extracted by the proposed model exhibit promising performance in classification tasks.
Notable strengths of this paper include:
1. The innovative application of natural language processing techniques to graph mining, which presents an intriguing research direction.
2. The paper's organization is logical and easy to follow.
However, several weaknesses were identified:
1. A comparison with state-of-the-art methods, specifically Graph Kernels, is noticeably absent.
2. The problem statement lacks motivation, and the authors fail to provide concrete applications or differentiate their approach from existing graph kernel methods, further emphasizing the need for a comparison with graph kernel techniques.
3. Additional experiments are necessary to comprehensively demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed feature extraction method, such as applying it to clustering, search, and prediction tasks.
4. The presentation of the paper is marred by numerous typos and ambiguous statements, which detract from its overall quality.
5. Although the authors mention graph kernels, they neglect to include a comparative analysis in the experimental section, and solely evaluating the proposed method based on classification accuracy is insufficient.
