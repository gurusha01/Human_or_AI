This manuscript proposes a hierarchical clustering approach that leverages learned CNN features to construct a phylogenetic tree, predicated on the notion that feature similarity correlates with tree distance. The authors explore three distinct methods for tree construction: approximating a central point, generating a minimum spanning tree, and employing a multidimensional scaling-based technique, with the latter yielding the most favorable outcomes. This application of deep features is noteworthy, yet I am inclined to recommend rejection due to several concerns:
1) The experimental scope is exceedingly narrow, encompassing merely 6 fish species, 11 canine species, and 8 vehicle classes, with a notable absence of quantitative results. Instead, the authors rely on visual comparisons between the generated tree and the WordNet tree, which raises questions about the validity of using WordNet as a benchmark, given its non-biological origins and potential discrepancies with actual evolutionary relationships between species.
2) The technical innovation presented in this work is limited, as the majority of the pipeline consists of standard components, such as utilizing pre-trained models for feature extraction and relying on established methods for hierarchical clustering. In my assessment, the technical contributions of this paper are modest, which further supports the recommendation for rejection.
