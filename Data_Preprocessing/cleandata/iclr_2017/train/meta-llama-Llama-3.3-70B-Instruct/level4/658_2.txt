The paper proposes an intriguing interpretation of SPN and MPN as encoders and decoders of RL, a perspective that warrants exploration in a dedicated paper. However, the current manuscript falls short of convincingly presenting this idea, even in its revised form. A substantial overhaul, rather than minor adjustments, is necessary to effectively convey this concept, which appears to exceed the scope of the authors' current revisions.
The experimental design, as noted by other reviewers, lacks structure and fails to provide meaningful insights. While I could elaborate on the experimental flaws, the detailed comments from other reviewers have already comprehensively addressed these issues, rendering further enumeration redundant.
In summary, the paper does not fulfill its promise, and I recommend a clear rejection for this conference. Furthermore, the use of the MNIST dataset, which is now considered a simplistic benchmark, does not strengthen the paper's case, as it may not convincingly demonstrate the authors' claims to a broader audience.
