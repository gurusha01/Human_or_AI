Summary
This manuscript presents an algorithm for learning the structure of continuous Sum-Product Networks (SPNs) in a single pass through the data, essentially by expanding the SPN when correlations between variables are detected.
NOTE
As I am not an expert in SPNs, I face challenges in assessing the significance of the results due to my limited familiarity with the datasets used.
Pro
- The work appears to have potential impact, proposing a straightforward and elegant single-pass algorithm for learning SPN structure, which contrasts with the common approach of using random structures in online settings.
Con
- The paper underwent substantial updates between the submission deadline and the review submission, which raises concerns.
- The initial version of the paper gave the impression of being hastily written, lacking polish.
- The comparison with existing literature is inadequate; for instance, the statement "several automated structure learning techniques have been proposed" is followed by six citations without discussing their relevance, the ideas borrowed from offline settings, or how they apply to this online setting. Moreover, since this work addresses both structure and parameter learning, a comparison with online parameter learning papers (three of which are cited) would be valuable, especially considering that prior approaches, such as Bayesian Moment Matching in Jaini 2016, seem more principled.
- Due to my limited knowledge of SPNs and the datasets, I am unable to fully evaluate the strength of the results, but they seem somewhat underwhelming on larger datasets compared to random structures.
Remaining questions after the paper updates
- Table 3: While using random structure as a baseline is acceptable, it is unclear how the parameters were learned in this context. Was a simple running average used, or were more advanced methods employed?
- Table 1: The presentation of positive average log-likelihood values is puzzling, as one would expect an average of log(p<=1) < 0 values. This discrepancy requires clarification.
Based on the concerns outlined, particularly the paper's significant updates after the submission deadline and its overall lack of polish at the time of submission, I recommend rejection. The manuscript should have been finalized and refined before the initial submission, rather than during the review period.
