This manuscript proposes a straightforward approach to establishing a visual hierarchy of ImageNet classes using a CNN trained for class discrimination. The authors examine two metrics to assess inter-class similarity: (1) softmax output probabilities, which form the class confusion matrix, and (2) L2 distance between fc7 features. Additionally, they explore three methods to construct the hierarchy from the distance matrix: (1) approximate central point, (2) minimal spanning tree, and (3) multidimensional scaling, as per Borg and Groenen's 2005 methodology.
The paper claims two primary contributions: (1) the construction of a biological evolutionary tree and (2) providing insights into the representations generated by deep networks. 
However, concerning the first contribution, although the work's motivation is rooted in biology, the method itself relies solely on visual similarity. Consequently, the constructed trees are unlikely to accurately reflect the evolutionary hierarchy, and notably, there is a lack of quantitative experiments to substantiate this claim.
Regarding the second contribution, the technical examination falls short of the depth expected for ICLR. The conclusions drawn from the paper seem limited to the observation that CNNs can group categories based on visual similarities, with deeper networks outperforming shallower ones (as illustrated in Figure 2).
In conclusion, unfortunately, this paper is not suitable for publication in its current form.
