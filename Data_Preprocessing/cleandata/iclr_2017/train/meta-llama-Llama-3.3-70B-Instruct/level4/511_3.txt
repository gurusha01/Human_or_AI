I lack experience with the HJI PDE, having previously worked solely with parabolic PDEs like diffusion, which limits my understanding of the problem's transformation into a supervised loss. As such, my evaluation is speculative. Many ICLR readers may encounter similar difficulties, so if accepted, the authors should consider adding an introductory appendix on the HJI PDE to facilitate comprehension. My key observations are:
1. A potential drawback of this method appears to be the necessity of training a new network for each distinct domain, system function f(x), or boundary condition. If accurate, this raises questions about the approach's practicality compared to existing solutions for these PDEs. Could the authors discuss a more unified strategy that would enable generalization across various PDEs with minimal adjustments?
2. The network's performance sensitivity to varying domain sizes is unclear, as only a single size (51 x 51) was evaluated. Does the error rate increase with larger domain sizes?
3. How applicable is this approach to other types of PDEs, such as diffusion equations, and what are its limitations in terms of generality?
