This manuscript presents a range of methods for visualizing learned generative models, with a particular emphasis on VAE and GAN architectures. Evaluating this work is somewhat complex, as it does not introduce a novel algorithm, model, or application. On one hand, the proposed techniques are likely to be highly relevant and valuable to the generative modeling community, and this paper warrants broad dissemination. The methods outlined are straightforward, clearly explained, and can be immediately applied by researchers working with generative models. However, the paper's suitability for the ICLR conference track is questionable, as it lacks deeper theoretical insights into sampling generative models and does not include comparative or quantitative assessments of the proposed techniques. Overall, my assessment is ambivalent, as I believe the techniques have merit and should be accessible to those interested in generative modeling, but I require a compelling justification from the authors for why ICLR is the appropriate platform for this research. Additionally, it would be beneficial to understand the rationale behind the superiority of spherical interpolation when the prior distribution is uniform.
