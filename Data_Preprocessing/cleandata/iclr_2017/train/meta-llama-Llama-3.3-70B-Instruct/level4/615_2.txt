The time complexity of L-SR1 appears to be O(mn), which is not explicitly mentioned in the paper. 
The experimental results indicate that L-SR1 fails to surpass Adadelta (and presumably Adam) in terms of performance. 
Considering the time complexity of L-SR1, a plot of time on the x-axis would likely reveal that L-SR1 is substantially slower, potentially by a factor of m. 
The finding that a memory size of 2 yielded the lowest minimum test loss over 90 iterations implies that the primary contributor to L-SR1's performance was its momentum, suggesting that the second-order information provided minimal benefit.
