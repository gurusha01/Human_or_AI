The proposed submission presents a modified GAN architecture that incorporates "encrypt" and "decrypt" modules, denoted as Alice and Bob, respectively, as well as an additional module, Eve, which attempts to decrypt the signal without a key. The adversarial game is designed to converge to a system where Alice and Bob can communicate securely, at least for a designated part of the signal, while Eve is unable to break the code. The authors provide examples using toy data, where Alice, Bob, and Eve networks are implemented to take N-bit random plain-text and key values and produce N-entry floating-point ciphertexts for N = 16, 32, and 64, with both plaintext and key values being uniformly distributed.
The concept explored in this submission is intriguing, as it allows the modules to learn to encrypt and decrypt a signal while an adversary, Eve, simultaneously learns to try to break the encryption. This approach enables some data to remain unencrypted, while the portion correlated with the encrypted signal must be encrypted to prevent Eve from predicting the encrypted part.
However, despite the novelty of this idea, there are substantial obstacles to its practical implementation:
1) The optimization of GANs, as well as the objective considered in this submission, is notoriously unstable, as evident from the convergence figures. The only guarantees of privacy are against an Eve that has converged to a strong adversary, which is unlikely to be the case in practice. The paper fails to provide a reliable guarantee of the safety of the data transmission, which raises concerns about the approach's viability.
2) Public key encryption systems are widely available, computationally efficient, and have been successfully applied in various contexts. The toy examples presented in the paper do not demonstrate a clear solution to a real-world problem, making the approach seem more like an interesting thought experiment rather than a practical solution. While it is possible that a relevant example may emerge in the future, validating the approach, until such an example is presented, the submission remains largely theoretical.
