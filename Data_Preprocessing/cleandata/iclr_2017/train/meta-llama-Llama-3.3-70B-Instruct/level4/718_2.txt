This paper presents a recharacterization of feedforward neural networks within the framework of a multi-agent system. However, it appears to be grounded in an inaccurate assumption that multi-layer neural networks were originally designed with full matrix multiplications in mind, overlooking the extensive historical development of artificial neural networks. These networks, drawing inspiration from biological neurons, were conceived with units featuring sparse connectivity, operating in parallel. The matrix formulation, in this context, serves primarily as a notational convenience, and it's worth noting that in the case of sparse matrix operations or convolutions, zero values are neither stored nor multiplied.
Beyond the semantic shift of referring to neurons as agents, the paper does not seem to introduce any novel or captivating concepts. The integration of valuable insights from the multi-agent systems community into neural network research would be a significant contribution. For such an approach to be compelling, it would need to incorporate previously unexplored elements in neural network research, backed by robust empirical evidence demonstrating substantial improvements in either accuracy or efficiency. Unfortunately, the current paper falls short of achieving this.
