This paper proposes a methodology for concurrently predicting joint motion and classifying activities from sequential data, with applications in both fruit fly motion and online handwriting recognition. The approach employs a traditional encoder-decoder framework, augmented with skip connections that facilitate direct communication between the encoder and decoder at corresponding levels of abstraction. By discretizing motion and utilizing classification for prediction, the model is trained on a combination of classification loss and motion prediction loss, aiming to exploit the latter in a semi-supervised setting for unlabeled data.
Although the concept of leveraging predictions to enhance feature representations for discrimination is not novel, the paper introduces several intriguing ideas, drawing partial inspiration from other fields. A key concern, however, lies in the experimental evaluation. While the experimental section presents an abundance of qualitative visualizations, quantitative assessments are less prevalent.
In the online handwriting recognition application, the authors compare classification performance with a previously published method by the first author. Nonetheless, the performance gain in motion prediction, as depicted in Figure 5c, appears marginal compared to the baseline, raising questions about its significance. Furthermore, the absence of recognition results for the handwriting application is notable, prompting the question of whether this aspect was evaluated.
Certain figures, such as Figure 5a, are challenging to interpret due to the lack of introduction to the term "BesNet." Figure 4 conveys multiple, distinct narratives, suggesting that it would be beneficial to divide it into at least two separate figures. The statement "animal behavior is nondeterministic" could be perceived as an overstatement, as it depends on the frame of reference. A more nuanced rephrasing might acknowledge that the underlying cognitive processes are inaccessible, rendering the behavior seemingly nondeterministic given the available information.
Ultimately, the question arises as to whether a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) would be a more natural fit for the predictive component of this task, considering the nondeterministic nature of the behavioral model.
