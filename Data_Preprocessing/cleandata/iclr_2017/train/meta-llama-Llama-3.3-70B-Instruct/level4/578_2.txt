This manuscript investigates the impact of various data augmentation techniques on the performance of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and introduces an additional loss function to promote approximate invariance or equivariance, demonstrating some benefits.
The paper is well-structured and clearly conveys its objectives, tackling the crucial topic of invariances in CNNs, which is a highly valued area of research. However, the manuscript is divided into two distinct sections - an empirical analysis of equivariances in existing CNNs and a proposal for equivariance objectives - each of which could be improved if considered independently.
The empirical study has a limited scope, making it challenging to draw comprehensive conclusions:
- The analysis is restricted to a single network architecture; incorporating at least one additional architecture would enhance generalizability.
- The focus on a single layer (fc7) is problematic, as the top layer is typically the most invariant; considering at least one convolutional layer would be more informative.
- The reliance on the scanned text dataset is a limitation, although the ImageNet results are promising.
The authors provide a useful analysis of how performance degrades with increasing transformation degrees and interpret the results. Nevertheless, a more in-depth analysis would be beneficial. The current evaluation of networks using jittered data yields limited conclusions. Proposing alternative methods to assess invariance and equivariance could lead to more insightful findings.
The proposed loss function is only briefly discussed (Section 4, approximately half a page) and bears resemblance to existing invariance/equivariance objectives in the literature, such as those presented by Decoste and Scholkopf in "Training Invariant Support Vector Machines" (Machine Learning, 2002).
Dividing the paper into these two distinct contributions may not be the most effective approach, as both sections feel somewhat incomplete. A comprehensive treatment of either contribution could result in a more cohesive and impactful manuscript.
