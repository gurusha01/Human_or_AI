I highly appreciate the potential of this work and believe it could be a valuable asset for my own research endeavors, as it presents a promising tool.
Nevertheless, the manuscript falls short in terms of providing sufficient detail, which significantly hinders the ability to replicate the research. The lack of comprehensive information makes it challenging for others to reimplement the study, undermining the reproducibility that is fundamental to scientific inquiry. In contrast to other notable publications introducing software, such as those on TensorFlow, Theano, and Edward, which are accompanied by open-source code, this work does not offer such transparency, resulting in an incomplete presentation.
While I recognize the merit of the submission, I question whether ICLR is the most suitable platform for this research. Conferences focused on robotics, like IROS and ICRA, might offer a more receptive audience and provide opportunities for more targeted feedback and engagement with relevant communities, which could be beneficial for the authors to explore.
