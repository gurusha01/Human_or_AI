This manuscript presents a novel attention-based recurrent neural network architecture that enables iterative comparison of image pairs through alternating attention mechanisms. The experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on the Omniglot dataset, with a notable proportion of the performance improvement attributed to the utilization of extracted convolutional features as input.
The revised paper exhibits substantial improvements over the initial submission, incorporating revisions based on preliminary review feedback. Nevertheless, the qualitative results, such as those illustrated in Figure 2, remain somewhat underdeveloped and would benefit from additional examples and in-depth analysis. Furthermore, it is observed that the attention mechanism in Figure 2 consistently focuses on the entire character, which raises questions regarding its effectiveness. Intuitively, one would expect the attention mechanism to concentrate on relevant character features rather than the entire character, particularly when zooming in. The fact that it attends to the full character against a solid background appears to be a simplistic solution, which casts doubt on the origin of the significant performance gains reported.
Although the paper has undergone significant polishing, certain aspects still require more detailed elaboration, such as the specifics of the convolutional feature extraction process that yields considerable performance enhancements.
