This paper presents a novel approach to question classification, utilizing corresponding answers to inform the classification process. The methodology employs group sparse autoencoders to represent question groups, yielding enhanced accuracy compared to existing baselines. However, the baseline models utilized for comparison are somewhat outdated, and it would be beneficial to evaluate the proposed method against more contemporary convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) based approaches. Furthermore, a more detailed analysis of the individual components' contributions would be insightful, such as quantifying the specific impact of the group sparse autoencoder (GSA) on the observed improvement.
