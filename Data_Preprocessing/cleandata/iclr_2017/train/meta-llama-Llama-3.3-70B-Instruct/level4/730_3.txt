I concur with my fellow reviewer that the paper's scope of application is somewhat restricted. Nonetheless, I appreciate the paper's overall objective of assessing the efficacy of recent techniques in conjunction with recurrent networks. 
The authors present their work as a methodology for enhancing recurrent baselines in experimental settings, but the paper falls short in demonstrating its broader applicability beyond a narrow range of tasks. To truly challenge traditional baselines, it is essential to validate the effectiveness of these methods across a diverse spectrum of tasks.
A notable strength of the paper lies in its thorough evaluation of numerous recent techniques, supported by extensive experimental replications. However, the current results do not reveal whether there are potential synergies between certain enhancements and sentiment analysis. It would be valuable to investigate whether these findings can be generalized across a wide range of tasks, providing a more comprehensive understanding of their implications.
