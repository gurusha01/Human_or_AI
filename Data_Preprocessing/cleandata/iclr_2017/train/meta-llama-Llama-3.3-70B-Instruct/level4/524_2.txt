The idea of augmenting data in the embedding space is intriguing and effectively conveyed, with convincing justifications across various tasks including spoken digit recognition and image classification.
One notable observation regarding the comparative analysis is the consistent utilization of a straightforward 2-layer MLP as the baseline model across all tasks. However, it remains unclear whether the observed benefits persist when employing a more sophisticated baseline model.
Additionally, it is worth noting that the augmented context vectors are utilized for classification purposes, prompting the question of how this approach compares to using reconstructed inputs for the same purpose. Furthermore, as evidenced in Table 4, both input and feature space extrapolation yield performance improvements, raising the question of whether these two methods are complementary or not.
