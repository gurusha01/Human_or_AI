The authors present a transfer learning methodology tailored to a range of NLP tasks, which seem to be organized in a sequence of increasing complexity, progressing from straightforward syntactic tasks to more challenging semantic ones.
In terms of novelty, the authors' approach to transfer learning involves integrating models for each task in a manner that adheres to the established hierarchy of NLP task complexity. This design gives the overall architecture a cascaded appearance, somewhat diverging from traditional transfer learning frameworks. Relevant prior work in this domain can be found in existing literature, as evidenced by preliminary searches yielding notable results, such as those discovered in the initial Google search results.
