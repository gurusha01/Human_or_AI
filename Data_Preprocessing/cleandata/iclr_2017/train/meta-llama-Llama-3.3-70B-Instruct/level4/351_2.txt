This manuscript tackles the significant challenge of high-dimensional data (d>>n) in deep learning, proposing a sensible approach that leverages lower-dimensional feature embeddings to facilitate the application of deep learning techniques to large datasets. The paper is clearly and effectively written, with empirical results demonstrating notable enhancements over suitable baseline methods.
