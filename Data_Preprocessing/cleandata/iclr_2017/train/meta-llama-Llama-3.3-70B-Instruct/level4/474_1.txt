Upon re-examining the paper in conjunction with the authors' prior work, MUS-ROVER, I gained a deeper understanding of the current submission, which was essential for appreciating its content. However, despite my familiarity with the JSB chorales, probabilistic approaches, and n-grams, I found certain sections of the paper challenging to follow, largely due to the extensive notation used, which hindered clarity.
The ideas and approaches presented are commendable and deserving of publication and further exploration. Nevertheless, in its current form, I question whether ICLR is the most suitable venue, not due to the application itself, which I believe can be highly relevant, nor necessarily the approach, but rather the paper's density and lack of space to fully elaborate on the concepts, provide clear examples, and offer sufficient background information for the intended audience. A long-form journal publication could potentially provide the necessary space to explain these ideas comprehensively, include clearer running examples, and demonstrate results on additional datasets to showcase the approach's generality.
If the paper were to undergo substantial revisions, potentially focusing on a single aspect of the system, I would consider revising my evaluation. However, given the page count constraints, I think the effort would be better invested in developing a clearer and more detailed journal submission.
Additionally, I have some specific questions and observations. The bottom row of the top part of Figure 4, labeled "5-gram," is not entirely clear to me, and I would appreciate any intuition the authors can provide about what is happening there.
I am also curious about the scalability of the described approach, particularly in scenarios that might involve more complex datasets, such as those used in teaching orchestration with a large number of instruments. The potential for exhaustive searches or enumerations and the combinatorial complexity of counting occurrences of atomic operator compositions in longer pieces raise questions about the method's practicality in such applications. Conceptually organizing orchestration rules hierarchically could be beneficial, and any comments on this aspect would be valuable.
Following discussions and potential revisions, I have reconsidered my score, as indicated in the addendum.
