This manuscript explores the application of submodular sum product networks (SPNs) to scene understanding, building upon the foundational work of Poon (2011) that demonstrated the efficacy of SPNs in deep linear models. The authors introduce an innovative extension of the original SPN model by incorporating submodular unary and pairwise potentials, thereby enhancing its capabilities. Furthermore, they propose a novel inference algorithm designed to leverage these submodular extensions. The evaluation of their approach is conducted on the Stanford Background Dataset, with comparisons drawn against multiple baseline methods.
The strengths of this paper include:
+ The introduction of a new SPN formulation that incorporates submodularity, offering a fresh perspective on the traditional SPN model.
+ The development of a new inference algorithm tailored to the submodular SPN framework, which has the potential to improve computational efficiency and accuracy in scene understanding tasks.
However, several limitations and areas for improvement are noted:
- A critical omission in the manuscript is the lack of discussion regarding the learning process of the SSPN structure and the mechanism by which the generative process selects symbols (operations) at each level. Elucidating these aspects is essential for a comprehensive understanding of the proposed methodology.
- The evaluation section is found to be deficient. The authors restrict their comparison to their own approach and baseline methods, neglecting to consider other relevant approaches that could provide a more holistic view of their model's performance. Additionally, extending the evaluation to include regular image segmentation tasks (such as hierarchical segmentation) on datasets like BSD could offer deeper insights into the model's versatility and effectiveness.
While the concept presented in the paper is intriguing and holds promise, it requires further development and refinement to meet the standards for publication. It is recommended that the authors augment their manuscript with more detailed explanations of their methodology, conduct more extensive experiments to validate their approach, and provide a comprehensive description of the learning process. By addressing these suggestions, the authors can significantly enhance the quality and impact of their contribution.
