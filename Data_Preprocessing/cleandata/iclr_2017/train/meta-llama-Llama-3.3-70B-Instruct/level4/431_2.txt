This paper presents PALEO, a straightforward approach to modeling the execution of deep neural networks, which surprisingly yields accurate predictions of computation time for image recognition networks in both single-machine and distributed environments.
The capability to forecast network execution time is highly valuable, and the authors demonstrate that even a simplistic model can achieve reasonable accuracy, which is a notable advantage. However, the experimental evaluation is limited to a narrow range of networks (AlexNet, Inception, NiN) and settings, which raises concerns about the model's robustness. A more comprehensive assessment, encompassing a diverse set of models (including RNNs, fully connected, and adversarial networks) and scenarios (varying batch sizes, layer sizes, device placement, etc.), would likely expose the limitations of the proposed simplified model. Consequently, this reviewer initially considered the paper to be borderline, representing a preliminary yet rudimentary step lacking substantial experimental validation. Nevertheless, with the addition of further experiments, a revised assessment is warranted.
