This manuscript presents an extension of the parametric texture synthesis framework introduced by Gatys et al., incorporating long-range correlations of textures into the model. The authors achieve this by augmenting the synthesis loss with Gram matrices computed from spatially shifted feature vectors. The resulting synthesized textures exhibit visual improvements over the original method, particularly for textures characterized by highly structured long-range correlations, such as brick patterns.
The paper is well-structured and effectively communicates the methodology and underlying principles, supported by a diverse range of synthesis experiments across various textures. 
One limitation, shared with existing approaches including Gatys et al., is the issue of sample variability. The global minimum of the proposed objective function corresponds to the original image, which poses a challenge. While the authors partially address this by conducting inpainting experiments that require coherence with the image borders, the paper does not offer novel insights into resolving this variability issue, which would have been a valuable addition.
Overall, the work represents a straightforward yet effective modification of the Gatys et al. method, worthy of publication due to its contributions, although it does not represent a significant breakthrough in the field.
