The authors introduce a novel methodology for estimating maximum entropy distributions under expectation constraints, leveraging normalizing flow networks to perform non-linear transformations on samples from a tractable density function via invertible transformations, thereby facilitating access to the resulting distribution's density. The parameters of the normalizing flow network are optimized by maximizing a stochastic entropy estimate, obtained through sampling and log-density evaluation on the resulting samples, with the optimization problem incorporating stochastic constraints on expectations with respect to samples from the network, approximated through sampling. The augmented Lagrangian method is employed to solve this stochastic optimization problem.
Quality:
The paper appears to be technically sound, with the primary concern being the approach utilized to apply the augmented Lagrangian method to stochastic objectives and constraints. Although the authors propose a solution based on a hypothesis test, it is likely that this issue has been previously addressed in the literature, and the authors should provide commentary on this. The experiments demonstrate the proposed approach's ability to outperform or match Gibbs sampling from the exact optimal distribution, with the added benefit of providing a closed-form solution for the density.
However, the problems considered in the experiments seem relatively straightforward, with the Dirichlet distribution being relatively smooth and the financial problem involving a one-dimensional distribution, which can be solved using numerical methods to compute the normalization constant and plot the exact density. The method's performance in more challenging settings, such as high-dimensional spaces or complex non-linear constraints, remains unclear.
Clarity:
The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with clear explanations of the proposed methodology and experiments.
Originality:
The proposed method is not particularly original, as it primarily involves applying existing techniques, such as normalizing flow networks, to a specific problem. The methodological contributions are limited, with the combination of normalizing flow networks and the augmented Lagrangian method being the only notable aspect.
Significance:
The results appear significant, as the authors demonstrate the ability to find densities of maximum entropy distributions, which was previously thought to be impossible. However, the practical usefulness of this approach is unclear, and the authors should consider applying their method to more challenging problems with clear practical relevance. The problem addressed using real-world financial data could have been solved using one-dimensional quadrature, and the authors should explore more complex problems to demonstrate the significance of their approach.
Minor comments:
Additional details should be provided on how the plot in the bottom right of Figure 2 was obtained. The statement "a Dirichlet whose KL to the true pâˆ— is small" requires further clarification, including an explanation of how the Dirichlet was chosen. The updated review score reflects the new experiments included in the revised paper submitted by the authors.
