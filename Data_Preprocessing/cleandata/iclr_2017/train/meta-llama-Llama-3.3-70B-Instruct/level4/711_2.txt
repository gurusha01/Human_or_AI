This manuscript proposes an architectural framework for the answer extraction task, with an evaluation conducted on the SQUAD dataset. The suggested model utilizes a recurrent neural network to generate fixed-length representations of all spans within the answer document. Notably, it achieves superior performance to several baseline models in terms of exact match and F1 score on the SQUAD dataset.
However, it is regrettable that the manuscript lacks blind test results, which are currently unavailable due to copyright restrictions. Furthermore, numerous other systems listed on the SQUAD leaderboard could have served as additional points of comparison.
The absence of test set results also raises concerns regarding the hyperparameter grid search, which was performed directly on the development set, despite the authors' implementation of cross-validation experiments.
