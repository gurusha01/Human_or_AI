This paper has two notable strengths:
1. The concept of a data-dependent proposal distribution for MCMC is intriguing, and although it has been previously explored, such as in the works of Zhu (2000) and Jampani (2014), the latter of which presented a compelling approach to informed sampling, it is not a sufficiently novel contribution to be a primary reason for acceptance to ICLR.
2. The results presented are impressive, with the proposed algorithm achieving a speedup of approximately 33%, which significantly surpasses the typical 10% improvement expected from optimization techniques, as evidenced by the standard MCMC results on randomly-generated programs, which showed a 15% speedup. This substantial gain makes the paper worthy of publication.
However, a case can be made against accepting this paper to ICLR, as its focus may not align closely with the conference's primary objectives. ICLR typically emphasizes advances in automatic representation of data and models, whereas this paper's themes may be more broadly applicable to machine learning, making it potentially more suitable for conferences like NIPS or ICML. Although the paper touches upon the representation of generated programs, which could be considered tangentially relevant to ICLR's scope, it may face stiff competition from more directly relevant submissions, potentially relegating it to a poster presentation. Furthermore, submitting this work to a programming language conference might yield greater impact in the long run.
Despite these considerations, I recommend accepting this paper because it offers valuable insights and presents exceptionally strong results.
