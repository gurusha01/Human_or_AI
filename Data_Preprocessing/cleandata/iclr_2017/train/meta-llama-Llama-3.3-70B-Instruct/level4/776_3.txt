Disclosure: As a non-expert in machine translation algorithms, I approach this review with a general perspective.
Summary: The translation process typically involves an iterative refinement approach, where a human translator starts with a rough draft and progressively corrects it. This paper proposes to adapt this framework for automated systems, mimicking the iterative process of human translation.
The paper is well-written overall, effectively conveying its ideas and concepts. However, the inclusion of architectural diagrams would significantly enhance the reader's understanding of the interrelationships between the various algorithms presented.
I appreciate the inclusion of preliminary experimental results, which provide valuable insight into the complexity of the task. To further strengthen the paper, it would be beneficial to emphasize the connections between error detection in initial translations and the iterative refinement process. Utilizing post-edited text as a ground truth could also increase the robustness of the findings.
My primary concern lies in the experimental section, where the iterative approach is applied solely to one type of machine translation. This raises several questions, including the rationale behind this choice and the potential impact of the initial draft quality on the observed improvements. It is essential to address these concerns to fully demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
Additionally, there are a few minor typographical errors that should be corrected:
- Page 2: The phrase "a lookup table that replaceS each word" appears to contain a unnecessary pluralization.
- Page 3: The variable "j" seems to be used in multiple contexts, which may cause confusion. Clarification or consistent notation would be helpful.
- Page 3: The phrase "takes as input these representationS and outputs" also contains an unnecessary pluralization.
