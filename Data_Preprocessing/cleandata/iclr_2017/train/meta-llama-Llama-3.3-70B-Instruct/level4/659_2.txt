This manuscript presents a sequence transduction approach that leverages traditional statistical alignment methods to inform an encoder-decoder framework, with experimental evaluations conducted on multiple morphological inflection generation datasets. The results demonstrate an improvement over existing models, albeit with marginal gains over a soft attention model in certain tasks.
The paper is well-structured and provides a comprehensive analysis of the experiments, but I have reservations regarding the novelty and distinctness of this work compared to preceding approaches, resulting in a relatively narrow contribution confined to its application on shorter input sequences. Although the authors imply the suitability of their method for shorter sequences, they do not provide a comparative analysis with prior work, such as Chorowski et al. (2015) or Jaitly et al. (2016), which limits the scope of their contribution.
In summary, while the paper is well-executed and clearly written, its originality and breadth are somewhat limited. Nevertheless, I believe this work would be highly suitable as a short paper, given its focused contribution and well-presented results.
