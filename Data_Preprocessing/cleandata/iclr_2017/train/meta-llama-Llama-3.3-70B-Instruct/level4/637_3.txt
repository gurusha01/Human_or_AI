This paper proposes an intriguing approach to discovering rules, such as brother(father) => uncle, within knowledge bases by searching directly in the embedding space. The methodology involves interpreting the sequential application of relationships as the multiplication of relation-dependent matrices in non-negative RESCAL, offering a novel perspective on rule discovery.
The experimental section assesses the rules identified by the algorithm, providing initial insights into its efficacy. However, the research appears to be in its nascent stages, leaving several key questions unanswered:
1) Although the rule-finding approach seems broadly applicable, the underlying rationale for its effectiveness remains unclear. What specific properties of the embedding space or the initial algorithm are crucial for yielding meaningful rules? Is it feasible to extend these principles to algorithms beyond non-negative RESCAL, and if so, what implications might this have?
2) A critical omission is the lack of a comprehensive evaluation in terms of link prediction. How can these discovered rules be integrated with the original algorithm to enhance link prediction capabilities? What potential performance improvements can be anticipated, and are there scenarios where these rules could uncover links that the original algorithm might miss?
3) Scalability is another concern: with the number of parameters in the rule miner growing exponentially as (relationships)^(max. path length + 1), it is essential to investigate how this method performs on larger, more complex benchmarks like FB15k, which features over 1,000 relationships. Understanding the scalability of this approach is vital for assessing its practical viability in real-world applications.
