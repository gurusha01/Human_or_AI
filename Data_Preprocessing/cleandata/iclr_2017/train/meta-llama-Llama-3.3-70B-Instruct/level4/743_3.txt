The concept of universality, which is algorithm-dependent but independent of input distribution and dimension, is intriguing. Nevertheless, this empirical study falls short in several areas:
1. The deep learning example only presents a single algorithm, which is not sufficient to demonstrate universality; a more comprehensive comparison involving multiple algorithms and distributions would be more persuasive.
2. The formulation in equation (1) and the discussion in Section 2.1 appear to overlap with existing work, notably Deift (2014), Section 1.3, which explores various algorithms for solving linear systems and presents a more compelling case for universality. This paper could benefit from similar comparisons of different algorithms applied to the same problem setup.
3. In practical scenarios, practitioners are likely to be interested in both the mean and variance of running times, which are implicit in equation (1). This raises questions about the practical utility of the distribution itself in tuning algorithms.
To strengthen the argument for universality, a more extensive set of empirical comparisons across a diverse range of algorithms is necessary to demonstrate its broad applicability.
