To further enhance my assessment, I would like to reiterate the key points from my initial pre-review inquiries. Primarily, a more comprehensive evaluation on a larger scale would significantly bolster the review. Additionally, a more in-depth examination of hyperparameters is warranted. In instances where test errors are provided for snapshot ensembles, it would be beneficial to include statistical analysis of the performance of individual ensemble members to facilitate comparison, such as reporting the mean, standard deviation, and potentially the error rate of the best-performing single member.
