This submission presents several strengths, including its clarity of writing, the introduction of a novel model termed mLSTM that appears to yield promising results, and the incorporation of intriguing experiments conducted on large datasets. However, there are notable weaknesses. A significant omission is the lack of parameter numbers in the comparative analysis of different models, which hinders a comprehensive understanding of the models' complexities. Furthermore, the performance of mLSTM is surpassed by other models in the majority of tasks, suggesting room for improvement.
