This manuscript presents an experimental study investigating the feasibility of substituting deep convolutional networks with shallow networks possessing an equivalent number of parameters, without compromising accuracy. The investigation utilizes the CIFAR 10 dataset, where deep convolutional teacher networks guide the training of shallow student networks through L2 regression on logit outputs. The findings indicate that achieving comparable accuracy within the same parameter budget is only possible when employing multiple convolutional layers.
Notable strengths of the paper include:
- The meticulous execution of experiments, characterized by a thorough hyperparameter selection process.
- The presentation of intriguing results that partially contradict the conclusions drawn from prior research in this domain, notably the work by Ba and Caruana (2014).
- The clarity and quality of the writing, which effectively communicates the research.
However, areas for improvement are:
- The reliance on the CIFAR dataset, which, with only 10 classes, may be considered somewhat simplistic. Extending the study to more complex datasets like ImageNet could provide valuable insights into the scalability of the findings, particularly in scenarios involving a large number of classes.
In terms of originality, while the paper is primarily experimental, it addresses an interesting and worthwhile question. The experimental results are robust and offer novel perspectives on the topic.
The quality of the research is evident in the well-designed experiments. The manuscript's clarity is also commendable, making the content accessible to readers. The significance of the study lies in its challenging of previous conclusions, thereby contributing meaningfully to the ongoing discussion in the field.
Overall, this is a well-crafted experimental paper that yields interesting results, backed by solid experiments and clear writing, making it a valuable contribution to the scientific community.
