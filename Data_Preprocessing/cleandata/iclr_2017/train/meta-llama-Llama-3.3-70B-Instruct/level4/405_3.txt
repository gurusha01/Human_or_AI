The authors present a novel recurrent neural network architecture that achieves more accurate long-term predictions in various game environments, surpassing the current state-of-the-art.
The design of the original network was motivated by the limitations of previous approaches, which struggled to predict outcomes far into the future and were unable to skip intermediate states to make direct future predictions.
The authors conducted a thorough experimental evaluation across multiple benchmarks, yielding promising results.
Overall, the paper is well-structured and provides clear explanations.
A notable strength of the paper is its demonstration of the usefulness of future state prediction in applications such as 3D maze exploration.
Minor comments:
The statement 'jumpy predictions have been developed in low-dimensional observation spaces' would benefit from citation of relevant studies within the paper.

In Section 3.1, the phrase 'this configuration is all experiments' appears to contain an error.
