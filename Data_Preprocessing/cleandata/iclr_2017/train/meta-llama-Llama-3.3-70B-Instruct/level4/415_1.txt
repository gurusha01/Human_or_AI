The author presents a straightforward yet efficacious method for regularizing neural networks, yielding impressive results. Notably, this technique demonstrates its effectiveness even when applied to cutting-edge architectures, a significant advantage since many regularization methods are often limited to simpler tasks or initial configurations that fall short of achieving optimal outcomes. 
This paper is well-written, with suitable experimentation that puts the technique to the test on complex, deep neural networks, akin to state-of-the-art models. This is a crucial aspect, as other studies often assess regularization techniques using simplistic models where their benefits are more apparent, rather than pushing the boundaries with more advanced and challenging configurations.
