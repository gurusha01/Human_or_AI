This manuscript presents MusicNet, a novel dataset that addresses the long-standing issue of data scarcity in music-related machine learning research. The dataset's meticulous annotations, rigorous verification, and organization, as well as its substantial size and genre constraints, make it an invaluable resource for the community. The thorough validation process of the dataset is noteworthy, demonstrating a meticulous approach to its creation.
The authors' inclusion of basic experiments effectively demonstrates the dataset's potential for learning meaningful low-level features, such as sinusoidal variations, in an end-to-end framework. While some may argue that the primary contribution lies in the dataset itself rather than the experimental methods or results, it is essential to recognize the significant impact that high-quality datasets have on advancing research and establishing baseline references.
Given the current paucity of well-curated datasets, this contribution is substantial and is likely to yield considerable future benefits. Although the experimental techniques and results may not be among the most innovative, the dataset itself is likely to be among the top percentile of available resources. The value of this contribution should not be underestimated, as the availability of such datasets is crucial for driving progress in the field, and their development is a significant undertaking that is not frequently undertaken by research groups.
