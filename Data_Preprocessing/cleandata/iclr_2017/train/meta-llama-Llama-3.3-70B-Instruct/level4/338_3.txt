This manuscript offers a fresh insight into the ResNet and Highway net architectures. By positing that the blocks within these networks, characterized by residual or skip-connections, function as successive layers of identical hidden size, the authors suggest that these layers iteratively refine their feature estimates rather than generate novel representations. This perspective effectively reconciles certain contradictions arising from the traditional view of ResNet and Highway networks, as well as other related studies.
The strengths of this paper include:
1. The introduction of a novel framework for understanding recent advancements in neural networks.
2. The presentation of quantitative experimental comparisons between ResNet and Highway net, which yield contradictory results to several claims made in prior research. The authors provide thoughtful discussions and explanations for these discrepancies, offering valuable insights into the advantages and disadvantages of these network types.
However, a significant weakness of the paper is the inadequacy of the experimental support. For instance, the core contribution of the "unrolled iterative estimation" concept is not fully substantiated, particularly in the context of Figure 3's stage 4, which appears to deviate from the assumptions underlying this concept. The authors acknowledge this discrepancy, noting that stage four "appears to be underestimating the representation values, indicating a probable weak link in the architecture." To strengthen their argument, it would be beneficial to conduct additional experiments demonstrating that, under specific conditions, the performance of stage 4 can align with the "unrolled iterative estimation" assumption.
Furthermore, the paper would benefit from more experiments designed to validate the "unrolled iterative estimation" hypothesis independently of the comparison between ResNet and Highway Net. The scarcity of evidence supporting this concept is a primary concern, highlighting the need for more comprehensive experimental verification to solidify the manuscript's core claims.
