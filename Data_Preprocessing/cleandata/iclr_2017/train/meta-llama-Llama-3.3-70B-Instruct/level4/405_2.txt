This paper proposes an action-conditional recurrent network capable of predicting video game frames hundreds of steps into the future, claiming three primary contributions: 
1. a modification to the model architecture, building upon Oh et al.'s work, by directly utilizing the action at time t-1 to predict the hidden state at time t,
2. an exploration of "jumpy predictions," where predictions are made multiple frames into the future without relying on intermediate frames,
3. and an examination of various training schemes, which involve a trade-off between using observation and prediction frames for training the LSTM.
Regarding the first contribution, the modification to the model architecture:
+ The motivation behind making the LSTM state ht dependent on the previous action a{t-1} is sound, as it addresses a limitation in Oh et al.'s work where the action at time t-1 influences the input xt but not the state ht.
- However, the technical novelty of this modification is relatively minor, and a similar effect could potentially be achieved by adding the previous action a{t-1} as an input to the LSTM at time t without altering the architecture. The authors' claim that their approach outperforms combining a{t-1} with h{t-1} and s{t-1} warrants further empirical comparison, such as evaluating the difference when combining a{t-1} solely with s{t-1} or h_{t-1}. A more compelling motivation for the current formulation is also needed.
- Furthermore, the benefits of this architectural change are not thoroughly analyzed in the experiments. Figure 5(a) shows the performance difference between Oh et al.'s method and the current approach, but this difference is attributed to both the training scheme and the architecture. The specific contribution of the architecture to the performance improvement is unclear from this experiment. Although the authors reference Figure 12(a) as demonstrating the architectural difference for "Seaquest," the gain at 100 steps appears to be a small fraction of the overall gain in Figure 5(a), making it challenging to assess the significance of the architectural modification based on this result for a single game.
Concerning the second contribution, exploring jumpy predictions:
+ The idea of omitting intermediate frames to speed up simulations, as noted by the authors, is indeed noteworthy.
+ The results in Figure 5(b) offer interesting insights, indicating that omitting intermediate frames does not significantly increase error for at least a few games.
- Nonetheless, it remains unclear whether the current model's modification is responsible for this effect or if similar results could be achieved with previous models like Oh et al.'s.
- While the observations are intriguing, a more detailed analysis across additional games would strengthen the argument. The novelty of dropping intermediate frames for speedup, however, is somewhat marginal.
Regarding the third contribution, exploring different training schemes:
+ This aspect is perhaps the most compelling observation in the paper. The authors present how varying the fraction of the training phase that uses observation frames versus prediction frames affects performance, as shown in Figure 2(a).
+ The results demonstrate that this change in training can substantially impact prediction outcomes and is the most significant contributor to the performance improvement compared to Oh et al.'s work.
- Although this observation is interesting, similar effects have been explored in detail in other works, such as schedule sampling by Bengio et al. and, to some extent, in Oh et al.'s work.
In terms of clarity of presentation:
- The exact experimental setup for some results is not clearly stated. For instance, it is not specified that Figure 2(a) uses the same architecture as Oh et al., although this is clarified in the response to reviewer questions.
- Figure 4 is challenging to interpret, and highlighting the qualitative differences between Oh et al.'s method and the current approach explicitly would be beneficial.
- A minor point is that the qualitative analysis section requires readers to access various video links, disrupting the reading flow, especially when reading a printed copy.
Overall, the paper presents some interesting experimental findings. However, the technical novelty and the specific contributions of the proposed architecture and training scheme to the field are not clearly established.
