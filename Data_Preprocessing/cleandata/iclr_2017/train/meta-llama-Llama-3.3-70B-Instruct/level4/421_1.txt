This paper presents an innovative approach to addressing the challenges of performing inference on Hidden Semi-Markov Models (HSMM), leveraging an embedded bi-directional Recurrent Neural Network (bi-RNN) to approximate the posterior distribution. The concept of utilizing a bi-RNN for this purpose is both reasonable and ingenious.
However, two key areas may require additional refinement:
(1) A more detailed justification for the choice of bi-RNN over alternative modeling approaches, such as structured mean field using a sequential model for variational distribution formulation, would be beneficial. Enhancing the paper with an intuitive explanation for the superiority of this modeling choice, complemented by empirical evidence, would significantly strengthen the manuscript.
(2) The employed real-world datasets are relatively small, comprising fewer than 100 sequences. Supplementing the experimental results with larger datasets would further substantiate the paper's findings and enhance its overall impact.
