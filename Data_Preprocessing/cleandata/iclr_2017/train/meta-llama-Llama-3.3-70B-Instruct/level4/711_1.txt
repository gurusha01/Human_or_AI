This manuscript introduces RaSoR, a novel approach for efficient representation and scoring of all possible spans in extractive question answering tasks. Although the test set results on SQuAD are not publicly available, they may not achieve state-of-the-art performance; nonetheless, the concept of exhaustively enumerating spans presented in this work has the potential to enhance various architectures. The paper is well-structured and clearly written, with the analysis and ablation studies in the concluding sections being largely engaging, particularly Figure 2, which validates intuitive expectations. Given its potential to contribute positively to the research community working on SQuAD, I suggest accepting this paper.
