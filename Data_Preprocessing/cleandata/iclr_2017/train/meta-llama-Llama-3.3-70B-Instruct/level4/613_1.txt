This paper presents a methodology that utilizes a causality score to inform the weighting of a sparsity regularizer, thereby facilitating a trade-off between the causality and discriminative power of selected variables. The proposed framework is primarily assessed using a proprietary health dataset, which effectively motivates the problem but is insufficient for a comprehensive evaluation. The paper's suitability for ICLR is compromised due to the limited scope of experiments, the relatively straightforward nature of the methodology when compared to existing approaches (such as Chalupka et al., arXiv Preprint, 2016, which offers more technical depth), and the lack of robust theoretical underpinnings.
The core concept of the paper involves weighting a sparsity regularizer to prioritize the selection of "causal" variables, as identified by a separate objective. While this approach has merit, its validation is hindered by the absence of ground truth in the experiments. A more compelling case could have been made through the inclusion of a theorem establishing the identifiability of causal and discriminative variables from data samples, coupled with rigorous synthetic experiments. Such an addition would have significantly enhanced the paper's technical standing and reproducibility, potentially elevating it to a level worthy of acceptance. However, in its current form, the paper falls short in terms of providing novel insights and demonstrating reproducibility.
