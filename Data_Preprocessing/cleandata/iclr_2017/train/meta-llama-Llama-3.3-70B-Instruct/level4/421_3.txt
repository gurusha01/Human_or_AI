This manuscript introduces a innovative approach to unsupervised segmentation and classification of time series data, leveraging a recurrent hidden semi-markov model. The proposed model enhances traditional hidden semi-markov models by incorporating a recurrent neural network (RNN) for observation modeling, where each latent class is associated with its own RNN for category-specific observation modeling. Furthermore, the authors propose an efficient training procedure utilizing a variational approximation. Experimental results showcase the efficacy of this approach in modeling both synthetic and real-time series data.
The paper presents a compelling and original contribution, combining duration modeling HMMs with state-of-the-art observation models based on RNNs in a well-motivated manner. This integration addresses the limitations of standard HSMM variants, which are restricted by the simplicity of their emission probabilities. The methodology is technically sound and has been demonstrated to be effective.
A potential direction for future investigation would be to conduct a quantitative comparison of the proposed method with CRF-based approaches, such as the work presented by Ammar, Dyer, and Smith at NIPS 2014. Although CRFs can model more complex data likelihoods, they also have limitations, as acknowledged in the response phase. Nonetheless, the benefits of utilizing RNNs for class-specific generative models are evident, highlighting the value of this research.
