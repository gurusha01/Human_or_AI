This manuscript lacks a novel machine learning algorithmic contribution, as it merely employs a combination of LSTM and bivariate mixture density network identical to that of Graves. Furthermore, the appendix provides an incomplete explanation, notably omitting a crucial detail: the method by which Gaussian parameters are derived from the LSTM output through a transformation.
Additionally, the paper fails to provide numerical evaluations that demonstrate the algorithm's superiority over existing state-of-the-art methods. 
In my opinion, this paper is not suited for a conference of ICLR's caliber. Although the section on handwriting tasks and data transformation is well-written and engaging, potentially valuable in the context of a handwriting recognition-focused conference, its relevance and quality are outside my area of expertise.
