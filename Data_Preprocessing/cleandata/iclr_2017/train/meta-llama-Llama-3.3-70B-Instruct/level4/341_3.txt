This paper presents a significant extension of the imitation learning framework to accommodate scenarios where the demonstrator and learner possess distinct viewpoints, yielding several notable applications. The key innovation lies in leveraging adversarial training to develop a policy that is resilient to these perspective differences. Although this problem formulation deviates from the conventional imitation learning literature, which typically adopts a first-order perspective, it shares close ties with the transfer learning literature, as elucidated in Section 2.
The fundamental approach is well-articulated and logically follows from recent advancements in imitation learning and adversarial training. To further strengthen the paper, it would be beneficial to include comparisons with the following methods in Figure 3: 
1. Traditional first-person imitation learning using agent A's data and applying the policy on agent A, which serves as an upper bound on expected performance due to the correct perspective.
2. Standard first-person imitation learning using agent A's data and then applying the policy on agent B, to assess potential performance degradation and the resulting gap.
3. Reinforcement learning using agent A's data and applying the policy on agent A, which may outperform third-person imitation learning, depending on factors such as imitation difficulty, exploration, and viewpoint differences between agents. Including these comparisons would substantially enhance the paper's impact, as it would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the proposed approach.
