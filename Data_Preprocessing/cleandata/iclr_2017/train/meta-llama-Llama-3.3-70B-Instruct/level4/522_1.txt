This paper presents a convergence analysis of two-layer neural networks (NNs) utilizing ReLU activations, a topic that has been explored previously, although the specific assumptions and emphasis on ReLU nonlinearity, which is widely used in practice, may offer a unique perspective. 
Despite the challenging readability due to numerous grammatical errors and typos, the analysis appears to be fundamentally sound. However, the presentation of key findings and novelty lacks clear motivation at times. The claim that this work employs more realistic assumptions, such as Gaussian inputs, compared to existing studies is also open to debate.
In summary, while the paper contributes a technically correct analysis, its overall quality is compromised by subpar writing and presentation. The significance and relevance of the results are not always transparent, which detracts from their potential impact. To enhance the paper's clarity and effect, it would be beneficial to more succinctly present the primary results and underlying intuition, potentially relegating secondary details to appendices, thereby improving the visibility and influence of these noteworthy findings.
