The authors suggest integrating a CCA objective with a downstream loss, a concept that is both nice and natural. Nevertheless, the current paper's execution and presentation have significant room for improvement.
The overall objective of the paper remains unclear, despite being addressed in a pre-review question, which did not provide sufficient clarification. It is uncertain whether the objective is the sum of the CCA objective and the final top-layer objective, including CCA constraints, or if there is an interpolation between the two objectives.
The description of the top-layer objective as "cosine distance" or "squared cosine distance" is ambiguous. If the intention is to simply minimize this distance between matched pairs in the two views, it would not be effective without the intervening CCA layer, as it could be minimized by setting all projections to a single point. A more suitable comparison would be with a contrastive loss, such as the one proposed by Hermann & Blunsom, which aims to minimize the distance for matched pairs while maximizing the distance for mismatched pairs. Other discriminative top-layer objectives tailored to a specific downstream task could also be applicable.
The paper contains some imprecise terminology, including references to "correlation" and "cross-correlation" between vectors. As "correlation" typically applies to scalars, a clear definition is necessary. Additionally, "cross-correlation" usually refers to time series, and the operation in equation (2) involves taking the maximum of a matrix. The claim that this approach is "fully differentiable" while regular CCA is not requires further clarification.
It is also worth noting that cosine distance and correlation are related when the dimensions of the vectors are viewed as samples of a single random variable. In this case, the cosine distance of the mean-normalized vectors is equivalent to the correlation between the corresponding random variables. However, in CCA, each dimension of the vectors is viewed as its own random variable, making the claim about cosine distance and correlation potentially misleading.
Finally, there are a couple of minor typos that need correction: "prosed" should be "proposed" and "allong" should be "along".
