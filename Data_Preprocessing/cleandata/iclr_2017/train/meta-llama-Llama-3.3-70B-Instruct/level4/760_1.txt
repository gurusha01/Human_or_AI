The paper proposes a methodology for learning hierarchical template representations that are interpretable, with a focus on binary images. 
The authors introduce a innovative approach to extracting hierarchical template representations by leveraging a set of basic operations. They demonstrate how combining these operations is equivalent to performing boolean matrix factorization, which informs the development of a message passing technique. This technique has been shown to yield accurate results for such problems.
Summary:
———
This paper presents a unique formulation for extracting hierarchical template representations, which has not been previously explored in this manner. However, the experimental results are limited to smaller-scale data, and it appears challenging to extend the proposed algorithm to more complex, natural images.
Quality: Certain techniques could be described more thoroughly to enhance the overall intuition behind the method.
Clarity: Further elaboration on the derivations and underlying intuitions would be beneficial for clarity.
Originality: The idea presented is plausible but currently restricted to binary data.
Significance: Due to the limited experimental setup, assessing the significance of the work is difficult.

1. A primary concern is the experimental evaluation, as the approach's applicability seems restricted to binary images at present. Could the authors provide commentary on this limitation?
2. The existence of alternative techniques for image representation extraction, such as grammar-based methods, might be worth acknowledging by the authors.
