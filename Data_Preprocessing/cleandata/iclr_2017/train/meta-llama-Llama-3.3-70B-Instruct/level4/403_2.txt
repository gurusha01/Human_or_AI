This work explores the concept of external memory models, particularly the Neural Turing Machine (NTM), which has shown promise in learning algorithmic solutions by leveraging differentiable analogues of traditional memory structures. Notably, the NTM, as well as other approaches like the Differential Neural Computer (DNC), enable the shifting of a memory access head to linked memories from the current read position, facilitating the reading and writing of sequences.
The NTM, most relevant to this study, employs a differentiable version of a Turing machine tape, where the controller outputs a kernel that "softly" shifts the head, allowing for sequential reading and writing. To counteract the "smearing" effect of this soft shift, the controller also outputs a sharpening parameter to refocus the distribution.
The authors propose a novel approach, deviating from the conventional topology of a Turing tape, by storing memory at points on a manifold and introducing shift actions that form a Lie group. This allows memory points to have varied relationships, rather than being restricted to a linear topology. The authors empirically test models with the shift group R^2 acting on R^2 and the rotation group acting on a sphere, demonstrating mathematical elegance.
The paper is well-communicated and presents a novel idea. However, its primary limitation lies in its limited impact, as the approach, although mathematically elegant, may not significantly contribute to building models capable of general program learning. Instead, it may increase the complexity and slow down already complex models like the NTM. It is suggested that memory topology is problem-specific and should be learned rather than specified.
The comparison baseline used is a simple model that lacks the sharpening mechanism, and there is no comparison with the DNC, which provides a more general approach to linking memories. Minor issues include a misleading footnote regarding the DNC, difficult-to-follow figures on page 8, and a need for clearer labeling of images in figure 2 to enhance understanding. Overall, while the work is well-presented, its limitations and lack of comparison to more advanced models, such as the DNC, hinder its potential impact.
