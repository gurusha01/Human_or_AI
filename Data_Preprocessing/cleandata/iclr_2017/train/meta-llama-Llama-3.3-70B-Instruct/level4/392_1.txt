This study presents a novel approach to image compression leveraging autoencoders, yielding impressive results that surpass the current state of the art in this domain.
Strengths:
+ The paper is exceptionally well-written, providing a clear and reproducible methodology that enables readers to replicate the results if desired.
+ The outcomes demonstrate significant promise when compared to existing work in the field. It is essential to note, and the authors could have further emphasized, that this innovative technology is still in its early stages, and it is not unexpected that it may not outperform established image compression methods. Nevertheless, it shows considerable improvement over other neural network-based compression approaches.
Weaknesses:
- The training process appears cumbersome, involving multiple stages, weight freezing, and other complexities.
- The rationale behind Figure 1 seems unclear, potentially confusing readers, as it discusses the effects on JPEG but is unrelated to the paper's focus on neural network architecture, rather than DCT quantization.
