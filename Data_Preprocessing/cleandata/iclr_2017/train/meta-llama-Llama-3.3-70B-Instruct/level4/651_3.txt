This manuscript bears resemblance to existing methods, such as adaptive dropout, which also utilizes a binary mask that depends on the input to a neuron, similar to the proposed method. Despite the revised draft, the distinction between the proposed approach and adaptive dropout in terms of functional capabilities remains unclear. Furthermore, the experimental validation appears limited, as it lacks a comparison to the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.
