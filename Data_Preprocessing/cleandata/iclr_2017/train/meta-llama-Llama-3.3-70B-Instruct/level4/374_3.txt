SUMMARY.
This manuscript presents a novel approach to integrating word embeddings with character-level word representations through a gating mechanism, which leverages word-associated features to determine the most suitable representation. The proposed fine-grained gating is applied to two distinct tasks: cloze-style reading comprehension question answering and Twitter hashtag prediction. Notably, the question answering task involves a refined formulation of gated attention for combining document words and questions. The results demonstrate that the fine-grained gating enhances accuracy, surpassing state-of-the-art methods on the CBT dataset and achieving comparable performance to state-of-the-art approaches on the SQuAD dataset.

OVERALL JUDGMENT
The paper introduces a sophisticated extension of scalar gating for combining word representations, showcasing a clever and nuanced approach. The writing is clear and concise, providing a comprehensive overview of prior work and a thorough comparison with existing models. The inclusion of an ablation study effectively highlights the contribution of individual components, and the incorporation of shallow linguistic prior knowledge, such as part-of-speech tags, named entity recognition tags, and frequency, is a notable strength. A potential avenue for future exploration could involve the incorporation of syntactic features to further enhance the model's performance.
