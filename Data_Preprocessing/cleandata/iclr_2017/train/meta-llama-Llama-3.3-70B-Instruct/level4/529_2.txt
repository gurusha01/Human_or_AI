The authors present a approach to melody synthesis, addressing the limitations of "language-model"-type methods using LSTMs, which often result in melodies lacking long-range structure and exhibiting repetitive notes. To overcome this, they propose a two-stage training process, initially training the model as a traditional LM-style LSTM, followed by reinforcement learning to optimize an objective that incorporates non-differentiable music theory constraints.
While the reinforcement learning methodology is suitable, it is relatively straightforward and bears resemblance to prior work in text modeling and dialogue generation, not offering a novel technique in itself. Consequently, the paper's contribution hinges on the novelty, utility, and impact of its application. The authors have invested considerable effort into developing the rules and conducting a user study, which is commendable. However, their treatment of music is somewhat simplistic, and the user study, although diligent, seems premature, as the generated melodies, while semi-plausible, do not truly constitute music, much like LSTM-generated Shakespeare is not genuine poetry.
I would advise the authors to exercise caution in motivating their research solely on the basis of previous studies, as the field is replete with dead ends, and the onus of motivation should not be overlooked, particularly when the application is the primary focus of the paper. Furthermore, the authors should be mindful of describing their model as "composing," as the relationship between statistical sequence modeling and artistic creation, which involves real-world semantic communication, should not be exaggerated.
I appreciate the authors' efforts to address criticisms of the problem setup and encourage them to anticipate these arguments in the paper and provide more compelling motivation in the future. If the primary contribution lies in the application, given that the methods have been employed elsewhere, then motivation becomes paramount. The authors are correct in asserting that the field benefits from diverse datasets and that MIDI can capture all the information in a score, not just simplified music. However, they may overemphasize the importance of scores in jazz music.
Ultimately, while the application is engaging, it does not significantly enhance the paper's impact, and the methodology, although appropriate, does not stand alone. Following the authors' revisions and arguments, I have revised my evaluation to acknowledge their efforts.
