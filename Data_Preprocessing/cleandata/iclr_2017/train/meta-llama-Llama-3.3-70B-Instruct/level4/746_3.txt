I find this manuscript to be exceptionally challenging to comprehend. The primary contribution of the paper lies in its proposal to train models for combinatorial search procedures, with a focus on dynamic programming to learn optimal split and merge points. The methodology relies on a scale invariance property, which is not adequately justified for the majority of problems to which this approach is purportedly applicable. Nevertheless, the overall research direction is both fruitful and significant.
To enhance readability, the paper would benefit from commencing with a concise, formal problem statement, accompanied by a schematic overview of the methodology and a clear delineation of supervised and unsupervised components. A tabular summary of the diverse problems addressed by this method, along with illustrative examples, could be presented at the outset to provide motivation and contextualize the central paradigm. This would facilitate a more concrete understanding of the paper's content and its relevance to the broader field.
Regrettably, the manuscript is disjointed, oscillating between low-level and high-level details, problem formulations, and their corresponding solutions in a seemingly arbitrary and difficult-to-follow order. The split and merge phases involve numerous discrete choices in a hierarchical manner during training, yet the paper fails to elucidate how these discrete choices are backpropagated through the network in an unbiased manner, assuming this is indeed the case.
In summary, while the research direction explored in this paper is intriguing, the manuscript itself is frustrating to read in its current form. Despite dedicating several hours to its analysis, I have been unable to form a clear mental representation of how the various components presented in the paper cohere. I would reconsider my evaluation if the manuscript were substantially revised to improve its readability, although this would likely require a major overhaul.
