The authors conduct an in-depth examination of the neural GPU model, initially proposed by Kaiser and Sutskever. Specifically, in section 3, they attribute the model's performance to its capacity to execute O(n^2) steps for each example. The subsequent section underscores the significance of curriculum training, empirically demonstrating that larger models exhibit improved generalization capabilities. Section 5 is devoted to constructing examples that expose failure modes, while the final section presents a comparative analysis of performance across different input formats.
This paper is notable for its clarity and comprehensive experimental framework, which sheds light on the intricacies of training the neural GPU model and expands the scope of learnable algorithms. However, it appears to lack a unified narrative thread and fails to provide profound insights into the underlying mechanisms of the observed phenomena, such as the essential role of curriculum training and the existence of specific failure modes.
The introduction contains several assertions that warrant further qualification or explanation. Notably, statistical learning theory does not guarantee the consistency of empirical risk minimization when the number of parameters exceeds the number of examples; instead, generalization performance is contingent upon the VC dimension of the function space. Moreover, the suggested link between adversarial examples and learning algorithms is tenuous and would benefit from supporting references or a more detailed explanation, particularly with regards to the contentious claim that deep neural networks can match the performance of any parallel machine learning algorithm.
The authors' argument that the neural GPU performs O(n^2) "steps" on each example, enabling it to learn algorithms with super-linear complexity such as multiplication, seems to overlook the parallel nature of the neural GPU architecture. Both addition and multiplication can be achieved with O(log n) time complexity through parallelism, as exemplified by carry-lookahead adders and Wallace trees, respectively.
In section 4, the authors demonstrate that their larger models generalize better, which they argue is not intuitively obvious. Nevertheless, given that both training and test errors decrease, it is plausible that the smaller models are underfitting, in which case it is not counterintuitive that a larger model would exhibit better generalization performance.
The use of a learning curriculum, where the number of terms is progressively decreased and the radix of the number system is increased, yields promising results. However, a more robust intuitive or theoretical justification for the latter approach would be beneficial.
The final section posits that neural GPUs are equivalent to cellular automata, a claim that would benefit from further justification, as cellular automata are discrete models and the equivalence between the two is not immediately apparent. The relationship between global operations and changes in input format is also somewhat circuitous.
In conclusion, while the paper offers valuable insights into the neural GPU model, it does not introduce novel extensions to the model or elucidate fundamental limitations. Several statements require more substantial substantiation.
The strengths of the paper include:
* Clarity of writing
* Comprehensive experimental framework
* Exploration of learning algorithms with decimal representation
* Availability of source code
However, the paper is not without its weaknesses, including:
* Lack of a coherent hypothesis or premise
* Several bold statements without accompanying explanations or references
* Some ambiguity in experimental details
* Limited novelty and originality
Additionally, there are a few typographical errors, such as the omission of a minus sign in the phrase "chance of carrying k digits is 10^k" (section 5), the unnecessary inclusion of "are" in the phrase "the larger models with 512 filters are achieve" (section 4), and the omission of the indefinite article "a" in the phrase "such model doesn't generalize" (section 4).
