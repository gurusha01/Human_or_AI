This paper attempts to enhance corpus-based word representations by utilizing an external lexicon or knowledge base to identify the most suitable paraphrase in a given context through a fuzzy determination process.
However, I found the paper to be challenging to follow due to its grammatical and narrative style, which often resulted in difficulties with comprehension and occasional unintelligibility. Effective communication of ideas is a crucial aspect of a conference paper, and unfortunately, this submission falls short of meeting this expectation.
Furthermore, the evaluation methodology employed in the paper is inadequate. The assessment of word representations can be conducted in various ways, and the reliance on Google's analogy dataset is problematic, as highlighted by previous research (e.g., Linzen's RepEval 2016 paper and Drozd et al.'s COLING 2016 study).
Ultimately, the paper lacks qualitative insights and motivational context. It does not provide explanations for why this approach yields better results, nor does it discuss its limitations or failures. Additionally, the work fails to offer any broader understanding or contributions to the fields of word representations, lexicons, or corpus-based methods, leaving key questions unanswered.
