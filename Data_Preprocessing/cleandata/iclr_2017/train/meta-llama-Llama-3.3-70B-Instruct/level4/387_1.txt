This manuscript presents a modified version of the CNN-based texture synthesis approach initially proposed by Gatys et al., wherein it not only considers the correlations between feature responses at identical positions within the feature maps but also accounts for the correlations between spatially shifted feature responses. 
The authors assert that this enhancement yields several benefits, including:
a) an improvement in synthesizing textures characterized by long-range regular structures, which the original Gatys et al. method fails to preserve,
b) superior performance in texture inpainting tasks when compared to the Gatys et al. method,
c) enhanced outcomes in style transfer tasks, particularly when integrated with the style transfer technique developed by Gatys et al.,
d) the preservation of symmetry properties around the flipping axis by matching correlations between spatially flipped feature maps.
I concur with assertion a), as the proposed method indeed demonstrates an improvement in handling textures with long-range regular structures. Nevertheless, the synthesized textures still exhibit certain shortcomings, such as the presence of greyish regions, indicating that the issue remains unresolved. Moreover, the introduced procedure significantly increases computational costs, thereby rendering an already time-consuming texture synthesis method even slower. For instance, a comparative analysis with the concurrent study by Liu et al. highlights the efficiency drawbacks of the proposed approach.
