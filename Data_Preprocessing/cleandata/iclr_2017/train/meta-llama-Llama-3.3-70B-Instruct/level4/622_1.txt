The authors' rebuttal has not altered my initial assessment, and I remain convinced that this paper warrants a clear rejection. Although the application of spin glass techniques, originally presented in Choromanska et al., to the analysis of deep residual networks is a noteworthy contribution, the findings appear to closely mirror those of Choromanska et al., thereby restricting the paper's novelty. The primary theoretical methods outlined in the paper were previously established, and the main theoretical results mentioned had already been proven. Furthermore, the authors have retained numerous assumptions from Choromanska et al., including path-independence and specific weights distribution assumptions, which limits the paper's originality and impact.
