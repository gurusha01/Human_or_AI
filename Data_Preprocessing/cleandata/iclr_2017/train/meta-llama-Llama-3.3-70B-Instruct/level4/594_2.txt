The authors present a modified pass-through network architecture with low-rank constraints, aiming to enhance capacity control, which may be beneficial in certain scenarios, as demonstrated by the experimental results. However, upon examination, I found the overall results to be somewhat unimpressive. The performance achieved is not comparable to state-of-the-art methods on tasks such as sequential MNIST or memory tasks, and introduces an additional hyperparameter that requires tuning. To strengthen the comparison, it would be beneficial to include tables and/or figures that directly compare the proposed approach to competing methods, such as uRNNs, to provide a more comprehensive evaluation.
