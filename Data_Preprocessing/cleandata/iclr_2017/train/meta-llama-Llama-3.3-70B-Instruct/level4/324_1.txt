The concept of "pruning where it matters" is excellent, and the authors have done a commendable job of thoroughly exploring this idea, particularly by examining pruning across various layers. 
The paper's clarity and visual aids, including the effective use of diagrams, are noteworthy and deserving of recognition. Furthermore, the explicit specification of the mapping between layers and spaces, denoted by the \mathbb symbol, is a significant strength.
The experimental methodology is sound, and the findings are promising. While additional experiments would undoubtedly enhance the paper, this is a common limitation in research. 
One aspect that warrants further discussion is the proposed pruning criterion. Although filter-level pruning is, in my view, the most effective approach, a comparison of the "min sum of weights" criterion with alternative methods would be beneficial. How does this criterion perform relative to other pruning strategies, such as random pruning? 
Overall, the paper is well-written and presents a compelling argument, making it a enjoyable read.
