This paper explores a research direction that is highly relevant and intriguing. Nevertheless, the empirical findings presented do not sufficiently outweigh the limitations inherent to the proposed methodology, as discussed in Section 6. A notable aspect of the paper is the straightforward approach to hyper-parameter selection. However, it is observed that the momentum term for CPN is set at 0.95, differing from the typical value of 0.9 used in most optimizers that CPN is compared against. It is plausible that any perceived benefits of CPN can be primarily attributed to its momentum term, rather than the approach itself.
