The authors introduce TARTAN, a modified version of the previously proposed DNN accelerator architecture, "DaDianNao". The primary distinction lies in TARTAN's compute units, which employ bit-serial processing and unfold MAC operations across multiple cycles, allowing for enhanced exploitation of reduced input activation precision to achieve improved performance and energy efficiency.
Comments:
1. I concur with the previous reviewer's request for the authors to provide a more detailed explanation of the methodology used to estimate TARTAN's energy consumption. The claimed 17% improvement in energy efficiency seems modest and may be within the margin of error for energy estimation, warranting further clarification.
2. As TARTAN is heavily based on the DaDianNao architecture, the only innovative aspect of this work is the incorporation of bit-serial compute units. However, this novelty comes at a significant cost, incurring an area overhead of approximately 3x compared to DaDianNao's compute units.
3. Nevertheless, the concept of bit-serial computation is intriguing and merits consideration. In my opinion, this idea would be more suitably presented and appreciated in a forum focused on circuit design or architecture, where its relevance and potential impact could be more fully explored.
