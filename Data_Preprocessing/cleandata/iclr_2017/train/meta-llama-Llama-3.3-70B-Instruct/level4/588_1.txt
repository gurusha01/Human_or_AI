This manuscript leverages convolutional neural network-based object detection methods for identifying weather events in 3D climate data, with an additional exploration of incorporating an unsupervised autoencoder-style objective term.
Strengths:
The approach of utilizing object detection techniques for the problem of detecting extreme weather events is novel, to the best of my knowledge.
The paper is well-structured and effectively conveys the methodology, including a comprehensive review of related literature.
The most effective model employs 3D convolutions and unsupervised learning, both of which are relatively underexplored in detection literature. The benefits of these aspects are validated, demonstrating modest performance improvements over 2D and/or purely supervised approaches.
Weaknesses:
The advantages of the 3D convolutional architecture and unsupervised learning are somewhat muted, with a mean average precision (mAP) of 52.92% for the 3D+semi-supervised result compared to 51.42% for the 2D+supervised result.
It is unexpected that the 3D+supervised and 2D+semi-supervised models perform worse than the 2D+supervised baseline; ideally, each aspect should yield a slight improvement over the base result, given that combining them produces the best results. This discrepancy may be attributed to insufficient hyperparameter tuning for these cases, although the paper acknowledges this and provides potential explanations in Section 4.3.
As noted by other reviewers, the use of a 0.1 intersection over union (IoU) criterion for true positives is relatively lenient compared to the standard 0.5 criterion. However, if the visualized results in Figure 3 are representative, a 0.1 overlap criterion might be justified in this domain, as the detector appears to localize events sufficiently for human review of climate images for extreme events. Nonetheless, reporting results at higher overlap thresholds would be beneficial.
Minor issues:
Equation 6 likely should represent the squared L2 norm (i.e., the sum of squares) rather than the L2 norm itself.
In Table 4, the semi-supervised models should presumably have more parameters than their supervised counterparts due to the decoder layers.
Overall, this paper is well-written and applies intriguing, underutilized techniques to a relatively unique domain. Although the results are not remarkable, the model is appropriately ablated and shown to be beneficial. For a final version, including results at higher overlap thresholds would be desirable.
