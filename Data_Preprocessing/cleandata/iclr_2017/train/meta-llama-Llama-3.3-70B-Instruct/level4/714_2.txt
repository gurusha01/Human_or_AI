This paper presents an application of the representation learning method introduced by [Jonschkowski & Brock, 2015], utilizing a deep network as a function approximator. Although the task and approach are intriguing, the overall contribution of this work is restricted, and the experimental assessment is severely lacking, rendering the paper unsuitable for publication.
The methodology is evaluated on a simplistic synthetic task, characterized by minimal training and test datasets, as well as negligible data variation. The authors themselves acknowledge the preliminary nature of the results. Furthermore, the proposed approach is not benchmarked against existing methods or basic, hand-designed baselines, making it impossible to ascertain its efficacy or comparative performance. This significant omission undermines the paper's validity for publication.
With the inclusion of comprehensive experiments and demonstration of the method's viability in complex, real-world scenarios, this paper has the potential to be revised into a worthy submission.
