This paper presents a compelling contribution, with clear and well-structured writing. It effectively builds upon the traditional attention mechanism by reinterpreting the attention variable as a conditional distribution over the input and query, thereby integrating latent variables into a graphical model framework. The neural network-based computation of potentials further enhances this approach.
By adopting this perspective, the paper demonstrates how traditional variable dependencies, or structural relationships, can be explicitly incorporated into attention mechanisms. This, in turn, enables the application of established graphical models, such as Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) and semi-Markov CRFs, to capture the inherent linguistic dependencies within attention mechanisms.
The experimental evaluations convincingly demonstrate the model's effectiveness across various levels, including sequence-to-sequence and tree structures. The experiments appear to be meticulously designed and executed, with attention to detail, such as marginal normalization. Overall, I consider this to be a substantial contribution, with the potential to benefit research in other domains and problems.
