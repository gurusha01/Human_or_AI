This paper explores the use of tic-tac-toe as a simplified problem for examining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). A dataset of tic-tac-toe boards is created, where one player is one move away from winning, and a CNN is trained to classify these boards based on two criteria: the player who can win (two choices) and the position they can move to win (nine choices), resulting in 18 possible labels. The CNN achieves perfect performance on this task, and the paper aims to investigate how it works.
The primary method used for this investigation is Class Activation Mapping (CAM), which identifies areas of implicit attention within the CNN. These attention maps are utilized to derive actions, specifically determining which square each player should move to. Notably, the attention maps focus on specific squares on the tic-tac-toe board rather than arbitrary patterns, despite the uniform color of the squares. Furthermore, these maps can be used to select the correct winning actions.
The experiments conducted support the claims that the network understands the structure of tic-tac-toe boards, the rules for winning, and the presence of two players. Additional experiments yield similar results under various board renderings and incomplete training regimes.
However, several clarifying questions arise from the methodology. Firstly, the implementation of CAM in this context is unclear, as the original CAM technique requires identifying a specific class of interest. It is uncertain how one of the 18 possible classes is chosen for creating the CAM visualization and subsequently selecting an action. Secondly, the process of creating the test set for the dataset and the distribution of labels in both the training and test sets are not specified. Lastly, the calculation of the Rank Correlation Coefficient (RCO) and its representation in the results are unclear.
The proposed method of deriving actions from visualization techniques is novel and offers a unique approach. The experiment clearly demonstrates a CNN's reliance on context for making accurate predictions. Utilizing a toy domain like tic-tac-toe to study attention mechanisms in CNNs is a potentially fruitful approach that could lead to a better understanding of both implicit and explicit attention.
Despite these positives, several concerns are raised. The distinction between predicting outcomes and determining actions is not clearly justified, as the ability to act may not be more indicative of concept learning than the ability to predict future states. In the context of the proposed dataset, the labels for "what to do" would likely be identical to those for "what will happen," as both would require indicating the board position and potentially the player identity. This distinction is typically handled within the Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework, which is not applied here. Alternative models, such as deep Q networks or using the argmax of the current model's softmax for action prediction, are not considered.
Comparison to existing work that uses visualization techniques to investigate deep RL networks is lacking. Specifically, the use of saliency maps to analyze network behavior in RL, as seen in works like "Dueling Network Architectures for Deep Reinforcement Learning" and "Graying the black box: Understanding DQNs," is not discussed. The claim that saliency maps cannot activate on grid squares due to constant intensity is made without empirical or theoretical evidence. The notion of information referenced in relation to patch intensity distributions is unclear and seems irrelevant given the contextual dependence of the methods discussed.
The presentation of the paper could be improved by integrating the results from section 7 with the preceding discussions. Overall, while the experiments are novel, their significance and the conclusions drawn are not entirely clear. The methods and goals lack clarity and broader context, and some aspects of the approach may be incorrect or incomplete. Further details are necessary to fully understand the implementation and implications of the proposed approach.
