This paper presents an application of the standard SVGB framework in a sequential setting, similar to prior works, with the added constraint of a well-defined state space, akin to Linear Gaussian Models, featuring a Markovian latent space and conditional independence of observed variables given the latent variables, albeit in a non-linear context. The introduction of these constraints is justified by the aim of deriving meaningful latent variables.
The experimental results are intriguing, yet the regression outcomes in Figure 3 leave some doubts, specifically regarding the ability to extract angle and velocity from the state using a more complex function than a linear one. Additionally, the omission of the model from Watter et al. (2015) in the comparison is notable.
Upon re-examination, the rationale behind combining coordinates in a 3x3 checkerboard pattern, as described in Figure 5a, remains unclear. While the paper is well-motivated and the proposed model exhibits sufficient novelty, the bouncing ball experiment falls short of being convincing, particularly in terms of prediction, as the outcome is entirely determined by initial velocity and position.
