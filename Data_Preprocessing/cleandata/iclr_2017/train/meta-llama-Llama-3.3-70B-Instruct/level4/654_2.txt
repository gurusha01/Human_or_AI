I appreciate the fundamental concept presented in this paper, but I have reservations regarding its current implementation. My main concern, as previously mentioned in my pre-review question, remains unaddressed. Specifically, I believe that setting q(s | s') = p(s | s') will lead to a significant mismatch between the forward and reverse trajectories, resulting in a loose and high-variance variational bound.
The argument in Appendix D about the bound's tightness relies on the assumption that the transition distribution satisfies detailed balance, which is not the case for the learned transition distribution in this paper. Therefore, the claim of tightness in Appendix D is not valid. An alternative approach, discussed briefly in Section 2.1, would be to learn an energy function instead of a transition distribution, allowing for the choice of an MCMC transition operator that obeys detailed balance.
I found the experimental results to be underwhelming, which I attribute primarily to the discrepancy between the generative and inference trajectories. This mismatch is related to my previous concern and the pre-review question. Additionally, I note that some terms may be omitted from the training gradient, as mentioned in the note for Section 5.
The paper focuses on optimizing a variational bound on log likelihood, but it would be beneficial to report and compare log likelihoods with competing methods. Detailed comments are provided below, some of which were written based on a previous version of the paper.
Specifically, in Section 1.2, the first paragraph is difficult to follow, and the phrase "these modes these spurious modes" should be revised to "these spurious modes." In Section 2.1, the notation "s = (v,h)" should be changed to "s = {v,h}." Section 2.2 should be revised to "with an MCMC chain" and "(e.g. via MCMC)" instead of "(ideally an MCMC)." 
In Section 3, the last bullet point could be improved by setting the temperature to infinity for the last step, allowing the last step to sample directly from the prior and making the posterior and prior identical. Section 4 would benefit from using an energy function, as many MCMC transition operators obey detailed balance, reducing the likelihood of forward/backward transition mismatch.
Equations 12 and 13 lack a clear definition of alpha and its dependence on temperature. In Section 5, the last paragraph of the GSN section should note that q also depends on theta, and failing to backpropagate through the full q chain results in dropped terms from the gradient. The non-equilibrium thermodynamics section should acknowledge that the noneq. paper also increases the noise variance as the distance from the data increases.
Finally, Figure 1 has mislabeled right and left panels, Figure 2 requires labeled panes, and Figure 3 should specify the number of walkback steps.
