This manuscript evaluates the effectiveness of zoneout across diverse datasets, including character-level, word-level, and permuted MNIST classification tasks, demonstrating its versatility in various applications. Zoneout exhibits properties of a regularizer, mitigating overfitting, while also sharing similarities with residual connections. Further examination of this relationship, particularly the impact of gradient flow on task performance, is noteworthy and highlights an intrinsic characteristic of zoneout.
The paper is well-structured and presents a range of experiments that substantiate its claims. Having personally utilized this technique in recurrent neural network settings, I can attest to its positive influence on task outcomes. Given its potential, zoneout is likely to emerge as a standard method in RNNs, applicable across multiple frameworks.
