This manuscript presents a novel approach to estimating context sensitivity in paraphrases, which is then utilized to enhance a word embedding learning model. The core concept and model formulation are well-articulated and appear to be reasonable. However, the paper's primary limitations lie in its experimental evaluation and model exploration. The evaluation fails to conclusively demonstrate the model's superiority over simpler methods, particularly those that do not rely on a paraphrase database. Furthermore, the model description does not convincingly justify the chosen formulation, and alternative approaches are not adequately explored. To strengthen the paper, the authors should provide more compelling explanations for their model choices or investigate alternative formulations.
Overall, I am inclined to recommend rejection, with the suggestion that the authors resubmit a revised and improved version in the near future.
Specific/minor comments are as follows:
1) Although the paper is largely grammatically correct, a revision assisted by a native English speaker would be beneficial, as certain sections are challenging to comprehend due to unconventional sentence structures.
2) The tables require more descriptive and informative labels.
3) The results are somewhat ambiguous, particularly in the analogy task presented in Table 4, where it is surprising that CBOW outperforms the proposed embeddings, which are specifically designed to excel in this aspect.
4) The exclusion of "Enriched CBOW" from the analogy task is not justified.
5) The related work section mentions several papers that learn embeddings from a combination of lexica and corpora, yet the manuscript repeatedly claims that this is the first work of its kind or that there is a lack of research in this area, which seems somewhat misleading.
