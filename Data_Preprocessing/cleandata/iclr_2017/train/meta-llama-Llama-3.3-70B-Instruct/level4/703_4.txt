Although my expertise in digital logic is limited to my undergraduate studies, I can appreciate the potential value of this work. Given the complexity of the subject matter, I believe a reviewer with more advanced knowledge in this field would be better suited to provide a thorough evaluation. Nevertheless, the research appears to have merit and may be a good fit for publication in a different forum, where it can receive the specialized attention it deserves.
