This paper presents a novel approach, suggesting the utilization of a potentially deterministic retrieval function as an alternative to uniform sampling from the training data for discriminator training in a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework. While the core concept is intriguing, the experimental validation falls short. The absence of substantial quantitative results, meaningful baselines, and the limited presentation of qualitative results, which are not particularly persuasive, undermine the paper's credibility. The lack of standard experimental evaluation makes it challenging to provide a comprehensive review. Furthermore, the plots in Figure 6 are unclear and require clarification regarding the trends and outcomes they are intended to illustrate.
