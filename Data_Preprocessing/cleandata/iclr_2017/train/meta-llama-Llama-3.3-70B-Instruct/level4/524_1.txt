The authors propose a regularization technique that involves introducing noise into a representation space, which is primarily applied to sequence autoencoders, as introduced by Dai et al. in 2015, without utilizing attention mechanisms and relying solely on the context vector. The experimental results demonstrate an improvement over the authors' baseline in certain toy tasks.
Regarding the augmentation process, it is straightforward, involving the addition of noise, interpolation, or extrapolation to the sequence-to-sequence context vector, as described in Section 3.2. This raises the question of whether this approach could be effective in non-sequence-to-sequence applications. A comparison with dropout applied to the context vector would have been a valuable addition.
The experimental section is somewhat disappointing, as it fails to include a comparison with machine translation tasks, where a substantial body of published work exists for reference. Instead, the authors focus on several lesser-used toy datasets, as well as MNIST and CIFAR. While they demonstrate improvement over their baseline in some toy datasets, the gains on MNIST and CIFAR appear marginal. Notably, the authors omit a comparison with the baseline established by Dai et al. in 2015 for CIFAR, which achieves a significantly better result of 25% using an LSTM model, surpassing the authors' baseline of 32.35% and their proposed method's result of 31.93%.
To strengthen the experiments, it would be beneficial to conduct them on sequence-to-sequence models applied to machine translation tasks, such as English-French or English-German. Given the origins of sequence-to-sequence models in machine translation, the absence of such experiments is notable. Alternatively, applying the method to sentiment analysis tasks, as explored in the Dai et al. paper, would provide a more convincing evaluation.
Finally, there appear to be issues with the reference formatting, as many conference and journal names are missing. It is recommended that the citations be updated to include the full conference or journal names, rather than relying solely on "arxiv" references. For instance, the citation for "Listen, attend and spell" should be updated to "Listen, Attend and Spell: A Neural Network for Large Vocabulary Conversational Speech Recognition" and attributed to ICASSP. Similarly, citations for other papers, such as "Adam: A method for stochastic optimization" (ICLR), "Auto-encoding variational bayes" (ICLR), "Addressing the rare word problem in neural machine translation" (ACL), "Pixel recurrent neural networks" (ICML), and "A neural conversational model" (ICML Workshop), should be updated to reflect the full conference or journal names.
