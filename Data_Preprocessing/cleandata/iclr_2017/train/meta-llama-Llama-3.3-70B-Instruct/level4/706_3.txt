UPDATE: Having reviewed the authors' rebuttal and the accompanying discussion thread, my assessment remains unchanged.
The authors suggest employing a mixture prior in lieu of a unimodal prior for variational auto-encoders, positing that the latter's simplicity restricts the model's expressivity, preventing it from capturing complex aspects of the data distribution.
I remain skeptical about the paper's motivation, as the posterior distribution is inherently not unimodal, and a unimodal prior on the latent variable space can still effectively capture complex, multimodal data distributions. A straightforward example illustrates this: a uniform distribution on the latent space, combined with a likelihood function derived from the inverse CDF of the true data distribution, can model any distribution.
Moreover, the emphasis on multimodality in the literature may be misguided, as the latent variable space often exhibits complex nonlinear characteristics, rendering the capture of simple distributions less relevant. The experiments fail to clearly demonstrate the impact of the prior's multimodality on the posterior's ability to capture complex phenomena, and it is unclear whether this approach surpasses using a more complex, yet reparameterizable, distribution on the latent space.
Based on these concerns, I recommend rejecting this paper and encourage the authors to conduct a more thorough investigation into the effects of different priors.
Additionally, I would like to offer two further comments:
Although ICLR does not impose a page limit, the 14-page document can be substantially condensed without compromising the clarity or description of the authors' innovation. I suggest the authors consider condensing their work.
Lastly, I believe it is essential to acknowledge the controversy surrounding this paper, which was initially submitted with significant omissions, including incomplete experiments, missing citations, a handwritten figure, and several missing paragraphs. These deficiencies were only addressed approximately a week later. I recommend that the chairs take this into account when determining the standards for future submissions.
