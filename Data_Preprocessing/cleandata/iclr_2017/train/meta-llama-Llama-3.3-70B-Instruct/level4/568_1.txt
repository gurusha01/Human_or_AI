This manuscript presents a novel approach to sentence classification through the introduction of a new model. 
The strengths of the paper include:
- The incorporation of innovative architectural elements within the network, which is noteworthy.
However, several weaknesses were identified:
- The absence of a thorough assessment of the architectural decisions made, highlighting the need for an ablation study to discern the significance and impact of each component.
- The lack of evaluation on widely recognized benchmark datasets undermines the credibility of the results, particularly given that a basic TFIDF-SVM method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the single existing dataset considered, rendering the presented outcomes unconvincing.
