This paper proposes a maximum total correlation procedure, incorporating a target and subsequent noise perturbations.
Technical concerns:
The transition from equation (1) to (2) is problematic, as it presents a lower bound while neglecting H(Z), potentially overlooking significant variations in H(Z) compared to H(Z|Y). By omitting H(Z), the objective in equation (2) inadvertently promotes low-entropy Z, which is only partially mitigated by the -H(X|Z) term. This oversight may necessitate the introduction of semantic noise to prevent excessive entropy reduction in Z.
The introduction of arbitrary balancing parameters lambda1 and lambda2 in equation (3) lacks justification, as they were not present in equation (2).
Furthermore, the addition of L_{NLL} to the objective in equation (5) is not adequately justified. In the supervised case, where targets are known, H(Z|Y) should be conditioned on these targets. However, instead of revising the conditional entropy of Z, another objective is introduced without clear motivation. While one might argue that C(X,Y,Z) serves as a prior on the networks and weights, this interpretation is not explicitly stated. The chosen objective lacks a clear probabilistic or information-theoretic foundation.
Given these concerns, it is not surprising that additional measures, such as semantic noise addition, are necessary to achieve satisfactory results. Although the concept of noise addition may be valuable, the underlying issues with the objective function make it challenging to draw meaningful conclusions.
In summary, a more rigorous theoretical justification of the proposed model is essential before any conclusive assessment of the semantic noise modeling can be made.
