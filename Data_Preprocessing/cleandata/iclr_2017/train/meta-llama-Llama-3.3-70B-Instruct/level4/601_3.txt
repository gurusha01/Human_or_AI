This paper introduces NEWSQA, a novel machine comprehension dataset comprising over 100,000 question-answer pairs derived from more than 10,000 news articles from CNN. The authors conduct an analysis of the various answer types and the distinct reasoning skills required to respond to questions within the dataset. They also assess human performance and the performance of two baseline models on the dataset, drawing comparisons with the SQuAD dataset.
The paper has several strengths, including the presentation of a large-scale dataset for machine comprehension, a reasonable question collection method that incorporates an answer validation step, and the proposal of a novel, computationally efficient implementation of the match-LSTM model.
However, there are several weaknesses that need to be addressed. Firstly, the human evaluation is limited to a small subset of 200 questions, which may not accurately represent human performance on the entire dataset. Secondly, while the NEWSQA dataset shares similarities with the SQuAD dataset in terms of size and composition, the paper's attempts to demonstrate that NEWSQA is more challenging are not convincing. The reported gap in human and machine performance between the two datasets may not be reliable due to the small sample size used for human evaluation, and the difference in sentence-level accuracy could be attributed to variations in document length rather than inherent differences in difficulty. Furthermore, the claim that the proposed BARB model is computationally more efficient than match-LSTM lacks quantitative evidence. Additionally, the paper contains unclear notation, such as the variable "s" in "n_s" under the "Boundary pointing" section.
In conclusion, while the dataset collection method shows promise, a more comprehensive evaluation is necessary to fully assess the value of NEWSQA. Specifically, it would be beneficial to see human performance results on a larger proportion of the dataset and a more rigorous empirical study demonstrating the relative challenges or advantages of NEWSQA compared to SQuAD.
