This paper presents an innovative application of computer vision to biology, but its potential impact is hindered by a lack of biological context and methodology. The approach essentially involves hierarchical clustering of visual categories, relying on WordNet hierarchy or biological inheritance trees as ground truth, which may not accurately represent biological relationships, particularly for species that interbreed or for non-biological entities like vehicles. The use of a tree structure is also limiting, as it imposes unnecessary constraints and loss of information, whereas a graph would be more suitable for capturing visual relationships. 
The paper's focus on recovering the biological inheritance tree from visual inputs is an intriguing idea, but it falls short in its execution. Evaluating the ability of visual features to recover hierarchical relationships between biological organisms would be a more meaningful endeavor, especially considering challenges like convergent evolution. However, this paper does not adequately address this task, leaving it feeling like a solution in search of a problem. The claim that this exercise can provide insights into deep features is also questionable, as the choice of ground truth (biological tree of life or WordNet hierarchy) is not convincingly justified.
Furthermore, the paper's comparison to human baselines is underwhelming, consisting of only qualitative results and a vague assertion that the proposed method is competitive with human performance in building the tree of life based on visual similarity. A more rigorous and quantitative evaluation of human baselines would be necessary to support such claims. Overall, while the paper explores an interesting idea, its lack of biological substance, methodological limitations, and unconvincing results detract from its potential contribution to the field.
