This manuscript introduces a meta-learning approach for learning generative models from limited examples, bearing a structural resemblance to the matching networks proposed by Vinyals et al. (2016). The algorithm is trained within a meta-learning framework, where dataset inputs are utilized, and its performance is evaluated on the Omniglot dataset in terms of log-likelihood and generated sample quality.
However, several aspects of the paper are unclear, making it challenging to fully comprehend the proposed methodology. The description of existing methods employs distinct terminology from the original authors, contributing to the complexity of the exposition. Furthermore, the novelty of the proposed idea is not explicitly stated, with only brief references to matching networks, upon which this work heavily relies. Despite being raised in the reviewer's question, the paper lacks revision to clarify these points.
The meta-learning setup also raises questions, as a natural formulation would involve predicting the distribution of small datasets X, implying uniform data point weighting, which differs from the method presented. The inclusion of a query q in section 3.1 adds to the confusion, as its representation and purpose are not clearly defined.
In terms of experimental validation, the absence of comparisons with prior work is notable, given the existence of similar methods. Such comparisons are essential to contextualize the proposed approach and assess its relative performance, highlighting the need for a more comprehensive evaluation.
