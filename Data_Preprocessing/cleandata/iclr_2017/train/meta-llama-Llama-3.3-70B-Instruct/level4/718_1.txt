The proposed multiagent system is presented as an extension of neural networks, allowing for more flexible network architectures by selectively computing only the necessary graph operations. However, upon examination, the distinction between the proposed system and existing artificial neural network frameworks is not clearly evident. While contemporary neural networks often rely heavily on matrix-matrix multiplications, this is not an inherent limitation, and the proposed multiagent system could potentially be represented within the artificial neural network framework by incorporating more complex layer and connectivity structures, with each neuron treated as a distinct layer. The discussion of computational efficiency is confined to comparisons among sparsely connected denoising autoencoders within the multiagent system framework, but a more comprehensive evaluation should include a baseline comparison against fully-connected neural networks that utilize matrix-matrix multiplication to provide a more robust assessment.
