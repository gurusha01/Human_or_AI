This paper presents a novel approach to modifying ConvNet training by dividing feature activations into groups, where all pairs of features across groups are encouraged to have low statistical correlation, utilizing supervision, referred to as privileged information, to manually assign features to groups. The proposed method is applied to image classification tasks.
The strengths of the paper include:
- The clarity and readability of the presentation
- The experimental results, which appear to demonstrate some benefits of the proposed approach
However, several weaknesses are noted:
(1) The introduction of background feature suppression lacks clear motivation and rigorous experimentation, despite the paper's core idea focusing on group orthogonality with privileged information
(2) The absence of a comparison with an ensemble method
(3) The potential impact of the study would be enhanced by conducting full experiments on ImageNet under the "partial privileged information" setting
While this paper shows promise, the current version requires improvement due to its lack of focus and poorly designed experiments.
Initially, the abstract and introduction emphasize the need for a single model with diverse, ensemble-like features to replace ensembles, aiming to achieve similar accuracy boosts while reducing computational costs and memory requirements. However, the remainder of the paper fails to address this point, omitting experimental results on ensembles and evidence that the proposed approach can maintain the accuracy benefits of ensembles while avoiding their speed and memory costs.
Furthermore, the technical contribution of the paper, group orthogonality, is presented as the primary idea. Nevertheless, the introduction of background feature suppression in Sec 4.1 seems ad hoc, as it is not inherently tied to group orthogonality, and the experiments do not isolate the effects of group orthogonality from background feature suppression. This omission is a significant experimental flaw.
Additional minor suggestions and comments include:
- The equation in Definition 2 contains an incorrect normalizing factor, which should be corrected to 1/c^(k)^2
- Figure 1 appears to have incorrect mask placements, with the top mask potentially masking out the background and only allowing the foreground to pass through.
