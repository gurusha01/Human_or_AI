Although I acknowledge the challenges associated with collecting audio data from animals, I believe that the proposed feature engineering approach may not be the most effective strategy. Instead, I would recommend exploring models that can learn feature representations directly from the data. It seems feasible to assemble a more extensive dataset from zoos, natural habitats, or other environments, which could then be utilized to train a generative model. The learned feature representation could subsequently be employed to inform a classifier. As I am not intimately familiar with the specific requirements of this task, it is difficult for me to assess the benefits of using chirplets, and I question whether this approach represents a significant improvement.
