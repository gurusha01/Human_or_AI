This paper presents several strengths, including the introduction of a well-designed filter bank and its effective implementation, the presentation of strong numerical results, and the refinement of representation through back propagation, which is shown to accelerate the learning process. 
However, there are a few areas that require improvement. The algorithms detailed in section 3.1 seem unnecessary and detract from the overall clarity of the paper, although the inclusion of source code would be a valuable addition. Furthermore, the connection to the scattering transform is not adequately explained. Additionally, there are instances where the writing could be enhanced for better comprehension, as noted in several of my comments.
Overall, I am optimistic that the weaknesses identified can be readily addressed, and with such revisions, the paper's quality would significantly improve.
