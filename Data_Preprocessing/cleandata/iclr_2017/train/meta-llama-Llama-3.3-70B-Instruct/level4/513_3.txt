Paper Summary 
This paper presents a method for learning a predictive model that forecasts subsequent video frames from a given input image, and leverages this model's predictions to enhance the performance of a supervised classifier. The proposed approach is demonstrated using a tower stability dataset.
 Review Summary 
The current state of this work appears to be preliminary, particularly in terms of experimental evaluation. The concept of utilizing forward modeling as a pretraining step has been previously explored and applied to various tasks, including video and text classification. Furthermore, the discussion of related work is inadequate. The choice of end task, which involves predicting motion, may not be ideal for advocating the use of unsupervised training.
 Detailed Review 
Upon examination, this work seems to be in its early stages. Notably, there is a lack of comparison with alternative semi-supervised strategies, and any approach that treats subsequent frames as latent variables or privileged information could be considered. Additionally, it is unclear whether the supervised stability prediction model is necessary once the next frame has been predicted. Essentially, the task can be simplified to predicting whether motion will occur in the video following the current frame, which could be achieved by comparing the first frame and last prediction or analyzing the density of gray in the top part of the video. Training a model to predict motion presence from unsupervised data alone may yield satisfactory results. It is recommended to focus on tasks where labels cannot be easily inferred from unsupervised data, as this would render unlabeled videos equivalent to labeled frames.
The related work section is lacking in its discussion of previous research on learning unsupervised features from video data, such as predictive models and dimensionality reduction, to aid in the classification of still images or videos. For instance, Fathi et al. (2008), Mobahi et al. (2009), and Srivastava et al. (2015) have explored these concepts. More recently, Wang and Gupta (2015) achieved excellent results on ImageNet using features pretrained on unlabeled videos, while Vondrick et al. (2016) demonstrated the effectiveness of generative video models in initializing models for video classification tasks. Similarly, in text classification, pretraining classifiers with language models is a form of predictive modeling, as seen in the work of Dai and Le (2015).
It is suggested that the authors report test results on the dataset from Lerrer et al. (2016), although this would require collecting their own videos for pretraining the predictive model. However, stability prediction only necessitates still images.
Overall, the experimental section appears to be underdeveloped. It would be beneficial to concentrate on a task where solving the unsupervised task does not inherently imply that the supervised task is trivially solved, or vice versa, where a simple rule can transform unlabeled data into labeled data.
