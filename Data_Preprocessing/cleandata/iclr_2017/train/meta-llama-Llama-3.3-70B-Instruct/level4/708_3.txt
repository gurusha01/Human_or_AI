The authors present a methodology for generating adversarial examples without requiring knowledge of the network's architecture or gradients, a concept that holds some value. Nevertheless, it is essential to acknowledge that this area of research has been extensively explored, including scenarios involving black box setups, as noted by another reviewer.
A significant concern arises from the initial set of experiments, which permits the inclusion of images that fall outside the valid image space, a point the authors themselves acknowledge on page 7. In my view, this limitation renders the results of these experiments inconsequential and unsurprising.
The introduction of a greedy search procedure addresses this issue to some extent. However, the description of the proposed method is somewhat obscure. As I understand it, the process involves first generating a candidate set of pixels using PERT, followed by perturbation using CYCLIC. It remains unclear why this approach yields effective or minimal perturbations, especially since the candidate pixels are identified using a large "p" value that can lead to images outside the valid image space. The rationale behind choosing this method is not adequately justified by the authors.
In summary, although the authors conduct an intriguing investigation into generating adversarial images from a black-box network, the overall methodology and conclusions appear relatively straightforward. The paper's verbose writing style makes the findings seem more complex than necessary, and I believe the key points could be conveyed much more concisely.
