The authors investigate the concept of utilizing deep learning to develop a static analyzer, demonstrating its potential with a simplified programming language and a basic analysis task - verifying variable initialization. 
Although the idea has merit and could potentially evolve into a valuable tool, the simplistic nature of the task presented in this paper falls short of justifying submission to ICLR. The task of detecting variable initialization in a string is akin to other basic algorithmic tasks that have been successfully addressed by models such as the Neural Turing Machine, Stack RNNs, Neural GPU, and Differentiable Neural Computer in recent research. Given the impressive performance of these architectures on various algorithmic tasks, it is likely they would also excel in this specific task. Unfortunately, the authors' comparison is limited to more fundamental models like HMMs, omitting the more advanced models that have publicly available code. As a result, the paper's readiness for ICLR is questionable, and there is a concern that existing models may already effectively solve this problem, thereby obscuring the contribution of this work.
