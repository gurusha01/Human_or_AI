This manuscript presents a sparse coding framework utilizing cosine-loss, incorporated as a feed-forward layer within a neural network, adopting an energy-based learning approach. The bidirectional extension renders the proximal operator analogous to a specific non-linearity, notably CReLu, albeit its necessity is debatable. However, the experimental results fail to demonstrate substantial enhancements over existing baselines.
The strengths of this work include:
- The optimization of cosine-distance, which appears beneficial in various contexts where computing inner-products between features is necessary.
- The discovery that bidirectional sparse coding corresponds to a feed-forward network equipped with CReLu non-linearity.
Conversely, the weaknesses are:
- The concept of unrolling sparse coding inference as a feed-forward network is not novel.
- The class-wise encoding approach makes the algorithm impractical for multi-class scenarios, as it necessitates a separate sparse coding network for each class.
- The manuscript does not provide evidence that the proposed method surpasses baselines in real-world applications.
