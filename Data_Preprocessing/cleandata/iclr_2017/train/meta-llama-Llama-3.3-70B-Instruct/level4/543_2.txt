Although the presented work is intriguing and may be beneficial to a specific group, its appeal appears to be limited to a niche audience, rather than the broader ICLR community, which is generally comfortable utilizing traditional machine learning tools. 
The paper does not introduce novel algorithms or provide significant enhancements to the user interface or meta-design, which would facilitate the design and training of neural network systems for non-experts. 
In my opinion, the ICLR audience may show limited enthusiasm for a paper that does not substantially contribute to the advancement of the field. 
I do not have any major concerns regarding the paper's presentation or methodological approach.
