This paper proposes an amortised MAP estimation approach for super-resolution (SR) problems, which involves training a neural network to project onto an affine subspace of SR solutions that are consistent with the low-resolution (LR) input. The method leverages various optimisation techniques, including GANs, noise-assisted, and density-assisted methods, to obtain proper solutions. The results are well-demonstrated on multiple datasets.
Overall, I find the paper to be of interest, although I believe the writing and presentation could be significantly improved for better clarity. Given the complexity of the subject matter, enhanced clarity would greatly facilitate understanding, as some sections were challenging to follow. Furthermore, I would appreciate a more in-depth analysis of the learned networks, such as the types of features they acquire, to provide additional insight into the method's efficacy.
