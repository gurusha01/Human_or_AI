This manuscript presents a theoretical foundation for linking parameters between input word embeddings and output word representations within the softmax function. Notably, experiments conducted on the Penn Treebank (PTB) dataset demonstrate substantial enhancements. Although the concept of sharing or tying weights between input and output word embeddings is not novel, as previously discussed, the authors' proposed rationale appears innovative and intriguing, which I consider a significant positive aspect. However, I perceive the lack of novelty in the idea itself as a drawback. My primary concern is that the results are solely reported on the PTB dataset, which, while foundational, is somewhat outdated in the current literature. I appreciate the authors' effort to experiment with an additional dataset, and I suggest incorporating these findings into the paper, if possible, to strengthen the results. Furthermore, I wonder if the authors have explored the potential of utilizing character or sub-word units in this context to potentially enhance the model's performance.
