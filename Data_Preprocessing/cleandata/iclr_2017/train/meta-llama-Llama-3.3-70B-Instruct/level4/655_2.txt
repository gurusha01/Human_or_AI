I appreciate the author's response and acknowledge their efforts. However, after reevaluation, I maintain my initial assessment, and the paper remains unsuitable for publication at this time.
The proposed transfer learning approach aims to tackle optimization complexity and class imbalance issues. Nevertheless, several concerns persist:
1. The manuscript's readability is hindered by numerous typos, unconventional phrasing, and inconsistent terminology usage, such as the terms "distributed," "transfer learning" (which seems to imply "fine-tuning"), "softmax" (apparently referring to "fully-connected"), and "deep learning" (seemingly synonymous with "base neural network"). Despite my best efforts, I am still uncertain about the precise details of the algorithm.
2. The figure and table captions lack sufficient information, requiring the reader to constantly navigate back and forth throughout the paper to comprehend the meaning behind the numbers and images.
3. Based on my understanding, the authors' "conventional transfer learning" refers to fine-tuning only the fully-connected layers, as illustrated in Figure 1. In this context, it is crucial to compare the proposed method with approaches that also update some convolutional layers. Unfortunately, this comparison is absent from the paper.
Regarding the pre-review questions:
1. If the paper exclusively focuses on the case where |C| equals |L|, it would be beneficial to simplify the notation to reduce clutter.
2. The concept of "distributed transfer learning" remains unclear. Figure 1 is intended to highlight the distinction from the conventional approach (fine-tuning of fully-connected layers), but I find the terminology confusing, as "Softmax" is not typically used to describe fully-connected layers. The diagram suggests that the base CNN has an equal number of convolutional filters at each layer, and to obtain a distributed ensemble, filters with the same indices must be connected. However, this explanation does not seem logical to me, and I may be misinterpreting the figure. I recommend that the authors revise the diagram to improve clarity.
In conclusion, the paper requires substantial refinement to enhance the presentation's clarity and, in its current form, cannot be accepted for publication.
