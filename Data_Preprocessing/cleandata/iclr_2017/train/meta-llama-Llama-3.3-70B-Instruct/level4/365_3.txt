This paper demonstrates encouraging outcomes, although its presentation and organization hinder a clear understanding of the content. The authors concurrently discuss several closely related concepts, making it challenging to evaluate the individual performance of each. Specifically, the paper touches on diversity, sparsity, regularization terms, and weight tying, which, while interconnected, would benefit from clearer delineation. Nonetheless, the overall results are noteworthy and suggest potential.
