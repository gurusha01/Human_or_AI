I reviewed the manuscript as of December 6th.
The authors conduct a thorough examination of various retraining methods to enhance the robustness of a classification network against adversarial examples. Notably, their RAD and IAEC methods yield lower error rates and outperform previously proposed distillation methods for retraining networks to withstand adversarial examples, indicating a promising approach to developing a defense against such threats.
Major Comments:
Upon reviewing the paper, I found that it lacks a clear and concise narrative. Although the paper presents an extensive list of related results (page 2), it fails to convey a coherent message. It appears that one of the primary contributions is the superior performance of the authors' retraining techniques, but the paper does not provide a comprehensive comparison with other retraining techniques, nor does it offer a detailed explanation of the proposed methods, namely RAD and IAEC. To improve the paper's clarity and exposition, I suggest the following:
- The authors should provide a more detailed description of the auto-encoder construction in the IAEC method, potentially accompanied by a diagram. Similarly, a more thorough explanation of the RAD method is necessary. The authors reference a previous workshop submission, but further elaboration is required to ensure that readers can fully understand the methodology employed.
