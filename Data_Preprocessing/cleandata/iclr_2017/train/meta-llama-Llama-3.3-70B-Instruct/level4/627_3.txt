I struggle to comprehend the underlying motivation of this paper, as the authors' claim of capturing a latent representation of text and image during training, enabling better translation without images at test time, is not convincingly demonstrated. The setup, particularly the absence of images at test time, seems unusual. The provided qualitative analysis fails to persuasively show that the models have learned latent representations, leading me to speculate that any observed gains may be attributed to reduced overfitting due to the inclusion of images during training, rather than the image models themselves. The authors' reasoning, such as "we observed some gains, so these should come from our image models," appears speculative and lacks concrete evidence.
Furthermore, the dataset utilized in this study is insufficient for conducting meaningful experiments in Neural Machine Translation (NMT). The comparison between the proposed models and existing NMT and Visual Neural Machine Translation (VNMT) models is also questionable, given the fine-tuning procedures described in Section 4.1, where VNMT is fine-tuned by NMT and the proposed models are fine-tuned with VNMT. Additional clarification on this aspect is necessary.
The presentation of the paper also poses several challenges. For instance, the excessive use of symbols, such as 'f' and 'g' for 'x' (source) and 'y' (target) in Section 3.1, hinders readability. The inconsistent use of the ' symbol, as seen in Section 3.1.2, where references are made to h'\pi obtained from Eq. (3), which pertains to h\pi, further complicates the narrative. Although the intended meaning is understood, a more effective presentation approach would be beneficial.
Additionally, the computation of h'z from \mu and \sigma in Section 3.2.2 raises questions regarding the utilization of \mu' and \sigma'. Notation inconsistencies, such as G+O-AVG, which would be more appropriately denoted as G+O{AVG} to avoid implying an ablation test, are also present throughout the paper.
Other notable issues include the lack of explanations for Figures 2 and 3, as well as a missing \pi symbol in Appendix A preceding the KL derivation. These oversights detract from the overall clarity and coherence of the paper, underscoring the need for revision and refinement to effectively convey the authors' research and findings.
