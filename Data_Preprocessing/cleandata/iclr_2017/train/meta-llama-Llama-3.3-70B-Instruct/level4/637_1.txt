This paper proposes to extract explicit rules from the knowledge base embedding space by formulating it as a sparse reconstruction problem, with experimental results showing its capability to derive reasonable rules on several link prediction datasets.
The approach presented appears to be viable, but it raises questions regarding the necessity of mining rules from learned knowledge base embeddings. 
- The information encoded by these embeddings remains unclear, making it perplexing to attempt to learn rules that include complex logical operations such as negation and disjunction from them.
- If the objective is to obtain useful rules for application in other areas, it would be essential to draw comparisons with alternative methods, such as "graph random walk", to assess the effectiveness and uniqueness of the proposed rule extraction method.
