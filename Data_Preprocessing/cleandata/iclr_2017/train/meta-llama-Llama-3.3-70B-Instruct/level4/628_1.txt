1. Enhancing the accuracy and precision of the paper would substantially improve its clarity. For instance, characterizing alpha-expansion and belief propagation as 'scene-understanding algorithms' is misleading, as they are methods for optimizing energy functions. The claim of computing the MAP state of an SSPN in sub-linear time relative to the network size seems counterintuitive, as it implies not all nodes are visited. Defining terms like 'deep probabilistic model' would also be beneficial. The statement that InferSSPN calculates 'the approximate MAP state of the SSPN (equivalently, the optimal parse of the image)' raises questions about how an approximate state can be optimal. Similar clarifications are needed elsewhere.
2. Despite being tailored for scene understanding tasks, the experiments do not adequately demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed technique. A more comprehensive analysis is necessary to evaluate its applicability. Specifically, the technique's evaluation on a limited subset of images hinders comparison with other approaches. In my view, the paper should either provide a conclusive experimental evaluation using metrics like IoU or compare its results with publicly available data to facilitate a more informed assessment.
3. To facilitate a better understanding of the paper, a more intuitive, high-level overview of the approach would be beneficial. Including an intuitive visualization of the method could further enhance the reader's comprehension and simplify the overall presentation of the paper.
