Review- Strengths:
  The proposed training criterion is noteworthy.
Weaknesses:
  The absence of suitable Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technique-based baseline comparisons is a significant limitation.
Comments:
  The utilized dataset is relatively limited in size.
  To enhance the evaluation, incorporating ROC curves for detection and additional metrics such as Equal Error Rate (EER) alongside Average Precision (AP) would be beneficial.
  A more in-depth examination of the results is required, including a comparison of the precision of in-vocabulary words encountered during training with the detection performance of out-of-vocabulary words.
  Visualizing the relationship between embedding distances and orthographic distances through scatter plots could provide valuable insights and would be a worthwhile addition.
