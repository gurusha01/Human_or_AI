This review is a speculative assessment, as unfortunately, I was unable to fully comprehend the paper due to my own knowledge gaps and the highly abstract presentation. Despite investing several hours in reading the paper, I found it challenging to follow, which I attribute to both my limitations and the overly abstract nature of the content. The writing is clear, but reminiscent of a N. Bourbaki book in its clarity, which, while precise, may not facilitate understanding for a broader audience.
Given my limited understanding, I suggest that the accept/reject decision be left to other reviewers who may possess a deeper grasp of the subject matter. Even if the authors have made significant errors, I would be unable to identify them. However, my overall assessment is positive, driven by the paper's clear writing and promising empirical evaluation. Nevertheless, I believe that considerable effort is required to make the content more accessible to a wider audience interested in the topic.
My feedback will therefore focus on the presentation aspects. A major obstacle for me was the lack of concrete examples to anchor the abstract formalism. When examples were provided, they seemed to appear without clear connections to the preceding concepts, making it difficult to understand their relevance.
A crucial example that could significantly enhance understanding is how convolution or inner product operations relate to the setting described in the paper. Specifically, I struggled to see how the '(x, x')' pairs used to build relations, structures, and define invariance connect to the concept of convolution, which is typically understood in the context of space or time and characterized by its equivariant property.
The transition from sets to relations to functions to operators and finally to shift-invariant operators (convolutions) involves multiple steps, and more guidance for the reader would be beneficial. For instance, the association between a 3x3 convolution and 9 relations was not clear to me. Are these relations tied to the input at a specific coordinate and its contribution to the output, such as through the term (w{offset} x{i-offset})? If so, the purpose of the backward arrow from the center node to other nodes and the arrows across nodes needs clarification.
Furthermore, several terms and notations were unfamiliar, including "Cardinal" and "Cartesian convolution" in the context of signal processing. It was also unclear whether the discussion pertains to separable filters. The symbols and sub-graphs in Figure 2, such as the X and Square symbols, the horizontal and vertical sub-graphs, and the variables x1, x{11}, x{1,2}, and x{1,3}, lacked clear explanations.
While these questions may seem trivial to the authors, I believe that part of the publishing process involves doing the "homework" for the readers to facilitate easy comprehension of the ideas. Targeting the general case is commendable, but dedicating space to explain how specific instances relate to the general case would be beneficial.
I propose that the authors consider explaining key concepts, such as x, x{I}, and x{S}, using the simplest possible example, like convolving a 1x5 signal with a 1x3 filter. Demonstrating how convolution filter parameters are incorporated into the function f and how spatial invariance (or equivariance) of convolution is reflected in this context would significantly enhance clarity.
