This study appears to be well-conducted, although it falls outside my domain of expertise, and I did not encounter any methodological or presentational issues. However, I was unable to fully appreciate the nuances or contextualize the work within the relevant literature.
The proposed technique seems to offer genuine efficiency improvements in hardware, albeit without impacting task accuracy. The selection of tasks, such as Alexnet and VGG, appears suitable. Nevertheless, the results are based on simulations rather than actual hardware implementations.
Given the focus of ICLR, this topic may be somewhat niche, as it primarily focuses on hardware optimization without introducing novel learning or representation approaches, despite the call for papers including "hardware" as a relevant area. As a result, the appeal to conference attendees may be limited.
It would be beneficial to improve the use of parenthetical references, as the current implementation can hinder the reading experience.
