This paper presents a hierarchical infomax approach, and I have several key observations and suggestions. 
(1) The paper's length, spanning 21 pages excluding the appendix, poses a challenge for readers to follow the content easily. To enhance readability, the authors should strive to condense the paper while preserving its core message.
(2) A primary contribution of this work is the identification of a suitable initialization point through the maximization of I(X;R). However, the rationale behind maximizing I(X;\breve{Y}) to achieve this goal is not clearly explained, particularly given that Proposition 2.1 establishes I(X;\breve{Y}) as an upper bound of I(X;R). Typically, when direct maximization of a function is difficult, a common strategy involves maximizing a tractable lower bound of the function, which contrasts with the approach taken here.
Minor comments:
(1) If equation (2.11) is intended as an approximation of equation (2.8), the notation "\approx" should be utilized to indicate this relationship.
(2) The choice of K_1 over N in equation (2.11) warrants further explanation.
(3) In equation (2.12), the term H(X) appears to be unnecessary and could potentially be removed.
(4) Organizing Section 3 into subsections would significantly improve the paper's structure and readability.
