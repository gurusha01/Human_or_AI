This manuscript presents a novel memory component designed for large-scale, life-long, and one-shot learning scenarios. The proposed module demonstrates versatility by being successfully integrated into multiple neural network architectures, yielding enhanced performance across the board.
While utilizing k-nearest neighbors for memory retrieval is not an entirely novel concept, having been explored in previous works such as Rae et al. (2016) and Chandar et al. (2016), and specifically for one-shot learning in [R1], this paper contributes by providing comprehensive experimental evidence of its applicability and effectiveness across a range of architectures.
The authors have adequately addressed all the questions I posed in my preliminary review, and I find their responses satisfactory.
However, to further facilitate reproducibility, I inquire whether the authors are willing to make the source code publicly available, particularly for the experiments conducted on Omniglot and the synthetic tasks.
