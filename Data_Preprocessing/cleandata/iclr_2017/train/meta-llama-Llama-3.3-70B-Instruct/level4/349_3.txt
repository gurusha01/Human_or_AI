This manuscript explores an extension of the fundamental bAbI problems by introducing unknown variables in place of certain entities and individuals within the scenarios. Notably, resolving the questions posed requires knowledge of some of these variables, thereby necessitating the agent to acquire the ability to query their values. This setup allows for the assessment of both the agent's accuracy in responding to questions and its efficiency in identifying and querying only the relevant unknown variables, thus avoiding unnecessary inquiries. This capability to infer unknown variables represents a significant advancement beyond the original bAbI tasks, which have largely been resolved.
The paper is well-structured and effectively communicates its contributions. However, given the constrained vocabulary and simplistic structure inherent to bAbI problems, it is essential to recognize that these tasks, including their variants, are more accurately characterized as fundamental reasoning exercises rather than genuine natural language understanding assessments. The authors' assertion that this work evaluates the 'interaction' capabilities of agents is not entirely convincing, as the task can be more precisely described as 'inferring crucial unknown variables,' a skill that, although important, is more closely related to reasoning than interaction. The connection between this ability and 'interaction' may be somewhat superficial.
Nevertheless, it is undeniable that conversational agents must possess basic reasoning skills to engage in meaningful interactions with humans. The overarching objective of the bAbI tasks, which is to evaluate these reasoning capabilities within controlled, synthetically generated environments of appropriate complexity, is commendable. The authors have successfully demonstrated that their proposed extension of these tasks is intriguing and merits further exploration. Consequently, based on the significance and potential impact of this research, I support the acceptance of this manuscript.
