This manuscript presents a k-shot learning approach that adapts existing pre-trained networks by clustering filters with similar activation patterns, enabling joint learning to mitigate overfitting in low-sample scenarios.
Although the concept is intriguing and yields some promising results, the current draft requires further refinement before publication:
Performance Evaluation:
A comparative analysis with state-of-the-art k-shot learning methods, such as the Matching Networks proposed by Vinyals et al. (2016), is necessary to assess the effectiveness of the proposed method.
Lack of Clarity:
The experimental setup for k-shot learning should be elaborated upon to provide a more comprehensive understanding.
Evaluation Metric:
Comparing the baseline and proposed methods using accuracy differences may not be ideal; instead, reporting raw accuracies would be more straightforward.
Furthermore, the manuscript contains numerous grammatical errors and inconsistent citation formatting, including examples such as:
M. et al. (2011)
ImageNet (Alex et al., 2012)
Judy et al. (2013), which appears multiple times in the reference list.
