This paper proposes a framework for predicting the stability of block towers by leveraging an additional model that forecasts the sequence of frames depicting the tower's evolution. The results demonstrate that this approach enhances the generalization capabilities of the original supervised task. 
The authors construct a synthetic dataset comprising block towers with 3 to 5 blocks in various precarious positions, complete with labels indicating whether the tower falls or not, as well as video frame sequences generated using a physics engine.
Three types of models are trained: one that predicts the stability of the tower based solely on its initial state, and two others that utilize both the initial and final states of the tower to make predictions. The latter two models differ in how they process the final state, with one predicting the final frame directly and the other generating a series of intermediate frames before arriving at the final frame. Notably, the models that predict the final state are trained using unsupervised learning.
The experiments involve training each model on towers of a specific height and testing them on towers with unseen heights. When the training and testing heights are identical, all models perform similarly. However, when the testing height exceeds the training height, explicitly modeling the final state of the tower significantly improves prediction accuracy.
The key advantages of this work include the clear benefits of incorporating an unsupervised final frame predictor, which leads to substantial gains in accuracy, and the clarity of the writing. 
However, a major concern is the lack of in-depth analysis. To further explore the idea, potential directions for analysis could include investigating whether the results are limited by the specific rendering of the block towers or the model architecture. For instance, the LSTM model's performance might be influenced by the sub-sampling strategy, and examining the frame-by-frame video prediction accuracy could provide valuable insights. Additionally, exploring the impact of model capacity, task specification, and training procedure on generalization to different block heights could yield important findings.
Minor concerns include the desirability of comparing the proposed approach to existing baselines, such as Zhang et al. 2016 and PhysNet, although this is not considered a major issue. Furthermore, the motivation behind training models to predict the number of fallen blocks instead of a binary stability label could be clarified. Finally, the release of the dataset or code for generating it would be beneficial.
In overall evaluation, the writing, presentation, and experiments are of high quality, suitable for ICLR. Nevertheless, the limited analysis beyond the primary result and moderate novelty of the idea are notable drawbacks. The results do, however, offer a valuable contribution to the literature, particularly if supplemented with further analysis.
