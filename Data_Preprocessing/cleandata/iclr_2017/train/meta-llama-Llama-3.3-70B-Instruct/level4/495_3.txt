This manuscript presents the following key findings:
1. The authors provide straightforward and constructive proofs to establish e-error upper bounds for neural networks, demonstrating that O(log 1/e) layers and O(log 1/e) ReLU units are sufficient.
2. The work extends previous results to encompass more general function classes, including smooth functions and vector-valued functions, thereby broadening the applicability of the findings.
3. The paper also derives lower bounds on the size of neural networks as a function of their depth, revealing that shallow architectures require an exponential increase in units to achieve comparable approximations.
The manuscript is clearly written and well-organized, making it easy to understand. The technical aspects, including the proofs outlined in the Appendix, appear to be accurate. While the proof techniques themselves are not overly complex and build upon existing arguments from researchers like Gil, Telgarsky, and Dasgupta, they are effectively combined to yield sharp and meaningful results. Overall, based on the strengths of the paper, I am inclined to recommend acceptance.
