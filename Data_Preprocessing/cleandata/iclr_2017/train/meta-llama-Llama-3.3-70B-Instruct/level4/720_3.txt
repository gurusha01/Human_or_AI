This paper presents a methodology for combining two embedding vectors, v1 and v2, through a process involving pairwise element combinations with complex nonlinearity, followed by the selection of the K-max values to form the output vector. The approach is extended to higher-order combinations by iteratively applying pairwise combinations. Notably, this method appears to be generally applicable to various types of embeddings, beyond just categorical or one-hot encoded data, which raises questions about the specific motivations behind this approach and its underlying connections. 
The proposed methodology bears resemblance to existing works, such as the Convolutional Click Prediction Model (CCPM), which employs a similar architectural design (convolutional layer + K-max pooling + convolutional layer + K-max pooling). However, the paper does not provide a detailed comparison or discussion on the conceptual similarities and differences between the proposed approach and CCPM, or other related methods like Compact Bilinear Pooling.
