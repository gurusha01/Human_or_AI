This paper presents the most compelling approach to image compression using deep neural networks that I have encountered to date. The writing is of high quality, and the incorporation of rate-distortion theory into the objective function is seamlessly integrated into the framework. A suitable baseline is established through comparison with JPEG2000, which is an improvement over previous papers that only considered JPEG. I anticipate that this paper will have a significant impact.
To further enhance the paper, I recommend including results from standard test images such as Lena, Barbara, and Baboon, in addition to comparing with state-of-the-art methods that employ more traditional techniques. It is essential to clearly elucidate how neural network-based methods compare to the best previous approaches. Upon reviewing the submitted version, I still lack a clear understanding of how these two categories of methods are positioned relative to each other.
