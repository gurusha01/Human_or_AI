This manuscript introduces a novel language model that incorporates entity references as latent variables, presenting three specialized models for distinct applications: dialog generation with database entry references, recipe generation with ingredient references, and text generation with coreference mentions.
Although the paper effectively conveys its central idea, which is intriguing and warrants further exploration, it appears to have been submitted under time pressure, resulting in several significant weaknesses. Despite some lack of clarity in certain details, the main concept is well-articulated, making it an interesting and worthwhile pursuit.
One major limitation is that the purported latent variables are not truly latent in the empirical evaluation. As clarified by the authors through pre-review questions, all model variants were provided with given mentions, rendering the term "latent" misleading, as these variables are essentially treated as observed. It is unclear whether the difficulty in training models with genuine latent variables contributed to this approach.
A related issue arises from the use of perplexity as an evaluation metric when comparing reference-aware language models to standard language models. This comparison is unfair, as the two models operate on different event spaces. The reference-aware models, which assume given mentions and utilize a pointer network-like design for mention generation, naturally yield higher probability scores over mentions compared to regular language models that must consider a larger vocabulary set. This disparity is analogous to comparing language models with aggressive unknown word handling (and a limited vocabulary) to those without (and a more extensive vocabulary).
To address this concern, the authors should conduct additional evaluations, such as assuming unknown mention boundaries and marginalizing over all possibilities (treating latent variables as genuinely latent) or employing alternative evaluation metrics, like BLEU, METEOR, or human evaluation, for the corresponding generation tasks.
Another significant weakness lies in the paper's technical accuracy and completeness. Many details remain opaque and confusing, even after clarifications through questions. The challenge of presenting three specialized models, each with numerous details, may have hindered the writing quality. Perhaps the authors could restructure the paper to clearly elaborate on the most crucial details, particularly regarding latent variable handling, in the main body of the paper. This includes explaining how to make mention detection and coreference resolution truly latent and the role of entity updates, which is currently only briefly mentioned for the coreference resolution application without empirical comparisons to motivate the update operation.
