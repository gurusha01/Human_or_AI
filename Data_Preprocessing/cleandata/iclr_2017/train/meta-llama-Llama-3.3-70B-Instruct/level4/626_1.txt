This paper examines the structural composition of the preimage of a specific activity at a hidden layer within a network, demonstrating that the preimage of any given activity constitutes a piecewise linear set of subspaces.
The strengths of this work include its potential to formalize the geometric properties of preimages for activity vectors, which could significantly enhance our comprehension of network architectures.
However, the analysis presented appears to be in its initial stages, lacking novel theoretical insights or clear, actionable conclusions.
A primary theoretical finding suggests that the preimage is composed of a combination of lower-dimensional subspaces. It is worth considering whether an alternative, direct inductive approach could have yielded similar results, such as tracing backwards from the penultimate layer. While this line of inquiry is intriguing and warrants further exploration (e.g., investigating how parameters like depth and width influence spatial division, or examining the dynamics during training), the current state of the work seems incomplete.
