Review- Pros:
The authors propose a novel RNN-based approach as an alternative to WaveNet for generating audio samples sequentially, which is a suitable application for RNNs and presents an intriguing option. Additionally, they report substantial enhancements in the quality of the generated samples. A notable innovation in this work is the utilization of a quantitative likelihood-based metric to evaluate the model, complementing the AB human comparison methodology employed in the WaveNet study.
Cons:
A limitation of the paper is the absence of detailed equations that describe the model architecture, an omission that can be addressed in the camera-ready version. Furthermore, the paper lacks comprehensive justifications for certain modeling decisions, including the use of a multilayer perceptron (MLP) in the bottom layer instead of an additional RNN, and the employment of linear projections for up-sampling rather than alternative methods such as feeding the same state to all samples or utilizing a more sophisticated transformation. The authors also acknowledge that their implementation of WaveNet may not be optimal, which raises concerns about the validity of the comparative analysis.
Despite these drawbacks, and assuming that more detailed modeling information is provided, this paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field.
