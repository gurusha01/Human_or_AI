This manuscript tackles the issue of data scarcity in the healthcare sector by utilizing hierarchical structures of medical concepts as defined in ontologies. It concentrates on sequential prediction based on a patient's medical history, which is represented as a sequence of medical codes that may include rare occurrences. Unlike traditional methods that assign a separate embedding to each medical code before inputting it into a recurrent neural network (RNN), the proposed method assigns a "fundamental" embedding to each node in the medical ontology and then computes a "composite" embedding for each medical code. This is achieved by taking a weighted average, learned through an attention mechanism, of the medical code's ancestral nodes in the ontology. The paper is well-structured and the approach is straightforward.
I have several observations and questions:
- The representation of a patient's visit as a mere sum of the medical codes present seems oversimplified. Would using the average or a learned weighted average not provide a more nuanced representation, and doesn't the current approach introduce a bias related to the number of codes in each visit?
- It is unclear why the basic embeddings are not fine-tuned alongside other parameters. Was this approach found to degrade performance, or is there a theoretical rationale behind this decision?
- Upon examining Figure 2, the results appear closely matched, and the figures lack clarity (notably, the top part of figure (b) is missing). It would be beneficial to discuss the statistical significance of these differences to provide a clearer understanding of the outcomes.
Lastly, while this paper presents an intriguing application of established deep learning methodologies to address a critical issue in data-scarce domains, it would be valuable for the authors to elaborate on the novel contributions their work brings to the ICLR community and justify why they consider ICLR an appropriate platform for their research.
