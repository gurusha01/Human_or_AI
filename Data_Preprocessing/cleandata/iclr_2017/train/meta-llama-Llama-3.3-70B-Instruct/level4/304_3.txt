This manuscript substantially enhances the initial NPI research by demonstrating that the model exhibits considerably improved generalization capabilities when trained on recursive-form traces. The authors achieve enhanced sample complexity and generalization outcomes for addition and bubblesort programs and introduce two novel, more complex tasks: topological sort and quicksort, incorporated in response to reviewer feedback. Notably, they provide a formal proof that the algorithms learned by the model generalize perfectly, a milestone that, to the best of my knowledge, has not been previously accomplished in the field of neural program induction.
