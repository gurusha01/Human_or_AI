The authors explicitly state that achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) results is not their primary objective. Nevertheless, the fact that an ensemble of ResNets yields inferior performance compared to certain single-network results suggests that additional experimentation, ideally utilizing larger datasets, is warranted to further validate their findings. Furthermore, the literature review would benefit from referencing existing studies, such as those on wide ResNets, to provide a more comprehensive context for their research.
