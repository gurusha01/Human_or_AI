This paper offers a thorough and intriguing examination of targeted and non-targeted adversarial examples in CNNs, presenting a comprehensive study that is both detailed and empirically rich.
Although I am undecided about this submission, I am inclined to recommend acceptance, as the meticulous empirical analysis it provides can significantly contribute to the foundation of future research. The paper's extensive length is, in my opinion, a notable advantage, enabling an in-depth investigation into the efficacy and transferability of various adversarial examples.
However, several concerns need to be addressed:
1) While the paper's length is beneficial, it is essential to clearly articulate the primary contributions. Upon reviewing the manuscript, I experienced confusion regarding the distinction between ensemble and non-ensemble methods, as well as the significance of the Clarifai evaluation. To improve clarity, I suggest a substantial revision that refocuses the narrative:
- Initially, the study demonstrates the ease of non-targeted attacks and the difficulty of targeted attacks, supported by a pivotal experiment comparing the two (with extensive exploration provided in later sections or the appendix, such as the current Section 3).
- The paper then proposes an ensemble method, shown to effectively handle targeted attacks, as evidenced by comparative experiments between ensemble and non-ensemble methods in both controlled settings and on Clarifai.
- Additional details and explorations are then presented.
2) Instead of utilizing ResNet-152, ResNet-101, and ResNet-50 as three of the five models, it would be more effective to employ one ResNet architecture alongside two alternative models, such as AlexNet and Network-in-Network. This approach would render the ensemble results more compelling and robust.
