This paper examines the challenge of identifying the answer to a question within a given text, where the answer is always embedded in the input text. To address this, the authors propose a hybrid approach that integrates two existing methods: Match-LSTM for relating question and text representations, and Pointer Net for predicting the answer's location in the text.
The strengths of this paper include:
- The proposed approach is well-suited for the task and yields good performance, although recent concurrent studies have achieved even better results, as acknowledged by the authors.
- The evaluation on the SQuAD dataset shows significant improvements over previous work.
However, several weaknesses are noted:
1. The paper does not provide clarity on the applicability of this approach to scenarios where the answer is not a subset of the input text.
2. Experimental evaluation raises two concerns:
2.1. The decision not to use Bi-Ans-Ptr in the ensemble, despite its superior performance as shown in Table 2, is unclear.
2.2. It would be valuable to investigate whether this approach can generalize to other datasets.
Additional minor points and discussions include:
- The task and approach bear some resemblance to locating queries in images and visual question answering, suggesting the authors could benefit from referencing related works in this area.
- The task could potentially be viewed as a form of "guided extractive summarization," where the question directs the summarization process.
- A minor error is noted on page 6, in the last paragraph, where a period is missing: "… searching This…".
In summary, while the paper presents an intriguing combination of approaches for answer extraction, its novelty is somewhat limited. Although the experimental results are promising, the generalizability of this approach to other scenarios remains uncertain, partly because the task itself appears somewhat artificial.
