This submission explores a fascinating topic; however, it falls short of being persuasive due to significant shortcomings. Notably, the experimental component lacks robustness. To bolster the study, it would be beneficial to incorporate not only widely recognized datasets within the community but also those that are less commonly tackled by deep learning methods. Furthermore, the comparison with existing approaches is incomplete, which diminishes the overall impact of the research.
