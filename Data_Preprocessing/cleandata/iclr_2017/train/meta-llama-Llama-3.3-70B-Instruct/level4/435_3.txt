This manuscript presents an approach to accelerate convergence by introducing abrupt increases in learning rates that are otherwise decreasing monotonically. The authors clearly outline several techniques and propose a parameterized method, which they evaluate using the CIFAR task. The underlying concept is straightforward, and the selection of state-of-the-art models effectively demonstrates the algorithm's performance. The significance of these findings extends beyond image classification.
Strengths:
- The method offers a straightforward and effective means of enhancing convergence.
- The evaluation is well-conducted on a widely recognized database.
Weaknesses:
- The link between the introduction and the paper's main topic could be more clearly established.
- Figures 2, 4, and 5 are difficult to interpret due to lines extending beyond boundaries; presenting only the optimal settings for T0 and Tmult might improve clarity. Additionally, the baseline appears not to converge.
Suggestions:
Including a loss surface plot for T0 versus Tmult would provide valuable insight. Furthermore, investigating the relationship between network depth and the method's performance would enrich the analysis, offering deeper understanding and broader applicability.
