This paper presents a novel perspective on hierarchical feature representations within deep neural networks, offering a well-justified argument for refining representations that aligns with the proven effectiveness of recent architectures such as ResNets.
Strengths of the paper include:
- A compelling motivation for the success of ResNets and Highway networks, providing insight into their effectiveness.
- A thorough and persuasive analysis and evaluation that supports the proposed viewpoint.
However, there are a couple of areas that could be improved:
- The significant impact of the interpretation of batch-normalization is only touched upon briefly and warrants a more detailed exploration.
- The paper would benefit from an explanation of the findings in Zeiler & Fergus (2014) through the lens of the UIE viewpoint, which is currently lacking.
Additionally, a minor correction is needed:
- In line 223, the sentence should read "that it is valid" to ensure grammatical accuracy and clarity.
