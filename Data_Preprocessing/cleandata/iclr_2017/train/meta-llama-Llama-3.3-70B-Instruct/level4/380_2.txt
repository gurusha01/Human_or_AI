The authors propose a novel approach to modify the objective of generative adversarial networks, enabling the discriminator to accurately recover density information about the underlying data distribution. Through their derivation, they demonstrate that the standard GAN setup does not guarantee discriminator stability, but this can be achieved by introducing an additional entropy regularization term.
The paper is well-structured and clearly written, with a thorough theoretical derivation. The introduction of the additional regularization term appears valid and is well-explained. The empirical experiments support the claim that the proposed modified objective yields a more effective discriminator. However, there are a few areas that require improvement:
- Although the presentation is generally clear, the distinction between the energy-based view of training GANs and the standard GAN approach is not immediately apparent, particularly in the initial sections 3.1 and 3.2. It would be beneficial to explicitly state these connections at the outset and provide additional explanation for the implementation of c(), potentially in the Appendix or in the experimental section.
- The proposed method, by design, solely enhances the generator and does not necessarily improve the stability of GAN training. As the authors do not claim this, it would be prudent to clarify this point early in the paper to avoid potential misinterpretation, especially given the comparison to Salimans et al. in the Inception score experiment.
- While the experiments are well-designed, they primarily provide qualitative results, with the exception of the table in the Appendix for the toy datasets. Considering the challenges in evaluating GANs, it would be valuable to conduct additional quantitative experiments to assess discriminator performance, such as evaluating the discriminator's ability to separate real and fake examples, its robustness to injected noise, or the suitability of the learned features for auxiliary tasks like object classification.
- A major concern is the lack of description of the generator and discriminator architectures used in the experiments. Although the code will be made available, a brief description of the energy function used should be included in the paper, potentially in the Appendix, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the methodology.
