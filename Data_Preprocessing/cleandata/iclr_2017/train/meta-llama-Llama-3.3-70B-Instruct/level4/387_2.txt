This paper explores a straightforward modification of Gatys et al.'s CNN-based approach to texture descriptors for image generation. The method employs the empirical intra-channel correlation matrix of CNN feature responses at a specific deep network layer as a texture descriptor, similar to Gatys et al. However, it differs by incorporating a shift between correlated feature responses to capture longer-range correlations, resulting in a minor adjustment to the original architecture.
The concept is straightforward yet yields intriguing effects on the generated textures and has potential applications beyond translation transformations. Although longer-range correlations could be accounted for by utilizing deeper CNN features in the original Gatys et al. method, the authors demonstrate that explicitly modeling them using shallower features is more effective, which is a reasonable finding.
A notable limitation of this work, shared with many of its counterparts, is the absence of a systematic quantitative evaluation protocol, leaving the assessment of the approach largely subjective. While this should not be considered a major flaw due to the inherent challenges of addressing this open issue, it is somewhat restrictive that no rigorous evaluation method was developed and implemented. The authors propose a potential evaluation method based on a classification task as future work, which is an interesting approach worthy of further exploration.
