This paper presents a novel approach to feature extraction using a group sparse auto-encoder, which is then integrated with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to enhance question sentence representation for question answering (QA) tasks. 
The strengths of this paper include:
- The introduction of the group-sparse auto-encoder, a concept that appears to be innovative.
- The comprehensive experimental evaluation on QA tasks, which provides a thorough assessment of the proposed method.
However, there are several weaknesses:
- The proposed idea builds upon existing work in a somewhat incremental manner.
- The writing quality could be improved for better clarity and readability.
- The absence of ablation studies limits the understanding of the proposed approach's effectiveness.
Furthermore, the author's justification for the baseline comparison is not entirely convincing. While separate training stages for CNN+SGL are acceptable for comparison purposes, the goal should be to validate and analyze the superiority of the proposed SGA over group lasso. For instance, it would be beneficial to investigate whether joint training enhances performance or if the proposed group-sparse regularization outperforms the l_21 norm. Unfortunately, the current experimental design does not provide insight into these aspects.
