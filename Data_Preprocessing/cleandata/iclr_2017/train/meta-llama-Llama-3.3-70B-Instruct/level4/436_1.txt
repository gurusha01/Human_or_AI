This paper introduces a novel end-to-end neural network architecture for designing natural language interfaces to database queries, leveraging weak supervision signals to learn model parameters. Unlike traditional methods that rely on semantic parsing and logical form execution, the proposed approach directly maps natural language queries to final answers through database processing. This is facilitated by formulating database operations as continuous processes, with distributions learned using soft attention mechanisms. The model's efficacy is demonstrated on the WikiTableQuestions dataset, although a single model underperforms traditional semantic parsing techniques; an ensemble of 15 models achieves comparable results to state-of-the-art performance.
The proposed solution is an intriguing extension of previous models, such as Neelakantan 2016, and addresses the challenging problem of natural language interface learning for databases. However, the experimental section is limited, with evaluations conducted solely on a small dataset. Further ablation studies and comparisons to more advanced memory-augmented neural networks would strengthen the paper.
Several concerns need to be addressed. The model's details, particularly in Section 2.1, are overly complex and lack clarity, making replication without accompanying code extremely difficult. The authors should provide a more detailed explanation of discrete operation modeling, as well as the roles of the "row selector," "scalar answer," and "lookup answer." Moreover, the approach's scalability is questionable, as it performs full attention over the entire database; experimenting with larger datasets would help alleviate these concerns and demonstrate the model's feasibility for huge databases with millions of rows.
