The authors present a skillfully designed approach to leveraging sparsity in convolutional layers of a deep network, effectively reformulating it as a sparse matrix-vector multiplication problem. This yields significant performance gains, and the accompanying analysis provides valuable insights for practitioners on the feasibility of this method. However, my primary reservation regarding this paper is that its contribution to the research landscape appears somewhat limited, as it primarily focuses on performance optimization and comparative evaluations rather than groundbreaking research. Ultimately, it is the responsibility of the area chairs to determine the suitability of such a paper for inclusion in ICLR.
