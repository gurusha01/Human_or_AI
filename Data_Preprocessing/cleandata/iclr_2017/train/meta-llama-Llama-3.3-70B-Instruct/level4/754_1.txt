This manuscript proposes an enhanced neural language model tailored for capturing long-term dependencies, specifically designed to accurately predict the next identifier in dynamic programming languages like Python. The model's improvements are achieved through two key modifications:
1) The replacement of fixed-window attention with a pointer network, where the memory comprises context representations of the preceding K identifiers, encompassing the entire history.
2) The integration of a conventional neural LSTM-based language model with a sparse pointer network, mediated by a controller that dynamically weighs the predictions from both components based on the input, hidden state, and context representations at each time stamp.
This approach eliminates the need for large attention window sizes to predict subsequent identifiers, a common requirement for modeling long-term dependencies in programming languages. The paper's experiments, utilizing a Python codebase (another notable contribution), provide partial validation for this model.
Although the paper lacks certain crucial details, such as an analysis of how the sparse pointer network's performance varies with different K sizes, its computational efficiency during training and inference compared to LSTM with attention across various window sizes, and ablation studies quantifying the contributions of modifications (1) and (2), it may still be of interest to the ICLR community and worthy of acceptance.
