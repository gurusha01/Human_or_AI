Update: I appreciate the authors' response, and after considering their comments, my assessment remains unchanged, with the rating remaining the same.
This manuscript presents a domain adaptation method for time series data, which primarily combines variational recurrent neural networks with adversarial domain adaptation, specifically applied at the final time step.
Strengths:
1. The authors address a highly relevant application of domain adaptation, demonstrating its significance.
2. The paper is well-structured and clear, making it accessible to readers.
3. The empirical evaluation is thorough, comparing the proposed method to several state-of-the-art domain adaptation techniques across multiple datasets.
Weaknesses:
1. The approach lacks substantial novelty, essentially being a direct integration of existing techniques without significant innovation.
2. The manuscript fails to provide a compelling rationale for the chosen combination of variational recurrent neural networks and adversarial domain adaptation (specifically, RevGrad), leaving unanswered whether similar performance could be achieved by refining and carefully adjusting existing methods like R-DANN.
Additional Observations:
1. The discussion in Section 4.4 is unconvincing, as the visualization of firing patterns does not convincingly support the proposed method's efficacy.
2. Figure 1(c) appears suspicious, as it is unlikely that t-SNE would produce such a remarkably regular structure from real, non-degenerate data.
In summary, while the paper is solid, its suitability for the ICLR standard is questionable due to its limited novelty and other mentioned concerns.
