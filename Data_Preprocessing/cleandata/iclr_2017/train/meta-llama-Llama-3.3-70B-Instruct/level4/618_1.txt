This paper proposes an enhanced CNN formulation that decouples geometric transformations from intrinsic features, enabling the network to estimate filter transformations based on input images. 
The research is grounded in a robust technical framework and driven by a logical justification. However, the practical significance of this work raises several concerns:
(1) The approach assumes that input images undergo transformations belonging to a specific Lie group (locally). It is unclear whether such transformations pose significant real-world challenges, given that state-of-the-art CNNs (e.g., ResNet) already demonstrate considerable robustness to local deformations. The potential benefits of incorporating these components into existing architectures are not clearly demonstrated, and the limited experimental evaluation on Cifar-10 fails to provide compelling evidence.
(2) The computational overhead of this method is not adequately addressed.
