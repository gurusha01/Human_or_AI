The authors tackle the challenge of modeling temporal signal changes on a graph, where each node's signal evolves based on its neighborhood's inputs and hidden states, with the neighborhood size being a hyperparameter. Their approach builds upon Shi et al.'s 2015 work, extending it to arbitrary graph structures using Defferrard et al.'s 2016 graph convolutions, although this generalization has limitations due to the loss of directionality inherent in the original convolutional kernels. The authors demonstrate their model's performance on moving MNIST and the Penn Tree Bank Language Modeling task.
While the paper, model, and experiments are satisfactory, several concerns arise:
1. From a technical standpoint, the proposed model lacks significant novelty. Typically, this would be acceptable if compensated by rigorous experimental evaluation, clear exposition, and insightful discussions on the model's advantages and disadvantages relative to prior work. However, this balance seems to be lacking in the present case.
2. The experimental results section is concise but lacks depth in interpretation. Given the Penn Tree Bank's status as a highly competitive and well-known benchmark, it is surprising to see only a comparison to Zaremba et al.'s 2014 results, whereas multiple other relevant studies should be considered.
3. The writing could be improved in terms of clarity, and the authors do not adequately compare their model to others or provide meaningful insights into its strengths and weaknesses. For instance, the neighborhood's influence on word probabilities in the graph is not clearly defined, including the graph's width. It is unclear how information propagates across the graph or how the model achieves reasonable performance on moving MNIST despite being unable to discern edge direction. The authors acknowledge this limitation but fail to offer a convincing explanation for how their model overcomes it, such as how a pixel determines when to activate in the next frame. More thorough consideration and clearer presentation of these aspects would be beneficial.
In summary, the paper's technical contribution is somewhat limited, the experiments lack thoroughness, and the provided insights are sparse, which collectively detract from the overall quality of the submission.
