This manuscript presents an alternative formulation of Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA) that incorporates rank constraints as a regularization term in the objective function. However, the writing lacks clarity, and the focus oscillates between estimating "causal factors", nonlinear dimensionality reduction, KPCA, and ill-posed inverse problems. The reformulation of KPCA relies on standard techniques, but it is unclear what advantages the proposed approach offers over existing methods, as there is no theoretical analysis or empirical comparison with state-of-the-art techniques.
The concept of "causal factors" is introduced in the abstract and problem formulation on page 3 without a clear definition or discussion, leaving its meaning ambiguous. In the context of KPCA, the motivation behind finding a pre-image for each data point, as outlined in step (iii) on page 2, is unclear.
The authors highlight two key limitations of existing KPCA approaches. The first limitation, regarding the low-dimensional manifold assumption, has been extensively addressed in the machine learning literature, where it is common to assume that data lies near, rather than on, a low-dimensional manifold. The second limitation, related to finding a pre-image for each projection in the input space, is not a standard step in KPCA and lacks clarity.
On page 3, the notation $\mathcal{X} \times N$, $\mathcal{Y} \times N$, and $\mathcal{H} \times N$ is unclear, and it is assumed that it implies N-tuples, rather than Cartesian products. Additionally, the statement $\mathcal{Y} \ll \mathcal{X}$ is unclear, as $\mathcal{X}$ and $\mathcal{Y}$ are defined as sets. The symbol $\mathcal{S}^n$ is introduced on page 5 without definition.
The experimental section lacks comparison with standard algorithms for matrix completion, such as OptSpace or SVT. Furthermore, there is no comparison with existing approaches for non-rigid structure from motion. The proof of Theorem 3.1 is unclear, specifically the step from (16) to (17), which allegedly uses the Holder inequality. The application of the orthonormal constraints to simplify the sum of fourth powers of weights $w_{ij}$ is not evident, and additional details are necessary to follow the argument.
