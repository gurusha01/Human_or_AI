Update: I appreciate the authors' response, which has led me to revise my assessment and increase the rating.
This manuscript presents a novel convolution operation designed for a wide range of graph structures. By utilizing random walks to determine a set of neighbors for each node (ordered by expected visit frequency), the graph is effectively transformed into a feature matrix analogous to the im2col output in MATLAB or Caffe. Consequently, the convolution operation is reduced to a matrix multiplication.
While the proposed convolution variant appears plausible, I remain unconvinced by the empirical evaluation. Notably, the MNIST experiment raises concerns. I question the suitability of this dataset for demonstrating the method's efficacy, as the authors must remove crucial structural information (relative pixel locations) to apply their approach, thereby artificially increasing the task's complexity. Furthermore, the comparison with traditional CNNs yields underwhelming results, with the proposed method failing to achieve acceptable accuracy on this dataset.
To justify the inclusion of MNIST or similar datasets in the experimental section, I suggest that the authors modify their method to incorporate additional graph structure (e.g., relative node locations) when the node relationships cannot be fully captured by a similarity matrix.
In its current form, I believe the manuscript is not ready for publication but may be resubmitted to a workshop or future conference after addressing the aforementioned concerns.
