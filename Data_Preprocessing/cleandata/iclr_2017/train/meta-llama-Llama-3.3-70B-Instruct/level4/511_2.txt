Approximating solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs) using neural network (NN) approximators poses significant challenges. Specifically, the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) and Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) equations typically exhibit discontinuous and non-differentiable solutions, rendering them particularly difficult to tackle, except in cases where the underlying process is a diffusion, which introduces smoothing through the Ito term, a scenario not explored in this paper. Furthermore, a small PDE residual does not necessarily translate to a well-performing policy, as highlighted by previous work (e.g., Tsitsiklis, Beard, Todorov, among others), which is not adequately cited in this submission. 
The inclusion of 2D toy examples is insufficient to demonstrate the scalability and potential impact of the proposed approach. It remains unclear what justification exists for expecting this method to generalize to more complex, practically relevant problems. 
Additionally, the manuscript contains numerous typos, such as "Range-Kutta", which detract from its overall quality. 
Most critically, this paper appears to be misplaced in the current venue. The absence of learned representations, instead relying solely on a neural network, diverges from the focus of ICLR. A more suitable platform for this work would be conferences like ACC, ADPRL, or CDC, where control-oriented research is more prominently featured. 
Although this review may seem abrupt, it stems from a genuine enthusiasm for the research direction undertaken. To garner significant attention, it is essential to apply this methodology to more demanding control problems, thereby showcasing its potential and impact.
