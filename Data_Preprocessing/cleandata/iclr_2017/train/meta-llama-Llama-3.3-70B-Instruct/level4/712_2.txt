The authors present a recurrent neural network-based approach for developing a stochastic volatility model tailored to financial time series analysis. They develop an inference network, leveraging a recurrent neural network, which calculates an approximation of the posterior distribution of latent variables based on historical data. This variational approximation is utilized to maximize the marginal likelihood, thereby facilitating the learning of model parameters. The efficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated through experiments involving both synthetic and real-world time series data, where it exhibits superior performance compared to traditional parametric GARCH models and a Gaussian process volatility model.

The proposed methodology appears to be technically sound, although a notable exception is observed in equation (19), where the inference model is essentially performing filtering rather than smoothing. Specifically, the posterior distribution for \(zt'\) is conditioned solely on the preceding \(zt\) and \(x_t\) values at time \(t\), indicating a dependence on past observations without incorporating future data points for enhanced estimation accuracy.
