The authors introduce a methodology for extracting datasets, a corresponding dataset, and preliminary yet intriguing findings on the application of machine learning to higher-order logic theorem proving. Notably, the experimental outcomes demonstrate a strong baseline performance, with an accuracy exceeding 0.83 in relevance classification, significantly surpassing random chance. This promising start warrants further investigation in this area. The manuscript is commendable in its clarity of presentation and argumentation, leaving minimal scope for improvement. Additionally, the discussion of related work appears comprehensive, although it is worth acknowledging that my expertise lies outside the specific domain of automated theorem proving.
