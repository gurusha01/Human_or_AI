This manuscript introduces a novel approach to program generation, wherein a neural network is trained to estimate a fixed set of attributes that subsequently guide a search procedure, rather than directly generating the program. This methodology is intriguing and logical, given the complexity of constructing a generative model for programs.
The experimental section demonstrates faster computation times compared to baseline methods, including DFS and Enumeration, in a setup involving small programs with up to 5 instructions. However, it remains unclear how this approach will scale to larger programs, potentially with numerous active attributes, and whether its advantages will persist.
The authors employ the time required to find a single program that executes correctly for a given set of 5 input-output pairs as their metric. Nevertheless, as acknowledged in the paper, the ultimate goal is often to identify the optimal program or a ranked list of programs that yield correct execution, rather than just any program.
It would be beneficial to see experiments conducted in this more realistic setting, assessing the usefulness and challenges of the proposed approach. Furthermore, in the second experiment, where program lengths during training and testing differ, results are only presented for scenarios where 20% of programs are completed. It would be valuable to provide results for the case where all programs are found.
A thorough analysis of the results is lacking, including the types of programs that pose difficulties, the frequency and impact of neural network errors on speed, and the failure modes of the proposed method. The use of a fixed-length representation for each input-output pair, combined with average pooling to obtain the final representation, raises questions about the suitability of average pooling in this context. An alternative approach might involve combining predictions at the decoder stage rather than the encoder.
The idea of learning from only 5 executions appears challenging, particularly for longer and more complex programs. While this setting might be acceptable for small programs, it seems less reasonable for more demanding tasks.
In conclusion, this is an interesting paper that tackles a problem outside my area of expertise, and as such, I may have overlooked important aspects.
