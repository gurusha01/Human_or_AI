This study suggests utilizing gradient visualization to gain deeper insights into the significance of features, such as pixels, in visual classification tasks. While the presented visualizations are noteworthy, the methodology appears to be somewhat informal. The authors fail to provide a clear rationale for why standard gradient visualization does not accurately reflect the importance of features pertinent to a specific visual category, instead proceeding directly to the interior gradient approach without adequate justification.
A specific concern arises when considering regular gradients at features that constitute the spatial support of the visual class. It is unclear whether the gradients of features that are confident in their predictions remain relatively low, whereas those with high uncertainty exhibit strong gradients, and this relationship warrants further exploration.
Regarding the interior gradients, the impact of the scaling parameter Î± on feature importance and its connection to attention mechanisms is not well-defined. Furthermore, it remains unclear whether this model employs batch normalization, which could have significant implications for its performance and interpretability.
