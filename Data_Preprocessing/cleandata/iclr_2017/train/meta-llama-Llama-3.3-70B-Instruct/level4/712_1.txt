The authors present a novel approach to modeling volatility in financial time series using a recurrent variational neural network, which applies the VRNN model proposed by Chung et al. (2015) to volatility forecasting. This involves utilizing a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) structure at each time step of the series, effectively creating a recurrent architecture.
The paper is well-structured and clear, although a thorough spelling check is recommended to address the minor typos present throughout. 
The primary technical contribution of the paper lies in its implementation of a dual-level recurrence, one for the latent process and another for the observables, which appears to be a new, albeit minor, contribution to the field. More significantly, the paper's methodological contribution has the potential to make a substantial impact, particularly in areas of time series modeling that are crucial for practical applications and have traditionally relied on rigid functional forms. Demonstrating the applicability and usefulness of general-purpose non-linear models for volatility forecasting could be highly influential.
Several comments and concerns regarding the paper are worth noting:
1) The authors' framework seems to focus on one-timestep-ahead forecasts of volatility, without explicitly addressing the potential for longer-horizon forecasts, which are essential for various applications, such as derivative pricing. A discussion on how to extend the model for longer-horizon forecasts would be valuable.
2) The statement in Section 4.4 that a GARCH(1,1) model is conditionally deterministic is accurate only for one-time-step-ahead forecasts. For longer horizons, the GARCH(1,1) volatility forecast is not deterministic.
3) Initially, the experimental validation seemed limited, relying solely on a comparison with a baseline GARCH model. However, the revised version includes additional comparisons, enhancing the quality of the results. Nevertheless, the models used for comparison are not state-of-the-art. Utilizing R packages like 'stochvol' and 'fGarch' to implement a variety of models could provide more convincing evidence of the proposed model's superiority over existing approaches in the finance literature.
4) Section 5.2 would benefit from more detailed information about the network architecture, including the number of hidden units and the embedding dimension D_E (mentioned in Section 5.4).
5) Section 5.3 requires more details about the data generating process used for the synthetic data experiments.
6) Some results in the appendix are puzzling, such as the model's reaction to jumps in the price series, where volatility should spike, but instead, the model exhibits huge drops in volatility (Figure 4(b) and (c), around time steps 1300 and 1600). This phenomenon warrants explanation and discussion.
Overall, the paper provides a valuable contribution to the field of volatility modeling, despite some flaws. It serves as a starting point for the broader application of neural time series processing in the financial community, with the potential for significant impact.
