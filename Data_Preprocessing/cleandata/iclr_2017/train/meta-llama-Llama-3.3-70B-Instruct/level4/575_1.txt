This paper's contribution is unclear to me. The Deep CCA method, as established by Andrew et al. in 2013, already provides the gradient derivation of the correlation objective with respect to network outputs, which is then used for back-propagation to update network weights. The current paper also derives the gradient of the correlation objective, specifically the CCA objective, with respect to the network outputs. Therefore, it is perplexing when the authors claim that their differentiable formulation allows for direct back-propagation through the CCA computation, as this capability seems to already exist.
