This paper tackles a significant issue, specifically enhancing diversity in responses, and it is commendable that the authors demonstrate its applicability across various tasks through their results.
However, I have identified two key limitations at this stage:
1) The reported improvements, which are largely consistent across all tasks, appear to be relatively modest and do not substantially support the overarching claims made in the paper.
2) The proposed approach seems somewhat arbitrary, and it is unclear whether it has the potential for broad adoption. While the core idea behind the suggested solution is intriguing, it appears to be somewhat ahead of its time and requires further development.
