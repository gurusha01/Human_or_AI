This paper presents a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) model, termed Variational Lossy Autoencoder, which is designed to selectively discard irrelevant information to learn meaningful global data representations, essentially functioning as a lossy compression algorithm. The authors achieve this by integrating VAEs with neural autoregressive models, resulting in a model that combines a latent variable structure with a powerful recurrence structure.
Initially, the authors provide an insightful interpretation of VAEs through the lens of Bits-Back, elucidating when and how the latent code is disregarded. Consistent with existing literature, they note that the autoregressive component of the model often explains the data's structure, rendering the latent variables redundant. To address this, the authors propose two complementary strategies to ensure the utilization of latent variables by the decoder. The first approach involves restricting the autoregressive decoder to a small local receptive field, necessitating the model to leverage the latent code for learning long-range dependencies. The second approach entails parameterizing the prior distribution over the latent code using an autoregressive model.
The paper also reports novel state-of-the-art results on several datasets, including binarized MNIST (under both dynamic and static binarization), OMNIGLOT, and Caltech-101 Silhouettes.
A notable contribution of this work is the Bits-Back interpretation of VAE, which offers valuable insights into the model's behavior and potential avenues for improvement. The ability to exert fine-grained control over the information included in the learned representation is particularly useful in various applications, such as image retrieval, where it could facilitate the retrieval of objects with similar shapes regardless of their textures.
However, the authors propose two classes of improvements to VAE: the lossy code via explicit information placement and learning the prior with autoregressive flow. Nonetheless, they do not provide an evaluation of a VAE without an autoregressive flow prior but with a PixelCNN decoder, leaving unclear the impact on the latent code when such a prior is not used. Furthermore, the definition of WindowAround(i) and its relationship to x_{i} lacks clarity, warranting further explanation to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the model's components and their interactions.
