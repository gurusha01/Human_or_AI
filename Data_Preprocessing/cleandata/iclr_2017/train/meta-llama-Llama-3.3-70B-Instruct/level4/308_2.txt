This manuscript offers a significant advancement in elucidating the training process of generative adversarial networks (GANs). By shedding new light on the training dynamics of GANs and their variants, the authors elucidate the underlying causes of vanishing or unstable gradients in the original GAN and its variants, respectively. Notably, they propose a novel approach to mitigate these challenges by incorporating perturbations, which has the potential to stimulate more rigorous research in this area.
The introduction of a perturbation technique to stabilize gradient behavior is particularly intriguing, as it bears resemblance to the dropout method, where perturbations can be conceptualized as being derived from a Bernoulli distribution. An exploration of this connection would be a valuable addition. To further substantiate the efficacy of this technique, it would be beneficial to include empirical evidence. The inclusion of additional experiments, analogous to Figures 2 and 3, to compare the performance of the perturbed GAN would provide insightful comparisons and enhance the manuscript's robustness.
