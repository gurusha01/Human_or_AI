This paper proposes a linear pipeline All-reduce approach for parallelizing neural networks across multiple GPUs, accompanied by both theoretical analysis and experimental results. While the presented results are intriguing, the overall quality of the writing could be enhanced. 
Several key points warrant attention:
- The comparison of the proposed approach with alternative methods demonstrates its strong performance, but it remains unclear whether the observed improvements stem from the approach itself or its implementation details.
- The paper's clarity and readability could be significantly improved, particularly in the introduction and Section 3, where more intuitive explanations of the proposed approach would be beneficial. Additionally, addressing typos and incorporating missing references would enhance the manuscript's overall quality.
- A critical examination of Section 3.2 reveals a discrepancy between the claimed communication cost advantages of the linear pipeline approach over Broadcast and Minimum Spanning Tree (BE and MST) methods and the actual analysis provided. Specifically, the proposition and analysis do not support the claim of the linear pipeline being approximately 2x and log p faster than BE and MST, respectively. Instead, the inequality presented in Eq (2) suggests that the linear pipeline cannot achieve a speedup of 2x and log p times over these methods. A more accurate interpretation of the results would involve stating that the ratio of TbroadcaseBE to TbroadcaseLP is greater than 1 as n approaches infinity, rather than less than 2, to correctly convey the relationship between these methods without implying an upper bound on TbroadcaseLP.
- To further motivate the research, it would be valuable to highlight the distinctions between designing parallel algorithms for CPUs versus GPUs, emphasizing how these differences justify the need for the proposed approach.
