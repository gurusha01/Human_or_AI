This manuscript introduces a novel approach to accelerate optimization in the vicinity of saddle points by introducing a repulsive force from the current parameter vector to a running average of recent parameter values, demonstrating faster optimization than various existing methods across multiple datasets and architectures.
At first glance, the proposed method bears a strong resemblance to momentum, and it would be highly beneficial to create a concise diagram highlighting the distinction between the two and the potential advantages of the proposed method near saddle points. The comparison of optimization speeds, although illustrative, is not as insightful as a conceptual diagram that elucidates a critical scenario where the proposed method outperforms momentum in a qualitatively significant manner.
An alternative approach to elucidate the relationship with momentum would involve deriving a form for $Rt(f)$ that yields the exact momentum update, facilitating a direct comparison with the $Rt(f)$ utilized in the proposed method.
The notation $\phi(W,W)$, among others, is overly general and could be omitted, as Equation 8 sufficiently conveys the necessary information.
The theoretical framework, encompassing Equation 1 and Theorem 1, appears irrelevant in the absence of a specified joint density and could be removed.
From an experimental standpoint, standardizing the results to facilitate comparisons with other methods would be valuable. For instance, recreating Figure 4 from Dauphin et al., but incorporating the proposed method instead of SFN, would provide a clear demonstration of the proposed method's capability to escape situations where momentum fails.
The core idea presented in this manuscript holds significant potential value, but it necessitates more rigorous comparisons and a clearer delineation of its relationship to momentum and other existing work to fully realize its impact.
