This paper proposes a layered architecture that utilizes a single parameter to modulate the output response of each layer, either amplifying or attenuating it. The authors demonstrate that this design facilitates the optimization of deep networks by enabling the effortless learning of identity mappings within layers, which in turn enhances gradient propagation to lower layers, thereby providing more effective supervision.
The introduction of the SDI metric reveals that gated residual networks exhibit a notable advantage in learning identity mappings compared to alternative architectures. 
While the paper presents sound theoretical justification, the experimental results for the learned k values do not appear to robustly substantiate the theoretical framework, as the learned k values are predominantly very small and exhibit minimal variation across layers. Furthermore, the experimental validation of the approach is limited, with reported performance metrics and the number of large-scale experiments being somewhat underwhelming.
