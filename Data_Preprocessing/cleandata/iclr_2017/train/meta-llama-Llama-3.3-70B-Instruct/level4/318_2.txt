This manuscript introduces an innovative approach to dialog representation by learning a graph-based memory on the fly, initially evaluated on the bAbI tasks. The graph learning process is integrated into the inference stage, complemented by long-term representation learning for graph transformation parameters and sentence encoding. Notably, this work pioneers the implementation of a differentiable graph-based memory, offering a more complex yet potentially powerful framework compared to preceding methods like memory networks, despite currently lacking significant performance gains on bAbI tasks. Although clarity was initially a concern, the revised version demonstrates substantial improvement, making the paper more accessible. The originality, technical accuracy, and thought-provoking nature of this work render it worthy of publication.
The initial findings do not yet conclusively determine whether the sophisticated graph-based differentiable memory surpasses other approaches in terms of learning or generalization capabilities. While the performance on bAbI tasks is comparable to state-of-the-art memory networks, it remains inferior to traditional rule induction methods, highlighting the need for further investigation to fully realize the potential of this novel approach.
