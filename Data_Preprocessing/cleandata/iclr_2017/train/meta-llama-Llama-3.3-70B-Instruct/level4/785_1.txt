This manuscript proposes a novel neural network framework and training methodology for forecasting vehicle speed multiple seconds ahead, leveraging video and vehicle state data as inputs. The proposed architecture enables multiple recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to compete in making predictions, with only the most accurate prediction receiving backpropagation training at each time step. Initial experimental results indicate that this approach can lead to a reduction in prediction error.
However, the selection process for the best-performing RNN at each time point during testing remains unclear. Specifically, the method used to obtain the "integrated prediction" in Figure 7 is not explicitly stated. Is the prediction selected based on the minimum error across all output layers? If so, this would imply that the prediction can only be made after the actual value to be predicted is already known.
It is conceivable that a larger, more generic RNN could potentially yield accurate predictions. As understood, the competitive architectures presented have a significantly larger number of parameters compared to the baseline. It is uncertain whether the improved performance is attributable to the competitive scheme itself or merely the result of a larger model.
To substantiate the claim that this scheme effectively extracts driver intentions, considerable additional research is necessary. It would be intriguing to investigate whether the proposed scheme, with suitable extensions, can automatically distinguish between intentions such as stopping at a stop sign versus slowing down but not stopping due to a preceding vehicle, or passing a vehicle versus changing lanes. The inclusion of labels in the dataset could facilitate a more straightforward comparison.
More broadly, driver intention appears to be closely related to the immediate goals being pursued. There exists a substantial body of work in inverse reinforcement learning that explores this issue, including some studies focused on driving styles.
