This manuscript proposes an on-policy approach for forecasting future intrinsic metrics, with all experiments conducted within the vizDoom environment. Rather than solely predicting outcomes such as win/loss or score, the authors' model is trained to predict a sequence of triplets comprising health, ammunition, and frags, which are weighted by a sequence of input "goal" triplets. By adjusting the weights of these goal triplets, the model can guide exploration, and at test time, actions can be selected to maximize long-term goals.
The results are noteworthy, with the model emerging as the winner of the 2016 vizDoom competition. The experimental section appears robust, featuring comparisons between the proposed method, denoted as DFP, and other approaches including A3C, DQN, as well as an attempt to compare with DSR, a similar recent approach. DFP demonstrates superior performance to other methods or matches their performance when they reach an optimum, as observed with A3C in scenario D1. Additionally, an ablation study supports the utility of the added complexity in the paper's model.
The domains of predicting intrinsic motivation, auxiliary variables, and forward modeling are well-established within reinforcement learning, with foundational work such as that by Singh et al. in 2004. The version of the manuscript reviewed (December 4th revision) adequately references prior work, although the bibliography may not be entirely exhaustive.
Several minor suggestions for improvement in the manuscript's form are noted:
- The description of Doom as a 3D environment may be misleading, as it is essentially a 2D environment presented in a pseudo-3D format, with height not being a significant dimension for action or discrimination.
- The use of "P" in equation (2) and subsequent equations may cause confusion, as it represents prediction rather than probability, contrary to common notation practices.
- The dual use of "j" in equation (6), despite differences in font, could potentially lead to confusion.
- The tables presenting results could benefit from repeating the units of measurement, particularly in Table 1 where measurements are heterogeneous.
In conclusion, this paper is considered a clear accept. While one might argue for the need for experiments in diverse environments or question the novelty, the manuscript's sound experimental design, focus on reproducibility as evidenced by the detailed appendix, and its achievement as a vizDoom winner, support its publication as a significant contribution to the field.
