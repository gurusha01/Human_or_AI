This paper presents a novel approach by incorporating geometrical structure into a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) through combination with a Scattering network, which enhances stability and performance in limited-data scenarios. The manuscript is well-structured, and the integration of Scattering and CNNs constitutes a fresh contribution with promising outcomes. This work fills a significant gap in the Scattering literature, making it more applicable to practical scenarios.
It would be beneficial for the authors to examine the impact of stable bottom layers on adversarial examples, a task that can be accomplished relatively easily using tools like CleverHans or DeepFool. Investigating whether the stability of the first layer in hybrid architectures substantially enhances robustness would be particularly insightful, as it could indicate a relationship between these fooling images and low-level geometry. Conversely, finding no such relationship would also be noteworthy.
Additionally, the proposed architecture's evaluation on actual limited data problems would further substantiate the claim of improved generalization. Although the difference between Cifar-100 and Cifar-10 results is already a promising indicator, real-world small-data problem assessment is necessary. Addressing either of these points with an additional experiment would warrant an increase in my score from 6 to 7.
Key points:
+ The approach presented is intriguing and potentially beneficial for real-world scenarios with limited data.
+ Results on limited data appear promising.
- The investigation of adversarial examples is lacking in the experimental section.
- The absence of evaluation on realistic small-data problems is a limitation.
Minor suggestions:
- Including a state-of-the-art ResNet in Table 3 would be advisable, as NiN is somewhat outdated.
- Correcting typos, such as "tacke," "developping," and "learni," would improve the manuscript's quality.
