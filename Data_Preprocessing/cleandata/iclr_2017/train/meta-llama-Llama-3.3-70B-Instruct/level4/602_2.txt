This paper proposes a novel approach to iteratively re-weight word representations in a document through a straightforward multiplication operation, which also affects the GRU-coded document representation. The authors rightly note that this operation functions as a filter, diminishing attention to less relevant document sections and thereby enhancing model performance.
The paper's results are comparable to or near the state-of-the-art for several Cloze-style QA tasks. To warrant an even higher score, the following limitations should be more effectively addressed:
1. Although the proposed architecture is conceptually simple and interesting, its application is limited to a specific task, despite incurring substantial computational overheads.
2. The incremental improvement of the paper's core idea, gated attention, is relatively modest when comparing GA Reader-- to GA Reader, particularly considering that the latter incorporates various engineering enhancements, such as character embedding, utilization of a word embedding trained on a larger corpus (GloVe), and token-specific attention in equation (5), which collectively contribute to its performance.
3. Further clarification on the role of K (the number of hops) would be beneficial, both in terms of intuitive understanding and empirical analysis. A more in-depth examination of K's impact on different question types could provide valuable insights, and the authors are encouraged to explore this aspect more thoroughly.
