This manuscript examines the comparison between dependency trees and traditional window contexts for learning word vectors, a worthwhile research objective. However, in my opinion, the paper does not provide an exhaustive examination of the topic. Notably, it omits an analysis of GloVe-like objective functions, which have been shown to outperform the algorithms utilized in this study. Furthermore, the paper lacks a direct comparison with other established vectors or models in absolute terms. Ultimately, the work does not yield novel insights that would significantly impact or alter existing research trajectories. Additionally, it neither advances the current state of the art nor contributes new resources that would benefit the research community.
