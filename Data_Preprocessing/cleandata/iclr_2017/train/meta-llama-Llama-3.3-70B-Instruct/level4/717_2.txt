The authors' analysis of trained neural networks involves quantifying the selectivity of individual neurons for various features, such as color and category. 
Strengths:
* The paper is well-written and features clear figures.
* The authors have technically executed their stated goal, with well-chosen indexes for their purposes.
Weaknesses:
* I have reservations about the paper's motivation and usefulness, as it appears to catalog piecemeal facts about neural networks without a larger context. This issue is reminiscent of neurophysiology research, where selectivity distributions are often presented without clear importance or utility. I question the significance of knowing the distribution of color selectivities and whether it constitutes meaningful understanding.
* To enhance the investigation, the authors could have:
  (a) Compared model properties to real neural data, potentially revealing interesting matches or mismatches between models and actual brain function. This comparison could have contributed to the growing literature linking CNNs to visual brain areas.
  (b) Demonstrated that their metrics are prescriptive constraints by imposing them as loss-function criteria on untrained neural networks, potentially leading to the development of useful filters and improved performance. This would have provided a priori reason to care about the chosen property metrics and contributed to unsupervised learning efforts.
* Without such enhancements, the investigation seems to lack direction and significance, echoing my own experiences with similar approaches that have yielded disappointing results. I believe that the community should focus on more substantial and impactful research endeavors.
