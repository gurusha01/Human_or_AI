Summary: This manuscript introduces SqueezeNet, a compact convolutional neural network (CNN) design tailored for embedded systems, which investigates both macroarchitecture and microarchitecture aspects of CNNs and utilizes fire modules as its core component.
Strengths: 
Notably, SqueezeNet achieves a significant reduction in memory usage, approximately 50 times less than AlexNet, while maintaining comparable accuracy levels.
Weaknesses and Areas for Clarification:
The complex bypass mechanism exhibits lower accuracy compared to its simpler counterpart, with the simple bypass resembling the bottleneck structures found in ResNet and the complex bypass drawing parallels with the inception modules in GoogLeNet. This raises the question of whether these SqueezeNet variants can be viewed as adaptations of concepts pioneered in GoogLeNet and ResNet. If this analogy holds, it prompts the inquiry into the existence or potential development of a SqueezeNet-like model that could achieve accuracy on par with that of GoogLeNet and ResNet.
