This paper presents a highly innovative and thought-provoking concept, although its complexity may hinder comprehension. The application of image-generating GANs in a practical context, accompanied by meaningful benchmarks beyond subjective realism, is particularly noteworthy.
Equation 4 is of interest due to the introduction of the potentially non-differentiable black-box function Stego(...) into the training process of (S, G). A clarification is needed on whether backpropagation is performed through the Stego function.
Regarding the train/test split, the decision to train the SGAN on the entire 200k images raises questions. Would it not be more straightforward to utilize the same splits for SGAN training as for steganalysis purposes? This discrepancy might contribute to the sensitivity to random seeds observed in Table 2.
In Section 5.3, the statement suggests that Steganographic Generative Adversarial Networks can serve as a universal tool for generating steganography containers tailored to deceive specific steganalysis algorithms. However, the experiment demonstrating SGAN's ability to fool HUGO lacks clarity on how it was "tuned" to achieve this, or how such tuning could be accomplished for a particular steganalyzer in general.
While the proposed method appears to deceive S, it is essential to acknowledge that in image generation, the discriminator D is rarely fooled. Contemporary GANs do not converge to fooling the discriminator, even when producing samples that occasionally deceive humans. The creation of an additional steganalyzer, S(x) = S(x) * D(x), could pose significant challenges in reliably fooling it, as it demands both realistic image generation and steganalysis evasion.
Despite multiple readings, the paper's description of how to utilize a trained SGAN remains unclear. To enhance the paper's clarity, a step-by-step workflow illustrating how a hypothetical user would employ a trained SGAN should be provided. This explanation should cater to readers unfamiliar with steganography, such as the majority of ICLR attendees, to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the proposed method's application and potential.
