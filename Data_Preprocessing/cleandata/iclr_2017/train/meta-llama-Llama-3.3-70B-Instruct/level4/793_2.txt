This paper suggests utilizing the previous error signal of the output layer as an additional input to the recurrent update function to improve the modeling capabilities of dynamic systems, such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).
However, the paper is based on an incorrect assumption that test label information is readily available, which is not the case in most real-world applications, with the exception of a few. Consequently, the language modeling task, which is the sole experiment presented in this paper, may not be the most suitable task for evaluating this approach. Furthermore, comparing the proposed model to those that do not utilize test error signals during inference is unfair, as it is not a realistic representation of typical prediction scenarios, where test label information is not observable, except in online prediction problems.
The experimental evaluation is limited to a single dataset, where the authors claim to have achieved state-of-the-art results. Nevertheless, this claim is inaccurate, as there are at least four existing papers that report superior results on this task, which are not cited in the manuscript. Although this paper may have been submitted prior to these other works, the manuscript should be updated to reflect the current state of the field before a final decision can be made.
Additionally, the model size is not provided, which makes it challenging to assess the significance of the proposed technique, as the contribution of the method cannot be fully evaluated without this crucial information.
