This paper explores the capability of neural networks to recognize environmental contents through critical features, akin to the human visual system. The authors propose utilizing an Auto-Encoder (AE) to reconstruct low-fidelity visual inputs, and, similar to Mnih et al. (2014), employ a recurrent approach to mimic the sequential behavior of the human visual system.
I find the paper's motivation compelling. Nevertheless, several issues warrant attention:
1. The baselines presented in the paper are overly simplistic. It is unsurprising that nearest neighbor, bilinear, bicubic, and cubic interpolations, which lack a learning component, perform inferiorly to AE-based models. A more meaningful comparison would involve state-of-the-art (STOA) methods, such as
