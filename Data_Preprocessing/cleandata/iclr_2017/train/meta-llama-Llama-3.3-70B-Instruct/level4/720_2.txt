This paper presents a method for learning continuous features from input data comprising multiple categorical variables. The approach involves embedding each category in a low-dimensional continuous space, computing pairwise interactions between categories through component-wise dot product or addition, applying k-max pooling to select the most informative interactions, and repeating this process to obtain the final feature vector. This vector is then used as input to a classifier or regressor to achieve the desired task. The category embeddings are learned using standard methods. The experimental section demonstrates the effectiveness of this procedure in selecting relevant interactions on a synthetic dataset and shows promising results on the iPinYou real-world dataset, outperforming a few simple baselines.
However, my primary concern is that the paper lacks novelty. The concept of embedding categorical data with mixed categories has been previously addressed in the literature, where separate lookup tables are learned for each category class, and inputs are represented by concatenating embeddings from these tables, followed by a non-linear function, typically a deep network. The only marginal contribution here is the explicit modeling of category interactions in equations 2-5. Otherwise, there is little new content in the paper.
Furthermore, I believe that these interactions can be automatically learned by using a deep convolutional network on top of the input embeddings, which raises questions about the usefulness of the proposed contribution. The experimental section is also limited, as it only evaluates the method on a single real-world dataset against weak baselines. A more comprehensive evaluation against state-of-the-art models that handle similar problems, including WSABIE, would be more convincing.
I disagree with the authors' claim that WSABIE is not suitable for their problem. Although the original WSABIE paper focused on image inputs, its training methodology can be easily extended to other datasets, including categorical data. For instance, a model that embeds categorical inputs, concatenates the embeddings, and uses a deep convolutional network on top with margin loss, could potentially perform as well as, if not better than, the hand-coded interaction model proposed in this paper. A comparison against such baselines would be more persuasive, and I believe it is essential to test the proposed model against these alternatives to demonstrate its effectiveness.
