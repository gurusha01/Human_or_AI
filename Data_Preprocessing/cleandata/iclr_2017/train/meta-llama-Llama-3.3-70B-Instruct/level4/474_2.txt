Summary: 
This paper proposes an enhanced self-learning model that extracts compositional rules from Bach's chorales, building upon the authors' previous work by introducing a hierarchical structure in both conceptual and informational dimensions, as well as an adaptive 2-D memory selection assuming a Dirichlet Distribution for feature representation. The model utilizes sonority, represented as a column of 4 MIDI numbers, analogous to a word in a language model, to learn fundamental music theory rules through unigram statistics and higher-order n-grams for part writing characterization. Sonorities are clustered based on feature functions, with significant partitions recognized as rules. The outcome is the generation of two sample syllabi with varying difficulty levels and "satisfactory gaps" based on learned rules.
1. Quality:
 a) Strengths: The exploration of two-dimensional hierarchies enhances the model's cognitive interpretability, while the adaptive memory selection improves learning efficiency.
 b) Weaknesses: The limitation to N<=5 may restrict the model's capacity to capture long-distance musical dependencies. Although the authors mentioned experimenting with N=10, the omission of these results from the paper is notable. Additionally, incorporating a survey of music department students' opinions could strengthen the system's performance evaluation.
2. Clarity:
 a) Advantages: The paper effectively presents an improved automatic music theorist system, clearly interpreting and comparing learned rules with music theory concepts. The use of analogies and examples facilitates reader understanding.
 b) Disadvantages: While detailed definitions are available in the authors' previous MUS-ROVER I papers, a clearer explanation of the optimization process, particularly in Figure 1, would be beneficial. Furthermore, the prime symbol in equation (3) should be subscripted in the "(Conceptual-Hierarchy Filter)" row.
3. Originality:
The paper contributes to the open area of music concept and rule representation through a novel approach, offering an alternative to other interpretable feature learning methods like autoencoders and GANs.
4. Significance:
The provision of corresponding music theory interpretations for the learned rules is a notable aspect. The suggestion to involve music students in the self-learning loop is intriguing, and combining these advantages could enhance music theory teaching and learning practices.
