This paper presents a novel approach to learning hierarchical sentence representations using reinforcement learning, specifically the policy gradient method REINFORCE. The authors propose a neural shift-reduce parser that induces tree structures, which are optimized for a downstream task based on its evaluation metric as the reward. Two settings are explored: one where no structural information is provided, relying solely on downstream task supervision, and another where actions from an external parser supplement the supervision. The method is evaluated across four tasks: sentiment analysis, semantic relatedness, textual entailment, and sentence generation.
The concept of learning tree representations of text tailored for a specific downstream task is intriguing. The paper is well-organized and clearly written. However, the experimental results are not convincing, as the proposed model falls short of state-of-the-art performance in most tasks:
- Sentiment analysis: 86.5% vs. 89.7% (accuracy),
- Semantic relatedness: 0.32 vs. 0.25 (MSE),
- Textual entailment: 80.5% vs. 84.6% (accuracy).
It is challenging to discern whether these outcomes are attributable to the model itself or the reinforcement learning algorithm.
The strengths of the paper include:
- An interesting idea: adapting sentence structures for a downstream task,
- A well-written paper.
However, the weaknesses are:
- The experimental results are weak and do not substantially support the authors' claims.
Some minor comments:
In the introduction's second paragraph, it could be argued that bag-of-words is also a prevalent approach to sentence representation.
Paragraph titles, such as those in section 3.2, should be followed by a period.

UPDATE
Despite the update, the results remain unconvincing, particularly the necessity of combining words in a non-left-to-right manner to achieve state-of-the-art results. Nonetheless, this research direction is promising, and the paper's results show potential. Therefore, I am revising my score from 5 to 6.
