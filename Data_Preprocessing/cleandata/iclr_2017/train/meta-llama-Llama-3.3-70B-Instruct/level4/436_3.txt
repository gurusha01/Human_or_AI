This manuscript presents a novel, weakly supervised end-to-end neural network architecture designed to facilitate a natural language interface for interacting with tables. The proposed model, leveraging the neural programmer, is evaluated on the WikiTableQuestions dataset, a benchmark for natural language question answering, and demonstrates acceptable performance accuracy. Furthermore, an ensemble method is employed, combining model components trained under diverse configurations, which yields an enhancement in performance comparable to that of traditional natural language semantic parsing baselines. Notably, regularization techniques such as dropout and weight decay appear to significantly contribute to the model's efficacy.
Future investigations could benefit from a more in-depth error analysis to elucidate the primary factors contributing to the relatively low accuracy achieved by this approach, especially when compared to other natural language processing tasks. Additionally, it would be insightful to determine the headroom and oracle performance bounds of the current methodology to fully understand its potential and limitations.
