The authors' goal is to investigate the learnability of static analysis. However, as I previously suggested, the complexity of static analysis has been significantly diminished in the toy language, allowing for an overly simplistic solution using basic set logic, which can be readily learned by an LSTM, given a differentiable set object. This oversimplification fails to convince me that the approach can be effectively applied to more realistic and complex static analysis problems.
While LSTMs and deep learning have achieved notable successes in tackling complex, real-world language tasks, it is conceivable that they could also be used to solve static analysis problems. Nevertheless, adopting an overly cautious approach is not the most effective way to explore this possibility.
