The authors introduce a parameterized version of the ELU function, demonstrating its effectiveness in mitigating vanishing gradients in deep neural networks, outperforming existing nonlinear activation functions. Their approach is substantiated through both theoretical examination and empirical verification. 
Notably, the authors provide insightful findings regarding the statistical properties of PELU parameters. Further elucidation on the evolution of these parameters could offer deeper understanding of the proposed nonlinearity. However, the comparative experimental evaluation is somewhat challenging to assess due to discrepancies in parameter counts between the proposed method and other benchmarked approaches.
