This manuscript proposes an enhanced neural network architecture for video frame prediction by incorporating an additional reward-predicting component. The authors demonstrate the model's capability to accurately predict both rewards and subsequent frames in the context of Atari game playing environments.
Strengths:
- The paper is well-structured and concise, making it easily comprehensible.
- The proposed model is straightforward and simple to grasp.
Weaknesses:
- The introduced model offers only incremental improvements over the baseline architecture. Although the authors aim to establish a foundational premise, which they successfully accomplish, this limitation constrains the paper's overall scope.
The presentation of this paper suggests it could be the foundation for a more comprehensive long paper or a compelling short paper. Fully exploring the future directions outlined by the authors would significantly enhance the paper's quality. In its current form, however, the manuscript feels somewhat lacking in substantial novel contributions.
