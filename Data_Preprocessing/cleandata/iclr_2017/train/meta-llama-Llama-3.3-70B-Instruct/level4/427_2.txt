The authors present a novel approach to visualizing the regions of an image that predominantly influence a specific Deep Neural Network (DNN) response. By building upon and refining the foundational method introduced by Robnik-Sikonja and Kononenko in 2008, they successfully adapt it for DNNs, thereby enhancing its analytical capabilities and extending its applicability to image analysis.
The paper delivers a comprehensive examination of the proposed methodology, accompanied by compelling examples, although these examples are selectively chosen. To further strengthen the presentation, it would be beneficial to include at least one figure illustrating the analysis of a random subset of images, such as 24 images from the ImageNet dataset, to demonstrate the method's broader applicability.
A comparative analysis against other methodologies mentioned in the introduction, including gradient-based and deconvolution-based methods, would provide valuable insight into the relative strengths and weaknesses of the authors' approach.
The manuscript is exceptionally well-written, with all necessary details provided, making it a pleasure to read. The clarity of the writing and the thoroughness of the analysis contribute significantly to the paper's overall quality.
In the context of understanding DNN functionality and decision-making processes, which is a widely discussed and significant problem, the authors' method offers a substantial contribution with the potential to drive further advancements in the field. The comparison of evidence collection patterns across different networks, as shown in Figure 8 for AlexNet, GoogLeNet, and VGG, is particularly insightful. Given the method's potential applications and its contribution to the field, it is considered to be of high significance.
Following the authors' thorough incorporation of the suggested improvements, the initial rating of 8 has been revised to a 9, reflecting the enhanced quality and comprehensive nature of the revised manuscript.
