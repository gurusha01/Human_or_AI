This paper follows a conventional approach by utilizing deep metric learning with a Siamese architecture, yet it also presents an intriguing connection to human perception, specifically persistence. Although I am not a specialist in human vision, the general comparison and the resultant hierarchical groupings appear to be noteworthy and potentially captivating for this community. The experimental setup is satisfactory, but I was somewhat let down to find that it relies entirely on synthetic data. The authors could have enhanced the study by incorporating a minimal, real-world dataset, such as ALOI, to increase the validity and applicability of their findings.
