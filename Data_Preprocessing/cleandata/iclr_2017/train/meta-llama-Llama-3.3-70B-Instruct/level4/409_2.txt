This manuscript presents the development of a comprehensive corpus of openly-licensed classical music recordings, accompanied by aligned MIDI scores. The authors also conduct experiments on polyphonic transcription utilizing various deep learning methodologies, yielding promising outcomes.
The paper's organization and coherence could be improved, as certain sections appear disjointed and contradictory. For instance, the initial sentence of section 2 (MusicNet) would be more effectively positioned in the following paragraph, allowing the section to commence with an overview of the available tools for music researchers. Additionally, the description of Table 3 would be better suited in the Methods section. Furthermore, the abstract and introduction initially state that the objective is note prediction, whereas a subsequent claim (in the 4th paragraph of the introduction) suggests a focus on "learning low-level features of music," which can be somewhat perplexing.
Despite existing research on collection platforms and corpora, such as the work by Uehara et al. (2016), this study is notable due to its corpus size and innovative feature generation approach. The authors' future plans to expand the corpus, in terms of both volume and diversity, are of particular interest and warrant further exploration.
