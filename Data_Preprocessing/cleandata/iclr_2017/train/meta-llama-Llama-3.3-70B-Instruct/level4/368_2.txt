Review- Summary:
This paper presents a method for estimating log-likelihoods of popular decoder-based generative models, such as GANs and VAEs, using annealed importance sampling (AIS) and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC). The approach is validated using bidirectional Monte Carlo on the MNIST dataset, providing a comparison of the performance of GANs and VAEs.
Review:
At first glance, the application of AIS in this paper appears to be relatively straightforward, although I may have overlooked a crucial aspect that enables its successful implementation. Nevertheless, I appreciate the paper's educational value and empirical contributions, which are likely to clarify the ongoing debates surrounding the density estimation capabilities of GANs and facilitate the adoption of AIS by a broader audience.
To enhance the paper's clarity, it would be beneficial to expand on the description of AIS, particularly in explaining the underlying rationale and mechanisms that drive the algorithm's performance. While the paper provides a basic overview of AIS and mentions its components, it lacks a deeper discussion on the algorithm's workings and theoretical foundations.
Initially, I found the disparate values in Figure 2 to be confusing. Upon closer inspection, it became apparent that the figure compares different models on continuous and discrete MNIST datasets. To avoid similar confusion in the future, it would be helpful to specify in the caption that subfigures (a) and (b) pertain to continuous MNIST, while subfigure (c) refers to discrete MNIST. Additionally, the label "GMMN-50" should be corrected to "GMMN-10".
The use of reconstructions as a means of evaluating models, although necessary, is not a sufficient condition for determining a model's quality. For instance, a posterior sample may have a low density under the prior, depending on the likelihood. It would be beneficial if the authors could discuss the limitations of this evaluation method and provide a more nuanced analysis.
Minor suggestions:
The paper could benefit from a reference to MacKay's density networks (MacKay, 1995) in the context of decoder-based generative models.
In Section 2.2, the authors mention that the prior over z can be significantly different from the true posterior p(z|x), particularly in high-dimensional spaces. To improve the paper's flow, especially for readers unfamiliar with importance sampling and AIS, it would be helpful to clarify the relevance of the posterior in this context.
In Section 2.3, the authors argue that estimating p(x) in log-space is often more "meaningful" due to underflow problems. However, the term "meaningful" may not be the most accurate choice. Instead, the authors could revise the statement to say that estimating log p(x) is more practical due to underflow problems or that it is more meaningful because of its connection to compression, surprise, or entropy.
