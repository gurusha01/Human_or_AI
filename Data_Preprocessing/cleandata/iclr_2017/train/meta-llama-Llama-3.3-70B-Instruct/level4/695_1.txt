Review- Summary:
This paper presents NoiseOut, a novel approach to parameter reduction through neuron pruning in neural networks. 
The method involves identifying highly correlated neuron pairs, merging them into a single neuron, and subsequently adjusting the weights accordingly.
To enhance correlation between neurons, the authors introduce an additional noise output neuron, which encourages the network to predict the mean of the noise distribution, a constant value that increases inter-neuron correlation.
The efficacy of this technique is demonstrated through experiments on the MNIST and SVHN datasets.
Comments:
While the proposed neuron pruning method is intriguing, further experimentation on larger datasets is likely necessary to conclusively establish its reliability and broad applicability.
The derivation of Equation (5) appears straightforward, suggesting that it may not require extensive explanation.
For more complex, larger datasets, it is plausible that multiple noise output neurons may be required to maintain sufficiently high correlations; however, it is unclear whether this would compromise overall accuracy.
The paper is well-organized and engaging, making for an interesting read. As such, I recommend that the authors continue to explore and develop this line of research.
