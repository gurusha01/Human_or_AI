This paper introduces a novel memory module grounded in the k-NN approach. The writing is of high quality, and the results presented are persuasive. 
The utilization of Omniglot as a sanity check is appropriate, and the performance achieved is notably impressive. The artificial task demonstrates the validity of the authors' claims, underscoring the necessity for more comprehensive benchmarks in this area. Furthermore, the translation task effectively highlights the practical utility of the proposed model, making a compelling argument.
As I am not a specialist in memory networks, I rely on the authors to ensure that all pertinent references are included, as suggested by another reviewer who mentioned associative LSTM. Nonetheless, I find this to be a well-structured and beneficial paper. I encourage the authors to make their code publicly available to further facilitate research in this domain.
