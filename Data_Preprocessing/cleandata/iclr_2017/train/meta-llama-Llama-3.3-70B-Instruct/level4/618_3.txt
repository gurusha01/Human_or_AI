This work leverages steerable frames in various applications where convolutional neural networks with location-invariant operators are typically employed. The authors provide an in-depth overview of steerable frames, followed by an experimental section that applies dynamic steerable networks to small machine learning problems, where steerability is conceptually beneficial.
Although the evaluation is limited to a few small tasks, the reason for not exploring more tasks is that piece-wise pose invariance is only necessary for a subset of tasks. Notably, using overcomplete bases as a form of "feature pre-processing" enhances the results for already highly optimized ResNet and DenseNet architectures, which is a significant achievement.
For edge detection, a relatively challenging baseline is selected - the Dynamic Filter Networks, which already attempts to achieve position-invariant filters. The fact that the Dynamic Steerable Filter Network (DSFN) improves performance on this task demonstrates that regressing the parametrization of the steerable filters yields better results than regressing the filters directly.
In the final experiment, the authors apply the network to video classification using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTMs) and show that the improved performance is not due to the increased capacity of the network.
Overall, this is an interesting work, offering theoretically intriguing and promising results, even if it does not present groundbreaking findings, primarily due to the lack of experiments on larger tasks.
There are a few minor issues and suggestions related to the paper:
* For the LSTM experiment, providing information about the total number of parameters would be useful, as the network estimating the pose also increases the number of parameters.
* More details on how back-propagation is performed through the steerable filters would be beneficial.
* For the Edge Detection experiment, including results for a standard baseline, such as a CNN with a similar number of parameters, would be helpful in understanding the usefulness of location-variant filters for this task.
* The last sentence of the second paragraph on page 1 is missing a verb and may be unnecessary.
* The hyphenation for ConvNet is incorrect in multiple places, which could be resolved using `\hyphenation{Conv-Net}`.
