This paper presents a novel approach to link prediction on Knowledge Bases, introducing two key innovations: (1) an iterative inference process that enables the model to refine its predictions, and (2) a shared memory component. These elements contribute to the model's impressive performance on two benchmark datasets.
The paper is well-written, and the proposed model is intriguing, with experimental results that are notably impressive. However, I can only recommend a weak accept due to several concerns.
* A major issue with this paper is the lack of insight into how the two innovative elements contribute to the model's superior performance. Specifically:
  - It would be beneficial to evaluate the model's performance without the shared memory component and assess how its size affects the results.
  - Analyzing the impact of varying Tmax (the chosen value for experiments) from 1 to 5 would provide valuable information on the termination gate's frequency of operation.
  - Reporting the proportion of examples where inference terminates before reaching Tmax would be informative.
  - Investigating the proportion of examples where predictions change across multiple inference iterations would also be interesting.
* The choice of \lambda = 10 (Section 2) suggests a low temperature for the softmax, potentially resulting in the attention mechanism focusing primarily on a single cell. It would be helpful to examine how softmax activations vary with different relationship types and entity types.
* As FB15k and WN18 are outdated and overused benchmarks, it would be valuable to test the model on larger, more contemporary datasets to demonstrate its scalability and robustness.
