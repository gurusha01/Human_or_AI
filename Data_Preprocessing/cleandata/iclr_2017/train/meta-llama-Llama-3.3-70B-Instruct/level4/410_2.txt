The authors suggest utilizing statistical measures of softmax output to estimate error probability and the likelihood of a test sample being out-of-domain, comparing this approach to relying solely on softmax output probabilities as a confidence metric. 
Further clarification on the concept of disregarding the logit of the blank symbol would be beneficial.
Evaluating the proposed method's performance in more complex scenarios, where out-of-domain examples closely resemble in-domain ones, would be intriguing. For instance, in speech recognition, this could involve using speech from a different language with an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system trained on a specific language, where the acoustic characteristics of speech signals from two languages may be more similar than those of noisy and clean speech from the same language.
The description of the auxiliary decoder setup in Section 4 could be enhanced with additional details.
