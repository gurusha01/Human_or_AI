The authors present a novel parameterization of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that ensures equivariance with respect to a broad range of geometric transformations, backed by rigorous mathematical analysis and interesting, innovative content. The paper is well-structured and readable, with a notable effort to make the mathematical explanations accessible, although minor improvements could enhance clarity.
The theory developed is sufficiently general to encompass continuous transformations, even though the experimental section focuses on discrete transformations. This limitation is justified by the experimental results, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on the CIFAR dataset.
Recent studies, such as that by Lenc & Vedaldi, have explored equivariance in CNNs empirically, offering a complementary perspective. Additionally, the concept of geometric equivariance has been extensively studied in the past, particularly in the 2000s, with notable works like that of Reisert, who applied Lie group theory to achieve invariance and equivariance in steerable filters. Although the focus was on kernel machines rather than CNNs, many of the underlying principles and theorems share relevance.
To improve the readability of the mathematical formulations, simplifying some notations could be beneficial. For instance, specifying the lattice as Z^2 instead of Z^d, given that the inputs are always images, could make the subsequent mathematical derivations easier to follow. Furthermore, eliminating the layer index and adopting notation for current and next layers could enhance the natural flow of the paper.
Some minor suggestions for improvement include providing supporting references for certain statements, such as the existence of explicit formulas and the introduction of intertwiners. Additionally, there is a small error in the reference to Balduzzi & Ghifary. Overall, the authors are encouraged to consider these suggestions to further refine their work. Relevant references include Lenc & Vedaldi's 2015 study on measuring equivariance and equivalence in image representations, and Reisert's 2008 work on group integration techniques in pattern analysis.
