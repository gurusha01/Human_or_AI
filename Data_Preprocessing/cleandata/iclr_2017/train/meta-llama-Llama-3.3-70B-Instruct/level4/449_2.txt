This manuscript proposes a methodology for constructing deep neural networks through the implementation of rules governing the expansion and merging of sub-networks.
Key strengths of the paper include:
- The concept presented is innovative and contributes to the existing body of knowledge.
- The methodology is well-articulated and easy to follow.
However, several limitations were noted:
- The empirical assessment of the approach lacks persuasiveness, as evidenced by the failure to demonstrate improvement on the SVHN dataset.
- To facilitate a fair comparison among models, it is essential that the number of parameters be specified for each.
- The impact of drop-path appears to be negligible when data augmentation is applied, which warrants further investigation.
