This manuscript extends the research of Weston (2016) by utilizing end-to-end memory network models to facilitate a restricted form of dialogue that incorporates teacher feedback. As noted by the authors, this work is closely related to the question answering problem, with the distinction being the provision of a response by the teacher following the model's answer, which may not always yield a positive reward. Consequently, the model must learn to leverage the teacher's feedback to achieve significant performance enhancements.
The paper is well-structured and presents several intriguing models. Although it only explores a limited form of dialogue, akin to question answering, where the questions do not necessitate the agent to reference the context extensively, investigating this direction could yield fruitful results when scaled up to more challenging tasks.
My primary concern lies in the paper's novelty. The authors identify two key differences between their work and that of Weston: "(i) the earlier work did not employ a natural reinforcement learning/online setting, instead relying on a predetermined policy, and (ii) the earlier work utilized solely simulated data, whereas this study employs real-language data collected via Mechanical Turk." While the inclusion of real-language data is a notable improvement, merely adding human testing data may not be sufficient to warrant a conference paper. The core contribution of the paper appears to be the demonstration that "the model remains effective when data is collected online, using the agent's policy rather than a predetermined one." Although this represents a step in the right direction, its significance as a standalone contribution for an ICLR paper is questionable, as minimal model innovation is required to address this additional requirement beyond implementing epsilon-greedy exploration. Therefore, the paper occupies a borderline position between acceptance and rejection.
EDIT: Upon reviewing the authors' response, which highlights the importance of considering real-world implementation as a key contribution, I have adjusted my evaluation accordingly.
