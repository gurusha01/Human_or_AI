This manuscript explores the concept of enforcing invariance in neural networks through weight sharing, with a specific focus on formalizing feature functions that are invariant to a set of relations. The primary invariance examined is "set-invariant" functions, which are applied to anomaly detection and point cloud classification problems.
At a high level, addressing "invariance" is crucial, as it prevents the unnecessary allocation of parameters to model spurious ordering relationships, potentially leading to inefficiencies. The formalization of invariance presented in this paper is commendable. However, several weaknesses detract from the overall strength of the submission. Firstly, the presentation is overly abstract and would benefit from a concrete, running example introduced from the outset.
Secondly, the definition of "set invariance" relies on the authors' formalization of invariance but lacks an explicit connection to the conventional understanding of set invariance, such as invariance to permutations of input or output dimensions. A clearer definition of set invariance, followed by its relation to the structural invariance formulation, would enhance the explanation. For instance, the rationale behind Figure 1(b) being the chosen set data-structure is not clearly justified.
The discussion on the compositionality of structures is appreciated, although it raises questions about the validity of the resulting compositional structures. Moreover, the authors overlook the importance of relating the proposed notion of invariance to function composition in neural networks, specifically under what conditions the composition of invariant functions remains invariant. It is evident that a single layer of invariance does not guarantee the entire network's invariance, as seen in the anomaly detection network. Therefore, it is unclear whether the final predictor in this example is "set invariant" in some sense.
The experimental section lacks baselines for anomaly detection, and while baselines are provided for point cloud classification, the proposed model's results are not superior, which warrants further discussion. Additionally, the desirability of set invariance as a property for point cloud classification is not clearly explained. A potential approach could involve using a fully connected layer with data augmentation to enforce set invariance, and the relevance of classical set kernels should be explored.
Several minor points require clarification:
* In Example 2.2, the symmetry case of left-right and up-down should yield |S|=5.
* The term "parameters shared within a relation" is vague and requires definition.
* The appendix's "set convolution" terminology is misleading, as it does not appear to be convolutional in nature.
* The potential relationship to symmetric function theory is not investigated.
Overall, while the paper presents an interesting formalization of invariance, its abstract nature, lack of concrete examples, and omission of crucial details hinder its impact. Addressing these concerns would significantly strengthen the submission.
