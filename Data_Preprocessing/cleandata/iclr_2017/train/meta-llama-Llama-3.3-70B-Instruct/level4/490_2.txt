This study essentially proposes a hybrid approach, integrating a pointer network with language modeling. 
A key insight of this paper is its focus on language modeling with extended context, where retaining a memory of previously encountered words, particularly rare ones, significantly enhances the prediction of subsequent sentence elements. 
Thus, combining a pointer network with a conventional language model effectively balances the tasks of copying known words and predicting unseen ones. 
Typically, in applications such as sentence compression, combined pointer networks utilize a vector representation of the source sequence to calculate the gate. 
In contrast, this paper introduces a sentinel vector to implement the mixture model, an approach well-suited for language modeling. 
While the current implementation yields impressive results, exploring variations of the sentinel mixture model could be intriguing. 
Furthermore, the newly introduced WikiText language modeling dataset is noteworthy. 
It has the potential to become a standard dataset for evaluating continuously updated language model benchmarks, possibly surpassing the ptb dataset in this regard. 
Overall, the paper is well-structured and clearly written. Based on its technical merit and contributions, I strongly recommend its acceptance.
