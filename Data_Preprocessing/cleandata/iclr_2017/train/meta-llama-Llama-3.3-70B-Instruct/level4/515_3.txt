This manuscript presents a novel approach to representing the full polynomial linear model using tensor train (TT) decomposition, which can effectively reduce computational complexity during both inference and training phases. The authors propose a stochastic gradient method on a Riemann manifold to solve the TT-based formulation, and empirical experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.
I find the proposed approach to be innovative and compelling, and I am inclined to recommend acceptance of this paper. However, to further strengthen the presentation, I suggest that the authors provide an analysis of the computational complexity per iteration, which would offer additional insight into the method's efficiency.
