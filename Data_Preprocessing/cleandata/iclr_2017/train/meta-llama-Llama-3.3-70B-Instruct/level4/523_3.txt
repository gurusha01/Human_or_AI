The authors present a compelling approach to efficient softmax computation for language modeling on GPUs, driven by computational complexity considerations. Their proposed adaptive softmax method utilizes a hierarchical model, which is optimized using dynamic programming to minimize computational complexity on GPUs.
However, the robustness of the dynamically programmed configuration with respect to performance and perplexity remains unclear. Comparative results with perplexity-based clustering would be beneficial, particularly in Section 5, under the "Baselines" paragraph and Table 1, where a comparison with HSM(PPL) (as in Zweig et al., 2013) would be insightful.
Notably, the first successful application of an LSTM-based language model to large vocabulary tasks, as reported by Sundermeyer et al. in 2012, is absent from the summary of prior work at the bottom of page 3.
Overall, the paper is well-written and accessible, although some notational improvements are necessary, as detailed below.
Prior work on LSTM language modeling includes:
- Sundermeyer et al.: LSTM Neural Networks for Language Modeling, Interspeech, pp. 194-197, 2012.
Regarding notation:
- The use of g(k) versus g(k,B,d) requires clarification, specifically whether g(k) implies constant B and d.
- Notational reuse should be avoided, such as using B to represent both a matrix in Equation (3) and batch size in Section 4.1.
- The notation p{i+j} in Equation (10) and preceding sections may be misleading, as p{i+j} does not equate to p_{(i+j)}.
Minor comments include:
- On page 1, the first item in the list should read "takes" instead of "take".
- In the second paragraph of page 5, "will then contained" should be corrected to "will then contain".
- The third paragraph of page 5 should read "to associate" instead of "to associated".
- In Section 4.3, the first paragraph should begin with "For the time being" rather than "At the time being".
- Below Equation (9), "most-right" should be replaced with "right-most".
- Below Equation (10), the phrase "the second term of this equation" should be rephrased as "the second term of the right-hand side of this equation".
- On page 6, the second-to-last line should read "smaller than the" instead of "smaller that the".
- In Section 5 of page 7, the first itemized point should read "100 million" instead of "100 millions".
- The last sentence of page 8 should be corrected to "ours is the" from "we are the".
The function g() is employed in various configurations with different variables, necessitating clear definitions for each, such as g(k,B,d) versus g(k), and whether the latter implies constant B and d.
Additionally, numerous references and citations appear to be either missing or incorrect, as indicated by "(?)" in the text, and should be provided.
