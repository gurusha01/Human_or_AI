The authors present a novel image generation framework wherein the background is initially generated, followed by the creation of a foreground mask and its corresponding appearance. The appearance image is then warped using the mask, and the mask is transformed via a predicted affine transformation to overlay it onto the background image. The naturalness of the generated images is validated through a user study conducted with Amazon Mechanical Turk workers, who preferred the proposed model's outputs over those of a DC-GAN model 68% of the time.
However, the segmentation masks are limited to representing objects within highly constrained datasets, such as birds, which restricts the method's applicability to more general shape datasets, a limitation also acknowledged by the authors. Nevertheless, the architectural innovations introduced in the paper demonstrate potential value.
A potential avenue for further exploration is whether this layered approach can generate multiple layers of foreground objects that occlude one another, or if it is solely capable of producing figure-ground aware images.
