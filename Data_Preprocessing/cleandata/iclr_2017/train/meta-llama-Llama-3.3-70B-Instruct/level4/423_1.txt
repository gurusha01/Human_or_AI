This study integrates multiple discriminators into the GAN framework, yielding results that suggest this approach is beneficial for stabilization purposes. 
The primary issue with stabilization appears to stem from the gradient signals emitted by the discriminator, prompting the authors to propose the use of multiple discriminators as a means to mitigate this effect.
In my opinion, this research points to a promising direction, but I believe the authors could further strengthen their argument by providing additional comparative results and approaches that emphasize discriminator gradient enforcement, such as GANs combined with DAE (as seen in Improving Generative Adversarial Networks with Denoising Feature Matching), to more effectively demonstrate the advantages of utilizing multiple discriminators.
