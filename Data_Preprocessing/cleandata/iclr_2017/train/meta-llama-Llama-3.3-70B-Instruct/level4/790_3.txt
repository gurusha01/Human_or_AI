This paper explores the application of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for secure communication purposes.
In Section 2, the authors introduce a three-component neural network architecture aimed at encoding and decoding data. However, this model lacks practical significance on its own, serving primarily as a precursor to the subsequent model presented in Section 3. Notably, it falls short of any established cryptographic system in terms of security guarantees.
Section 3 outlines a scenario where the authors aim to conceal specific parts of the data that contain correlated fields, while making the remainder publicly available. Nevertheless, it is challenging to envision a real-world application where this approach would offer advantages over a more straightforward method: decorrelating the data and utilizing a proven cryptographic system to encrypt the sensitive fields, while releasing the non-sensitive information in plain text.
