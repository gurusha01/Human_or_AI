This manuscript presents a novel approach to argumentation mining, which involves identifying relationships between statements in short texts. The proposed model effectively integrates a pointer network for linking statements with a classifier for predicting statement roles, yielding impressive performance that surpasses strong baselines even with limited training data of fewer than 100 examples.
From a technical standpoint, the paper appears to be sound, with no major issues identified. However, the contribution to the field of representation learning is not substantially novel, as it primarily adapts established techniques to a new NLP problem. Consequently, it may be more suitable for presentation at one of the ACL conferences.
The utilization of a pointer network for this task seems justified, although a more comprehensive comparison with alternative methods for generating trees would strengthen the paper. The quantitative analysis of results is thorough, but the inclusion of model output examples and qualitative error analysis would provide valuable additional insights.
Specific comments include:
- Figure 2 contains an inconsistency, as it illustrates the decoder pointing to an output index despite the text stating it only produces a distribution over input indices.
- The reference "Wei12" appears to be incorrect, as it does not seem to correspond to a valid author name.
