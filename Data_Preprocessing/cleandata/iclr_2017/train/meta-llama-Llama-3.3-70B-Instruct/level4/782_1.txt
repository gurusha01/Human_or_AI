This manuscript proposes an innovative hierarchical memory framework for neural networks, utilizing a binary tree structure where leaves represent memory cells, thereby enabling memory access in O(log n) time. Experimental results further showcase the model's capability to tackle complex tasks, such as sorting based on input-output examples and handling extended sequences.
The concept presented in the paper is original and clearly articulated, with a memory architecture that appears to offer practical advantages. Nevertheless, a significant limitation of the paper lies in its experimental evaluation. Notably, it lacks a comparative analysis with other external memory-based methods, as well as an assessment of computational efficiency considering overhead costs beyond theoretical complexity, which is purported as a key benefit. Additionally, the experimental configurations are somewhat limited, focusing on artificial tasks with only moderate sequence length increases. Enhancing these aspects would substantially bolster the manuscript, as the underlying idea holds considerable interest.
