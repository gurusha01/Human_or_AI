This manuscript presents a valuable dataset and data generator, which creates tasks similar to bAbI, with the added complexity of requiring the question-answering agent to solicit clarification on variable values to achieve success. The authors' choice of baseline models for evaluating these tasks appears to be suitable. However, I have some concerns that the tasks may not be sufficiently challenging, echoing the limitations of the original bAbI tasks. Nevertheless, I believe these tasks will still have local utility. If the generation code is robust and the tasks are adaptable, they have the potential to remain useful for an extended period.
