The manuscript explores the utilization of deep learning techniques in analyzing genomic SNP data, with a particular focus on addressing the challenge of high data dimensionality through various approaches. Although the proposed methodology appears intriguing, the experimental scope is somewhat restricted, which limits the ability to definitively assess the comparative strengths of different methods. Enhancing the mathematical precision in the presentation would significantly improve clarity.
Quality:
The core concept of the paper is compelling, and the application of deep learning methodologies seems sound. However, the experimental validation falls short due to its reliance on a single dataset and a limited number of cross-validation folds. Given the substantial variability in method performances, it is plausible that the differences among the better-performing methods may not achieve statistical significance. A more extensive empirical validation would undoubtedly bolster the manuscript.
Clarity:
The writing quality is generally commendable, effectively conveying both biological and machine learning concepts. Nevertheless, incorporating more rigorous mathematical explanations would facilitate a precise understanding of the methodologies employed. The descriptions of different architectures, while intuitive, would benefit from clear mathematical definitions. The "raw end2end" model, in particular, lacks clarity, as it is unclear what embedding technique is used, given the insufficient parameters for processing raw 300k dimensional input. 
Fig. 3 could be improved by scaling the results so that the maximum for each class equals 1, thereby mitigating the impact of differing subject numbers across classes. Furthermore, the text should consistently utilize the standard italics math font for symbols such as N, N_d, ...
Originality:
The application and approach presented in the manuscript appear to be novel and innovative.
Significance:
There is a palpable interest in deep learning within the genomics community, and this manuscript aims to address several key bottlenecks. While it is premature to determine if the proposed techniques will ultimately prevail, the manuscript undoubtedly introduces interesting and novel ideas that can inspire further research.
Other comments:
The release of the code, as promised, is essential and would significantly contribute to the reproducibility and advancement of the proposed techniques.
