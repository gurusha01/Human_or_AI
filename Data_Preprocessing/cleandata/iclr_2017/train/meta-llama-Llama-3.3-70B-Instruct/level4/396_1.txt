The manuscript proposes a novel framework for image generation by combining foreground and background elements to create a cohesive image. This approach is sensible when a distinct foreground object is present. Nevertheless, real-world images often exhibit complex compositions with multiple layers, deviating from the straightforward foreground-background dichotomy. It is unclear how the authors' method would handle such intricate scenarios.
In general, this work presents a thoughtful approach to a significant problem from a unique perspective. However, substantial additional work is required to develop the proposed method into a broadly applicable methodology.
