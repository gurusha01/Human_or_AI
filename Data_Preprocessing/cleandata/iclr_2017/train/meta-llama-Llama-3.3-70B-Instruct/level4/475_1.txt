This paper presents a novel Variational Encoder architecture that incorporates discrete variables, comprising an undirected discrete component to capture the distribution over disconnected manifolds and a directed hierarchical continuous component to model the actual manifolds induced by these discrete variables. Essentially, the model simultaneously clusters the data and learns a continuous manifold representation for each cluster. A detailed training procedure is also outlined, which is quite complex. The experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on several public datasets, including MNIST, Omniglot, and Caltech-101.
The proposed model is intriguing and has the potential to be applied in various domains and applications. However, the approach is mathematically sophisticated and complex. One notable omission is a clear comparison or relation to other Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) formulations, particularly those that involve discrete latent variables and continuous outputs. For instance, the work by Graham Taylor and Geoffrey Hinton on Factored Conditional Restricted Boltzmann Machines for modeling motion style (ICML 2009) is a relevant example that warrants discussion. The addition of such a comparison would provide valuable context and deepen the understanding of the proposed model's contributions.
