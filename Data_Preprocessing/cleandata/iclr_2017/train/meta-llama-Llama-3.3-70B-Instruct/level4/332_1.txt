This manuscript presents a novel approach to learning representations across diverse object views. The core idea revolves around utilizing a triplet loss function, which aims to minimize the distance between two different views of the same object while maximizing the distance to an image of a distinct object. The methodology is assessed through experiments on object instance and category retrieval, with comparisons drawn to baseline convolutional neural networks (CNNs), including an untrained AlexNet and an AlexNet fine-tuned for category classification, using fc7 features with cosine distance. Additionally, the study includes a comparison with human perception on the "Tenenbaum objects" dataset.
Strengths of the paper include the potential novelty of applying triplet loss to this specific problem, although its originality may be somewhat diminished by concurrent research efforts. The manuscript is also well-structured and clearly written.
However, several weaknesses are noted. A significant omission is the lack of relevant citations and comparisons to existing works in this domain. Incorporating these would strengthen the paper's position within the field.
For further context, a closely related study is the "image purification" paper by Hao Su et al., presented at SIGGRAPH Asia 2015. This work focuses on learning joint embeddings of shapes and images via CNN image purification for view-invariant object retrieval. Specifically, it maps CNN features to hand-designed light field descriptors of 3D shapes. A direct comparison with this approach, particularly the cross-view retrieval experiment outlined in Table 1 of the referenced paper, would be beneficial. Given that the code and data from this study are available online, such a comparison appears feasible and would provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of the proposed model.
