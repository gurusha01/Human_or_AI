This paper offers a theoretically sound approach to visualizing the input feature map components that drive the output decision, leveraging the notion that the most critical features are those that significantly impact the output while being less predictable from other features. Building on the foundation established by Robnik-Å ikonja & Kononenko (2008), the authors differentiate their work from previous studies by considering the predictability of features from one another, in addition to their influence on the output.
The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed visualization method, which models conditional distributions, in identifying more salient regions compared to an approach based on marginal distributions. The inclusion of visualization results for a single image across multiple networks and classes is a notable strength, as it illustrates the method's ability to capture class-discriminative features. The authors' decision to provide a link to additional visualizations for a random sample of images is commendable, and incorporating this into the paper's appendix would further enhance its clarity.
One aspect that warrants attention is the comparison with the method proposed by Zeiler et al., which involves greying small square regions in the image, analogous to computing visualization using marginal distribution. The authors' use of 10 samples for both marginal and conditional visualization computations raises concerns, as the marginal visualization would result in a gray image in the limit of infinite samples. The conditional distribution's computation via a normal distribution introduces regularization, making the comparison between the two methods using 10 samples each potentially unjustified.
To strengthen the paper, a comparison between the proposed approach based on conditional distribution and a method using grey image patches, similar to Zeiler et al., would be beneficial. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the relative merits of each approach and further validate the authors' methodology.
