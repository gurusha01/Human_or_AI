This paper tackles the significant issue of discrepancies between simulated and real-world policy control domains in a systematic manner. The proposed approach comprises two key components: 1) adversarial training on an ensemble of models to develop policies resilient to errors, and 2) adapting the source domain ensemble using target domain data to enhance real-world applicability.
> Significance
The paper tackles a crucial and timely problem, and the methodology employed to address it is noteworthy and engaging.
> Clarity
While the paper is well-structured and clearly written, a certain level of domain-specific expertise is necessary to fully comprehend the content.
My primary concerns were adequately addressed by the authors' rebuttal and the subsequent revisions made to the paper, which have successfully mitigated my initial reservations.
