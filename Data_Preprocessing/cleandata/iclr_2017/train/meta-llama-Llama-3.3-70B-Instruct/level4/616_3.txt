The paper presents a novel network architecture designed to tackle inverse problems in computer vision, including image inpainting, intrinsic image decomposition, and foreground/background separation. This architecture consists of three primary components: (i) a generator that produces the desired latent output, such as the separation of foreground and background regions, (ii) a renderer that reconstructs the original image from the latent output for comparison and error measurement, and (iii) an adversarial prior that ensures the generated latent output adheres to specific image statistics.
Notable strengths of the paper include:
- The proposed architecture, which incorporates a memory database, is innovative and appears to be a new contribution to the field.
However, several weaknesses were identified:
- The experimental results are limited to proof-of-concept demonstrations on simplified setups and fail to convincingly demonstrate the benefits of the proposed architecture.
- The memory retrieval engine, which relies on L2 distance on pixel values to retrieve images, may not generalize well to more complex and realistic scenarios.
- The clarity of the explanation could be improved, as some terminology and concepts, such as "imagination" and "memory," were found to be confusing.
A detailed evaluation of the paper reveals:
- Originality: The novelty of this work stems from the adversarial prior, which introduces an adversarial loss between the generated latent output and a single image retrieved from a large, unlabelled database of target output examples. This form of network architecture, combined with a memory-based fully convolutional adversarial loss, appears to be novel and potentially interesting. However, the motivation behind the "Memory retrieval engine" is weak, relying on L2 distance measurements that may not be effective in more realistic datasets and problems.
- Quality: The experimental validation is limited, with results shown only for simplified setups such as MNIST digit inpainting, intrinsic image decomposition on the MIT database, and figure/ground layer extraction on synthesized 3D chair data. These experiments do not demonstrate the model's capability in real-world settings, falling short of current state-of-the-art performances in image inpainting and other tasks. To strengthen the paper, it would be beneficial to focus on one problem and showcase results on a challenging, state-of-the-art dataset, highlighting the benefits of the memory database.
- Clarity: The writing could be improved for better understanding. Certain terms and the overall concept of "memory" were confusing, and the process of obtaining "memories" for a given input image was not clearly explained. Including an illustration of the feature space, similar to figure 2 in other works, would help clarify the proposed architecture and its functioning.
