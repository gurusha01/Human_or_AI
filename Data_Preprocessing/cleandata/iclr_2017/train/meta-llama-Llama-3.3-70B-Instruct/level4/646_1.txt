The proposed QA model lacks novelty, bearing a strong resemblance to existing models. Furthermore, the IQA model's design is perplexing, as it appears to require human intervention during the training process, which raises concerns about its practical feasibility. Specifically, relying on human participation in each iteration seems impractical. If, on the other hand, the interactive questions are pre-defined, this would undermine the model's interactivity, as it would not be responsive to the current state of the model's output.
