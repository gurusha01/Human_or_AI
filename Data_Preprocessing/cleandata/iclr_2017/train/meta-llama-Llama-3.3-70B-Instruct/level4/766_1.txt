This paper proposes a pedestrian detection approach combining EdgeBoxes with Fast-RCNN and batch normalization. However, the submission falls short in several key areas, leading to a clear rejection. 
The main shortcomings include a limited evaluation scope, with results presented only for the ETH and INRIA datasets, and a lack of improvement over the current state of the art. The writing quality is also subpar, which hinders the overall clarity and impact of the work. Furthermore, the concept presented lacks novelty, especially when compared to existing works such as those by S. Zhang (CVPR 2016) and L. Zhang (ECCV 2017), which have already explored similar ideas in the context of Fast R-CNN and Faster R-CNN for pedestrian detection.
On the positive side, the authors do demonstrate that incorporating batch normalization can enhance the detection results, which is a valuable insight.
However, several significant drawbacks are noted:
- The evaluation is restricted to only two datasets (ETH and INRIA), with no inclusion of more comprehensive datasets like Caltech or KITTI.
- The reported results, while fair, do not surpass the state-of-the-art performance.
- The overall idea is of limited interest due to its similarity to previous works.
- The text quality is poor, with numerous grammatical errors and awkward phrasing.
- The work offers limited new insights or contributions to the field.
In terms of quality, clarity, originality, and significance, the submission rates as low, fair but with poor English, low, and low, respectively.
For future consideration, the authors would need to significantly enhance their work by achieving superior results on a broader range of datasets (including INRIA, ETH, and either Caltech or KITTI), and by providing novel insights that advance the current state of pedestrian detection research.
Minor suggestions for improvement include:
- Enhancing the text quality, possibly with the assistance of a native English speaker, to correct grammatical errors and improve readability.
- Ensuring that citations are properly formatted within parentheses.
- Correcting the positioning of authors' names in citations to adhere to standard reference formats.
