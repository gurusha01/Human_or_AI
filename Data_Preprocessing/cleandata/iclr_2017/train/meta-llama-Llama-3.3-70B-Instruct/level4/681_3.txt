Overview: This study exhibits potential, but it would benefit from a more comprehensive comparison with existing baselines and a more detailed explanation from a signal processing perspective.
Pros:
Introduction of a novel descriptor
Efficient implementation
Cons:
a) Insufficient rigor
b) Excessive length relative to content
c) Unclear computational advantages of the algorithm
d) Lack of comparison with the scattering transform, a fundamental baseline
I will elaborate on each of these concerns.
a) Section 1:
The author justifies the use of the scattering transform by highlighting its ability to contract space based on geometric features.
However, the statement "The nonlinearity used in the scattering network is the complex modulus which is piecewise linear" requires clarification, as a complex modulus typically has a bell-shaped representation when interpreted as R^2, whereas a real modulus is piecewise linear.
Additionally, the introduction of Î© is lacking.
A specific reference (including page and paper) is needed to support the claim that "Higher order nonlinearity refers to |x|^2 instead of |x| as it is usually done in the scattering network."
Section 2:
The motivation behind the chosen non-linearity is unclear, and its potential to increase variance due to dependence on higher moments (up to 4) should be addressed.
A numerical computation of the normalized variance (e.g., divided by the averaged l^2 norm) would serve as a sanity check.
Furthermore, it is essential to prove that the energy is decreasing, as the mathematical foundations of the scattering transform, which this architecture draws inspiration from, require such results.
Permutation is not a relevant factor to consider.
The concept of sparsity is inconsistently defined throughout the paper, sometimes referring to the count of zero values and other times to the l^1 norm; mathematically, any non-zero value, no matter how small, does not constitute sparsity.
It is unclear whether the graph in Figure 4 for the bird dataset was computed, and using a ratio for clarity might be beneficial.
The defined wavelet does not appear to be a Morlet wavelet.
