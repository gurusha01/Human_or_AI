This manuscript tackles a significant and contemporary issue in an innovative manner. However, I have identified three key limitations and one notable concept.
1) The paper lacks sufficient background information on existing research in shallow reinforcement learning, particularly in the realm of "robust RL". A potential starting point could be the work of Shie Mannor, which would provide valuable context.
2) The general problem setup appears to be poorly defined. It is unclear whether post-hoc labeling of certain actions as "catastrophic" is meaningful if the agent is not aware of this metric during the learning process. Evaluating a system trained for one objective (reward maximization) using a different metric can be misleading. Additionally, it would be beneficial to include plots for "average reward" in Figure 3 to provide a more comprehensive understanding. Furthermore, it is essential to consider how the baseline would perform if it received large negative rewards for entering "danger states".
3) The proposed solution seems somewhat ad-hoc, introducing domain-specific hyperparameters (kr, klambda, and lambda), an additional deep network, and two extra replay memories. I also have concerns regarding the reliability of the results, given the well-established performance of various methods on the cart-pole problem. It is unclear whether DQN is an outlier or if the convolutional network is an inappropriate function approximator. Specifically, which state-of-the-art DQN variant is being used?
One concept that shows promise and warrants further exploration is D_d, the set of rare but dangerous states. This idea has potential applications in continual learning, addressing a key difference between reinforcement learning and supervised learning, where such states are typically discarded as outliers.
Given my previous comment and the authors' prompt response regarding the implementation of expected SARSA, I had expected to see revised results in the updated manuscript. I am open to discussing these points and revising my opinion based on a revised version of the paper.
As a minor note, the bibliography appears to be incomplete, with missing years, conference venues, and author lists (e.g., "Sergey et al. Levine"). It is also considered good practice to cite conference publications instead of arXiv versions when applicable.
