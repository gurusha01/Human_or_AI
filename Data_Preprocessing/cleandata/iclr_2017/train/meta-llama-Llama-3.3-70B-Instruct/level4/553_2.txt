This research endeavor, which integrates storage and processing capabilities, is noteworthy due to the significant challenges posed by data transfer in various machine learning applications. 
The manuscript is well-structured, although it explores numerous concepts at a moderate level of depth, likely owing to limitations in length.
In my view, a journal publication that facilitates an in-depth examination of the technical aspects would be a more suitable outlet for this work.
Although the researchers employed an intriguing methodology to assess system performance, I found it challenging to discern the anticipated practical benefits of this approach.
Given the prominent emphasis on GPU and specialized hardware like TPUs, a key question arises: What is the expected margin of improvement over the current state-of-the-art GPU when applied to a real-world task?
I must acknowledge that I am not an expert in this field, despite having some familiarity with SystemC, which may impact my ability to fully appreciate the nuances of this research.
