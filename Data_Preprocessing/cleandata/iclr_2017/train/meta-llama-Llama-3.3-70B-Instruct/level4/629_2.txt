This manuscript presents a comparative analysis of the sensitivity to perturbations between multilayer neural networks and human vision, revealing similar sensitivities in various tasks. The results suggest that multilayer neural networks capture several key properties of the human visual system. However, in light of the existence of adversarial examples where minor, imperceptible perturbations lead to significant categorization errors, the implications of these findings are unclear. The similarity in phenomenology between the two systems in certain cases can be interpreted in multiple ways, highlighting the need for a more detailed examination of the underlying reasons for these similarities and differences. For instance, the correlation between conv2 and human sensitivity to noise perturbations, as observed in the initial section, warrants further investigation into how the first layer filters are combined to produce this contextual effect, potentially shedding light on neural mechanisms. While the author's approach is commendable and aligns with my interests, I believe the analysis merely touches the surface of exploring perceptual correlates in multilayer neural networks, leaving room for more in-depth investigation.
