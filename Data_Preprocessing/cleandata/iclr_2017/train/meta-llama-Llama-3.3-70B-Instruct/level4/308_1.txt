This paper is of high quality and deserves consideration for acceptance, prompting me to reaffirm my initial assessment. It presents a robust examination of generative adversarial networks (GANs), a recently introduced and crucial method in neural networks. The authors provide a theoretical analysis of GAN convergence and discuss stability issues, both of which are vital aspects. As one of the pioneering theoretical works on GANs, this paper offers profound theoretical understanding of the architecture, distinguishing itself from most submissions in the field. The discussion on GAN stability is particularly significant, given the initial instability of the first proposed GAN architectures, which hindered their practical application. Theorems 2.4-2.6 introduce novel concepts and employ interesting mathematical techniques. Although I have some minor technical inquiries regarding the proof of Theorem 2.5, they do not detract from the overall merit of the paper.
