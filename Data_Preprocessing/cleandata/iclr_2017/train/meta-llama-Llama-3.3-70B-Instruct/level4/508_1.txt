This paper presents a graph classification method that involves decomposing graph objects into hierarchical representations of smaller graphs, generating vector embeddings, and aggregating them using deep neural networks. The approach is logical and easy to follow, yet the experimental results fail to demonstrate a significant advantage over existing methods.
Although the proposed method achieves better performance than Yanardag et al. (2015) and Niepert et al. (2016) on social network graphs, it falls short when compared to Niepert et al. (2016) on bioinformatics datasets. Notably, the authors omit the accuracy of Yanardag et al. (2015) on similar bioinformatics datasets, such as NCI1, where the latter achieves 80%, substantially outperforming the proposed method. The claim that the method is specifically designed for social network graphs lacks robust justification, raising questions about the suitability of this approach for various graph models and the types of graphs for which it is most appropriate.
