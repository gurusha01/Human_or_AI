This paper presents an intriguing and valuable contribution. To further enhance its impact, the authors may consider supplementary analyses, such as introducing rescaled Gaussian noise to gradients during the Linearized Bregman (LB) regime, which could potentially leverage the benefits of the Split Bregman (SB) regime.
