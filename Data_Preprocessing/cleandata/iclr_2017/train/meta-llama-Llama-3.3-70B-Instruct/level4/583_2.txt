Initially, the drawbacks of the paper are notable:
The writing style of this manuscript is problematic. Although the grammar is satisfactory, several issues arise:
- The initial four pages are overly theoretical and lack concrete examples, making them challenging to comprehend. Incorporating a recurring example throughout the theoretical discussion would significantly enhance these sections.
- The presentation's organization is also perplexing, as crucial details appear to be out of sequence, prompting frequent references to forthcoming figures and preceding details. Reordering certain aspects could potentially resolve this issue. It is suggested that the authors present the work in a naturally ordered oral presentation and then rearrange the paper accordingly.
Furthermore, the experimental description is brief, leaving the reader uncertain about the significance of omitted details. Including supplementary experimental details could alleviate these concerns.
On the other hand, the paper has several strengths:
The manuscript excels in compiling prior research on novelty generation and proposing a unified framework for evaluating existing and future models. This is achieved by adapting existing generative model evaluation metrics to assess novelty. Although the experiments are fundamental, they surpass previous work in this area, to the best of this reviewer's knowledge.
In conclusion, I recommend accepting the paper, but with the condition that certain sections be rewritten to improve clarity. As with other novelty-related papers, it will likely be thoroughly read by a specialized audience, but may struggle to engage readers outside the niche area of novelty generation. Therefore, it is essential to make the theoretical aspects more intuitive and the experiments and results more accessible to a broader audience.
