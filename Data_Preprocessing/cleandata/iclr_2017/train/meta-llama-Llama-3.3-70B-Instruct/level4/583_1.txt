This manuscript explores the concept of computational creativity through the lens of machine learning, where creativity is characterized by a model's capacity to produce novel object types not encountered during training. The authors contend that traditional likelihood-based training and evaluation methods are inherently inadequate for generating out-of-class objects, and instead propose a novel evaluation framework that utilizes held-out object classes to assess a model's ability to generate innovative and interesting object types.
Although my familiarity with the existing literature on computational creativity is limited, preventing me from fully assessing the work's contextualization within the field, I find the ideas presented to be innovative, intriguing, and thought-provoking from a machine learning perspective.
As I interpret it, the underlying hypothesis suggests that a model's ability to generate new and interesting types that are unknown correlates with its ability to generate new and interesting types that are known, with the latter serving as a suitable proxy for the former. However, the validity of this hypothesis is contingent upon the bias introduced by model selection, analogous to the consideration of generalization performance, where it is crucial to avoid reusing the same held-out classes for both model selection and evaluation.
Despite this, I commend the authors' endeavor to formalize the concept of computational creativity within the machine learning paradigm, viewing it as a pivotal initial step in this direction. Given the paper's clarity and accessibility to machine learning researchers, I believe it merits inclusion in ICLR, particularly considering its well-structured and approachable presentation.
