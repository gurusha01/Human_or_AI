This paper presents a novel approach to knowledge transfer, which is an intriguing concept. The proposed method of transferring attention maps rather than activations is a notable aspect that I find particularly appealing. Nevertheless, the experimental results do not demonstrate a significant enhancement over knowledge distillation alone, and I believe additional experiments are necessary, especially in the IMAGENET section. If the authors were to expand on section 4.2.2, I would be willing to reconsider my evaluation score.
