This paper presents a novel approach to sparse coding by introducing an explicit regularization method that encourages neighboring datapoints to be encoded using similar dictionary atoms, achieved through KNN clustering in the input space. Although the resulting algorithm is complex and computationally expensive, the authors provide thorough derivations and demonstrate convergence using proximal gradient descent methods, with detailed explanations for the algorithm's design motivation. 
The paper's writing is clear, but the experimental results, described as "extensive" in the abstract, are less convincing due to the use of relatively small datasets (USPS handwritten digits, COIL-20, COIL-100, and UCI) and modest dictionary sizes (p=100 to p=500), which is surprising given the claim of an efficient CUDA C++ implementation. Furthermore, the reported improvements over standard sparse coding in image retrieval/clustering tasks, measured by accuracy and normalized mutual information, are minimal (often less than 1% in NMI, with more promising results in accuracy). The methodology also raises questions, as it appears that the test set was used for hyperparameter selection (choosing the best similarity measure for the clustering step), and there are no comparisons to other state-of-the-art image clustering methods.
Beyond its application in small-scale image clustering, it would be beneficial to directly assess the sparse coding approach's properties, such as reconstruction error, sparsity, or even denoising performance, to provide a more comprehensive evaluation. In its current form, the paper lacks sufficient experimental evidence to support its claims for publication in ICLR. While the proposed regularization direction is intuitively appealing, the experiments do not convincingly demonstrate its effectiveness, and the modest improvements in the clustering task, where the proposed method is used as a feature extractor, do not strongly support the paper's contributions.
