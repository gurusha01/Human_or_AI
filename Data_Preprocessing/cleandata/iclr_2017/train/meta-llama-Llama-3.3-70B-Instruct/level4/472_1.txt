This study presents a novel approach to sparse coding by leveraging the a priori known geometry of the data to achieve more consistent results. The underlying concept, which suggests that similar or neighboring data samples should have similar sparse codes in terms of support, is intriguing, albeit not entirely new. The innovation primarily stems from the introduction of an l1-norm regularization term, distinguishing it from other techniques that typically employ l2 regularization.
The authors develop and thoroughly analyze a new algorithm, SRSC, which demonstrates superior clustering performance compared to existing methods based on l2 sparse coding regularization and other schemes. Building upon the principles of LISTA, they further propose an approximate solution, Deep-SRSC, designed as a fast encoder. This concept appears efficient, as evidenced by experiments on USPS data, although its framework bears a strong resemblance to LISTA and would benefit from clearer motivation and a more detailed discussion of the limitations of SRSC.
Overall, the paper is well-structured and comprehensive, offering a new and effective algorithmic implementation. While the core ideas may not be highly original, the actual execution and actual algorithm demonstrate novelty and efficacy, making the paper a valuable contribution to the field.
