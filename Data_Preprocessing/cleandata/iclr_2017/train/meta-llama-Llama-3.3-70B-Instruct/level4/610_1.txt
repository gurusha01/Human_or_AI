This manuscript presents a comprehensive experimental evaluation of the robustness of various defense methods, including RAD, AEC, and its enhanced variant, among others. The study yields intriguing insights, with RAD and distillation emerging as top performers. However, none of the methods demonstrate sufficient resilience against the supplementary attack launched by cg or adam. As an experimental paper, my primary concern lies in its clarity, which is elaborated upon in the comments below.
Strengths:
1. The paper offers a valuable comparative analysis of the performance of the selected methods.
2. The investigation in Section 3.3, focusing on the supplementary attack, is noteworthy. Despite the negative outcome regarding the defense methods, the findings remain thought-provoking.
3. Overall, the manuscript provides interesting and thought-provoking experimental results concerning the chosen methods.
Weaknesses:
1. The paper omits several notable methods from the literature, such as those discussed in papers [1,2], which include additional defense and attack methods.
2. Although the paper presents an extensive list of experimental results, it lacks detailed explanations, such as the specifics of the experiments that yielded the results in Table 5.
3. The contribution of the paper appears limited due to the lack of in-depth analysis and explanation of the experimental results.
4. The proposed improved version of the AEC algorithm does not demonstrate promising results in the experiments.
Minor remarks:
Page 3: Equation (3) is also non-convex, which suggests that the non-convexity of Equation (2) should not be cited as the motivation for Equation (3).
