This submission introduces a "causal regularizer" that encourages the utilization of causal relationships (X -> Y, where X is a feature and Y is the target variable) in predictive models, while penalizing non-causal dependencies that may arise from reverse causation (Y -> X) or confounding (X <- Z -> Y, where Z is a hidden confounder).
Overall, the submission effectively addresses the crucial problem of building causal models in machine learning, demonstrating its application to a heart disease dataset and correctly identifying common causes of heart disease using the proposed causal regularizer.
However, the authors fail to discuss the robustness of their approach with respect to hyper-parameter selection, including both neural network architecture and generative model parameters, which is particularly important when working with medical data.
The experimental evaluation conclusions require more in-depth discussion. For instance, Figure 4.a shows no difference in predictive performance between L1 and causal regularization, but the statistical significance of this result is unclear without error bars. Additionally, Table 3 is difficult to interpret due to the lack of explanation regarding the selection of the 30 rows and the meaning of the red highlighting, making it challenging to assess precision and recall.
The paper's review of previous work on causal classifiers is also inadequate, notably missing the reference "Towards a Learning Theory of Cause-Effect Inference" by Lopez-Paz et al., which explores similar concepts, including the Mother distribution, synthesizing causal data, addressing confounding, and handling discrete data.
On a positive note, the paper is well-written and tackles the essential problem of integrating causal reasoning into machine learning. However, the technical contributions' novelty is modest, and the qualitative evaluation of the results could be significantly expanded. Overall, I am slightly inclined towards acceptance.
While the paper provides sufficient detail for re-implementation, it lacks discussion on the release of the heart failure dataset, which is crucial for reproducibility.
