Summary of the Paper
The paper proposes a novel approach to sequence-to-sequence tasks, specifically text summarization, by introducing a "Read-Again" model and a copy mechanism. The Read-Again model reads the input sequence twice, allowing the encoder to capture the meaning of each word in the context of the entire sentence. The copy mechanism enables the decoder to generate out-of-vocabulary words by copying them from the input sequence. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on the Gigaword dataset and the DUC2004 competition, achieving state-of-the-art performance.
Decision
I decide to accept this paper, with two key reasons: (1) the proposed approach is well-motivated and addresses significant shortcomings in current encoder-decoder models, and (2) the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a clear and well-structured presentation of the proposed approach, including a detailed description of the Read-Again model and the copy mechanism. The authors also provide a thorough analysis of the experimental results, including an evaluation of the impact of the copy mechanism on reducing the decoder vocabulary size and improving performance. The paper is well-placed in the literature, building on existing work in sequence-to-sequence tasks and text summarization.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more detailed analysis of the Read-Again model, including an investigation of the impact of the number of reading passes on performance. Additionally, the authors could explore the application of their approach to other sequence-to-sequence tasks, such as machine translation. I would also like to see more examples of the copy mechanism in action, including an analysis of the types of words that are most commonly copied.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like to ask the authors the following questions: (1) How do the authors plan to extend their approach to handle larger input sequences, such as documents or articles? (2) Can the authors provide more insight into the types of words that are most commonly copied by the copy mechanism, and how this relates to the performance of the model? (3) How do the authors plan to explore the application of their approach to other sequence-to-sequence tasks, such as machine translation?
