Summary of the Paper
The paper proposes a novel approach to learning bilingual word vectors offline, leveraging the concept of orthogonal transformations to align vector spaces. The authors introduce a new "inverted softmax" method to improve the accuracy of translation predictions and demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach using various experiments.
Decision
I decide to Accept this paper, with the primary reason being the significant improvement in translation precision achieved by the proposed method. The paper presents a well-motivated approach, grounded in theoretical insights, and provides comprehensive experimental evaluations to support its claims.
Supporting Arguments
The paper tackles a specific question in the field of bilingual word vectors, providing a clear and well-structured solution. The approach is well-placed in the literature, building upon existing work and addressing limitations of previous methods. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving state-of-the-art performance in various settings.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest the authors consider providing more detailed analysis of the "inverted softmax" method, including its relationship to existing approaches and potential limitations. Additionally, exploring the applicability of the proposed method to other languages and domains could strengthen the paper's contributions.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to address the following questions:
1. Can you provide more insight into the choice of hyperparameters for the "inverted softmax" method, and how they were optimized?
2. How do the authors plan to address potential scalability issues when applying the proposed method to larger datasets or more diverse language pairs?
3. Are there any plans to explore the use of the proposed method in other NLP tasks, such as machine translation or text classification?
