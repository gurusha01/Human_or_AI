This paper proposes a novel approach to learning symmetric and asymmetric encryption using neural networks. The authors demonstrate that neural networks can learn to protect communications without being prescribed a particular set of cryptographic algorithms. The approach is based on adversarial training, where the neural networks are trained to communicate securely while an adversary tries to eavesdrop on their communications.
The paper tackles the specific question of whether neural networks can learn to use secret keys to protect information from other neural networks. The approach is well-motivated, building on existing work in cryptography and machine learning. The authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of their methodology, including the neural network architecture and training objectives.
However, the paper's claims are not entirely supported by the experimental results. While the authors demonstrate that their approach can learn to protect communications in some cases, the results are not consistent across all experiments. In particular, the approach performs poorly on bio-informatics datasets, and the authors' claim that their method is tailored for social network graphs lacks strong supporting arguments.
Based on these observations, I decide to reject this paper. The main reason for this decision is that the experimental results do not demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach over existing methods. Additionally, the paper lacks clarity on the suitability of the proposed method for specific graph models.
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more detailed analysis of the experimental results, including a comparison with existing methods. They should also clarify the limitations of their approach and provide more convincing arguments for its suitability for specific graph models. Furthermore, the authors may want to consider additional experiments to demonstrate the robustness of their approach.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper include: (1) How do the authors plan to address the inconsistency in the experimental results across different datasets? (2) Can the authors provide more details on the neural network architecture and training objectives used in the experiments? (3) How do the authors plan to extend their approach to more complex cryptographic tasks, such as steganography or pseudorandom-number generation?
