Summary
The paper proposes a novel approach to understanding the behavior of deep neural networks by introducing the concept of preimages, which are the sets of inputs that result in the same output activity at a certain level of the network. The authors demonstrate how to compute these preimages for fully connected multi-layer rectifier networks and show that they form piecewise linear manifolds in the input space. The paper also discusses the implications of this concept for modeling image manifolds and achieving efficient classification.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, with the main reason being that the paper lacks a clear connection to the specific question or problem tackled, and the approach, although novel, is not well-motivated in the context of the current literature.
Supporting Arguments
The paper proposes a differentiable Neural Physics Engine (NPE) that predicts the change in velocity of a focus object based on the state of pairs of objects at two previous time-steps. However, the novelty of the NPE is unclear due to the similar model proposed by Battaglia et al. in 2016. The paper includes all relevant citations but lacks a quantitative and qualitative comparison with Battaglia et al.'s work. The experiments are limited to bouncing balls and lack comparison to other works such as Fragkiadaki et al. The evaluation of the NPE is limited to error in velocity, and a more comprehensive error analysis with respect to ground truth ball position would be more enlightening.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide a clearer motivation for their approach and demonstrate its advantages over existing methods. They should also provide more comprehensive experiments and evaluations, including comparisons to other works and more detailed error analyses. Additionally, the authors should consider the practical advantages and potential applications of their approach, especially compared to other approaches that couple vision with learning dynamics.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper and provide additional evidence for my assessment, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
1. How does the proposed NPE differ from the model proposed by Battaglia et al. in 2016, and what are the advantages of the new approach?
2. Can the authors provide more comprehensive experiments and evaluations, including comparisons to other works and more detailed error analyses?
3. What are the practical advantages and potential applications of the proposed approach, especially compared to other approaches that couple vision with learning dynamics?
