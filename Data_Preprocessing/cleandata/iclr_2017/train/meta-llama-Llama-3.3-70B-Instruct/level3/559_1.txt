Summary
The paper proposes a novel approach to few-shot learning called prototypical networks, which represents each class by the mean of its examples in a learned embedding space. This approach is simpler and more scalable than existing methods, such as matching networks, and achieves competitive results on several benchmark datasets, including Omniglot and miniImageNet. The authors also demonstrate the applicability of their approach to zero-shot learning, achieving state-of-the-art results on the Caltech UCSD birds dataset.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the paper's approach, although simple and efficient, does not offer significant advantages over existing methods, such as matching networks, in terms of performance. Secondly, the experimental results, while competitive, do not demonstrate a substantial improvement over the state-of-the-art, leaving the reviewer unconvinced of the method's advantages.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's approach is based on representing each class by the mean of its examples in a learned embedding space, which is a straightforward and efficient method. However, this approach is not substantially different from existing methods, such as matching networks, which also use a similar idea of representing classes by a distribution over the support set. The paper's results on Omniglot and miniImageNet are competitive, but not significantly better than those of matching networks. Furthermore, the paper's comparison to other methods is limited, and it is unclear how the proposed approach would perform in more challenging scenarios.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, the authors could provide more detailed comparisons to existing methods, including matching networks, and demonstrate the advantages of their approach in more challenging scenarios. Additionally, the authors could explore the use of more advanced techniques, such as attention mechanisms or graph neural networks, to improve the performance of their approach. The authors could also provide more insights into the learned embedding space and the prototypes, and explore the use of their approach in other applications, such as zero-shot learning.
