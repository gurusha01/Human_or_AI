The paper under review introduces a thorough evaluation of various factors that impact the discriminative ability of features extracted from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for instance-level image retrieval tasks. The authors propose a new multi-scale image feature representation method and demonstrate its effectiveness on four benchmark datasets.
However, I decide to reject this paper for the following two key reasons: 
Firstly, the paper's approach, although well-motivated and placed in the literature, lacks clarity in its notation, equation formatting, and variable definitions, making it challenging to understand the model. For instance, the introduction of multiple cost functions and regularization techniques without a clear explanation of the overall cost function minimized by the model raises concerns about the paper's scientific rigor.
Secondly, the paper's results, although promising, are not entirely convincing due to the lack of available code and unclear details, making it difficult to reproduce the model's results and numbers. The absence of a clear and detailed explanation of the network transformations and the overlap in each scale used in the multi-scale approach further exacerbates this issue.
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide clearer notation, equation formatting, and variable definitions. Additionally, they should make their code available and provide more detailed explanations of their methods, including the network transformations and the overlap in each scale. The authors should also consider addressing the inconsistencies in their statements about discrete attention mechanisms and their challenges.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper include: 
1. Can you provide a clearer explanation of the overall cost function minimized by the model, including the role of each cost function and regularization technique introduced?
2. How do you ensure the reproducibility of your results, given the lack of available code and unclear details about your methods?
3. Can you provide more insight into the network transformations used in your approach, including the constraints on the input image size and the minimum size required for extracting features from certain layers? 
By addressing these concerns and providing clearer explanations, the authors can strengthen their paper and demonstrate the effectiveness of their proposed method for instance-level image retrieval tasks.
