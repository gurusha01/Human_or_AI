Summary of the Paper
The paper proposes a novel approach to sequence-to-sequence tasks, specifically text summarization, by introducing a "Read-Again" model and a copy mechanism. The Read-Again model reads the input sequence twice, with the first read biasing the second read to capture the meaning of the input text. The copy mechanism allows the model to handle out-of-vocabulary words by extracting their representations from the input context. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on the Gigaword dataset and DUC competition, achieving state-of-the-art performance.
Decision
I decide to accept this paper, with two key reasons: (1) the paper proposes a well-motivated and novel approach to sequence-to-sequence tasks, and (2) the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
Supporting Arguments
The paper tackles a specific question/problem in the field of natural language processing, namely the limitations of current encoder-decoder models in capturing the meaning of input text. The approach is well-motivated, drawing inspiration from human reading behavior and addressing the limitations of existing models. The experimental results are thorough and demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach over state-of-the-art models.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more analysis on the importance of the Read-Again model and the copy mechanism. For example, they could provide ablation studies to demonstrate the contribution of each component to the overall performance. Additionally, they could discuss the potential applications of their approach to other sequence-to-sequence tasks, such as machine translation.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like to ask the authors the following questions:
1. Can you provide more details on the implementation of the Read-Again model, specifically how the importance weights are computed and used to bias the second read?
2. How do you handle out-of-vocabulary words in the input text, and what is the impact of the copy mechanism on the model's ability to handle such words?
3. Can you provide more analysis on the trade-off between the size of the decoder vocabulary and the performance of the model, and how the copy mechanism affects this trade-off?
