Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper presents a novel approach to analyzing bioacoustic signals using a Bayesian non-parametric formulation of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), specifically the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Hidden Markov Model (HDP-HMM). This approach allows for the automatic identification of song units in bioacoustic signals, which is a crucial step in understanding the behavior and communication patterns of non-human species. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on two real-world bioacoustic datasets, one involving humpback whale songs and the other involving multi-species bird songs.
Decision
Based on the review, I decide to Accept the paper with minor revisions. The paper presents a well-motivated and well-executed approach to analyzing bioacoustic signals, and the results are promising. However, there are some areas that require further clarification and improvement, which are discussed below.
Supporting Arguments
The paper tackles a specific and important problem in bioacoustics, namely the automatic identification of song units in bioacoustic signals. The authors provide a clear and well-motivated introduction to the problem, and the proposed approach is well-placed in the literature. The experimental results are comprehensive and demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach on two real-world datasets. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the technical details.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the computational cost of the approach and its scalability to larger datasets. Additionally, the authors may want to consider comparing their approach to other state-of-the-art methods in bioacoustics, such as deep learning-based approaches. Furthermore, the authors may want to provide more insights into the interpretability of the results, such as the meaning of the identified song units and their relationship to the behavior and communication patterns of the species.
