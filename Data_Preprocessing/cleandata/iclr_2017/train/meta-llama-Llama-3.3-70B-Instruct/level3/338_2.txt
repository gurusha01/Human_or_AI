This paper presents a novel approach to sampling from generative autoencoders, which are a class of deep neural networks that learn to represent data in a probabilistic manner. The authors propose a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling process that allows for sampling from the learned latent distribution, rather than the prior distribution, which is commonly used in practice. This approach is shown to improve the quality of generated samples, particularly when the learned latent distribution is far from the prior.
The paper is well-motivated, and the analysis and evaluation are convincing. The authors provide a clear explanation of the background and related work, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The use of MCMC sampling is a significant contribution, as it allows for sampling from the learned latent distribution, which can lead to more realistic and diverse generated samples.
I decide to Accept this paper, with the main reason being that the approach is well-motivated and the results are convincing. The paper provides a significant contribution to the field of generative modeling, and the proposed approach has the potential to improve the quality of generated samples in a variety of applications.
One potential area for improvement is the interpretation of batch normalization, which is briefly touched on in the paper but not fully explored. Additionally, the explanation of findings from Zeiler & Fergus (2014) using the UIE viewpoint is missing from the paper. However, these are minor points, and the paper is overall well-written and well-structured.
To improve the paper, I would suggest providing more details on the implementation of the MCMC sampling process, as well as more extensive experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach. Additionally, the authors may want to consider exploring the use of other sampling methods, such as importance sampling or rejection sampling, to further improve the quality of generated samples.
I would like the authors to answer the following questions to clarify my understanding of the paper: 
1. Can you provide more details on the implementation of the MCMC sampling process, including the choice of hyperparameters and the number of iterations used?
2. How do you plan to extend this work to other types of generative models, such as GANs or flow-based models?
3. Can you provide more extensive experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, including comparisons to other sampling methods and evaluations on a variety of datasets?
