This paper proposes a novel adversarial learning formulation that enables Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to produce direct energy estimates for samples. The authors introduce a flexible adversarial training framework, which leads to a non-degenerate discriminator that retains density information at the global optimum. The paper provides a rigorous characterization of the learned discriminator in the non-parametric setting and proposes two methods for instantiating it in the typical parametric setting.
The paper addresses a fundamental limitation of GANs, which is their inability to provide sensible energy estimates for samples. The proposed formulation modifies the GAN objective function to make the optimal discriminator an energy function, allowing it to retain fine-grained information about the relative quality of samples. The authors derive the analytic form of the induced solution and analyze its properties, showing that the discriminator can recover the energy of the data distribution.
The experimental results verify the theoretical analysis, demonstrating that the learned discriminator can capture density information and provide a good measure of quality for held-out data. The paper also presents a quantitative comparison of different models, showing that the proposed framework outperforms baseline models in terms of recovering the true data distribution.
I decide to accept this paper because it provides a well-motivated and well-placed approach to addressing the limitation of GANs in evaluating held-out data. The paper's mathematical exposition is elegant, and the results show that the learned discriminator/energy function approximates the log probability of the data on toy data and gives a good measure of quality for held-out data on complex data.
However, I do have some concerns about the practical issues with scalability and accuracy of the proposed approximations, which may limit the applicability of the method. Additionally, the paper's writing has some minor issues, including a potentially incomplete sentence and a title that undersells the significance of the paper's contributions.
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more detailed discussions on the limitations of the proposed method and potential future directions. Additionally, the authors may want to consider providing more quantitative results on the performance of the proposed framework on high-dimensional data.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper include:
* Can the authors provide more intuition on why the proposed formulation leads to a non-degenerate discriminator?
* How do the authors plan to address the practical issues with scalability and accuracy of the proposed approximations?
* Can the authors provide more detailed comparisons with other methods that address the limitation of GANs in evaluating held-out data?
