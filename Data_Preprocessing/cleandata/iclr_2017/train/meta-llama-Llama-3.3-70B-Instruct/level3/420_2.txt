Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper explores the loss surface of deep neural networks, focusing on the topology and geometry of the level sets. The authors provide theoretical results on the connectedness of level sets in single-hidden-layer ReLU networks and introduce a dynamic programming algorithm to approximate geodesics within each level set. The paper also presents numerical experiments on various regression and classification tasks, demonstrating that the optimization of deep learning tasks behaves in a nearly convex fashion up until high accuracy levels.
