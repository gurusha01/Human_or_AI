Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper proposes a novel approach to evaluating automatic dialogue responses using a physiological plausible model of handwriting as a feature representation for sequence generation with recurrent mixture density networks. The authors build on recent results in handwriting prediction and focus on generating sequences that possess the statistical and dynamic qualities of handwriting and calligraphic art forms. The paper presents a system that can learn the parameters for a physiologically plausible model of handwriting from an online dataset, allowing for the capture of both geometry and dynamics of a hand-drawn/written trace with a single representation.
Decision and Reasons
Based on the provided guidelines, I decide to accept this paper. The two key reasons for this choice are:
1. The paper addresses a specific question/problem, namely, evaluating automatic dialogue responses, and proposes a well-motivated approach that is grounded in the literature.
2. The paper supports its claims with a range of experiments that demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach, including predicting virtual targets, dynamic parameters, and style transfer.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's approach is well-motivated, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the Sigma Lognormal model and its application to handwriting synthesis. The experimental section presents a range of experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, including the use of data augmentation to improve performance. The paper also provides a detailed description of the RMDN model details, including the architecture, training objective, and model selection.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more in-depth analysis of the failure cases, such as cases where the proposed approach does not align with human judgment. Additionally, the authors could provide more details on the computational resources required for training the models and the potential applications of the proposed approach in real-world scenarios.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like to ask the authors the following questions:
1. Can you provide more details on the computational resources required for training the models, and how this may impact the scalability of the proposed approach?
2. How do you plan to extend the proposed approach to more complex dialogue response evaluation tasks, such as multi-turn dialogues or dialogues with multiple participants?
3. Can you provide more examples of the style transfer capabilities of the proposed approach, and how this may be useful in real-world applications, such as generating personalized handwriting styles for individuals with motor disorders?
