This paper proposes a new approach to sequence learning, called Incremental Sequence Learning, which involves gradually increasing the length of the sequences used for training as the network learns to predict the earlier parts of the sequences. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on a novel sequence learning task, predicting and classifying MNIST pen stroke sequences, and show that it outperforms other instantiations of curriculum learning.
However, I decide to reject this paper for two main reasons. Firstly, the paper is excessively long, with 17 pages, which makes it difficult to follow and understand the main message. The authors could have shortened the paper to focus on the key contributions and results. Secondly, the proposed incremental learning schedule is not novel, as similar ideas have been tried before, and the only new contribution is the ablation studies conducted by the authors.
The paper's value is also limited by the fact that the authors only test their hypothesis on a single artificially generated dataset, and not on real sequential datasets, which raises questions about the technique's applicability and effectiveness in other scenarios. Additionally, the artificial dataset created by the authors seems to have been designed to support the proposed ideas, rather than providing a meaningful contribution to the field.
To improve the paper, the authors could provide more evidence of the technique's effectiveness on real-world datasets, and clarify the significance of the artificial dataset created for this study. They could also shorten the paper to focus on the key contributions and results, and remove unrelated experiments that contribute to the paper's excessive length.
I would like to ask the authors to clarify the following points: How do the authors plan to address the lack of novelty in their proposed incremental learning schedule? Can they provide more evidence of the technique's effectiveness on real-world datasets? How do the authors respond to the criticism that the artificial dataset created for this study is not a meaningful contribution to the field? What are the potential applications of the proposed technique, and how do the authors plan to explore them in future work?
