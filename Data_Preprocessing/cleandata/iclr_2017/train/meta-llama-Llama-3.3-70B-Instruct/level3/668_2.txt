Summary
The paper proposes a novel approach to sentiment analysis by incorporating local contexts with a global context attention mechanism. The model, inspired by human reading behavior, uses a bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) network to extract a rough global context representation, which is then used as attention to selectively focus on important local contexts. The authors evaluate their model on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness in achieving state-of-the-art results.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, with the primary reason being the lack of proper contextualization within the existing machine learning research landscape. The paper introduces the idea of regularizing the estimator of a probability distribution to prefer high-entropy distributions as if it were new, despite many papers including scaled entropy terms in optimization objectives. Additionally, the experimental results, although good, lack significance tests and error analysis to confirm the model's improvements are robust and not due to a small test set.
Supporting Arguments
The idea of preferring parameters that jointly lead to a plausible distribution is natural and sound, with potentially unexplored applications in neural networks. However, the paper's failure to acknowledge and build upon existing research in this area is a significant drawback. Furthermore, the lack of rigorous evaluation and analysis of the results undermines the confidence in the model's performance.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, I suggest the authors prioritize proper contextualization and careful evaluation. They should thoroughly review existing research on regularization techniques, entropy-based optimization objectives, and attention mechanisms in neural networks. Additionally, they should conduct more comprehensive experiments, including significance tests and error analysis, to demonstrate the robustness of their model. The authors may also consider exploring the applications of their approach in other NLP tasks, such as machine translation or question answering, to further demonstrate its effectiveness.
Questions for the Authors
1. How do the authors plan to address the lack of contextualization and acknowledge existing research in the area of regularization techniques and entropy-based optimization objectives?
2. Can the authors provide more detailed analysis and visualization of the attention weights to further demonstrate the effectiveness of their global-local context attention mechanism?
3. How do the authors plan to extend their approach to other NLP tasks, and what potential challenges or limitations do they anticipate in doing so?
