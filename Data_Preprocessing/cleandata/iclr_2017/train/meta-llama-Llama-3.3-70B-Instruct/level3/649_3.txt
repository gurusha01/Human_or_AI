The paper presents a thorough investigation into the role of syntactic dependencies in unsupervised word representation learning models, exploring the impact of bound and unbound representations for context at training time. This systematic study aims to shed light on the optimal definition of context, a crucial aspect of word embedding models. The authors' contribution is commendable, as they conduct comprehensive experiments across 21 datasets and 4 tasks, providing valuable insights into context selection.
Based on my evaluation, I decide to Reject this paper, primarily due to its narrow focus on a specific NLP detail and the lack of novel methods consistently outperforming existing ones, resulting in primarily negative results. These factors make the paper less suitable for the ICLR community, which tends to favor more broadly impactful and innovative research.
The approach is well-motivated, and the paper is sound in its methodology. However, the empirical results are mixed, and the absence of a clear breakthrough or significant improvement over existing methods limits the paper's appeal. The authors' systematic investigation is praiseworthy, but the negative results and narrow focus reduce the paper's potential to inspire new research directions or contribute substantially to the field.
To improve the paper, I suggest the authors consider broadening their investigation to explore more diverse context types and representations or integrating their findings with other NLP tasks to demonstrate a more significant impact. Additionally, providing more in-depth analysis of the negative results could offer valuable insights into the limitations of current word embedding models.
To clarify my understanding and assess the paper more confidently, I would like the authors to answer the following questions: What motivated the choice of specific syntactic dependencies and context representations explored in the paper? How do the authors envision their findings being used as a guideline for choosing context in future research, given the mixed results? Are there any plans to expand the investigation to other NLP tasks or explore more innovative context definitions that could lead to more positive outcomes?
