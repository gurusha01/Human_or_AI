Summary
The paper proposes a method to compute the preimage of activities at arbitrary levels in a deep rectifier network, which is the set of inputs that result in the same node activity. The authors demonstrate that these preimages are piecewise linear manifolds in the input space and can be used to understand the efficiency of deep learning networks. They also discuss the implications of their findings for modeling image manifolds and achieving efficient classification.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, with the main reason being that the results and preimage construction are not clearly explained, making it difficult to understand the underlying mechanism behind the models. Additionally, the paper lacks concrete evidence and empirical results to support the claims made.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a theoretical framework for computing preimages, but it is unclear how this framework can be applied in practice. The authors mention that the preimages can be used to understand the efficiency of deep learning networks, but they do not provide any concrete examples or empirical results to support this claim. Furthermore, the paper assumes that the preimages are piecewise linear manifolds, but it is not clear how this assumption is justified.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, the authors should provide more concrete examples and empirical results to support their claims. They should also clarify the relationship between the preimages and the efficiency of deep learning networks. Additionally, the authors should consider providing more details on how the preimages can be computed in practice, including any potential challenges or limitations.
