Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper proposes a novel approach to understanding the loss surface of deep neural networks, focusing on the topological and geometrical aspects of the optimization landscape. The authors provide new theoretical results that quantify the amount of uphill climbing required to progress to lower energy configurations in single hidden-layer ReLU networks and prove that this amount converges to zero with overparametrization under mild conditions. They also introduce a dynamic programming algorithm, Dynamic String Sampling, to efficiently approximate geodesics within each level set, providing a tool to verify the connectedness of level sets and estimate their geometric regularity.
