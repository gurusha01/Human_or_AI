This paper proposes a novel optimization algorithm called Entropy-SGD for training deep neural networks. The algorithm is motivated by the local geometry of the energy landscape and aims to exploit the phenomenon of wide valleys in the energy landscape, which are known to generalize better. The authors introduce the concept of local entropy, which measures the flatness of the energy landscape, and use it to modify the original loss function. The resulting algorithm, Entropy-SGD, uses stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics to estimate the gradient of local entropy and updates the parameters accordingly.
The paper addresses the problem of transferring a policy learned in a simulator to a real-world system by using an ensemble of simulated source domains and adversarial training. However, the proposed approach in this paper is different and focuses on optimizing deep neural networks using local entropy. The authors provide a clear motivation for their approach, discussing the limitations of existing optimization algorithms and the benefits of exploiting the local geometry of the energy landscape.
The paper is well-organized, and the authors provide a detailed explanation of their approach, including the mathematical derivations and implementation details. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of Entropy-SGD in training deep neural networks, including convolutional and recurrent neural networks, and show that it compares favorably to state-of-the-art techniques in terms of generalization error and training time.
To evaluate this paper, I will answer the three key questions:
1. What is the specific question/problem tackled by the paper?

2. Is the approach well-motivated, including being well-placed in the literature?
The approach is well-motivated, and the authors provide a clear discussion of the limitations of existing optimization algorithms and the benefits of exploiting the local geometry of the energy landscape. The paper is well-placed in the literature, and the authors provide a thorough review of related work.
3. Does the paper support the claims?
The paper provides a detailed explanation of the approach, including mathematical derivations and implementation details. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of Entropy-SGD in training deep neural networks, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of the results.
Based on these questions, I decide to accept this paper. The paper proposes a novel and well-motivated approach to optimizing deep neural networks, and the experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness.
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the implementation of Entropy-SGD, including the choice of hyperparameters and the computational resources required. Additionally, the authors could provide more analysis on the theoretical properties of Entropy-SGD, including its convergence properties and the relationship to other optimization algorithms.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer include:
* How does the choice of hyperparameters, such as the learning rate and the scope, affect the performance of Entropy-SGD?
* Can the authors provide more analysis on the theoretical properties of Entropy-SGD, including its convergence properties and the relationship to other optimization algorithms?
* How does Entropy-SGD compare to other optimization algorithms, such as stochastic gradient descent and Adam, in terms of computational resources and training time?
