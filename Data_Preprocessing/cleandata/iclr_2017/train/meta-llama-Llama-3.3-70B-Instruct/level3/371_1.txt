Summary of the Paper's Contributions
This paper presents a novel approach to understanding the behavior of deep neural networks, specifically focusing on the concept of "preimages" - the set of inputs that result in the same output activity at a certain level of the network. The authors demonstrate how to compute these preimages for fully connected multi-layer rectifier networks and show that they form piecewise linear manifolds in the input space. This work has significant implications for understanding how deep networks learn to represent and classify data.
Decision: Accept
I decide to accept this paper due to its well-motivated approach, clear and concise writing, and significant contributions to the field of deep learning. The paper tackles a specific and important question in the field, namely, how to understand the behavior of deep neural networks, and provides a novel and well-supported solution.
Supporting Arguments
The paper is well-motivated, with a clear introduction to the problem of understanding deep neural networks and a thorough review of related work. The authors provide a detailed and easy-to-follow explanation of their approach, including a step-by-step procedure for computing preimages. The paper also includes a number of informative figures and examples that help to illustrate the concepts and results. The authors demonstrate the importance of their work by showing how preimages can be used to understand the behavior of deep networks and how they can be used to improve the efficiency of network training.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors consider adding more empirical results to demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach. Additionally, it would be helpful to include a more detailed discussion of the limitations and potential applications of their work. The authors may also want to consider exploring the relationship between preimages and other concepts in deep learning, such as adversarial examples.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
1. Can you provide more details on how the preimage concept can be used to improve the efficiency of network training?
2. How do the authors plan to extend their work to convolutional neural networks, and what challenges do they anticipate in doing so?
3. Can you provide more insight into the relationship between preimages and adversarial examples, and how the preimage concept can be used to understand and mitigate the effects of adversarial attacks?
