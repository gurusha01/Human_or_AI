This paper proposes a novel approach to address the instability issue in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) by enabling the generator to anticipate the discriminator's decision boundary evolution. The authors introduce a flexible adversarial training framework that ensures the generator converges to the true data distribution while allowing the discriminator to retain density information at the global optimum.
The paper is well-written, and the experiments are supportive of the proposed approach. However, I have some doubts about the method's success due to potential alternative procedures and implementation dependencies. Specifically, I question whether the same effect can be achieved by training the discriminator for an extended number of steps and then undoing those updates. Additionally, my attempt to reproduce the results using a fully connected network instead of an RNN generator was unsuccessful, suggesting potential dependencies on specific discriminator and generator forms.
To answer the three key questions for myself:
1. The specific question/problem tackled by the paper is the instability issue in GANs, which is addressed by proposing a novel adversarial training framework.
2. The approach is well-motivated, and the paper provides a thorough analysis of the proposed formulation, including its connection to existing alternatives.
3. The paper supports its claims with empirical results, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in capturing density information and generating high-quality samples.
Based on these considerations, I decide to Reject the paper, primarily due to the concerns about the method's robustness and potential dependencies on specific implementation choices.
To improve the paper, I suggest the authors:
* Investigate alternative procedures, such as training the discriminator for an extended number of steps, to determine if the proposed approach is truly necessary.
* Provide more detailed analysis of the implementation dependencies and potential limitations of the proposed approach.
* Consider additional experiments to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed approach across different discriminator and generator forms.
Questions for the authors:
* Can you provide more insight into why the proposed approach is necessary, and how it differs from alternative procedures?
* How do you plan to address the potential dependencies on specific implementation choices, and what additional experiments can be done to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed approach?
* Can you provide more details on the experimental setup and hyperparameter choices, to facilitate reproducibility and comparison with other methods?
