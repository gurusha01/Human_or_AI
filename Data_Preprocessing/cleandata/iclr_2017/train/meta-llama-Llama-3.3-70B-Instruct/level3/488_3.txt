Summary of the Paper
This paper proposes a novel approach to constructing a phylogenetic tree, also known as the Tree of Life, using the deep representation of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) trained for image classification. The authors leverage the hierarchical feature representation learned by deep networks to quantify the visual similarity of species and construct a tree of life. The paper presents a simple yet effective approach that can be easily applied to various biological species, including those not in the training categories.
Decision
Based on the review, I decide to Accept this paper with minor revisions. The paper tackles a specific and interesting problem, and the approach is well-motivated and well-placed in the literature. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, and the paper provides new insights into the deep representation of neural networks.
Supporting Arguments
The paper presents a clear and concise introduction to the problem of constructing a phylogenetic tree and the motivation behind using deep learning techniques. The proposed method is well-explained, and the experimental results are thorough and convincing. The paper also provides a good discussion of the related work and the potential applications of the proposed approach in Bioinformatics.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, I suggest the following:
* Include a Support Vector Machine (SVM) baseline in the experimental results for comparison with the proposed method, such as the one by S Wang and C Manning 2012.
* Consider alternative baseline methods, such as dropping words or masking noise, which may be more effective than dropout or Gaussian noise for text applications.
* Provide more details on the hyperparameter tuning process, especially for the epsilon value in the virtual adversarial training method.
* Draw parallels between adversarial training and other techniques, such as transductive SVM and contrastive divergence, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the proposed method.
* Reference related work, including papers on marginalized denoising autoencoders, stacked denoising autoencoders, and learning invariant features through local space contraction, to provide context and background for the proposed approach.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper and provide additional evidence for my assessment, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
* Can you provide more details on the data collection process and the criteria used to select the species for the experiments?
* How did you determine the optimal value of epsilon for the virtual adversarial training method?
* Can you provide more insights into the differences between the proposed method and other approaches, such as the SVM baseline, and how they relate to the problem of constructing a phylogenetic tree?
