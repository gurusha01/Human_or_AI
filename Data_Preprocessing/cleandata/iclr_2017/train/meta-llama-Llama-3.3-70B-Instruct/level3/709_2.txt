Summary
The paper proposes a novel perspective on Highway and Residual networks, suggesting that they perform unrolled iterative estimation. This view posits that successive layers within a stage cooperate to compute a single level of representation, with the first layer providing a rough estimate that is then iteratively refined by subsequent layers. The authors derive both Residual and Highway networks from this perspective, providing a unified theory for understanding these architectures. They also present experimental results comparing the performance of Highway and Residual networks on image classification and language modeling tasks.
Decision
I decide to accept this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the paper presents a well-motivated and well-placed contribution to the literature, providing a new perspective on Highway and Residual networks that challenges the traditional representation view. Secondly, the paper supports its claims with compelling evidence, including derivations and experimental results that demonstrate the validity of the unrolled iterative estimation perspective.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's contribution is well-motivated by the limitations of the traditional representation view, which assumes that each layer computes a new level of abstraction. The authors provide a clear and concise overview of the representation view and its limitations, setting the stage for their proposed alternative. The derivation of Residual and Highway networks from the unrolled iterative estimation perspective is also well-executed, providing a unified theory for understanding these architectures. The experimental results presented in the paper are also convincing, demonstrating that Highway and Residual networks can achieve similar performance on image classification and language modeling tasks.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more detailed analysis of the implications of the unrolled iterative estimation perspective for network design and optimization. For example, how does this perspective inform the choice of hyperparameters, such as the number of layers and the learning rate? Additionally, the authors may want to consider exploring the relationships between the unrolled iterative estimation perspective and other recent advances in deep learning, such as attention mechanisms and graph neural networks.
Questions for the Authors
I would like the authors to clarify the following points:
1. How do the authors envision the unrolled iterative estimation perspective informing the design of new neural network architectures?
2. Can the authors provide more detailed analysis of the experimental results, including ablation studies and sensitivity analysis to hyperparameters?
3. How do the authors see the unrolled iterative estimation perspective relating to other recent advances in deep learning, such as attention mechanisms and graph neural networks?
