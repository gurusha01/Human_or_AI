Summary of the Paper's Claims and Contributions
The paper presents a novel perspective on Highway and Residual networks, proposing that they perform unrolled iterative estimation. This view posits that successive layers within a stage cooperate to compute a single level of representation, with the first layer providing a rough estimate that is then iteratively refined by subsequent layers. The authors derive both Residual and Highway networks from this perspective, providing a unified theory for understanding these architectures. They also present experimental results comparing the performance of Highway and Residual networks on image classification and language modeling tasks, finding that they achieve similar results when the number of parameters is equal.
Decision and Key Reasons
Based on the provided guidelines, I decide to Reject this paper. The two key reasons for this decision are:
1. Lack of Baseline Comparison: The paper does not provide a thorough comparison with a baseline model without gates, such as a convolution/pooling layer-based model, to test the merit of the proposed method.
2. Insufficient Analysis of Parameter Count: The authors do not adequately analyze whether the number of parameters in the proposed model is comparable to those in the baseline models, which is crucial for a fair comparison.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's contribution to the understanding of Highway and Residual networks is valuable, and the experimental results are interesting. However, the lack of a thorough baseline comparison and insufficient analysis of parameter count limit the paper's impact. Additionally, the paper's claims about the importance of gating in certain tasks are not fully supported by the experimental results.
Additional Feedback and Questions
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors:
* Provide a thorough comparison with a baseline model without gates to test the merit of the proposed method.
* Analyze the number of parameters in the proposed model and compare it to the baseline models.
* Clarify the implications of the iterative estimation view for the design of neural network architectures.
* Provide more detailed experimental results, including error bars and statistical significance tests.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper are:
* How do the authors plan to address the lack of baseline comparison in future work?
* Can the authors provide more insight into the relationship between the number of parameters and the performance of the proposed model?
* How do the authors think the iterative estimation view can be applied to other neural network architectures beyond Highway and Residual networks?
