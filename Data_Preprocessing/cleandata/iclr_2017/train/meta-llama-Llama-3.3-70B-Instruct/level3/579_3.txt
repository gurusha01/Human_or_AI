The paper presents a novel approach to time series prediction by introducing a hybrid architecture that combines a 1D convnet and an LSTM. The authors have done a good job of including additional references and baseline experiments, which strengthens the paper. However, the paper still has several methodology flaws that need to be addressed.
I decide to reject this paper for two main reasons. Firstly, the methodology has several flaws, including predicting slope and duration separately instead of jointly, which may lead to suboptimal results. Secondly, the paper lacks a clear evaluation metric, such as predicting time series at specific horizons, and fails to consider the impact of predictions on decision-making, such as trading strategies.
To support my decision, I provide the following arguments. The paper's approach to predicting slope and duration separately may not be the most effective way to model time series data. Additionally, the lack of a clear evaluation metric makes it difficult to assess the performance of the proposed model. The paper also fails to consider the impact of predictions on decision-making, which is a critical aspect of time series forecasting.
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors consider the following feedback. Firstly, they should revisit their methodology and consider predicting slope and duration jointly. Secondly, they should establish a clear evaluation metric that takes into account the specific requirements of time series forecasting. Finally, they should provide more detailed experiments and results to demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach.
I would like the authors to answer the following questions to clarify my understanding of the paper. How do the authors plan to address the methodology flaws, particularly with regards to predicting slope and duration separately? How do the authors propose to establish a clear evaluation metric that takes into account the specific requirements of time series forecasting? What additional experiments and results can the authors provide to demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach? 
In terms of the conference guidelines, I have considered the following three key questions. Firstly, the specific question or problem tackled by the paper is time series prediction using a hybrid architecture. Secondly, the approach is not well-motivated, as it has several methodology flaws and lacks a clear evaluation metric. Thirdly, the paper does not support its claims, as the results are not convincing and the approach has several limitations. 
Overall, while the paper presents an interesting approach to time series prediction, it has several methodology flaws and lacks a clear evaluation metric, which leads me to reject it. With revisions to address these issues, the paper may be reconsidered for acceptance.
