Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper proposes a novel method for learning vision features as intermediate rewards for robot training in the real world using pre-trained deep models and human demonstrations. The approach involves segmenting demonstration sequences into fragments, clustering, and finding discriminative features to use as reward functions. This method is simple yet effective, and the paper demonstrates its efficacy on two real-world tasks: door opening and liquid pouring.
Decision and Key Reasons
Based on the review, I decide to Accept the paper with minor revisions. The key reasons for this decision are:
1. The paper tackles a specific and important problem in robot learning, namely, designing reward functions for complex tasks.
2. The approach is well-motivated and grounded in the literature, leveraging pre-trained deep models and human demonstrations to learn vision features as rewards.
3. The paper provides empirical evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed method on two real-world tasks, demonstrating its potential for real-world applications.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's contributions are significant, as they address a critical challenge in robot learning. The proposed method is simple, efficient, and scalable, making it suitable for real-world applications. The empirical results demonstrate the efficacy of the approach, showing that the learned reward functions can be used to learn complex tasks, such as door opening and liquid pouring.
Additional Feedback and Questions
To further improve the paper, I suggest the following:
1. Provide more detailed analysis of the results, including error bars and stronger baselines, particularly in vision-related areas.
2. Consider using simpler vision-based approaches, such as random or basic feature extraction, as baselines for comparison.
3. Clarify the choice of baselines, including the random reward in Table 2, and provide more justification for their selection.
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
1. Can you provide more details on the feature selection algorithm used in Appendix A.3, including the choice of hyperparameters and the rationale behind the scoring heuristic?
2. How do you plan to address the potential limitations of the proposed method, such as the reliance on pre-trained deep models and the need for human demonstrations?
3. Can you provide more insights into the potential applications of the proposed method, including its potential for lifelong learning and its scalability to more complex tasks?
