This paper proposes a novel approach to object recognition, introducing Compositional Kernel Machines (CKMs) as an alternative to deep architectures and other kernel methods. The authors claim that CKMs can mitigate the curse of dimensionality and improve sample complexity by representing a discriminant function as a sum-product function over an exponential set of virtual instances. The paper provides a thorough definition of CKMs, explores their properties, and presents promising results on the NORB dataset.
I decide to accept this paper, with the primary reason being the originality and potential impact of the proposed approach. The authors provide a well-motivated and well-placed contribution in the literature, addressing the limitations of current deep architectures and kernel methods. The paper supports its claims with theoretical and empirical results, demonstrating the effectiveness of CKMs in various scenarios.
The key strengths of the paper include the clear and concise definition of CKMs, the efficient computation of the discriminant function using sum-product functions, and the promising results on the NORB dataset. The authors also provide a thorough discussion of the relationship between CKMs and other methods, such as reinforcement learning and classifiers with uncertain labels.
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide additional references to related work, particularly in the areas of reinforcement learning and uncertain labels. Additionally, the authors could clarify the type of classifier used in the experiments and compare the performance of CKMs with deterministic counterparts. Some technical issues, such as a missing "-" sign in an equation, should also be addressed.
I would like to ask the authors to clarify the following points: (1) How do the authors plan to extend CKMs to other domains, such as structured prediction and regression problems? (2) Can the authors provide more insights into the computational advantages of CKMs compared to deep architectures? (3) How do the authors envision the integration of symmetry transformations into the CKM architecture, and what potential benefits can be expected from this integration? 
Overall, the paper presents an interesting and original approach to object recognition, and with some clarifications and improvements, it has the potential to make a significant impact in the field.
