The paper presents a method for learning reward functions from a limited number of demonstrations, leveraging the abstraction power of intermediate visual representations learned by deep models. The approach is well-motivated, attempting to transfer priors learned from object classification tasks to address the problem of limited training examples. The use of unsupervised video segmentation to identify subtasks is a good starting point, but it lacks comparison to prior works in the domain.
The paper's method shows promise in achieving comparable performance with fully instrumented methods, but it is limited by its assumption that demonstrations follow a specific set of constraints. The experimental evaluation of the unsupervised temporal video segmentation approach is limited, with only a simple random baseline compared for a few sample videos. The paper's hypothesis that sparse independent features exist to discriminate unseen inputs is not experimentally well-demonstrated, and comparison to a simple linear classifier for subtasks would have been useful to validate the hypothesis.
Based on these points, I decide to reject the paper. The main reasons for this decision are the limited experimental evaluation and the lack of comparison to prior works in the domain. The paper's approach is simple and efficient, but it needs to be analyzed and compared with better baselines to establish its effectiveness.
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide a more comprehensive experimental evaluation, including comparisons to state-of-the-art methods in the domain. Additionally, the authors should consider validating their hypothesis about sparse independent features through more rigorous experiments. The paper could also benefit from a more detailed analysis of the limitations of the approach and potential avenues for future work.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper include: How do the authors plan to address the limitation of assuming specific constraints on the demonstrations? Can the authors provide more details on the feature selection algorithm and its hyperparameters? How do the authors plan to extend the approach to more complex tasks and larger datasets?
