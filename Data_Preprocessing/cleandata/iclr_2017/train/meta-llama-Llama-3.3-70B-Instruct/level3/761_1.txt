Summary
The paper proposes an innovative approach to learning static analysis of source code by introducing a simple toy programming language. The authors aim to determine if variables are defined before use and experiment with various sequence classification models, including a novel model using a "differentiable set" to track defined variables. This concept has the potential to contribute significantly to the field of static analysis, and the experimental setup is reasonable.
Decision
I decide to Reject this paper, with the primary reason being that the setup and models proposed are overly simplistic and may not address the challenges of learning a static analyzer for real-world scenarios. Additionally, the paper raises important questions about the reasoning patterns needed to solve these problems, but the current approach may not be sufficient to provide conclusive answers.
Supporting Arguments
While the paper is an interesting start, it lacks the complexity and depth required to tackle real-world static analysis problems. The authors' experimental setup, although reasonable, is limited in its scope and may not generalize well to more complex programming languages and scenarios. Furthermore, the paper's focus on a simple toy programming language may not be representative of the challenges faced in real-world static analysis.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors consider expanding their setup to analyze more code properties and leverage the strengths of machine learning. This could involve experimenting with more complex programming languages, incorporating additional features such as control flow and data flow analysis, and exploring the application of their approach to real-world scenarios. I would like to see more discussion on the potential limitations of the "differentiable set" model and how it can be improved to handle more complex programming constructs.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper and provide additional evidence, I would like the authors to answer the following questions: (1) How do the authors plan to extend their approach to handle more complex programming languages and scenarios? (2) What are the potential limitations of the "differentiable set" model, and how can it be improved to handle more complex programming constructs? (3) Can the authors provide more insights into the reasoning patterns needed to solve these problems, and how their approach can be used to inform the development of more advanced static analysis tools?
