Summary of the Paper's Contributions
This paper proposes a novel approach to constructing a tree of life for biological species using the deep representation of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained for image classification. The authors leverage the hierarchical feature representation learned by deep networks to quantify the visual similarity of species and construct a tree of life. The paper also provides insight into the representations produced by deep neural networks, demonstrating their potential for novel applications in bioinformatics.
Decision and Key Reasons
I decide to accept this paper, with two key reasons: (1) the paper tackles a specific and interesting problem in bioinformatics, and (2) the approach is well-motivated and supported by empirical results. The use of deep learning techniques to construct a tree of life is a novel and promising direction, and the authors provide a clear and well-structured presentation of their method and results.
Supporting Arguments
The paper is well-organized, and the authors provide a clear introduction to the problem and their approach. The methodology is sound, and the experiments are thorough and well-designed. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in constructing a tree of life for various biological species, and the comparison with human-built trees shows that the method is competitive. The paper also provides a good discussion of the limitations and potential future directions.
Additional Feedback and Questions
To further improve the paper, I would suggest providing more details on the interpretation of the results and the implications of the proposed approach for bioinformatics. Additionally, it would be interesting to see a more thorough comparison with other methods, such as traditional phylogenetic tree construction methods. I would like the authors to answer the following questions: (1) How do the authors plan to address the limitation of requiring a large number of images for each species? (2) Can the authors provide more insight into the features learned by the CNNs that are relevant for constructing the tree of life? (3) How do the authors envision the proposed approach being used in practice, and what are the potential applications in bioinformatics?
