Summary
The paper presents a novel approach to learning multi-sense word embeddings using a multi-view Bayesian non-parametric algorithm. The approach leverages multilingual distributional information to disambiguate words in English, allowing for the combination of multiple parallel corpora to obtain a large multilingual corpus. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through extensive experiments on word sense induction and contextual word similarity tasks.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the paper does not address the specific question of bioacoustic segmentation using Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Hidden Markov Models, as stated in the key points. Instead, it presents a completely different approach to learning multi-sense word embeddings. Secondly, the writing quality of the paper is poor, with many grammatical errors and awkwardly constructed sentences, which makes it difficult to follow and understand the authors' arguments.
Supporting Arguments
The paper fails to provide convincing results on the bioacoustic segmentation task, and instead presents a new approach to learning multi-sense word embeddings. While the approach may be novel and effective, it does not address the original research question. Furthermore, the poor writing quality of the paper makes it difficult to evaluate the authors' claims and arguments.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, the authors should focus on addressing the original research question and provide clear and convincing results on the bioacoustic segmentation task. Additionally, they should revise the paper to improve its writing quality, clarity, and organization. The authors may also consider providing more detailed explanations of their approach and its limitations, as well as more extensive evaluations of their method.
Questions for the Authors
I would like the authors to clarify how their approach relates to the original research question of bioacoustic segmentation using Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Hidden Markov Models. I would also like them to provide more detailed explanations of their approach and its limitations, as well as more extensive evaluations of their method. Specifically, I would like to know:
* How does the authors' approach to learning multi-sense word embeddings relate to the bioacoustic segmentation task?
* What are the limitations of the authors' approach, and how do they plan to address them in future work?
* Can the authors provide more extensive evaluations of their method, including comparisons to other state-of-the-art approaches?
