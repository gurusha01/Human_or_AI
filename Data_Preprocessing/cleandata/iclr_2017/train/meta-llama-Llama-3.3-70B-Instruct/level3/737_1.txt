Summary
The paper proposes a novel method for finding dependent subspaces across multiple views of data, with a focus on preserving neighborhood relationships. The approach directly maximizes the similarity of neighborhoods between subspaces of each view, using a well-defined objective function that favors sparse and informative neighborhoods. The method is shown to outperform traditional Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) and other state-of-the-art methods in experiments on artificial and real-world data sets.
Decision
I decide to Accept this paper, with two key reasons: (1) the proposal presents a well-motivated and novel approach to finding dependent subspaces, and (2) the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the method in preserving neighborhood relationships and outperforming other methods.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a clear and well-structured presentation of the proposed method, including a detailed description of the objective function, optimization technique, and experimental setup. The authors demonstrate a good understanding of the related work and provide a thorough comparison with other methods. The experimental results are convincing, showing the proposed method's ability to find dependent subspaces with strong invariance properties and nonlinear dependencies.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest the authors provide more insight into the factors contributing to the success of their method, such as the choice of neighborhood distribution and the optimization technique. Additionally, it would be helpful to include more detailed analysis of the results, such as visualizations of the found subspaces and discussions of the implications of the results. Furthermore, the authors may consider extending their method to handle nonlinear transformations and comparing it with other nonlinear CCA variants.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
1. Can you provide more details on the choice of the neighborhood distribution and the optimization technique, and how they affect the performance of the method?
2. How do you plan to extend your method to handle nonlinear transformations, and what are the potential challenges and benefits of doing so?
3. Can you provide more visualizations and analysis of the found subspaces, to help understand the results and implications of the method?
