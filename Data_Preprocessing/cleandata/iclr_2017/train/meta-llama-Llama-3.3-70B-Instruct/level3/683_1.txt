Summary
The paper proposes a boosting-based ensemble procedure for residual networks using the Deep Incremental Boosting method. The approach aims to improve the performance of residual networks by adding a new block of layers at a position p_t and copying weights to speed up training. The authors also provide preliminary results for boosting Res Nets, but the contribution is not novel, and the empirical results are not satisfactory to demonstrate the method's significance.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper with two key reasons: (1) the method is not sufficiently novel as it slightly adopts the Deep Incremental Boosting approach with minimal modifications, and (2) the empirical analysis lacks data-augmentation, which may impact the improvements of the ensemble, and has unfair comparisons due to the absence of skip connections in one of the baselines.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's focus on the ensemble approach, rather than using state-of-the-art Res Nets, may lead to incomplete conclusions, and the boosting procedure can be computationally restrictive for large-scale training. Additionally, the selection of the injection point for boosting is not clearly explained, and its sensitivity is unknown. The experiment setup, including parameters, training algorithms, and network architectures, is not clearly detailed, and comparisons to state-of-the-art Res Net variants, dense convolutional networks, and training times are lacking.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, the authors should provide more detailed explanations of the injection point selection and its sensitivity. They should also include data-augmentation in the empirical analysis and ensure fair comparisons with state-of-the-art Res Net variants. Furthermore, the authors should consider using more advanced Res Net architectures and provide more comprehensive comparisons with other ensemble methods.
Questions for the Authors
1. Can you provide more details on the selection of the injection point for boosting and its sensitivity to different positions?
2. How do you plan to address the lack of data-augmentation in the empirical analysis and ensure fair comparisons with state-of-the-art Res Net variants?
3. Can you provide more comprehensive comparisons with other ensemble methods, such as bagging and stacking, to demonstrate the significance of the proposed approach?
