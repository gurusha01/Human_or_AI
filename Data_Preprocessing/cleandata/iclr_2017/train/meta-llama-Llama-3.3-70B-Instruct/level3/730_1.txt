Summary
The paper proposes an online structure learning technique for Gaussian Sum-Product Networks (SPNs) that learns the structure of the network in a single pass through the data. The algorithm starts with a fully factorized joint probability distribution and updates the structure and parameters as new data points are processed. The technique is evaluated on several benchmark datasets and compared to other algorithms, demonstrating its effectiveness in learning a suitable network structure and achieving good results.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the experiment section is weak, with results not on par with state-of-the-art and limited to similar datasets. Secondly, the proposed extensions are not novel and lack convincing experiments, particularly in their application to different tasks beyond sentiment analysis.
Supporting Arguments
The paper proposes an online structure learning technique for Gaussian SPNs, which is a significant contribution. However, the experiment section is limited, and the results are not compared to state-of-the-art algorithms. The paper also lacks convincing experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique in different tasks and datasets. Furthermore, the proposed extensions are not novel, and the paper does not provide sufficient evidence to support the claims made.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors conduct more experiments on diverse tasks and datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique. The authors should also compare their results to state-of-the-art algorithms and provide more convincing evidence to support their claims. Additionally, the authors should consider testing the proposed models on more diverse tasks, such as machine translation and question answering, to demonstrate their effectiveness.
Questions for the Authors
I would like the authors to answer the following questions to clarify my understanding of the paper and provide additional evidence:
1. Can you provide more details on the datasets used in the experiments and the evaluation metrics used to compare the results?
2. How do you plan to extend the structure learning algorithm to discrete variables, and what are the potential challenges and limitations?
3. Can you provide more evidence to support the claim that the proposed technique is effective in learning a suitable network structure and achieving good results?
4. How do you plan to address the issue of overfitting, and what regularization mechanisms can be used to control the complexity of the networks?
