Summary
The paper proposes a novel method for regularizing Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) called zoneout, which stochastically preserves hidden units' activations. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of zoneout on various tasks, including character-level and word-level language modeling on the Penn Treebank and Text8 datasets, and classification on the permuted sequential MNIST dataset. Zoneout is shown to outperform other regularization methods, such as dropout and recurrent dropout, and achieves competitive or state-of-the-art results on these tasks.
Decision
I decide to accept this paper, with the main reason being that the approach is well-motivated and supported by thorough experiments. The authors provide a clear explanation of the zoneout method and its relationship to other regularization techniques, such as dropout and stochastic depth. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of zoneout on various tasks and its ability to improve performance when combined with other regularizers.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a thorough analysis of the zoneout method, including its relationship to other regularization techniques and its effect on gradient flow in RNNs. The authors also provide a detailed description of the experiments, including the datasets, models, and hyperparameters used. The results are well-presented and easy to understand, making it clear that zoneout is a effective regularization method for RNNs.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the hyperparameter search process and the sensitivity of the results to different hyperparameter settings. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more analysis on the effect of zoneout on the learned representations and the robustness of the method to different types of noise and perturbations.
Questions for the Authors
I would like to ask the authors to clarify the following points:
* How did you choose the hyperparameters for the zoneout method, and what was the sensitivity of the results to different settings?
* Can you provide more analysis on the effect of zoneout on the learned representations and the robustness of the method to different types of noise and perturbations?
* How does zoneout compare to other regularization methods, such as weight decay and early stopping, in terms of its effect on the generalization performance of RNNs?
