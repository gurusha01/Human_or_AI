Summary of the Paper's Claims and Contributions
The paper proposes a novel approach to semi-supervised reinforcement learning (SSRL), which enables an agent to learn a policy that generalizes to unseen scenarios without requiring a reward function. The authors formalize SSRL as a problem where the agent must learn from both labeled and unlabeled Markov decision processes (MDPs). They introduce a method called semi-supervised skill generalization (S3G), which uses the agent's prior experience in labeled MDPs to infer the reward function in unlabeled MDPs. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of S3G in various continuous control tasks, showing that it outperforms traditional RL methods and reward regression approaches.
Decision: Reject
The main reason for this decision is that the paper's approach, although well-motivated and well-written, lacks novelty. The combination of variational recurrent neural networks and adversarial domain adaptation is a straightforward fusion of existing techniques, and the paper does not provide sufficient motivation for this particular combination. Additionally, the discussion in Section 4.4 is unconvincing, and the visualization of firing patterns does not support the efficiency of the proposed method.
Supporting Arguments
1. Lack of novelty: The paper's approach is a combination of existing techniques, and the authors do not provide a clear motivation for why this particular combination is necessary or effective.
2. Unconvincing discussion: The discussion in Section 4.4 is not convincing, and the visualization of firing patterns does not provide sufficient evidence to support the claims made in the paper.
3. Suspicious figure: Figure 1(c) appears suspicious, with an unusually regular structure for non-degenerate real-world data.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, the authors should provide more motivation for their approach and clarify why the combination of variational recurrent neural networks and adversarial domain adaptation is necessary. They should also provide more convincing evidence to support their claims, such as additional experiments or visualizations. Furthermore, the authors should address the suspicious figure and provide more details about the data used in the experiments.
Questions for the Authors
