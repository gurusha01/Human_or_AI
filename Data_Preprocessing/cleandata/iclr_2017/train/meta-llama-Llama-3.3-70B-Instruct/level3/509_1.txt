This paper presents a novel approach to making a Forth interpreter differentiable, allowing it to learn high-level instruction implementations from examples. The proposed approach bridges programming by example and sketches by programmers, borrowing ideas from probabilistic programming and Neural Turing Machine, while introducing significant differences and optimizations.
The paper is well-written and well-motivated, and the experiments provided are promising, although limited to proof of concept. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on two neural programming tasks, sorting and addition, and show that their model can learn to fill in the sketch and generalize well to problems of unseen size.
To evaluate this paper, I will answer the three key questions: 
1. What is the specific question/problem tackled by the paper? 
The paper tackles the problem of how to incorporate prior procedural knowledge into a neural network, specifically in the context of programming languages.
2. Is the approach well motivated, including being well-placed in the literature? 
The approach is well-motivated, and the authors provide a clear overview of the related work in the field, including probabilistic programming, Neural Turing Machine, and program synthesis.
3. Does the paper support the claims? 
The paper provides empirical evidence to support the claims, although the experiments are limited to proof of concept and would benefit from more detailed empirical studies to strengthen the paper.
Based on these questions, I decide to Accept this paper, with the main reason being that the approach is novel and well-motivated, and the experiments provide promising results. However, I suggest that the authors provide more detailed empirical studies to further strengthen the paper.
To improve the paper, I provide the following feedback: 
* The authors should consider exploring the approach's capabilities on various programming problems to determine its ability to generate complex low-level code.
* The authors should provide more detailed analysis of the results, including error analysis and comparison to other state-of-the-art methods.
* The authors should consider providing more examples of how the approach can be used in practice, including applications in areas such as natural language processing and computer vision.
I would like the authors to answer the following questions to clarify my understanding of the paper and provide additional evidence: 
* Can the authors provide more details on how the differentiable Forth interpreter is implemented, including the specific neural network architecture used?
* How do the authors plan to address the issue of scalability, given that the approach requires a large number of parameters to be learned?
* Can the authors provide more examples of how the approach can be used to learn complex algorithms, such as those required in natural language processing or computer vision?
