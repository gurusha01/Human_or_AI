Summary
The paper proposes a novel neural network architecture called Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNNs) for sequence modeling tasks. QRNNs combine the strengths of convolutional and recurrent neural networks, allowing for parallel computation across both timestep and minibatch dimensions while still capturing long-distance context dependencies. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of QRNNs on several natural language tasks, including document-level sentiment classification, language modeling, and character-level neural machine translation, achieving better predictive accuracy and significantly faster computation times compared to traditional LSTM-based models.
Decision
I decide to Accept this paper, with the primary reason being the innovative architecture proposed and its demonstrated effectiveness on various tasks. The paper provides a clear and well-motivated approach to addressing the limitations of traditional RNNs, and the experimental results are convincing.
Supporting Arguments
The paper is well-structured, and the authors provide a thorough explanation of the QRNN architecture and its variants. The experiments are adequately designed, and the results are impressive, showing significant improvements over LSTM-based models in terms of accuracy and computation time. The paper also provides a good discussion of related work, highlighting the connections and differences between QRNNs and other sequence modeling architectures.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more explicit big Oh calculations or examples to illustrate the source of speed improvements. Additionally, the concept of QRNNs could be clarified with more intuitive explanations and visualizations, making it easier for readers to understand the architecture. The authors may also consider providing more detailed analysis of the trade-offs between QRNNs and traditional RNNs, including the effects of hyperparameter tuning and model size on performance.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
1. Can you provide more insights into the design choices behind the QRNN architecture, particularly the selection of convolutional and pooling layers?
2. How do the authors plan to address the potential limitations of QRNNs, such as the requirement for careful hyperparameter tuning and the potential for overfitting?
3. Are there any plans to explore the application of QRNNs to other sequence modeling tasks, such as speech recognition or time-series forecasting?
