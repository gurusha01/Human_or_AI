Summary
The paper introduces NewsQA, a large-scale machine comprehension dataset consisting of over 100,000 question-answer pairs based on news articles from CNN. The dataset is designed to encourage exploratory, curiosity-based questions that require reasoning mechanisms, such as synthesis of information across different parts of an article. The authors analyze the dataset and compare its characteristics to other existing comprehension datasets, demonstrating its challenge and usefulness as a machine comprehension benchmark.
Decision
I decide to accept this paper, with two key reasons for this choice: (1) the paper tackles a specific and important question in the field of machine comprehension, and (2) the approach is well-motivated and supported by a thorough analysis of the dataset.
Supporting Arguments
The paper clearly defines the problem of machine comprehension and the need for a large-scale dataset that requires reasoning mechanisms. The authors' approach to collecting the dataset, using a four-stage process with crowdworkers, is well-designed and yields a diverse set of answer types. The analysis of the dataset demonstrates its challenge and usefulness, with a significant proportion of questions requiring some reasoning ability to solve.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, I suggest providing more details on the crowdworkers' instructions and the validation process to ensure the quality of the dataset. Additionally, it would be helpful to include more comparisons with other existing comprehension datasets and models to further demonstrate the uniqueness and value of NewsQA.
Questions for the Authors
I would like to ask the authors to clarify the following points: (1) How did they ensure the quality of the crowdworkers' questions and answers, and what measures were taken to prevent biases in the dataset? (2) Can they provide more details on the neural models used as baselines, and how they were trained and evaluated on the NewsQA dataset? (3) How do they plan to make the NewsQA dataset available to the research community, and what are their plans for future updates and expansions to the dataset?
