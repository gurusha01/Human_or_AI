Summary
The paper proposes a novel approach to address data sparsity in the healthcare domain by leveraging hierarchies of medical concepts organized in ontologies to improve sequential prediction. The authors introduce a Layer-RNN (L-RNN) module that can learn contextual information adaptively using within-layer recurrence. The L-RNN module is a combination of 1D spatial RNNs that can be seamlessly inserted into any convolutional layer of a pre-trained CNN, and the entire network can be fine-tuned end-to-end.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the representation of a patient's visit as the sum of medical codes may introduce bias, and alternative methods such as average or learned weighted average should be considered. Secondly, the results in Figure 2 are unclear and closely matched, and the authors should provide commentary on the significance of the differences and clarify the figures.
Supporting Arguments
The paper proposes an interesting application of deep learning techniques to a significant issue, but it lacks clarity on the novel insights it offers to the ICLR community and its relevance to the conference. The authors should provide more context on how the L-RNN module addresses the specific challenges of data sparsity in the healthcare domain. Additionally, the paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the results, including ablation studies and comparisons to other state-of-the-art methods.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, the authors should consider the following suggestions:
* Provide alternative methods for representing a patient's visit, such as average or learned weighted average, to avoid bias.
* Clarify the results in Figure 2 and provide commentary on the significance of the differences.
* Offer more context on the novel insights the L-RNN module offers to the ICLR community and its relevance to the conference.
* Include more detailed analysis of the results, including ablation studies and comparisons to other state-of-the-art methods.
Questions for the Authors
I would like the authors to answer the following questions to clarify my understanding of the paper and provide additional evidence:
* Can you provide more details on how the L-RNN module addresses the specific challenges of data sparsity in the healthcare domain?
* How do you plan to extend the L-RNN module to other domains and applications?
* Can you provide more insights into the training process and the hyperparameter tuning for the L-RNN module?
* How do you plan to address the potential bias introduced by representing a patient's visit as the sum of medical codes?
