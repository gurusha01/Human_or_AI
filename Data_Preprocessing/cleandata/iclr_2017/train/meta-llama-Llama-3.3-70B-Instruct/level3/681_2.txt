This research paper proposes three improvements to scattering networks, including a new non-linearity, compact-supported representations, and additional variance features, which may lead to better speed and accuracy. The technical contributions are worthwhile, but the presentation is marred by overly long sentences, obfuscating language, and unnecessarily complicated equations, making it difficult to understand the content.
I decide to reject this paper, with the two key reasons being: (1) the poor presentation and evaluation of the technical contributions, and (2) the lack of convincing argument regarding the cardinality and the claims about finding invariants and fundamental structures.
To support my decision, I argue that the paper's technical contributions, although potentially valuable, are not well-motivated or clearly explained. The equations, such as Eq. 5, can be simplified to improve clarity, and the argument regarding cardinality (Eq. 14) is unconvincing and fails to prove that variance is more informative. Furthermore, the authors' claims about finding invariants and fundamental structures are hyperbolic and lack mathematical substantiation.
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors simplify their equations, provide more convincing arguments for their claims, and support their results with more substantial evidence from machine learning theory. Additionally, the authors should clarify their presentation, avoiding overly long sentences and obfuscating language, to make the content more accessible to readers.
I would like the authors to answer the following questions to clarify my understanding of the paper and provide additional evidence to support their claims: (1) Can you provide a more detailed explanation of the new non-linearity and compact-supported representations, and how they improve upon existing methods? (2) How do you respond to the criticism that your argument regarding cardinality is unconvincing, and what additional evidence can you provide to support your claims? (3) Can you provide more mathematical substantiation for your claims about finding invariants and fundamental structures, and how they relate to the technical contributions of the paper?
