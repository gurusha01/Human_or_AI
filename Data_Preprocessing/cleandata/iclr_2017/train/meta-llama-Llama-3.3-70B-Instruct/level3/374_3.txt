Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper proposes a novel recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture, called the Doubly Orthogonal Recurrent Neural Network (DORNN), which addresses the vanishing and exploding gradients problem in traditional RNNs. The DORNN architecture uses a multiplicative update rule, where the hidden state is updated by a time-invariant orthogonal transformation followed by an input-modulated orthogonal transformation. This approach ensures that the forward hidden state activation norm and the backwards gradient norm are exactly preserved, eliminating the vanishing and exploding gradients problem. The paper also introduces a rotation plane parameterization to represent the orthogonal matrices, which allows for efficient optimization and flexible modeling of complex dependencies.
Decision and Key Reasons
Based on the provided guidelines, I decide to Accept this paper. The two key reasons for this decision are:
1. The paper tackles a specific and well-defined problem in the field of RNNs, namely the vanishing and exploding gradients problem, and proposes a novel and well-motivated solution.
2. The paper provides a thorough and rigorous analysis of the proposed architecture, including a proof of the preservation of the forward and backward norms, and demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach through experiments on a simplified memory copy task.
Supporting Arguments
The paper is well-written, clear, and effectively covers prior work and comparisons with previous models. The introduction provides a concise overview of the vanishing and exploding gradients problem and the existing solutions, while the methodology section clearly explains the proposed DORNN architecture and its components. The experimental section demonstrates the ability of the DORNN to learn long-term dependencies up to 5,000 time steps, which is a significant improvement over existing approaches.
Additional Feedback and Suggestions
To further improve the paper, I suggest the authors consider the following:
* Provide more detailed comparisons with other state-of-the-art RNN architectures, such as LSTMs and GRUs, to demonstrate the advantages of the DORNN approach.
* Explore the application of the DORNN architecture to more complex tasks, such as language modeling or machine translation, to demonstrate its versatility and effectiveness in real-world scenarios.
* Consider using more advanced optimization techniques, such as the Cayley transform, to improve the efficiency and stability of the training process.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper and provide additional evidence for my assessment, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
* Can you provide more details on the initialization of the orthogonal matrices and the rotation planes, and how they affect the performance of the DORNN architecture?
* How do you plan to address the potential limitations of the DORNN architecture, such as the linear input-dependent model, and explore more complex and nonlinear transitions?
* Can you provide more insights into the training process and the observed phenomena, such as the increasing instability of the training process for longer sequence lengths?
