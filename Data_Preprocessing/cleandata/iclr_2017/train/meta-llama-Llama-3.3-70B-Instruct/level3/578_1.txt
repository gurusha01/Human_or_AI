Summary
The paper proposes a novel approach to sequence learning, called Incremental Sequence Learning, which involves gradually increasing the length of sequences used for training as the network learns to predict the early parts of the sequences. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on a new sequence learning task, predicting and classifying MNIST pen stroke sequences, and show that it significantly improves sequence learning performance, reducing the test error by 74% and achieving a 20-fold speedup in computation time.
Decision
I decide to accept this paper, with two key reasons for this choice: (1) the paper tackles a specific and well-motivated question in the context of sequence learning, and (2) the approach proposed by the authors is well-supported by experimental results, which demonstrate its effectiveness in improving sequence learning performance.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a clear and well-structured presentation of the proposed approach, including a detailed description of the experimental setup and results. The authors also provide a thorough analysis of the origins of the performance improvement, which helps to understand the underlying mechanisms of the proposed approach. Additionally, the paper includes a comprehensive review of related work, which helps to situate the proposed approach within the broader context of sequence learning and curriculum learning.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors consider providing more detailed information about the hyperparameter tuning process, as well as more extensive comparisons with other state-of-the-art sequence learning methods. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more examples of the generated sequences, to gain a better understanding of the quality of the results.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like to ask the authors the following questions:
* Can you provide more details about the process of transforming the MNIST digit data set into a pen stroke sequence data set?
* How did you select the hyperparameters for the Incremental Sequence Learning approach, and what was the effect of varying these hyperparameters on the results?
* Have you considered applying the Incremental Sequence Learning approach to other sequence learning tasks, and if so, what were the results?
