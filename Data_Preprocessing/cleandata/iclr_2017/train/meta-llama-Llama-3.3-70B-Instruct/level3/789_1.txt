Summary of the Paper
The paper proposes a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling process for generative autoencoders, which allows for sampling from the learned latent distribution. The authors argue that the traditional approach of sampling from the prior distribution can lead to suboptimal results, and that their MCMC method can improve the quality of generated samples. They demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on various datasets, including CelebA and SVHN, and show that it can be used to improve the quality of samples from both VAEs and AAEs.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, primarily due to two key reasons. Firstly, the paper lacks quantitative evaluation, relying only on samples from the generative model to judge performance. This makes it difficult to assess the effectiveness of the proposed method. Secondly, the model description is unclear, with undefined terms such as Q(Z) and a lack of explanation for the generative model.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's lack of quantitative evaluation is a significant concern. While the authors provide some visual examples of generated samples, these are not sufficient to fully evaluate the performance of the proposed method. Additionally, the model description is unclear, making it difficult to understand the specifics of the proposed approach. The use of additive noise in the input is also unjustified and seems unreasonable.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, I would suggest adding quantitative evaluation metrics to assess the performance of the proposed method. This could include metrics such as inception score, Frechet inception distance, or reconstruction error. Additionally, the authors should provide a clearer explanation of the model, including the definition of Q(Z) and the specifics of the generative model. The use of additive noise in the input should also be justified or removed.
Questions for the Authors
1. Can you provide a clearer explanation of the model, including the definition of Q(Z) and the specifics of the generative model?
2. How do you plan to address the lack of quantitative evaluation in the paper?
3. Can you justify the use of additive noise in the input, or consider removing it if it is not necessary?
By addressing these concerns and providing additional clarification, the authors can strengthen their paper and improve its chances of acceptance.
