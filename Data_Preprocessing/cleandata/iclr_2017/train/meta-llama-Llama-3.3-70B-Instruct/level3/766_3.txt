Summary of the Paper
The paper introduces the "Energy-based Generative Adversarial Network" (EBGAN) model, which views the discriminator as an energy function that attributes low energies to the regions near the data manifold and higher energies to other regions. The authors propose to use an auto-encoder architecture as the discriminator, where the energy is the reconstruction error. They demonstrate that this form of EBGAN exhibits more stable behavior than regular GANs during training and can generate high-resolution images.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the paper lacks novelty, as the detection system described is a standard application of Fast RCNN to pedestrian detection, with no new contributions or awareness of recent developments in object detection. Secondly, the results are not state-of-the-art, and the paper lacks comparison on the standard Caltech Pedestrians dataset.
Supporting Arguments
The authors applied the Fast RCNN detection system to pedestrian detection, utilizing "EdgeBoxes" object proposals and incorporating batch norm into their network. However, this approach is not novel and has been widely used in the field. The results were shown on the INRIA and ETH pedestrian datasets, but were reasonable and not state-of-the-art. The paper also lacks comparison on the standard Caltech Pedestrians dataset, which is a widely used benchmark for pedestrian detection.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, the authors could consider adding new contributions or awareness of recent developments in object detection. They could also provide more comprehensive comparisons with state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets. Additionally, the authors could consider using more advanced techniques, such as using a more robust object proposal method or incorporating additional features, such as depth or optical flow, to improve the accuracy of pedestrian detection.
Questions for the Authors
I would like to ask the authors to clarify the following points:
* How does the proposed EBGAN model differ from existing GAN models, and what are the advantages of using an auto-encoder architecture as the discriminator?
* Why did the authors choose to use the INRIA and ETH pedestrian datasets, and how do the results compare to state-of-the-art methods on these datasets?
* How does the proposed EBGAN model handle cases where the data manifold is complex or has multiple modes, and what are the limitations of the model in such cases?
