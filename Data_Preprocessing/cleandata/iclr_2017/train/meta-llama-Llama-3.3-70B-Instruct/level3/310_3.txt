This paper proposes a novel approach to learning state space models from raw non-Markovian sequence data, called Deep Variational Bayes Filters (DVBF). The authors claim that their method can overcome intractable inference and perform latent dynamic system identification, making it a valuable contribution to the field.
I decide to accept this paper for several reasons. Firstly, the approach is well-motivated and placed in the literature, building upon recent advances in stochastic gradient variational Bayes and addressing the limitations of existing methods. Secondly, the paper provides a clear and detailed explanation of the proposed method, including the reparametrization of the transition model and the derivation of the lower bound objective function. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of DVBF in recovering latent states and performing long-term predictions, outperforming existing methods such as Deep Kalman Filters.
The paper supports its claims through a series of experiments on various environments, including a dynamic pendulum, a bouncing ball, and two bouncing balls. The results show that DVBF can learn latent spaces that identify the underlying physical quantities and perform stable long-term predictions. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the results, including visualizations of the latent spaces and comparisons with existing methods.
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the implementation of DVBF, including the specific architectures used for the recognition and transition models, as well as the hyperparameters used for training. Additionally, it would be helpful to include more comparisons with other existing methods, such as Embed to Control, to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the proposed approach.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer include: How do the authors choose the dimensionality of the latent space, and what is the effect of varying this dimensionality on the performance of DVBF? How do the authors handle cases where the underlying system dynamics are highly nonlinear or non-stationary? What are the potential applications of DVBF in real-world domains, such as robotics or computer vision? 
Overall, I believe that this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of state space modeling and variational inference, and I look forward to seeing the authors' responses to these questions and suggestions.
