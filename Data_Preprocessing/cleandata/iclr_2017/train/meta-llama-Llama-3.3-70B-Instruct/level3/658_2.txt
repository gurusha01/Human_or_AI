This paper proposes a novel approach to learning state space models from raw non-Markovian sequence data, called Deep Variational Bayes Filters (DVBF). The authors claim that their method can overcome intractable inference and perform latent dynamic system identification, making it suitable for downstream tasks such as control or model-based reinforcement learning.
I appreciate the authors' attempt to tackle a challenging problem in the field of probabilistic modeling and filtering of dynamical systems. The paper presents an interesting perspective on interpreting SPN and MPN as encoders and decoders of RL, which is a novel and thought-provoking idea.
However, after carefully evaluating the paper, I have decided to reject it. The main reasons for this decision are:
1. The paper fails to convincingly argue its point, and the current draft requires a significant rewrite to effectively make its point.
2. The experiments are unstructured and lacking in insight, with several flaws and issues that have been pointed out by other reviewers.
To answer the three key questions for myself:
1. The specific question/problem tackled by the paper is: Can we learn state space models from raw non-Markovian sequence data using a novel approach called Deep Variational Bayes Filters?
2. The approach is not well-motivated, and the paper lacks a clear connection to the existing literature.
3. The paper does not support its claims, and the results are not scientifically rigorous.
To improve the paper, I would suggest the following:
* Provide a clearer motivation for the approach and a more detailed comparison to existing methods.
* Restructure the experiments to provide more insight and address the flaws and issues pointed out by other reviewers.
* Consider using more realistic datasets, such as those from real-world applications, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper are:
* Can you provide more details on how the DVBF approach is related to existing methods, such as Kalman filters and variational inference?
* How do you plan to address the issues with the experiments, and what additional results can you provide to support the claims made in the paper?
* Can you provide more insight into the choice of the MNIST dataset and how it relates to the problem of learning state space models from raw non-Markovian sequence data?
