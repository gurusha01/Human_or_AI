Summary of the Paper's Contribution
The paper proposes a novel deep learning model, GRU-D, which effectively handles missing values in multivariate time series data by incorporating masking and time interval directly into the GRU architecture. The model captures informative missingness and achieves state-of-the-art performance on real-world healthcare datasets, including MIMIC-III and PhysioNet.
Decision: Accept
I decide to accept this paper due to its significant contribution to the field of time series analysis with missing data. The paper presents a well-motivated approach, thoroughly placed in the literature, and provides empirical evidence to support its claims.
Supporting Arguments
The paper tackles a specific question of handling missing values in time series data, which is a common problem in many applications. The approach is well-motivated, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the limitations of existing methods. The paper also presents a thorough evaluation of the proposed model on various datasets, including synthetic and real-world data, and demonstrates its superiority over other baseline models.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest the authors provide more insights into the interpretability of the proposed model, particularly in understanding how the trainable decays capture the temporal missing patterns. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more analysis on the impact of the model's hyperparameters on its performance.
Questions for the Authors
1. Can you provide more details on how the trainable decays in GRU-D capture the temporal missing patterns, and how they differ from other existing methods?
2. How do you plan to extend this work to handle more complex missing patterns, such as non-random missingness or missing values with temporal dependencies?
3. Can you provide more insights into the computational complexity of the proposed model and its scalability to larger datasets?
