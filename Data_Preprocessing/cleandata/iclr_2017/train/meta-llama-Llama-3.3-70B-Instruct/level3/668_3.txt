Summary
The paper proposes a novel attention-based framework for sentiment analysis, inspired by human reading behavior. The model uses a two-scan approach, where the first scan extracts a global context representation using a bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) network, and the second scan uses this global context as attention to selectively focus on important local contexts. The authors also propose a single-scan version of the model, which achieves similar performance with reduced complexity. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model, outperforming existing related models on several benchmark datasets.
Decision
I decide to reject the paper, with the main reason being that the idea, although simple and effective, lacks thorough analysis and justification. The comparisons to L2 regularization and other related work are not fully convincing, and the paper could benefit from more detailed explanations and empirical evaluations.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's strength lies in its empirical rigor, with extensive experiments on various benchmarks, including CNNs and RNNs. The results show promising performance, especially in language modeling, where the proposed model outperforms label smoothing. However, the paper could benefit from more detailed analysis of the attention mechanism and its effectiveness in capturing complex semantic compositions. Additionally, the authors could provide more insights into the distribution of gradient norms and how the proposed regularization technique affects the convergence of the model.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more detailed explanations of the attention mechanism and its relationship to human reading behavior. They could also conduct more extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed model on different tasks and datasets. Furthermore, the authors could provide more insights into the computational complexity of the proposed model and its potential applications in real-world scenarios. Some questions that I would like the authors to answer include: How does the proposed attention mechanism differ from existing attention-based models? What are the key factors that contribute to the effectiveness of the proposed model? How does the model perform on tasks that require more complex semantic compositions, such as machine translation or question answering?
