The paper proposes a novel learning framework, Recurrent Inference Machines (RIM), which abandons the traditional separation between model and inference in solving inverse problems. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of RIMs in various image reconstruction tasks, showing that they can outperform state-of-the-art methods. The paper is well-structured, and the authors provide a clear motivation for their approach.
However, I decide to reject this paper due to two key reasons. Firstly, the paper mixes several concepts, making simple notions hard to understand. For instance, the use of "distributed" to mean classifier ensembles, rather than distributed training or computation, is confusing. Additionally, the paper's use of "transfer learning" is narrow, referring only to fine-tuning the last layer of a pre-trained classifier. This lack of clarity makes it challenging to follow the authors' arguments.
Secondly, the paper lacks scientific rigor in some of its claims. For example, the authors question how BPA addresses class imbalance better than simple re-weighting, but they do not provide sufficient evidence to support their claims. Furthermore, Algorithm 2 is presented incorrectly, implying that test data is used during training, which is unclear. The distinction between "train/validation" and "test" is also unclear, which raises concerns about the validity of the results.
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide clearer definitions and concepts, and ensure that their claims are supported by rigorous evidence. Additionally, they should clarify the distinction between "train/validation" and "test" and provide more details on the computation cost and timing of their approach.
I would like the authors to answer the following questions to clarify my understanding of the paper: (1) Can you provide more details on how RIMs handle class imbalance, and how they compare to simple re-weighting? (2) Can you clarify the distinction between "train/validation" and "test" in your approach, and provide more details on how you ensure that the test data is not used during training? (3) Can you provide more information on the computation cost and timing of your approach, and how it compares to other state-of-the-art methods? 
The specific question or problem tackled by the paper is the solution of inverse problems using a novel learning framework, RIM. The approach is well-motivated, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the limitations of traditional methods. However, the paper does not fully support its claims, and the results are not entirely scientifically rigorous. 
Overall, while the paper proposes an interesting approach, it requires significant revisions to address the concerns mentioned above. With clearer definitions, more rigorous evidence, and a clearer distinction between "train/validation" and "test", the paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of inverse problems.
