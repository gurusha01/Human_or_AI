Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper presents a valuable contribution to the bioacoustics field by applying Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Hidden Markov Models (HDP-HMM) to challenging bioacoustics segmentation problems, including humpback whale sound and bird sound segmentation. The authors propose a Bayesian non-parametric approach to automatically infer the number of hidden states from the data, which is a significant issue in bioacoustic problems. The paper demonstrates the potential of this approach in unsupervised analysis of bioacoustic signals, which can lead to new insights into the behavior of species.
Decision and Key Reasons
Based on the evaluation, I decide to accept the paper with minor revisions. The key reasons for this decision are:
1. The paper tackles a specific and important problem in bioacoustics, and the proposed approach shows promise in addressing this challenge.
2. The authors provide a clear and well-motivated explanation of the HDP-HMM model and its application to bioacoustic data.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a thorough introduction to the problem of bioacoustic signal segmentation and the limitations of existing approaches. The authors also provide a clear explanation of the HDP-HMM model and its advantages in addressing the issue of model selection. The experimental results on humpback whale and bird sound segmentation demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. However, the paper lacks a fair comparison with other simple methods, such as BIC and AIC, which should be included for a comprehensive evaluation.
Additional Feedback and Questions
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors:
1. Provide a more detailed comparison with other methods, including BIC and AIC, to demonstrate the advantages of the HDP-HMM approach.
2. Discuss the computational cost of the HDP-HMM model and potential ways to address this issue, such as using variational inference or stochastic variational inference.
3. Consider providing more examples of the segmentation results, including visualizations of the spectrograms and state sequences, to help illustrate the effectiveness of the approach.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer:
1. How did the authors choose the hyperparameters for the HDP-HMM model, and what is the sensitivity of the results to these parameters?
2. Can the authors provide more details on the computational resources required to run the HDP-HMM model, and how this might impact the scalability of the approach to larger datasets?
3. Are there any plans to extend the approach to other types of bioacoustic data, such as data from multiple species or data with varying levels of noise and interference?
