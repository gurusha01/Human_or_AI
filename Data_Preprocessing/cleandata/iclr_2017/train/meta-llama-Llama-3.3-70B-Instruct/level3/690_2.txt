Summary
The paper presents a systematic investigation of different context types and representations for learning word embeddings, a crucial aspect of natural language processing. The authors conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of various context definitions under four tasks and 21 datasets, aiming to provide insights into context selection and serve as a guideline for the community.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, primarily due to the lack of surprising or novel findings and the questionable conclusion of asymptotic hyperbolic behavior in Finding 2. The results, although well-presented, do not significantly advance our understanding of word embeddings or context selection.
Supporting Arguments
The authors' approach is well-motivated, and the experiments are thorough. However, the findings are largely expected, with most architectures and batch sizes fully utilizing the GPU. The conclusion of Finding 2 is not sufficiently supported by evidence, particularly for the latest model generations. Additionally, the paper's focus on GPU utilization and inference time, while relevant, does not directly address the open question of the best definition of context.
Additional Feedback
To increase the practical relevance of the findings, I suggest exploring the application of compressing techniques or testing the models on actual production networks. This could provide more interesting and actionable insights for the community. Furthermore, the authors may consider investigating the impact of different context definitions on specific NLP tasks or datasets to provide more nuanced recommendations.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to address the following questions:
1. Can you provide more evidence to support the conclusion of asymptotic hyperbolic behavior in Finding 2, particularly for the latest model generations?
2. How do you plan to extend this work to provide more practical guidelines for context selection in real-world NLP applications?
3. Can you discuss the potential limitations of the current experimental setup and how they may impact the generalizability of the findings?
