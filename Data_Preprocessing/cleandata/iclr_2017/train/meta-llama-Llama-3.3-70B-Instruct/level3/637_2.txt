Summary
This paper proposes a novel approach to learn state representations using deep neural networks and robotic priors. The authors utilize a siamese network architecture to impose constraints on the learned representation, ensuring consistency with physical and task-specific rules. The method is demonstrated to be effective in learning a one-dimensional representation of a Baxter robot's head position, achieving a high correlation with the ground truth. The paper also highlights the potential for transfer learning and robustness to noise and luminosity perturbations.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, primarily due to two key reasons. Firstly, the paper lacks clear motivations behind the proposed approach, making it difficult to understand the significance and novelty of the method. Secondly, the experiments are incomplete, as they do not compare the performance of the proposed method against the original vector space model, particularly for link prediction.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's approach, although interesting, is not well-motivated, and the authors fail to provide sufficient elements to support the use of rule mining for better interpretability and debugging of vector space models. The performance of the methods in Figure 1 and 2 is not compared to any baseline, making it difficult to evaluate their effectiveness. Furthermore, the scalability of the rule miner is a significant drawback that needs to be addressed to make the method more practical. Figure 3 is unconvincing in demonstrating the usefulness of rule-based systems for prediction or interpretation, as the learned rules are of poor quality.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, the authors should provide a clearer motivation for their approach, including a more detailed discussion of the related work and the significance of their contributions. The experiments should be more comprehensive, including comparisons with baseline methods and an evaluation of the scalability of the rule miner. The authors should also consider providing more convincing results to demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper and provide additional evidence, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
1. Can you provide more details on the motivation behind using robotic priors and siamese networks for state representation learning?
2. How do you plan to address the scalability issues of the rule miner, and what are the potential applications of this method in more complex environments?
3. Can you provide more comprehensive experiments, including comparisons with baseline methods and an evaluation of the effectiveness of the proposed approach in different scenarios?
