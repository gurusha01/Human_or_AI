This paper proposes a novel approach to semi-supervised reinforcement learning, which enables an agent to learn from both labeled and unlabeled experiences. The authors introduce the concept of semi-supervised skill generalization (S3G), which leverages the agent's prior experience in labeled settings to infer the reward function in unlabeled settings. The approach is evaluated on several continuous control tasks, demonstrating improved generalization performance compared to traditional reinforcement learning methods.
To evaluate this paper, I will consider the following key points: 
1. The specific question/problem tackled by the paper: The paper addresses the problem of semi-supervised reinforcement learning, where the agent must learn from both labeled and unlabeled experiences.
2. The approach's motivation and placement in the literature: The authors provide a clear motivation for their approach, highlighting the limitations of traditional reinforcement learning methods in real-world scenarios. They also provide a thorough review of related work in semi-supervised learning and reinforcement learning.
3. The paper's support for its claims: The authors provide extensive experimental evaluations, demonstrating the effectiveness of their approach on several tasks. However, I would like to see more analysis on the sensitivity of the thresholds used in the evaluation methodology.
Based on these considerations, I decide to accept this paper, with the following key reasons: 
The paper tackles an important problem in reinforcement learning, and the approach is well-motivated and grounded in the literature. The experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, and the authors provide a clear and thorough explanation of their methodology.
However, I have some concerns regarding the evaluation methodology, particularly with regards to the sensitivity of the thresholds used. I would like the authors to investigate how sensitive the thresholds are to different test sets, to ensure the reliability of the results. Additionally, I would like to see more analysis on the statistical significance of the differences in AUC/AUPR between the proposed classifier and the random baseline.
To improve the paper, I suggest the authors provide more clarification on the evaluation methodology used in the speech recognition experiments, specifically regarding what constitutes an "example" and how softmax probabilities are calculated. I also question the decision to ignore the blank symbol's logit in the speech recognition experiments and ask for justification. Furthermore, I recommend comparing the proposed model's performance to a simple generative baseline, such as GMM-HMM, to evaluate its ability to detect out-of-domain examples.
Overall, this is a strong paper that makes a significant contribution to the field of reinforcement learning. With some revisions to address the concerns mentioned above, I believe this paper has the potential to make a substantial impact in the field. 
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper and provide additional evidence to support their claims include: 
* Can you provide more details on the evaluation methodology used in the speech recognition experiments?
* How did you determine the thresholds used in the evaluation, and are they sensitive to different test sets?
* Can you provide more analysis on the statistical significance of the differences in AUC/AUPR between the proposed classifier and the random baseline?
* Why did you decide to ignore the blank symbol's logit in the speech recognition experiments, and can you provide justification for this decision?
* How does the proposed model's performance compare to a simple generative baseline, such as GMM-HMM, in terms of detecting out-of-domain examples?
