This paper introduces a novel approach to learning symmetric and asymmetric encryption using neural networks. The authors propose a framework where neural networks, representing Alice, Bob, and Eve, are trained to communicate securely without being prescribed a specific cryptographic algorithm. The approach is based on adversarial training, where Alice and Bob aim to minimize their reconstruction error while maximizing Eve's reconstruction error.
The paper claims to contribute to the field of cryptography and machine learning by demonstrating that neural networks can learn to protect communications without being explicitly taught cryptographic algorithms. The authors also explore the concept of selective protection, where neural networks learn to hide specific information while maximizing utility.
Based on the provided keypoints, I decide to accept this paper with the following reasons:
1. The paper tackles a specific and interesting problem in the field of cryptography and machine learning, which is learning encryption using neural networks.
2. The approach is well-motivated and placed in the literature, drawing connections to existing work on adversarial training and generative models.
The paper supports its claims through a series of experiments, including the demonstration of symmetric and asymmetric encryption, as well as selective protection. The results show that the neural networks can learn to communicate securely and protect specific information.
To improve the paper, I suggest the following:
* Provide more details on the neural network architecture and training procedures to facilitate reproducibility.
* Include more analysis on the learned encryption methods and their security properties.
* Explore the application of this approach to more complex scenarios, such as multiple adversaries or dynamic environments.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper are:
* How do the authors ensure that the learned encryption methods are secure against other types of attacks, such as side-channel attacks or quantum computer attacks?
* Can the authors provide more insights into the neural network's decision-making process when learning to encrypt and decrypt messages?
* How do the authors plan to extend this work to more practical scenarios, such as encrypting large amounts of data or protecting against multiple adversaries?
