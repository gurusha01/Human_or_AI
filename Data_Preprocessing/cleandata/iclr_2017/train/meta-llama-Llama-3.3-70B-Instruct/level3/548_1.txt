Summary
The paper proposes a novel regularizer, Charged Point Normalization (CPN), to help escape saddle points in high-dimensional non-convex optimization problems. The authors draw inspiration from physics and demonstrate the effectiveness of CPN on various deep neural networks and datasets. The idea is interesting and diverse, with potential applications in multiple fields.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, primarily due to two key reasons: weak justification and poor writing. The paper lacks proper introduction and explanation of variables and equations, making it difficult to follow. Additionally, the experiments and results are not convincing, with unclear figures and labels.
Supporting Arguments
The paper has several drawbacks that detract from its overall quality. The justification for the proposed method is weak, and the writing is poor, making it challenging to understand the authors' intentions. The introduction and explanation of variables, such as p in section 2.3, and equations, like Equation 6, are inadequate. The paper requires more analysis and explanation of key components, such as the function φ and its hyper-parameter α, as well as the choice of hyper-parameters for the models.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, I suggest the authors provide more detailed explanations of their method, including the motivation behind the Charged Point Normalization. They should also include additional results, such as validation or test results, and clearer figures and labels to strengthen the paper. Furthermore, the authors should address the question of whether they backpropagate through $\tilde{\mW}_i^t$ and provide clarification on this point.
Questions for the Authors
1. Can you provide more details on the motivation behind the Charged Point Normalization and how it relates to the physics-inspired metaphor?
2. How do you backpropagate through $\tilde{\mW}_i^t$, and can you provide more information on this process?
3. Can you include more comprehensive results, such as validation or test results, to support the claims made in the paper?
