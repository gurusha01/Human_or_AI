Summary
The paper proposes a new machine comprehension dataset, NewsQA, which consists of over 100,000 question-answer pairs based on news articles from CNN. The dataset is designed to encourage exploratory, curiosity-based questions that require reasoning mechanisms, such as synthesis of information across different parts of an article. The authors analyze the dataset and compare it to existing comprehension datasets, demonstrating its challenge and usefulness as a machine comprehension benchmark.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the paper lacks a clear differentiation between the proposed method and existing seq-to-seq RNNs, making it unclear what unique benefits the new approach offers. Secondly, the experimental section is weak, lacking comparisons to other methods and failing to quantify the success rate of learning data structures, making the paper's claims unsupported by sufficient evidence.
Supporting Arguments
The paper proposes a new dataset, NewsQA, which is a significant contribution to the field of machine comprehension. However, the paper fails to provide a clear motivation for the proposed method, including a lack of comparison to existing work on learning data structures. The experimental section is also limited, with only two baseline models evaluated, and no comparison to other state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, the paper uses MNIST digits instead of a categorical distribution on numbers, which unnecessarily adds complexity to the experiment.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide a clearer motivation for the proposed method, including a review of existing work on learning data structures. The authors should also strengthen the experimental section by evaluating the proposed method on a wider range of datasets and comparing it to other state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, the authors should consider using a more suitable dataset, such as a categorical distribution on numbers, to evaluate the proposed method.
Questions for the Authors
I would like to ask the authors to clarify the following points:
* How does the proposed method differ from existing seq-to-seq RNNs, and what unique benefits does it offer?
* Can the authors provide more details on the experimental setup, including the hyperparameters used and the evaluation metrics?
* How do the authors plan to address the lack of comparison to other state-of-the-art methods in the experimental section?
* Can the authors provide more insight into the choice of dataset used in the experiment, and why MNIST digits were chosen instead of a categorical distribution on numbers?
