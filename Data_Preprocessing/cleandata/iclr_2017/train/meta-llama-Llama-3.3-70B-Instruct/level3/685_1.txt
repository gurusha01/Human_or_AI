Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper proposes a novel approach to understanding the loss surface of deep neural networks, focusing on the topological and geometrical aspects of the optimization landscape. The authors provide new theoretical results that quantify the amount of uphill climbing required to progress to lower energy configurations in single hidden-layer ReLU networks and prove that this amount converges to zero with overparametrization under mild conditions. They also introduce a dynamic programming algorithm, Dynamic String Sampling, to efficiently approximate geodesics within each level set, providing a tool to verify the connectedness of level sets and estimate their geometric regularity.
Decision and Key Reasons
Based on the provided guidelines, I decide to Reject the paper. The two key reasons for this decision are:
1. Lack of Clarity in the Evaluation Method: The paper's evaluation method and reported gains in BLEU score are disputed, and the improvement is not statistically significant. This raises concerns about the validity of the results and the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
2. Insufficient Discussion on Computational Complexity: The paper does not provide a thorough discussion on the computational complexity during training and inference, particularly in regards to the use of character-level representations at the output. This omission makes it difficult to assess the practicality and scalability of the proposed approach.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's contributions are significant, and the proposed approach has the potential to improve our understanding of the loss surface of deep neural networks. However, the lack of clarity in the evaluation method and the insufficient discussion on computational complexity are major concerns that need to be addressed. Additionally, the paper's minor errors in figure captions and citation formatting can be easily corrected to improve the paper's clarity and readability.
Additional Feedback and Questions
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors:
* Provide a clearer and more detailed explanation of the evaluation method and the statistical significance of the results.
* Discuss the computational complexity of the proposed approach and its scalability to larger models and datasets.
* Address the minor errors in figure captions and citation formatting.
I would like the authors to answer the following questions to clarify my understanding of the paper and provide additional evidence to support their claims:
* Can you provide more details on the evaluation method and the statistical significance of the results?
* How does the computational complexity of the proposed approach scale with the size of the model and the dataset?
* Can you provide more insights into the trade-offs between the proposed approach and other existing methods for handling large vocabularies?
