This paper proposes a novel approach to instance-level image retrieval using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The authors investigate the impact of various factors on the performance of image retrieval, including feature aggregation, output layer selection, image resizing, multi-scale feature representation, and PCA and whitening. Based on their experimental results, they propose a new multi-scale image representation method that achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmark datasets.
I decide to accept this paper for several reasons. Firstly, the paper tackles a specific question/problem, which is to improve the performance of instance-level image retrieval using CNNs. The approach is well-motivated, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of the factors that impact the performance of image retrieval. The paper supports its claims with convincing qualitative and quantitative results, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method.
The strengths of the paper include its thorough experimental evaluation, which provides valuable insights into the factors that affect the performance of image retrieval. The authors also propose a novel multi-scale image representation method that outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their approach and results.
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more analysis on the computational cost of their method and compare it with other state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, it would be interesting to see how the proposed method performs on other datasets and tasks, such as object detection and image classification.
I have several questions that I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper. Firstly, how do the authors select the optimal number of scales for the multi-scale representation? Secondly, how do the authors determine the optimal weighting scheme for the features from different scales? Finally, can the authors provide more details on the network transformations used in their approach and how they affect the performance of the method? 
Overall, I believe that this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of image retrieval and provides a valuable insight into the factors that affect the performance of CNNs in this task. With some minor revisions to address the above questions and suggestions, I am confident that this paper will be a strong addition to the conference program.
