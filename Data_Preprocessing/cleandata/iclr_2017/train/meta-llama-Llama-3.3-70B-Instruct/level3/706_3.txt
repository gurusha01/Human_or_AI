This paper proposes a novel approach to incorporating prior procedural knowledge into neural networks by introducing a differentiable abstract machine for the Forth programming language, called ∂4. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of ∂4 in learning complex transduction tasks, such as sequence sorting and addition, with substantially less data and better generalization over problem sizes.
However, I have some concerns regarding the paper. Firstly, the motivation for using a mixture prior for variational auto-encoders is not clearly explained, and I am not convinced that a uni-modal prior would hinder the model's expressivity. In fact, a uni-modal distribution on the latent variable space can still capture complex, multi-modal data distributions.
Secondly, the influence of the prior's multimodality on the posterior's ability to capture complex phenomena is unclear, and I suggest considering a more complex distribution on the latent space instead. Furthermore, the paper can be significantly condensed without losing clarity, and I recommend shortening the 14-page document.
Based on these concerns, I decide to reject the paper. The main reasons for this decision are the unclear motivation for using a mixture prior and the lack of clarity in the paper.
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors extensively study the effect of different priors on the model's performance and provide more convincing evidence for the benefits of using a mixture prior. Additionally, the authors should consider condensing the paper and providing more clear and concise explanations of their approach.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper are: (1) Can you provide more details on how the prior's multimodality affects the posterior's ability to capture complex phenomena? (2) How do you plan to address the issue of the paper's length and clarity? (3) Can you provide more convincing evidence for the benefits of using a mixture prior in variational auto-encoders?
Overall, while the paper presents an interesting approach to incorporating prior procedural knowledge into neural networks, it requires significant improvements in terms of clarity, motivation, and evidence to support its claims.
