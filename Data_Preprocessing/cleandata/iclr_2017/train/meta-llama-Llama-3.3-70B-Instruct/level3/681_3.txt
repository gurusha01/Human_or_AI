This research paper presents a promising analysis of the nonlinear dynamics of two-layered bias-free ReLU networks. The authors provide a novel and concise gradient update rule for multilayer ReLU networks and prove the convergence of the dynamics to the teacher parameters under certain conditions. The paper also explores the behavior of the network when the teacher parameters form an orthonormal basis and provides a detailed analysis of the convergence properties.
The strengths of the paper include the introduction of a new descriptor and a fast implementation, which are notable contributions to the field. The authors also provide a thorough analysis of the dynamics of the network, including the derivation of a close-form nonlinear dynamics for the single ReLU node case and the proof of convergence to the teacher parameters.
However, there are some weaknesses and areas for improvement. The paper lacks comparison with more baselines and a precise description from a signal processing point of view. The authors could benefit from providing more context and background information on the relevance of the problem and the significance of the results. Additionally, the paper could be improved by addressing the lack of rigor, excessive length, unclear computational gain, and lack of comparison with the scattering transform baseline.
One of the key concerns is the use of complex modulus as a nonlinearity in the scattering network. The reviewer questions whether this is the best choice, as the complex modulus has a bell shape when interpreted as R^2. The motivation for the non-linearity used in the work is unclear, and it may increase the variance of the architecture. The reviewer suggests that the energy decrease of the architecture should be proven, and a numerical computation of the normalized variance should be performed as a sanity check.
Furthermore, the notion of sparsity in the paper is inconsistent, sometimes referring to the number of 0 values and other times to the l^1 norm. The wavelet defined in the work is not a Morlet wavelet, contrary to what is claimed. The authors should clarify these points and provide a more precise definition of sparsity and its relation to the wavelet transform.
To improve the paper, the authors should address the following questions:
* Can the authors provide more context and background information on the relevance of the problem and the significance of the results?
* How does the proposed method compare to other state-of-the-art methods in terms of computational gain and accuracy?
* Can the authors provide a more precise definition of sparsity and its relation to the wavelet transform?
* How does the use of complex modulus as a nonlinearity in the scattering network affect the results, and is it the best choice?
* Can the authors provide a numerical computation of the normalized variance as a sanity check?
Overall, the paper presents a promising analysis of the nonlinear dynamics of two-layered bias-free ReLU networks, but requires further clarification and improvement to address the concerns and questions raised by the reviewer. 
I decide to reject this paper. The two main reasons for this choice are: 
1. The paper lacks comparison with more baselines and a precise description from a signal processing point of view.
2. The paper has several areas that need improvement, including the lack of rigor, excessive length, unclear computational gain, and lack of comparison with the scattering transform baseline. 
These two reasons outweigh the positive aspects of the paper, and I believe that the authors need to address these concerns before the paper can be considered for acceptance.
