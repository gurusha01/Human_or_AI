This paper presents a novel approach to learning symmetric and asymmetric encryption using neural networks. The authors demonstrate that neural networks can learn to protect communications without being prescribed a particular set of cryptographic algorithms. The approach is based on adversarial training, where the neural networks are trained to minimize the reconstruction error of the intended recipient while maximizing the error of an adversary.
The paper claims to contribute to the field of cryptography and machine learning by showing that neural networks can learn to use secret keys to protect information from other neural networks. The authors also demonstrate that the neural networks can learn to apply encryption selectively in order to meet confidentiality goals.
I decide to accept this paper with the following key reasons: 
1. The paper tackles a specific and well-defined problem in the field of cryptography and machine learning, which is learning symmetric and asymmetric encryption using neural networks.
2. The approach presented in the paper is well-motivated and placed in the literature, drawing on concepts from cryptography, machine learning, and adversarial training.
The paper supports its claims through a series of experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach. The experiments show that the neural networks can learn to communicate securely and defeat an adversary, and that the approach can be used to learn selective protection.
However, there are some areas that need improvement. For example, the paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the neural network architecture and the training process. Additionally, the paper could provide more comparison with other common encryption methods in a supervised task.
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the neural network architecture and the training process, and that they compare their approach with other common encryption methods. I would also like the authors to answer the following questions: 
1. How do the authors plan to extend this work to more complex cryptographic tasks, such as steganography or pseudorandom-number generation?
2. How do the authors plan to address the issue of "security by obscurity" in their approach, and what measures can be taken to ensure that the neural networks are not simply relying on obscurity rather than true security?
3. Can the authors provide more insight into the neural network's decision-making process, and how it learns to apply encryption selectively? 
Overall, the paper presents a novel and interesting approach to learning symmetric and asymmetric encryption using neural networks, and with some revisions, it has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field.
