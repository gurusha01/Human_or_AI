The paper presents an interesting modification to the PoWER algorithm, introducing a dynamic neural Turing machine (D-NTM) that employs a learnable and location-based addressing scheme. This extension allows the D-NTM to perform highly nonlinear location-based addressing, making it a promising approach for tasks that require complex memory management.
However, I decide to reject this paper for two main reasons. Firstly, the experiments fail to demonstrate the claimed benefits, generality, and scalability of the modified algorithm over prior methods, particularly in large-scale domains. The evaluation is limited to simple domains such as Cartpole and the ad targeting task, which lacks comparison with alternative methods. Secondly, the method's performance may be limited due to its connection with RWR and PoWER, which can suffer in high-dimensional or continuous action spaces, such as those encountered in entropy-regularized RL.
To support my decision, I analyze the paper's approach and findings. The D-NTM is well-motivated, and its introduction of a learnable address vector for each memory cell allows the model to learn sophisticated location-based addressing strategies. However, the experimental results are not convincing, and the comparison with other methods is limited. The paper's claims about the benefits of the D-NTM are not fully supported by the empirical evidence.
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more comprehensive experiments, including comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods and evaluations on more complex domains. Additionally, the authors should address the potential limitations of the D-NTM and provide more insights into its performance in different scenarios.
I would like the authors to answer the following questions to clarify my understanding of the paper and provide additional evidence to support their claims: 
1. Can you provide more details on the experimental setup and the hyperparameter tuning process?
2. How do you plan to address the potential limitations of the D-NTM in high-dimensional or continuous action spaces?
3. Can you provide more comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods and evaluations on more complex domains to demonstrate the generality and scalability of the D-NTM? 
These questions and suggestions are intended to help the authors improve their paper and provide more convincing evidence to support their claims.
