Summary
The paper proposes a novel approach to transferring skills between robots with different morphologies using a task-invariant future space that can be shared between tasks and agents. The authors introduce Attentive Recurrent Comparators (ARCs), a class of neural networks that learn to estimate the similarity of a set of objects by cycling through them and making observations. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of ARCs in various visual tasks, including one-shot learning, and shows that they outperform existing methods, including Deep Convolutional Siamese Networks.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the paper lacks comprehensive comparison to other transfer methods, including those listed in Sec.2, which would be valuable to assess the effectiveness of the proposed method. Secondly, the assumption that time alignment can be used for state pairing is problematic and needs further validation to ensure the reliability of the proposed method.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's method is compared to previous work, but the authors' claims of handling non-linear dynamics better than other methods, such as Raimalwala et al (2016), need more empirical evidence to support them. Additionally, the robustness of the method to misspecification of the pairing correspondence is a major concern, and the use of dynamic time warping or similar methods could be explored to achieve better results.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, the authors could provide more detailed analysis of the ARC model's performance on different tasks and datasets, and compare it to other state-of-the-art methods. They could also explore the use of other attention mechanisms and recurrent neural network architectures to improve the model's performance. Furthermore, the authors could provide more insight into the interpretability of the ARC model's decisions and how they can be used to improve the model's performance.
Questions for the Authors
I would like to ask the authors to clarify the following points:
* How do the authors plan to address the issue of misspecification of the pairing correspondence, and what methods do they propose to use to improve the robustness of the method?
* Can the authors provide more detailed analysis of the ARC model's performance on different tasks and datasets, and compare it to other state-of-the-art methods?
* How do the authors plan to extend the ARC model to more complex tasks and datasets, and what are the potential limitations of the model?
