This paper explores the possibility of learning game concepts, specifically tic-tac-toe, under weak supervision with convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The authors propose a novel testing protocol to confirm whether a CNN has understood the game concepts by analyzing the class activation mapping (CAM) results. The paper claims to contribute to three main areas: (1) learning game concepts without explicit supervision, (2) cross-modal supervision for representation learning, and (3) the ability of CAM to activate at non-salient regions.
Based on the provided guidelines, I decide to Reject this paper with two key reasons: (1) the authors' claim that the CNN has figured out the game rules is not supported by experiments, as it only considers one stage of the game and does not test generalization, and (2) the definition of cross-modal supervision is unclear and does not provide new insights, as CNNs have already been used to map images to actions in previous work.
The paper's approach is well-motivated, and the use of CAM to visualize the salient regions responsible for the prediction is interesting. However, the authors' claim that the CNN has understood the game concepts is not supported by the experimental setup. The paper only considers one stage of the game, and the generalization ability of the learned representation is not tested. Furthermore, the definition of cross-modal supervision is unclear, and the paper does not provide new insights into this area.
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide additional experiments to test the generalization ability of the learned representation and clarify the definition of cross-modal supervision. Additionally, visualizing CAM with respect to incorrect classes and using a validation set to evaluate the generalizability of the features learned by the CNN would be helpful.
I would like to ask the authors to clarify the following points: (1) How do the authors plan to test the generalization ability of the learned representation? (2) Can the authors provide more insights into the definition of cross-modal supervision and how it differs from previous work? (3) How do the authors plan to address the issue of the CNN only considering one stage of the game? 
Overall, while the paper is well-written and explores an interesting area, it requires additional experiments and clarifications to support the authors' claims and provide new insights into the field.
