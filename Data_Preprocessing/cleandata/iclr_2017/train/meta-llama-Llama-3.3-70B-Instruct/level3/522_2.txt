Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper presents a novel approach to sequence-to-sequence transduction by formulating it as a noisy channel decoding problem. The authors propose a recurrent neural network-based model that parameterizes the source and channel models, allowing for the use of unpaired output data to estimate the source model's parameters. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach on three natural language processing tasks: abstractive sentence summarization, machine translation, and morphological inflection generation.
Decision
Based on the evaluation of the paper, I decide to Accept it. The two key reasons for this choice are:
1. The paper tackles a specific and well-motivated problem in sequence-to-sequence transduction, and the approach is well-placed in the literature.
2. The paper presents original and rigorous analysis, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on multiple tasks.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a clear and well-structured presentation of the problem, approach, and results. The authors motivate the use of noisy channel models and provide a thorough analysis of the proposed approach. The experimental results are comprehensive and demonstrate the benefits of using unpaired output data to improve the performance of sequence-to-sequence models.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest the following:
* Clarify the relationship between the proposed approach and existing work on sequence-to-sequence transduction, such as the use of attention mechanisms and beam search.
* Provide more detailed analysis of the results, including error analysis and comparison to other state-of-the-art models.
* Consider adding more tasks or datasets to demonstrate the generalizability of the proposed approach.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
* Can you provide more details on the implementation of the latent alignment variable and how it is used in the decoding process?
* How do you handle out-of-vocabulary words in the proposed approach, and what are the implications for the performance of the model?
* Can you provide more insight into the trade-offs between the direct model and the noisy channel model, and how they are combined in the proposed approach?
