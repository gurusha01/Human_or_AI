This paper proposes a novel approach to jointly learn automatic segmentation of words to subwords and their acoustic models, handling word segmentation as a hidden variable. The authors achieve improvements over character-based results, but lack comparison with word segmentation methods that don't rely on acoustic dependencies. 
I decide to accept this paper with the reason that the approach is well-motivated and the results are correct and scientifically rigorous. The paper tackles a specific question of learning automatic segmentation of words to subwords and their acoustic models, and the approach is well-placed in the literature. The use of longer acoustic units and constraints may contribute to the model's performance, potentially leading to fewer confused searches and more accurate results.
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors compare their model to a full-word model without segmentation and explore its performance in extreme cases with multiple possible segmentations. Additionally, the authors could provide more analysis on the model's ability to outperform full-word models in certain scenarios. 
Some questions I would like the authors to answer include: How does the model handle out-of-vocabulary words or words with multiple possible segmentations? Can the model be extended to handle more complex linguistic structures, such as syntax or semantics? How does the model's performance compare to other state-of-the-art models in the field? 
Overall, the paper presents a novel and well-motivated approach to learning automatic segmentation of words to subwords and their acoustic models, and with some additional analysis and comparisons, it has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field. 
To improve the paper, I suggest the authors to provide more details on the experimental setup, such as the dataset used, the evaluation metrics, and the hyperparameters tuned. Additionally, the authors could provide more visualizations or examples to illustrate the model's performance and strengths. 
In terms of future work, the authors could explore applying their approach to other languages or domains, such as speech recognition or machine translation. They could also investigate using other types of constraints or regularization techniques to improve the model's performance. 
In conclusion, the paper presents a well-motivated and scientifically rigorous approach to learning automatic segmentation of words to subwords and their acoustic models. With some additional analysis and comparisons, it has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field. I accept this paper and look forward to seeing the authors' future work.
