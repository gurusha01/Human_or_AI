Summary
The paper proposes a method to predict learning curves of iterative machine learning algorithms using Bayesian neural networks. The authors develop a specialized neural network architecture with a learning curve layer that improves learning curve predictions. They evaluate their approach on several datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness in predicting asymptotic values of partially observed learning curves and unobserved learning curves. The authors also extend the Hyperband algorithm to use their model for hyperparameter optimization, showing improved performance over standard Hyperband and Bayesian optimization.
Decision
I decide to accept this paper, with the main reason being that the approach is well-motivated and the results are scientifically rigorous. The authors provide a clear and thorough evaluation of their method, including comparisons to other approaches and ablation studies.
Supporting Arguments
The paper tackles a specific and important problem in machine learning, namely the prediction of learning curves. The authors provide a clear and well-motivated approach, building on existing work in the field. The results are impressive, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method in predicting asymptotic values and unobserved learning curves. The extension of Hyperband using the proposed model is also a significant contribution, showing improved performance over standard Hyperband and Bayesian optimization.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, I would like to see more discussion on the choice of basis functions and the learning curve layer. The authors mention that they used a subset of the basis functions from Domhan et al. (2015), but it would be helpful to understand the reasoning behind this choice. Additionally, the authors could provide more details on the implementation of the learning curve layer and how it improves the predictions.
Questions
I would like the authors to clarify the following points:
* Can the authors provide more details on the implementation of the learning curve layer and how it improves the predictions?
* How did the authors choose the basis functions and what is the reasoning behind using a subset of the functions from Domhan et al. (2015)?
* Can the authors provide more discussion on the limitations of their approach and potential future directions?
