Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper proposes a novel adversarial learning formulation that enables the discriminator to retain density information, allowing it to be used as a scoring function for sample evaluation. The authors introduce a flexible adversarial training framework and prove that it ensures the generator converges to the true data distribution while the discriminator retains the density information at the global optimum. They also derive the analytic form of the induced solution and analyze its properties. The paper presents two effective approximation techniques to optimize the training objective and verifies the results empirically.
Decision: Reject
The paper is rejected due to two key reasons. Firstly, the results presented in the paper are somewhat confusing, and the difference in performance between the proposed model and the baseline models is not significant. Secondly, the paper lacks clarity on the differences between the proposed model and other existing models, such as energy-based GANs, and does not provide a comprehensive comparison with other state-of-the-art models.
Supporting Arguments
The paper proposes a novel adversarial learning formulation, but the results presented are not convincing. The authors claim that the proposed model can capture density information, but the visualizations and quantitative comparisons do not clearly demonstrate this. The paper also lacks a clear explanation of how the proposed model differs from other existing models, such as energy-based GANs, and does not provide a comprehensive comparison with other state-of-the-art models.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, the authors should provide more convincing results and clarify the differences between the proposed model and other existing models. They should also provide a more comprehensive comparison with other state-of-the-art models and address the limitations of the proposed model. Additionally, the authors should consider providing more details on the implementation of the proposed model and the approximation techniques used.
