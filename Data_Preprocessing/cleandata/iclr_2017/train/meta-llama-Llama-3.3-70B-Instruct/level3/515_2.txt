Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper introduces a simple yet effective baseline for detecting misclassified and out-of-distribution examples using softmax prediction probabilities. The authors demonstrate the efficacy of this baseline across various tasks in computer vision, natural language processing, and automatic speech recognition. They also propose an abnormality module that can be used to improve detection performance by exploiting the internal representations of neural networks.
Decision and Key Reasons
I am undecided about accepting or rejecting this paper, with the main reason being that while the idea is interesting and the baseline is effective, the analysis of its novel aspects is insufficient. Specifically, the paper lacks a thorough comparison to other existing methods and a more detailed analysis of the abnormality module's performance.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's contributions are theoretically interesting and elegant, combining established machinery to form an efficient polynomial linear model. However, the empirical analysis is insufficient, with unclear performance boosts from certain initializations and a lack of important baselines, such as comparison to a vanilla feed-forward neural network. Additionally, the paper devotes too much effort to explaining prior work, rather than analyzing the novel aspects of the model.
Additional Feedback and Questions
To improve the paper, I would suggest adding more comparisons to existing methods and providing a more detailed analysis of the abnormality module's performance. Specifically, I would like to see answers to the following questions:
* How does the proposed baseline compare to other existing methods for detecting misclassified and out-of-distribution examples?
* Can the authors provide more insights into the abnormality module's performance, such as its robustness to different types of noise and its ability to detect out-of-distribution examples in different domains?
* How do the authors plan to address the issue of threshold selection in the abnormality module, and what are the implications of this choice on the detection performance?
