This paper proposes a novel approach to integrate efficient inference within the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework, called Adversarially Learned Inference (ALI). The authors claim that ALI jointly learns a generation network and an inference network using an adversarial process, allowing for mutually coherent inference and generation networks. The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with a clear explanation of the methodology and experimental results.
I decide to reject this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the proposed method is not very original, and the methodological contributions are almost non-existent. The idea of using an adversarial process to learn inference networks is not new, and the authors do not provide significant improvements or novel insights. Secondly, the results seem significant, but it is not clear how useful they can be in practice, and the authors should consider more challenging problems with clear practical interest.
To support my decision, I provide the following arguments. The authors validate their method on a toy problem and a financial problem, but the problems considered are too easy and do not demonstrate the method's performance in more challenging settings. The paper lacks a thorough comparison with existing methods, and the authors should provide more detailed analysis and evaluation of their approach. Additionally, the authors should consider providing more details about the plot in Figure 2 and clarification on the choice of a Dirichlet distribution.
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors consider the following feedback. They should provide more detailed analysis and evaluation of their approach, including a thorough comparison with existing methods. The authors should also consider more challenging problems with clear practical interest, and provide more detailed explanations of the methodology and experimental results. Furthermore, the authors should address the minor comments, including requesting more details about the plot in Figure 2 and clarification on the choice of a Dirichlet distribution.
I would like the authors to answer the following questions to clarify my understanding of the paper and provide additional evidence to support their claims. Can the authors provide more details about the plot in Figure 2 and explain the choice of a Dirichlet distribution? How do the authors plan to address the lack of originality and methodological contributions in their approach? Can the authors provide more challenging problems with clear practical interest to demonstrate the performance of their method?
