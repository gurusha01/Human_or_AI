Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper proposes a novel approach to learning chess game concepts under weak supervision using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The authors investigate whether a CNN can automatically figure out complicated game rule concepts, such as the chessboard grid, winning rule, and two sides, without being explicitly told. The paper also explores the applicability of cross-modal supervision for representation learning in this context and demonstrates that class activation mapping (CAM) can activate at non-salient regions.
Decision and Reasons
I decide to reject this paper, primarily due to two reasons. Firstly, the paper's content and density may be more suitable for a journal format than a conference format, making it difficult to read and understand within the limited time frame of a conference. Secondly, the training method, which requires providing the graph state at each timestep, may be limited to specific tasks and not applicable to more complex problems, which raises concerns about the generalizability of the approach.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's approach to learning chess game concepts under weak supervision is innovative and well-motivated, and the authors provide interesting results and analysis. However, the paper's length and complexity make it challenging to fully appreciate the contributions within the context of a conference. Additionally, the limited applicability of the training method may restrict the potential impact of the approach.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors consider condensing the content to focus on the most critical contributions and results, making it more suitable for a conference format. Additionally, the authors may want to explore ways to extend the training method to more complex problems, demonstrating the approach's generalizability and potential for broader impact.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper and provide additional evidence, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
1. How do the authors plan to address the potential limitations of the training method, and what strategies can be employed to extend the approach to more complex problems?
2. Can the authors provide more insight into the trade-offs between using a CNN and other machine learning approaches for learning chess game concepts under weak supervision?
3. How do the authors envision the proposed approach being applied to real-world problems, and what potential applications can be explored in future work?
