The paper proposes a new approach to evaluating the performance of decoder-based generative models using annealed importance sampling (AIS). The authors claim that their method provides a more accurate estimate of the log-likelihood of these models compared to existing methods such as kernel density estimation (KDE) and importance weighting. The paper also presents several scientific findings, including the comparison of log-likelihoods between different models, the degree of overfitting, and the ability of the models to capture important modes of the data distribution.
I decide to reject this paper for two main reasons. Firstly, the paper lacks quantitative validation and a thorough discussion of its relationship with prior work, particularly with respect to the AIS and RAISE algorithms. The authors do not provide sufficient evidence to support their claims, and the analysis in Appendix D is incorrect, assuming constant temperature and not accounting for varying temperatures. Secondly, the paper fails to report log-likelihood estimates, which could be easily obtained using importance sampling, and should be compared to prior results on MNIST.
The approach proposed in the paper is not well-motivated, and the authors do not provide a clear justification for their method. The paper also lacks a thorough discussion of the limitations and potential biases of the proposed approach. The analysis of the results is also limited, and the authors do not provide a clear interpretation of the findings.
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide a more thorough discussion of the relationship between their approach and prior work, including a clear explanation of how their method differs from existing methods. The authors should also provide more quantitative validation of their approach, including log-likelihood estimates and comparisons to prior results on MNIST. Additionally, the authors should address the limitations and potential biases of their approach and provide a clear interpretation of the results.
I would like the authors to answer the following questions to clarify my understanding of the paper: (1) How does the proposed approach differ from existing methods such as AIS and RAISE, and what are the advantages and limitations of the proposed approach? (2) Can the authors provide more quantitative validation of their approach, including log-likelihood estimates and comparisons to prior results on MNIST? (3) How do the authors address the limitations and potential biases of their approach, and what are the implications of the results for the evaluation of decoder-based generative models?
