Summary
The paper proposes a new perspective on Highway and Residual networks, suggesting that they perform unrolled iterative estimation. This view posits that successive layers within a stage cooperate to compute a single level of representation, with the first layer providing a rough estimate that is then iteratively refined by subsequent layers. The authors derive both Residual and Highway networks from this perspective, providing a unified theory for understanding these architectures. They also present experimental results comparing the performance of Highway and Residual networks on image classification and language modeling tasks.
Decision
I decide to accept this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the paper provides a novel and well-motivated perspective on Highway and Residual networks, which is supported by mathematical derivations and experimental results. Secondly, the authors' comparative study of Highway and Residual networks on different tasks provides valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each architecture.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's contribution is significant because it challenges the traditional representation view of deep neural networks, which assumes that each layer computes a new level of abstraction. The authors' iterative estimation perspective provides a more nuanced understanding of how Highway and Residual networks operate, and their experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this perspective in explaining the behavior of these architectures. The paper is also well-written and easy to follow, with clear explanations of the mathematical derivations and experimental results.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more detailed analysis of the experimental results, particularly in terms of the implications of their findings for the design of future neural network architectures. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more comparisons between Highway and Residual networks on other tasks, such as object detection or segmentation. Finally, the authors may want to consider discussing the potential limitations of their iterative estimation perspective, and how it might be extended or modified to accommodate other types of neural network architectures.
Questions for the Authors
I would like the authors to clarify the following points:
1. How do the authors plan to extend their iterative estimation perspective to other types of neural network architectures, such as recurrent neural networks or graph neural networks?
2. Can the authors provide more detailed analysis of the experimental results, particularly in terms of the implications of their findings for the design of future neural network architectures?
3. How do the authors think their work will impact the development of new neural network architectures, and what potential applications do they see for their iterative estimation perspective?
