The paper presents a method for instance-level image retrieval using features extracted from convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The authors evaluate the impact of five factors on the performance of image retrieval, including feature aggregation and normalization, output layer selection, image resizing, multi-scale feature representation, and PCA and whitening. Based on the experimental results, the authors propose a new multi-scale image representation method, which achieves superior performance over previous methods on four datasets.
I decide to reject this paper with two key reasons: the novelty of the paper is low due to similarities with existing work, and the paper's presentation is not general enough for a broad audience. The paper builds on the work of Mathieu et al. and shares similarities with two-stream networks and pose estimation applications, which reduces its novelty. Additionally, the paper lacks proper explanations of key concepts, such as losses and adversarial training, and the notation and equations are unclear, which makes it difficult for a broad audience to understand.
The paper's technical issues, including typos, grammatical errors, and a lack of information on pre-training and potential overfitting problems, also support the decision to reject. The paper's failure to provide a clear and concise presentation of the method and its limitations makes it difficult to evaluate its effectiveness and potential applications.
To improve the paper, the authors should provide a clearer and more concise presentation of the method, including proper explanations of key concepts and notation. They should also address the technical issues and provide more information on pre-training and potential overfitting problems. Additionally, the authors should clarify how their method differs from existing work and provide more evidence of its effectiveness and potential applications.
I would like the authors to answer the following questions to clarify my understanding of the paper: How does the proposed method differ from existing work on instance-level image retrieval? What are the key limitations of the method, and how do the authors plan to address them in future work? How do the authors plan to evaluate the effectiveness of the method in real-world applications, and what are the potential challenges and limitations of deploying the method in practice?
