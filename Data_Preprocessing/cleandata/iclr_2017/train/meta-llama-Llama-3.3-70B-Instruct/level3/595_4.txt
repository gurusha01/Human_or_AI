This paper presents a novel approach to learning symmetric and asymmetric encryption using neural networks. The authors propose a method where neural networks, representing Alice, Bob, and Eve, are trained to communicate securely without being prescribed a specific cryptographic algorithm. The key idea is to train Alice and Bob to minimize their reconstruction error while maximizing Eve's reconstruction error, thus learning to protect their communication from eavesdropping.
The paper claims to contribute to the field of cryptography and machine learning by demonstrating that neural networks can learn to protect communications without being explicitly taught cryptographic algorithms. The authors also explore the concept of selective protection, where neural networks learn to hide specific information while maximizing utility.
After carefully evaluating the paper, I decide to Reject it with the following key reasons:
1. Lack of comparison with existing work: The paper lacks a thorough comparison with other works on context-specific embeddings and cryptographic techniques, making it difficult to assess the effectiveness of the proposed method.
2. Insufficient exploration of tradeoffs: The paper does not fully explore the tradeoffs between complexity and accuracy in optimizing the ELBO and using Jacobian vectors, which is crucial for understanding the limitations and potential applications of the proposed method.
To improve the paper, I suggest the following:
* Provide a more comprehensive comparison with existing works on cryptographic techniques and context-specific embeddings to demonstrate the novelty and effectiveness of the proposed method.
* Conduct a more thorough exploration of the tradeoffs between complexity and accuracy in optimizing the ELBO and using Jacobian vectors, including experiments with different architectures and hyperparameters.
* Consider providing more theoretical analysis and justification for the proposed method, including proofs of security and convergence guarantees.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper include:
* How do the authors plan to address the issue of "security by obscurity" in their asymmetric encryption experiments, and what additional measures can be taken to ensure the security of the proposed method?
* Can the authors provide more insight into the neural network architecture and training procedures used in the experiments, including the specific hyperparameters and optimization algorithms employed?
* How do the authors envision the proposed method being applied in practice, and what potential applications or use cases do they see for this technology?
