This paper introduces a novel approach to multitask deep reinforcement learning guided by policy sketches, which annotate each task with a sequence of named subtasks. The proposed framework associates every subtask with its own modular subpolicy and jointly optimizes over full task-specific policies by tying parameters across shared subpolicies. The approach is evaluated on a maze navigation game and a 2-D Minecraft-inspired crafting game, demonstrating substantial improvements over policy gradient baselines and the ability to generalize to new tasks.
I decide to accept this paper, with the key reason being the novelty and effectiveness of the proposed approach. The paper presents a well-motivated and well-placed approach in the literature, and the experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over existing baselines.
The approach is well-supported by the claims made in the paper, with the results showing that the proposed method outperforms the baselines in both the maze and crafting environments. The use of a decoupled actor-critic method and curriculum learning scheme are also shown to be essential for good performance.
To further improve the paper, I suggest including more details on the implementation of the subpolicies and the critic, as well as providing more analysis on the learned models' ability to generalize to new tasks. Additionally, it would be helpful to include more comparisons with other existing methods in the field.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper include: How do the authors plan to extend the approach to more complex tasks and environments? How do the learned subpolicies generalize to new tasks, and what is the role of the critic in this process? What are the potential applications of this approach in real-world scenarios? 
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of multitask deep reinforcement learning, and with some minor revisions, it has the potential to be a strong addition to the conference program.
