Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper presents a novel approach to learning multi-sense word embeddings using a multi-view Bayesian non-parametric algorithm. The algorithm leverages multilingual distributional information to improve sense embeddings beyond what can be achieved with bilingual information. The authors demonstrate that their approach can achieve competitive performance with state-of-the-art monolingual models trained on much larger corpora.
Decision and Reasons
Based on the review, I decide to Accept the paper. The two key reasons for this decision are:
1. The paper tackles a specific and important problem in the field of AI, namely learning multi-sense word embeddings, and presents a well-motivated and novel approach to addressing this problem.
2. The paper provides strong empirical evidence to support its claims, including experiments on word sense induction and contextual word similarity tasks, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
Supporting Arguments
The paper is well-written and clearly motivated, with a thorough review of related work in the field. The authors provide a detailed description of their algorithm and its components, including the use of a Dirichlet process prior to model sense assignments and the incorporation of multilingual distributional information. The experimental results are impressive, demonstrating the ability of the proposed approach to learn high-quality embeddings using substantially less data and parameters than prior state-of-the-art models.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors consider the following:
* Providing more analysis on the effect of different language families on the performance of the model, as well as the impact of window size on the crosslingual context.
* Exploring the application of the proposed approach to other languages, such as Chinese, and investigating the potential for generating a multilingual Wordnet-like resource in a completely unsupervised manner.
* Considering the addition of rescaled Gaussian noise to gradients during the learning process to leverage the advantages of the stochastic batch regime.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper and provide additional evidence to support my assessment, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
* Can you provide more details on the implementation of the Dirichlet process prior and how it is used to model sense assignments?
* How do you plan to extend the proposed approach to model polysemy in foreign languages, and what are the potential challenges and benefits of doing so?
* Can you provide more analysis on the effect of different hyperparameters, such as the concentration parameter Î± and the maximum number of senses T, on the performance of the model?
