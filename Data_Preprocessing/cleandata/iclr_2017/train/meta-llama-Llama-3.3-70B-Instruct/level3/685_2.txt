Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper proposes a novel approach to studying the loss surface of deep neural networks, focusing on the topological and geometrical aspects of the optimization landscape. The authors provide new theoretical results that quantify the amount of uphill climbing required to progress to lower energy configurations in single hidden-layer ReLU networks and prove that this amount converges to zero with overparametrization under mild conditions. They also introduce a dynamic programming algorithm, called Dynamic String Sampling, to efficiently approximate geodesics within each level set, providing a tool to verify the connectedness of level sets and estimate their geometric regularity.
Decision and Key Reasons
Based on the evaluation criteria, I decide to Reject this paper. The two key reasons for this decision are:
1. Lack of comparison with related research: The paper does not provide a thorough comparison with existing research addressing the same problem of representing unseen words, which makes it difficult to assess the novelty and significance of the proposed approach.
2. Insufficient intrinsic evaluation and investigation: The paper lacks a comprehensive intrinsic evaluation of the proposed model, including an investigation into its strengths and weaknesses, which is essential to understand its performance and limitations.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's theoretical contributions are interesting, but the lack of comparison with related research and insufficient intrinsic evaluation limit the paper's impact and significance. Additionally, the paper's focus on a specific type of neural network (ReLU networks) and the absence of experiments with other morphologically rich languages and machine translation tasks beyond English raise concerns about the generality and applicability of the proposed approach.
Additional Feedback and Questions
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors:
* Provide a thorough comparison with existing research on representing unseen words, including a discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches.
* Conduct a comprehensive intrinsic evaluation of the proposed model, including an analysis of its performance on various tasks and datasets.
* Investigate the applicability of the proposed approach to other types of neural networks and languages.
* Consider experimenting with other machine translation tasks beyond English to demonstrate the generality of the proposed approach.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper and provide additional evidence to support their claims include:
* How does the proposed approach compare to existing methods for representing unseen words, such as subword modeling and character-level modeling?
* What are the limitations of the proposed approach, and how do they affect its performance on different tasks and datasets?
* Can the authors provide more details on the experimental setup and results, including the specific datasets and metrics used to evaluate the proposed approach?
