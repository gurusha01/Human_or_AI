Summary
The paper proposes a novel approach to improve word vector representations by estimating the context sensitivity of paraphrases and using them to inform a word embedding learning model. The authors introduce a fuzzy set-based method to annotate each paraphrase with a degree of reliability, which is then used to control the replacement of words in a corpus with their paraphrases. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms simpler approaches and achieves top scores compared to prior works.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, primarily due to the weak experimental evaluation and the lack of thorough justification for the model formulation.
Supporting Arguments
The experimental evaluation is limited, and the results are inconclusive. For instance, the paper reports that CBOW performs better on the semantic aspect of the analogy task than the proposed embeddings, which is surprising and requires further explanation. Additionally, the model formulation is not thoroughly justified, and the paper would benefit from exploring alternative models or providing more convincing explanations for the chosen model.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, I suggest revising the writing and presentation to clarify unconventional sentence structures and using more descriptive labels for tables. The related work section should also be revised to accurately reflect the contributions of similar papers. Furthermore, the authors should consider providing more detailed explanations for the experimental results and exploring alternative models to strengthen the paper's contributions.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper and provide additional evidence, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
1. Can you provide more detailed explanations for the surprising results, such as CBOW performing better on the semantic aspect of the analogy task?
2. How do you plan to address the limitations of the model formulation and provide more thorough justifications for the chosen approach?
3. Can you provide more information on how the fuzzy set-based method is used to control the replacement of words in the corpus, and how this approach differs from simpler methods?
