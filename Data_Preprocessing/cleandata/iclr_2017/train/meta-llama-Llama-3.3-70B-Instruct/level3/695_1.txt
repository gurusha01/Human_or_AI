Summary
The paper introduces NoiseOut, a novel technique for pruning neural networks by identifying and replacing correlated neuron pairs with a single neuron. The approach relies on introducing a noise output neuron that increases correlation between neurons, allowing for more efficient pruning. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of NoiseOut on various networks and datasets, including MNIST and SVHN, achieving significant compression rates without loss of accuracy.
Decision
I decide to Accept this paper, with the main reason being the novelty and potential of the proposed NoiseOut technique. The paper is well-presented, and the experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.
Supporting Arguments
The paper tackles a specific and relevant problem in the field of neural networks, namely reducing the number of parameters while maintaining accuracy. The approach is well-motivated, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the technique and its underlying principles. The experiments are thorough, and the results are promising, demonstrating the potential of NoiseOut for pruning neural networks.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest the authors consider the following points:
* Provide more experiments on larger datasets to confirm the effectiveness of NoiseOut.
* Investigate the impact of using multiple noise outputs on the overall accuracy of the pruned network.
* Compare NoiseOut with other pruning techniques, such as Optimal Brain Damage and Optimal Brain Surgeon, to demonstrate its advantages.
* Consider applying NoiseOut to other types of neural networks, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
* Can you provide more details on the choice of noise distribution and its impact on the correlation between neurons?
* How do you determine the optimal number of noise outputs for a given network and dataset?
* Have you considered applying NoiseOut to other domains, such as natural language processing or speech recognition, and if so, what were the results?
