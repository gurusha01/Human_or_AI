Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper proposes a novel solution to the problem of over-regularization in Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) by introducing sparsity in the latent representation. The authors introduce PixelVAE, a VAE model with an autoregressive decoder based on PixelCNN, which combines the advantages of VAEs and PixelCNNs. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on binarized MNIST, competitive performance on 64 Ã— 64 ImageNet, and high-quality samples on the LSUN bedrooms dataset.
Decision and Key Reasons
I decide to Accept this paper, with the key reasons being:
1. The paper tackles a specific and important problem in VAEs, namely over-regularization, and proposes a well-motivated solution.
2. The approach is well-placed in the literature, building on existing work on VAEs and PixelCNNs, and the experiments are sufficient to support the proposed idea.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a clear and well-structured presentation of the proposed method, including a detailed description of the PixelVAE model and its hierarchical architecture. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, showing that PixelVAE outperforms existing methods on several benchmarks. The paper also provides a thorough analysis of the results, including visualizations and quantitative evaluations.
Additional Feedback and Questions
To further improve the paper, I would like to see more discussion on the connection between under-utilization of model capacity and overfitting, as mentioned in the first paragraph on p.7. Additionally, I would like to ask the authors to clarify the following points:
* How does the choice of prior distribution over the latent variables affect the performance of PixelVAE?
* Can the authors provide more insights into the learned latent representations, such as visualizations or quantitative evaluations of the disentanglement of factors of variation?
* How does PixelVAE compare to other state-of-the-art methods, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), in terms of sample quality and diversity?
Overall, the paper presents a well-motivated and effective solution to a important problem in VAEs, and I believe it deserves a place in the conference.
