Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper proposes a novel approach to semi-supervised reinforcement learning (SSRL), which enables an agent to learn a policy and a reward model simultaneously from both labeled and unlabeled Markov decision processes (MDPs). The authors introduce a method called semi-supervised skill generalization (S3G), which leverages the agent's prior experience in labeled MDPs to infer the reward function in unlabeled MDPs. The approach uses a combination of REINFORCE with entropy regularization and inverse reinforcement learning to provide feedback over unlabeled MDPs. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of S3G in improving the generalization of a learned policy in continuous control tasks.
Decision to Accept
Based on the evaluation of the paper, I decide to accept the paper. The main reasons for this decision are:
1. The paper tackles a specific and well-defined problem in reinforcement learning, which is semi-supervised learning in MDPs with limited reward supervision.
2. The approach proposed by the authors is well-motivated and grounded in the literature, and the experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the method in improving the generalization of a learned policy.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a clear and concise introduction to the problem of SSRL and motivates the need for a new approach. The authors provide a thorough review of related work and position their contribution within the context of existing research. The proposed method, S3G, is well-explained and easy to follow, and the experiments are convincing and well-designed. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of S3G in improving the generalization of a learned policy in continuous control tasks, and the comparison to baseline methods is thorough and informative.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors consider the following:
* Provide more details on the implementation of the S3G algorithm, such as the choice of hyperparameters and the optimization procedure.
* Include more experiments to demonstrate the robustness of the method to different types of MDPs and reward functions.
* Discuss the potential limitations and challenges of the approach, such as the need for a large amount of unlabeled data and the potential for overfitting.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
* Can you provide more details on the choice of the entropy regularization parameter and its effect on the performance of the algorithm?
* How do you handle the case where the reward function is not well-defined or is highly complex?
* Can you discuss the potential applications of the S3G algorithm to real-world problems, such as robotics and autonomous driving?
