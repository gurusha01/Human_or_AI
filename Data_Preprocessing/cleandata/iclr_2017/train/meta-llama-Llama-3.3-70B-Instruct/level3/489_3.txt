Summary
The paper presents a novel perspective on Highway and Residual networks, proposing that they perform unrolled iterative estimation. This view suggests that successive layers within a stage cooperate to compute a single level of representation, with the first layer providing a rough estimate that is then iteratively refined by subsequent layers. The authors derive both Residual and Highway networks from this perspective, providing a unified theory for understanding these architectures. They also present experimental results comparing the performance of Highway and Residual networks on image classification and language modeling tasks.
Decision
I decide to Accept this paper, with two key reasons for this choice: (1) the paper presents a well-motivated and novel perspective on Highway and Residual networks, and (2) the authors provide a clear and concise derivation of both architectures from this perspective, along with experimental results that support their claims.
Supporting Arguments
The paper tackles the specific question of how Highway and Residual networks can be understood and derived from a common perspective. The approach is well-motivated, as it addresses the limitations of the traditional representation view and provides a new framework for understanding the behavior of these architectures. The authors also provide a clear and concise derivation of both Residual and Highway networks from the unrolled iterative estimation perspective, which is a significant contribution to the field. The experimental results presented in the paper support the authors' claims and provide additional evidence for the validity of their perspective.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more detailed analysis of the experimental results, particularly in terms of the implications of their findings for the design of future neural network architectures. Additionally, it would be helpful to include more visualizations or illustrations to support the authors' claims and make the paper more accessible to a broader audience. Some questions I would like the authors to answer include: (1) How do the authors plan to extend their perspective to other types of neural network architectures? (2) What are the implications of their findings for the design of neural networks for specific tasks or applications? (3) How do the authors plan to address potential limitations or criticisms of their perspective?
