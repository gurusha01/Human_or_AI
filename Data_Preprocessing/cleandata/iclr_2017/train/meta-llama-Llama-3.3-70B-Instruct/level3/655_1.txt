Summary
The paper proposes a novel learning framework, Recurrent Inference Machines (RIMs), which abandons the traditional separation between model and inference in solving inverse problems. Instead, RIMs learn both components jointly without defining their explicit functional form, allowing for a more flexible and expressive approach to inverse problems. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of RIMs in various image reconstruction tasks, including denoising and super-resolution, and show that they can outperform state-of-the-art methods.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, primarily due to the lack of clarity and convincing arguments in the presentation. Despite the interesting idea of RIMs, the paper's writing and organization make it difficult to follow and understand the key contributions and results.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's unclear writing and presentation make it challenging to evaluate the validity and significance of the proposed approach. The authors fail to provide a clear and concise explanation of the construction of the training set for weak classifiers, and the handling of datasets with different numbers of channels is not well-motivated. Furthermore, the lack of an ablation study to validate the approach of learning convolutional filters separately raises concerns about the robustness of the results.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, the authors should focus on clarifying the writing and presentation, providing more detailed explanations of the key components of the RIM framework, and conducting more thorough experiments to validate the approach. Specifically, the authors should consider adding more visualizations and examples to illustrate the effectiveness of RIMs, and providing a more detailed analysis of the results, including comparisons to other state-of-the-art methods.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper and provide additional evidence, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
1. Can you provide a more detailed explanation of the construction of the training set for weak classifiers and how it relates to the RIM framework?
2. How do you handle datasets with different numbers of channels, and what motivated this approach?
3. Can you provide more results and analysis to validate the effectiveness of RIMs in various inverse problems, including non-linear inverse problems?
