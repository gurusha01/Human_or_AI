Summary of the Paper
The paper proposes a novel deep pedestrian detection method based on the Fast R-CNN framework, which utilizes batch normalization to reduce training time and improve generalization performance. The authors also employ the EdgeBoxes algorithm to generate high-quality region proposals, improving detection speed and accuracy. The method is evaluated on two benchmark datasets, INRIA and ETH, and achieves satisfactory performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, primarily due to the lack of clarity in the argument and the organization of the paper. The concept of "structures" is not clearly defined, and the take-home message of the paper is unclear, leaving questions about the use of entity marking, modeling entity reference, and the role of linguistic features.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's organization and overall message are confusing, making it difficult to follow the authors' argument. The experiments on the Stanford reader show interesting results, but the paper would benefit from a more focused argument to clarify its analysis and findings. Additionally, the paper does not provide a clear explanation of how the proposed method improves upon existing state-of-the-art methods.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, the authors should provide a clearer definition of the concept of "structures" and clarify the take-home message of the paper. The authors should also provide more context about the related work in pedestrian detection and how their method improves upon existing methods. Furthermore, the authors should consider adding more visualizations and examples to illustrate the proposed method and its results.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
1. Can you provide a clear definition of the concept of "structures" and how it relates to pedestrian detection?
2. How does the proposed method improve upon existing state-of-the-art methods in pedestrian detection?
3. Can you provide more context about the related work in pedestrian detection and how your method fits into the existing literature?
