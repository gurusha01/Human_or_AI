Summary
The paper introduces a novel online structure learning technique for Gaussian Sum-Product Networks (SPNs), which is a type of deep probabilistic model. The algorithm, called oSLRAU, learns the structure of the SPN in a single pass through the data, making it efficient for large datasets. The technique starts with a fully factorized distribution and updates the structure by detecting correlations between variables. The authors evaluate oSLRAU on several benchmark datasets and compare its performance to other state-of-the-art algorithms, demonstrating its effectiveness in learning a suitable network structure.
Decision
I decide to Accept this paper, with two key reasons: (1) the paper introduces a novel and efficient online structure learning technique for Gaussian SPNs, which is a significant contribution to the field; and (2) the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of oSLRAU in learning a suitable network structure and achieving good performance on several benchmark datasets.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a thorough technical contribution, with a clear and well-motivated approach to online structure learning for Gaussian SPNs. The algorithm is well-designed, and the authors provide a detailed analysis of its time and space complexity. The experimental results are convincing, with oSLRAU outperforming other state-of-the-art algorithms on several datasets. The paper also provides a thorough discussion of the related work and the advantages of oSLRAU over other approaches.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the hyperparameter tuning process, particularly for the correlation threshold and the maximum number of variables per leaf node. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more analysis on the interpretability of the learned SPN structures and how they relate to the underlying data distributions. Finally, the authors may want to consider exploring other applications of oSLRAU, such as image or natural language processing tasks.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
1. Can you provide more details on the initialization process for the SPN structure and how it affects the performance of oSLRAU?
2. How do you handle cases where the correlation threshold is not sufficient to detect all relevant correlations between variables?
3. Are there any plans to extend oSLRAU to other types of SPNs, such as discrete or mixed SPNs?
