Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper proposes a novel approach to state estimation in robotics by combining algorithmic prior knowledge with machine learning. The authors introduce an end-to-end learnable histogram filter (E2E-HF) that represents discretized states using beliefs and utilizes a locally linear motion model and neural network-based measurement model. The system is learned through both supervised and unsupervised objectives and is tested on synthetic robot localization tasks, demonstrating improved data-efficiency and generalization over pure deep learning approaches.
