Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper proposes a novel approach to network morphism, which enables the transformation of a convolutional layer into an arbitrary module of a neural network. The authors introduce a graph-based representation for modular networks, allowing for the formulation of network morphism as a graph transformation problem. They define two atomic morphing operations and propose algorithms for simple morphable modules and complex modules. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet.
