This paper proposes a novel analysis of the nonlinear dynamics of two-layered bias-free ReLU networks. The authors derive a close-form nonlinear dynamics for a single ReLU node and prove its convergence to the optimal solution under proper initialization. For multiple ReLU nodes, they analyze the dynamics when the teacher parameters form an orthonormal basis and show that symmetric initialization leads to a saddle point, while certain symmetry-breaking initialization converges to the optimal solution without being trapped in local minima.
The paper tackles the specific question of how simple gradient descent can solve a complicated non-convex optimization problem effectively. The approach is well-motivated, building upon previous works that analyze deep neural networks using dynamical systems. The authors provide a clear and concise formulation of the problem and derive useful properties of ReLU networks.
However, the paper has several drawbacks that need to be addressed. Firstly, the mathematical derivation, although novel, lacks convincing empirical evidence to support the claims. The experimental section is limited, and a more thorough numerical evaluation is necessary to convincingly show the advantage of the proposed method. Additionally, the paper needs to empirically show that the proposed higher-order nonlinearity produces sparser representations than the complex modulus.
Furthermore, there are several minor issues, including errors in proof presentation, typos, and unclear figures, that need to be addressed. The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the stability of the proposed method to small variations in the input data.
To improve the paper, I would suggest the following:
1. Provide more extensive experimental results to support the theoretical claims, including comparisons with other methods and analysis of the robustness of the proposed method to different initializations and noise levels.
2. Empirically demonstrate the benefits of the proposed higher-order nonlinearity in terms of sparsity and representation quality.
3. Address the minor issues, such as proof presentation errors, typos, and unclear figures, to improve the overall clarity and readability of the paper.
4. Consider adding more discussion on the implications of the proposed method for deep learning and its potential applications.
Based on the provided guidelines, I would reject the paper in its current form due to the limited experimental evaluation and lack of convincing empirical evidence. However, with revisions addressing the above points, the paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of deep learning. 
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper and provide additional evidence are:
1. Can you provide more details on the experimental setup and the datasets used to evaluate the proposed method?
2. How do you plan to address the issue of stability to small variations in the input data?
3. Can you provide more insights into the implications of the proposed method for deep learning and its potential applications?
4. How do you think the proposed method can be extended to more complex neural network architectures and larger datasets?
