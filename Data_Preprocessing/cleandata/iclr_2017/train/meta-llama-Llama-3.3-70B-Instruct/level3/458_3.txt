Summary
This paper explores the possibility of learning chess game concepts under weak supervision with convolutional neural networks. The authors propose a protocol to train a classification network on rendered tic-tac-toe chessboards and analyze the learnt representations using class activation mapping (CAM). The results show that the network can automatically figure out complicated game rule concepts, such as the concept of a chessboard grid, the winning rule, and the concept of two sides. The paper also demonstrates that cross-modal supervision for representation learning is still applicable in this case of higher-level semantics and that CAM can activate at non-salient regions.
Decision
I decide to accept this paper with some minor revisions. The paper tackles a specific and interesting question, and the approach is well-motivated and well-placed in the literature. The results are impressive, and the paper provides a thorough analysis of the learnt representations.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a clear and concise introduction to the problem and the methodology. The authors provide a thorough review of the related work and clearly explain how their approach differs from existing ones. The experiments are well-designed, and the results are impressive. The paper also provides a quantitative evaluation of the results, which strengthens the claims made by the authors.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details about the training process, such as the hyperparameters used and the number of iterations. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more examples of the CAM visualizations and to have a clearer explanation of how the authors interpret the results. I also suggest that the authors discuss the limitations of their approach and potential future directions.
Questions for the Authors
I would like the authors to clarify the following points:
* How do the authors ensure that the network is not simply memorizing the training data, but rather learning the underlying concepts?
* Can the authors provide more examples of the CAM visualizations for different chessboard configurations?
* How do the authors plan to extend this work to more complex games or scenarios?
