This paper proposes a novel extension of online dictionary learning, inspired by adult neurogenesis, which allows for the addition and deletion of dictionary elements in response to changing input distributions. The approach, called Neurogenetic Online Dictionary Learning (NODL), is well-motivated and well-placed in the literature, building upon the state-of-the-art online dictionary learning method of Mairal et al. (2009).
The paper provides a thorough exploration of the approach, including a detailed description of the algorithm, an analysis of its properties, and an extensive empirical evaluation on various datasets. The results demonstrate that NODL can outperform the baseline method, especially in non-stationary settings, and that it is most beneficial when dictionary elements are sparse.
The paper also provides a theoretical analysis of the conditions under which NODL can be expected to perform well, including the case of sparse data with non-overlapping supports. The authors show that, in this scenario, the baseline ODL method cannot adapt to the new domain, while NODL can perform well due to its ability to add new dictionary elements.
Overall, the paper is well-written, and the topic is of interest to many in the machine learning community. The approach is novel and well-justified, and the empirical evaluation is thorough and convincing.
My decision is to accept this paper, with the main reason being that it proposes a novel and well-motivated approach to online dictionary learning, which is supported by a thorough theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation.
To further improve the paper, I would suggest that the authors provide more insights into the relationship between the proposed approach and other works that broaden the scope of the discriminator. Additionally, the authors could provide more details on the effect of the PT regularizer and its relationship to the group sparsity regularization.
Some minor typos and formatting issues were found, but they do not affect the overall quality of the paper. The experimental evaluation has some limitations, such as the use of an Inception model to compute KL scores for MNIST, but these limitations do not detract from the overall contribution of the paper.
I would like the authors to answer the following questions to clarify my understanding of the paper:
1. Can you provide more details on the relationship between the proposed approach and other works that broaden the scope of the discriminator?
2. How does the PT regularizer affect the performance of the approach, and how does it relate to the group sparsity regularization?
3. Can you provide more insights into the conditions under which NODL can be expected to perform well, and how these conditions relate to the properties of the input data?
