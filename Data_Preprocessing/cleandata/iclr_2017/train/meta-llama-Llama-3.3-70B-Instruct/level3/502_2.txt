Summary
The paper proposes a novel approach to generating handwriting sequences using a physiologically plausible model of handwriting, known as the Sigma Lognormal model. The authors preprocess the input data to extract virtual targets and dynamic parameters, which are then used to train Recurrent Mixture Density Networks (RMDNs) to predict the next virtual target and dynamic parameters. The system is able to generate handwriting sequences that capture the statistical and dynamic qualities of handwriting, and can be used for tasks such as style transfer and one-shot learning.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the paper's approach, although well-motivated, is not well-placed in the literature, as it does not provide a clear comparison with existing methods for handwriting generation. Secondly, the paper's results, although visually impressive, are not rigorously evaluated, and the authors do not provide a clear metric for evaluating the quality of the generated handwriting sequences.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's approach is based on a complex model of handwriting, which is not clearly explained or motivated. The authors do not provide a clear comparison with existing methods for handwriting generation, such as those based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks or Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Additionally, the paper's results are not rigorously evaluated, and the authors do not provide a clear metric for evaluating the quality of the generated handwriting sequences. The authors rely on visual inspection to evaluate the quality of the generated sequences, which is not a reliable method for evaluating the performance of a handwriting generation system.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, the authors should provide a clear comparison with existing methods for handwriting generation, and evaluate their approach using a rigorous metric, such as the Frechet Inception Distance (FID) or the Inception Score (IS). The authors should also provide more details about the implementation of their approach, including the architecture of the RMDNs and the hyperparameters used to train the models. Additionally, the authors should consider using a more robust method for evaluating the quality of the generated handwriting sequences, such as a user study or a automated evaluation metric.
Questions for the Authors
I would like to ask the authors to clarify the following points:
* How does the proposed approach compare to existing methods for handwriting generation, such as those based on LSTM networks or GANs?
* What is the motivation behind using the Sigma Lognormal model for handwriting generation, and how does it relate to existing models of handwriting?
* How do the authors evaluate the quality of the generated handwriting sequences, and what metrics do they use to compare their approach to existing methods?
* Can the authors provide more details about the implementation of their approach, including the architecture of the RMDNs and the hyperparameters used to train the models?
