This paper proposes a novel approach to analyzing the nonlinear dynamics of two-layered bias-free ReLU networks. The authors derive a close-form nonlinear dynamics for the case of a single ReLU node and prove its convergence to the optimal solution under proper initialization. For the case of multiple ReLU nodes, they prove that when the teacher parameters form an orthonormal basis, a symmetric initialization leads to convergence to a saddle point, while a certain symmetry-breaking initialization converges to the optimal solution without getting trapped in local minima.
The paper is well-organized and written, with a comprehensive qualitative analysis in the experimental section. The authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of their approach, making it easy to follow and understand. The use of mathematical derivations and proofs adds to the paper's rigor and credibility.
However, I decide to reject this paper for the following two key reasons: 
Firstly, the paper lacks additional experiments on different datasets, which is necessary to generalize the findings and verify the claims made in the paper. The authors only provide simulations on a limited setting, which may not be representative of real-world scenarios. 
Secondly, the computational benefits of the proposed approach are unclear compared to fixed sampling strategies with zooming capabilities. The authors do not provide a thorough comparison with existing methods, making it difficult to assess the significance of their contributions.
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors conduct more experiments on various datasets to support their claims and provide a more comprehensive comparison with existing methods. Additionally, they could consider providing more quantitative analysis and experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach. 
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper and provide additional evidence to support their claims include: 
* Can the authors provide more details on how they plan to extend their approach to multilayer ReLU networks and other nonlinear networks?
* How do the authors plan to address the issue of local minima in the context of their approach, and what guarantees can they provide for convergence to the global optimum?
* Can the authors provide more insights into the relationship between the initialization of the weights and the convergence of the dynamics, and how this relates to the symmetry-breaking initialization they propose? 
Overall, while the paper presents an interesting approach to analyzing the nonlinear dynamics of ReLU networks, it requires more thorough experimentation and comparison with existing methods to demonstrate its significance and effectiveness.
