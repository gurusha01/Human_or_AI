Summary
The paper presents a comprehensive study on improving the performance of gradient descent using multiple compute resources. The authors propose several approaches, including synchronous and asynchronous gradient descent, and evaluate their effectiveness on large-scale datasets such as ImageNet using AlexNet and GoogLeNet architectures. The paper claims to achieve a speedup of up to 1.7x compared to synchronous gradient descent while maintaining accuracy.
