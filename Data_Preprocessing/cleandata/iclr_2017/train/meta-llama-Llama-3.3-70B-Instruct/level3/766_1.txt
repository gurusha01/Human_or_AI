Summary of the Paper
The paper proposes a pedestrian detection method using EdgeBoxes and Fast R-CNN with batch normalization. The authors claim that their approach improves the detection performance and reduces the training time. They evaluate their method on two benchmark datasets, INRIA and ETH, and report satisfactory results compared to other state-of-the-art methods.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper. The main reasons for this decision are the lack of novelty in the proposed approach and the poor writing quality of the paper. The use of EdgeBoxes and Fast R-CNN with batch normalization is not a new idea, and the paper does not provide any significant improvements over the state-of-the-art results.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's results are limited to only two datasets, INRIA and ETH, and do not include other popular datasets such as Caltech or KITTI. This limited evaluation makes it difficult to assess the generalizability of the proposed method. Additionally, the paper's writing quality is poor, with grammatical errors, nonsensical sentences, and unclear explanations. The paper also lacks a clear motivation for the proposed approach and does not provide a thorough analysis of the results.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, the authors should consider evaluating their method on more datasets and providing a more detailed analysis of the results. They should also proofread the paper carefully to eliminate grammatical errors and improve the clarity of the writing. Furthermore, the authors should provide a clearer motivation for their approach and explain how it differs from existing methods.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the proposed method differ from existing pedestrian detection methods, such as S. Zhang CVPR 2016 and L. Zhang ECCV 2017, which also use Fast R-CNN and Faster R-CNN for pedestrian detection?
2. Can the authors provide more details on the implementation of the EdgeBoxes algorithm and how it is used to generate region proposals?
3. How do the authors plan to address the issue of low-resolution images, which can affect the detection performance of the proposed method?
