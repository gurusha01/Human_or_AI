Summary of the Paper's Claims and Contributions
The paper proposes a novel approach to address the issue of catastrophic failures in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents. The authors introduce the concept of "intrinsic fear," which involves training a separate danger model to predict the likelihood of a catastrophe within a short number of steps. This danger model is used to penalize the Q-learning objective, shaping the reward function away from catastrophic states. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach on several toy problems, including Adventure Seeker and Cart-Pole, and provides preliminary results on the Atari game Seaquest.
Decision and Key Reasons
I decide to reject this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the paper lacks a thorough literature review on sequence generation and relies heavily on chosen technologies, which makes it difficult to assess the novelty and significance of the proposed approach. Secondly, the evaluation of the proposed method is limited, with no quantitative comparison with other methods, making it challenging to determine the effectiveness of the approach.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's lack of literature review on sequence generation is a significant concern, as it fails to provide a clear understanding of the current state of the art in the field. Additionally, the reliance on chosen technologies, such as the DQN algorithm, without proper justification or comparison with other methods, raises questions about the generality and applicability of the proposed approach. The limited evaluation of the method, with no quantitative comparison with other methods, makes it difficult to assess the significance of the results and the potential impact of the proposed approach.
Additional Feedback and Questions
To improve the paper, I would suggest providing a more comprehensive literature review on sequence generation and DRL, as well as a more detailed evaluation of the proposed method, including quantitative comparisons with other approaches. Some questions that I would like the authors to address include: How does the proposed approach compare to other methods for avoiding catastrophic failures in DRL, such as reward shaping or safety constraints? How does the choice of danger model and fear factor affect the performance of the proposed approach? What are the potential limitations and challenges of applying the proposed approach to more complex domains, such as real-world robotics or autonomous driving?
