This paper presents a novel approach to incorporating prior procedural knowledge into a neural network by introducing a differentiable interpreter for the programming language Forth. The authors' system is impressive in learning from natural feedback in an online fashion, achieving close to full supervision results in some cases. The paper provides a clear and well-motivated approach to addressing the problem of learning algorithms from data, and the experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
However, there are some areas that require further clarification and improvement. The formalisation of the task of learning dialogue is not precise, and the authors' answer to this concern is only partially satisfying, suggesting a need for more precise goal-setting. Additionally, the relation to prior work, specifically Weston'16, is not fully clear, and the authors clarified that this submission is independent and incremental, with the online aspect leading to more exploration.
To support the claims made in the paper, the authors provided additional information on classic supervision baselines, helping to understand how much of the overall goal was achieved and open challenges. Nevertheless, there is a need for a better understanding of how much more difficult the machine translation setting is, with suggested baselines including hand-labeled feedback or template matching.
Based on the conference guidelines, I would like to ask the following questions to clarify my understanding of the paper:
1. Can the authors provide more details on how the differentiable interpreter is used to incorporate prior procedural knowledge into the neural network?
2. How does the proposed method handle cases where the prior knowledge is incomplete or incorrect?
3. Can the authors provide more comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods in the field, particularly in the area of neural program synthesis?
In terms of the decision to accept or reject the paper, I would like to highlight two key reasons for my choice. Firstly, the paper presents a novel and well-motivated approach to incorporating prior procedural knowledge into a neural network. Secondly, the experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in learning algorithms from data.
However, I would like to reject the paper due to the lack of clarity in the formalisation of the task of learning dialogue and the need for more precise goal-setting. Additionally, the relation to prior work is not fully clear, and more comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods are needed to fully understand the contributions of the paper.
To improve the paper, I would suggest the following:
* Provide more details on the differentiable interpreter and how it is used to incorporate prior procedural knowledge into the neural network.
* Clarify the formalisation of the task of learning dialogue and provide more precise goal-setting.
* Provide more comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods in the field, particularly in the area of neural program synthesis.
* Address the concerns regarding the relation to prior work and provide more details on how the proposed method handles cases where the prior knowledge is incomplete or incorrect.
