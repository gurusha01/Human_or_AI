This paper proposes a novel approach to learning state space models from raw non-Markovian sequence data, called Deep Variational Bayes Filters (DVBF). The authors claim that their method can overcome intractable inference and perform latent dynamic system identification, making it suitable for downstream tasks such as control or model-based reinforcement learning.
I decide to reject this paper, primarily due to two key reasons. Firstly, the authors' contribution is not fully clear, with multiple claims lacking sufficient support, such as the interpretability of Sum Product Networks and the properties of Max Product Networks. Secondly, the comparison with state-of-the-art generative models like GANs, GSNs, and Variational Autoencoders is missing, which would be more effective than comparing with RBMs and NADE.
The paper explores the concept of interpretable representations using Sum Product Networks, which is a powerful linear model that can learn parts and their combinations. The idea of generating embeddings to interpret SPNs is novel and interesting, and the experiments conducted are engaging. However, the experiments could be extended further to provide more comprehensive results.
To improve the paper, the authors need to clarify their contributions, eliminate overclaiming statements, and evaluate their approach against suggested methods. A more detailed comparison with state-of-the-art generative models would strengthen the paper. Additionally, the authors should provide more theoretical justifications for their approach and explain the intuition behind their method.
I would like the authors to answer the following questions to clarify my understanding of the paper: (1) Can you provide more details on how the Sum Product Networks are used to learn interpretable representations? (2) How do you plan to extend the experiments to provide more comprehensive results? (3) Can you provide a more detailed comparison with state-of-the-art generative models like GANs, GSNs, and Variational Autoencoders? 
Overall, while the paper presents an interesting approach, it requires more clarification, justification, and evaluation to demonstrate its effectiveness and significance.
