The paper under review investigates the neural GPU model and its performance, highlighting the importance of curriculum training and the potential for larger models to generalize better. The authors provide empirical evidence and theoretical examples to demonstrate the failure modes of the neural GPU model and compare its performance with different input formats.
In my assessment, the paper attempts to tackle the specific question of how the neural GPU model performs and what factors contribute to its success or failure. The approach is well-motivated, drawing on existing literature and providing a clear framework for understanding the model's behavior.
However, I have some concerns regarding the paper's claims and the supporting evidence. The introduction contains unqualified statements, such as the link between adversarial examples and learning algorithms, which require further clarification. Additionally, the analysis of the neural GPU's time complexity overlooks its parallel nature, and the argument that larger models generalize better is not entirely convincing due to potential underfitting of smaller models.
Based on these concerns, I decide to reject the paper. The main reasons for this decision are the lack of a coherent message and the failure to provide insight into the underlying reasons for the observations made. While the paper provides some useful insights into the neural GPU model, it lacks original extensions and explanations of fundamental limitations, with several statements requiring stronger substantiation.
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more rigorous theoretical analysis and empirical evidence to support their claims. Specifically, they should:
* Clarify the introduction and provide more context for the unqualified statements
* Address the parallel nature of the neural GPU model in the analysis of time complexity
* Provide more convincing arguments for the generalization performance of larger models
* Offer more insight into the underlying reasons for the observed failure modes and behavior of the neural GPU model
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper and provide additional evidence include:
* Can you provide more details on the construction of the counterexamples and how they relate to the neural GPU model's behavior?
* How do you respond to the potential criticism that the analysis of time complexity overlooks the parallel nature of the neural GPU model?
* Can you provide more empirical evidence to support the claim that larger models generalize better, and address the potential issue of underfitting in smaller models?
