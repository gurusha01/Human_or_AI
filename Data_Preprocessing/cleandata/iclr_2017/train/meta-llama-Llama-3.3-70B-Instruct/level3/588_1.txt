This paper proposes a novel approach to detecting weather events from 3D climate data using convnet-based object detection techniques, incorporating an unsupervised autoencoder-style objective term. The application of object detection techniques to extreme weather event detection is innovative, and the paper provides a thorough survey of related work. 
I decide to reject this paper, primarily due to the underwhelming benefits of the 3D convolutional architecture and unsupervised learning, which only yield a relatively small increase in mean average precision (mAP) from 51.42% to 52.92%. Additionally, the use of a 0.1 IoU criterion for true positives is loose compared to the standard 0.5 criterion, and reporting results at higher overlap thresholds would be useful.
The paper is well-written, and the model is appropriately ablated. However, the results are not striking, and future versions could benefit from additional analysis and results. Minor errors and inconsistencies, such as the potential mistake in equation 6 and the parameter count in table 4, should also be addressed.
To improve the paper, I suggest the authors provide more detailed analysis and results, particularly at higher overlap thresholds. They should also consider addressing the potential issues with the IoU criterion and the minor errors and inconsistencies. Furthermore, I would like the authors to answer the following questions: (1) Can you provide more insight into why the 3D convolutional architecture and unsupervised learning only yield a small increase in mAP? (2) How do you plan to address the potential issues with the IoU criterion and the minor errors and inconsistencies? (3) Can you provide more detailed analysis and results at higher overlap thresholds? 
Overall, while the paper presents an innovative approach to detecting weather events, the underwhelming results and minor issues prevent me from accepting it in its current form. With additional analysis, results, and addressing of the minor issues, the paper has the potential to be a strong contribution to the field.
