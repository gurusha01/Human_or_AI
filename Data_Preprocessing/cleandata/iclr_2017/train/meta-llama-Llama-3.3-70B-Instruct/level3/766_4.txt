Summary of the Paper's Claims and Contributions
The paper introduces the Energy-based Generative Adversarial Network (EBGAN) model, which views the discriminator as an energy function that attributes low energies to the regions near the data manifold and higher energies to other regions. The authors propose to use an auto-encoder architecture as the discriminator, where the energy is the reconstruction error. They demonstrate that this form of EBGAN exhibits more stable behavior than regular GANs during training and can generate high-resolution images. The paper also provides a theoretical analysis of the system, showing that the generator produces samples that follow the underlying data distribution when the system reaches convergence.
Decision and Key Reasons
Based on the provided guidelines, I decide to Reject the paper. The two key reasons for this decision are:
1. Lack of significant contributions: The paper's contributions, such as using EdgeBoxes as proposals for pedestrian detection and applying batch normalization in the network architecture, are considered minor and require more justification and comparison with other proposal methods.
2. Narrow focus and lack of experimental results on key datasets: The paper's narrow focus on pedestrian detection and failure to discuss potential technical issues with batch normalization are major drawbacks. Additionally, the lack of experimental results on key datasets like Caltech and KITTI limits the paper's impact and relevance.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's experimental results on the INRIA and ETH datasets are not sufficient to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, especially considering the lack of comparison with other state-of-the-art methods. The use of EdgeBoxes as proposals for pedestrian detection is not thoroughly justified, and the application of batch normalization in the network architecture is not explored in the context of generic object category detection. Furthermore, the paper's failure to cite recent relevant work and its narrow focus on pedestrian detection limit its potential impact and relevance to the broader research community.
Additional Feedback and Questions
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors:
* Provide more thorough justification and comparison with other proposal methods for pedestrian detection
* Explore the application of batch normalization in the context of generic object category detection
* Include experimental results on key datasets like Caltech and KITTI
* Discuss potential technical issues with batch normalization and its impact on the proposed approach
* Cite recent relevant work and broaden the paper's focus to increase its potential impact and relevance
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper and provide additional evidence to support their claims include:
* How do the authors plan to address the lack of significant contributions and narrow focus of the paper?
* Can the authors provide more experimental results on key datasets like Caltech and KITTI to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach?
* How do the authors justify the use of EdgeBoxes as proposals for pedestrian detection, and what are the advantages and limitations of this approach compared to other proposal methods?
