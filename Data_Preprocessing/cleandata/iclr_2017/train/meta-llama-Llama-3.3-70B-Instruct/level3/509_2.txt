This paper proposes a novel approach to program induction using program sketches in Forth, a stack-based programming language. The authors introduce a differentiable Forth interpreter, which allows for the optimization of program behavior through gradient descent techniques. The use of sketches enables the learning of more complex programs than starting from scratch, with the loss optimized being the L2 difference between program memory and desired output.
The paper tackles the specific question of how to incorporate prior procedural knowledge into a neural network, which is a core problem in artificial intelligence. The approach is well-motivated, building on existing work in program synthesis and neural programming. The use of Forth as the sketch definition language is a unique approach, and the authors demonstrate its effectiveness in learning complex transduction tasks such as sequence sorting and addition.
However, I decide to reject this paper due to two key reasons. Firstly, the experimental section is sparse, with only one experimental setting for learning to sort and no study of generalization or comparison to baselines. This lack of thorough experimentation makes it difficult to fully evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Secondly, the paper lacks clarity in certain sections, such as Section 3.3.1, which could be improved with explanations of the color code and parallel between D and the input list.
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more detailed explanations of the experimental setup and results, including comparisons to baseline models and studies of generalization. Additionally, the authors could provide more examples of how the differentiable Forth interpreter can be used in practice, and explore the relationship between the degree of prior knowledge provided in the sketch and the difficulty of the problem.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper include: How do the authors plan to address the issue of incongruencies between traditional language properties and the desire for generalization in the learned behavior? How do the authors envision the integration of ∂4 with other differentiable models upstream and/or downstream? What are the potential applications of ∂4 in domains such as natural language processing and computer vision?
