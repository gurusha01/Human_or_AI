Summary
The paper presents a comprehensive analysis of vocabulary selection techniques for neural machine translation, aiming to improve decoding and training efficiency by constraining the output vocabulary to a subset relevant to the source sentence. The authors explore various selection methods, including word co-occurrence counts, bilingual embeddings, word alignments, phrase pairs, and SVM classifiers, and evaluate their impact on speed and accuracy.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, primarily due to two key reasons: (1) the write-up of the paper can be improved for better clarity and understanding, and (2) the results presented may be misleading and not accurately representative of the model's performance.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's writing style and organization make it challenging to follow, which hinders the understanding of the authors' contributions and methodology. Additionally, the results may be misleading, as the model's behavior when weights are 0 is not indicative of its general functionality and working. Furthermore, the work underestimates the impact of nonlinearities on the learning dynamics and overall behavior of the model.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, the authors should focus on clarifying the writing, providing more detailed explanations of their methodology, and addressing the potential issues with the results. Specifically, they should consider the following:
* Provide more context and background information on the selection methods used.
* Clarify the experimental setup and evaluation metrics.
* Discuss the limitations of the current approach and potential avenues for future work.
* Consider adding more visualizations and plots to support the results.
Questions for the Authors
To better understand the paper and provide a more informed assessment, I would like the authors to address the following questions:
* Can you provide more details on the bilingual embedding method and its advantages over other selection methods?
* How do you handle out-of-vocabulary words in the selection process?
* Can you discuss the trade-offs between speed and accuracy in more detail, and provide more insights into the results?
* How do you plan to address the limitations of the current approach and improve the efficiency of the encoder and decoder architectures?
