This paper proposes the use of annealed importance sampling (AIS) and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) to estimate log-likelihoods of decoder-based generative models, providing a valuable educational and empirical contribution to the field. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach by comparing the performance of various generative models, including variational autoencoders (VAEs), generative adversarial networks (GANs), and generative moment matching networks (GMMNs).
I decide to accept this paper with two key reasons: (1) the paper tackles a specific and important problem in the field of generative models, namely the estimation of log-likelihoods, and (2) the approach is well-motivated and supported by thorough experiments and analysis.
The paper provides a clear and detailed explanation of the AIS algorithm and its application to decoder-based generative models. The authors also validate their approach using bidirectional Monte Carlo (BDMC), which provides a bound on the log-likelihood estimation error. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of AIS in estimating log-likelihoods and comparing the performance of different generative models.
However, there are some areas that require improvement. For example, the paper could benefit from a more detailed explanation of AIS, including why the algorithm works and its components, to improve clarity for readers. Additionally, the figure comparing GAN, GMMN, and IWAE performance is confusing due to inconsistent labeling and data types, and could be improved with clearer captions.
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more references to related work, such as MacKay's density networks, and clearer explanations of key concepts like importance sampling and posterior relevance. The authors should also revise their language to accurately convey the practicality or meaningfulness of estimating log p(x) due to underflow problems or connections to compression and entropy.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper include: (1) How do the authors plan to address the issue of underflow problems when estimating log-likelihoods using AIS? (2) Can the authors provide more details on the implementation of HMC and its hyperparameters? (3) How do the authors think their approach can be extended to other types of generative models, such as flow-based models or autoregressive models? 
Overall, the paper provides a significant contribution to the field of generative models and has the potential to be a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners. With some revisions to address the areas mentioned above, the paper can be even more effective in conveying its message and providing a clear understanding of the proposed approach.
