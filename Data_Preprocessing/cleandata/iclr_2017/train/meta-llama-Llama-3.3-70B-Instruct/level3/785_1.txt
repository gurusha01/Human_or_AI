Summary
The paper proposes a novel approach to constructing a phylogenetic tree, also known as the Tree of Life, using the deep representation of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) trained for image classification. The authors leverage the hierarchical feature representation learned by deep networks to quantify the visual similarity of species and construct a tree of life. The method is tested on various species, including fish, canine, and vehicle categories, and shows promising results.
Decision
I decide to Accept this paper, with two key reasons: (1) the paper tackles a specific and interesting problem, and (2) the approach is well-motivated and supported by experimental results.
Supporting Arguments
The paper addresses a long-standing problem in evolutionary biology, and the authors' approach is innovative and well-founded. The use of deep learning techniques to extract features from images and construct a phylogenetic tree is a novel application of these methods. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, with the constructed tree of life showing good agreement with the ground truth.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the selection of the reference networks and the criteria used to evaluate the quality of the constructed tree of life. Additionally, it would be interesting to see a comparison with other methods for constructing phylogenetic trees, such as those based on gene similarity. The authors may also want to consider exploring the use of other deep learning architectures, such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), to improve the accuracy of the constructed tree.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
1. How did you select the reference networks (AlexNet, VGG, and ResNet) for this study, and what criteria did you use to evaluate their performance?
2. Can you provide more details on the criteria used to evaluate the quality of the constructed tree of life, and how did you determine the ground truth for the species used in the study?
3. Have you considered exploring the use of other deep learning architectures, such as RNNs or GANs, to improve the accuracy of the constructed tree of life?
