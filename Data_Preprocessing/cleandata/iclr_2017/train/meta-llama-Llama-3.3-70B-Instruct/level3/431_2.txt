Summary
The paper proposes a novel approach to improve vector-space word representations by alleviating the adverse effects of polysemous words when using a lexicon. The authors introduce a fuzzy paraphrase set, where each paraphrase is annotated with a degree of reliability, and use this set to learn word vectors. The approach is evaluated on several benchmarks, and the results show that it outperforms prior works.
Decision
I decide to accept this paper, with the main reason being that it proposes a well-motivated and novel approach to address the polysemy problem in word vector representations. The paper provides a clear and detailed explanation of the proposed method, and the experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness.
Supporting Arguments
The paper tackles a specific and important problem in natural language processing, and the proposed approach is well-placed in the literature. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the effects of different parameters and paraphrase sets, which helps to understand the strengths and limitations of the approach. The comparison with prior works demonstrates the superiority of the proposed method.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors consider providing more detailed analysis of the results, particularly in terms of the linguistic insights that can be gained from the fuzzy paraphrase sets. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more experiments on different types of text data, such as multilingual or low-resource languages.
Questions for the Authors
I would like to ask the authors to clarify the following points:
* How do the authors plan to extend the proposed approach to other models, as mentioned in the conclusion?
* Can the authors provide more details on the computational resources required to train the model, particularly in terms of time and memory?
* How do the authors think the proposed approach can be applied to other NLP tasks, such as text classification or machine translation?
