Summary
The paper proposes a novel approach to domain-invariant representation learning, introducing a new regularization method called Central Moment Discrepancy (CMD). CMD measures the difference between the central moments of the source and target domain distributions, providing a more effective way to match the distributions. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of CMD on two benchmark datasets, Amazon reviews and Office, achieving state-of-the-art performance on most tasks.
Decision
I decide to Accept this paper, with two key reasons: (1) the proposed approach is well-motivated and provides a novel solution to the domain adaptation problem, and (2) the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of CMD on benchmark datasets.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a clear and well-structured introduction to the problem of domain adaptation and the limitations of existing approaches. The proposed CMD method is well-motivated, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of its properties, including its metric properties and convergence guarantees. The experimental results are convincing, demonstrating the superiority of CMD over other state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest the authors provide more insights into the choice of the parameter K, which controls the number of central moments used in the CMD calculation. Additionally, it would be interesting to see a more detailed analysis of the computational complexity of CMD compared to other methods. Furthermore, the authors may want to consider exploring the application of CMD to other domains, such as computer vision, to demonstrate its broader applicability.
Questions for the Authors
I would like to ask the authors to clarify the following points:
1. How did you choose the value of K, and what is the sensitivity of the results to this parameter?
2. Can you provide more details on the computational complexity of CMD compared to other methods, such as MMD?
3. Have you considered applying CMD to other domains, such as computer vision, and if so, what are the preliminary results?
