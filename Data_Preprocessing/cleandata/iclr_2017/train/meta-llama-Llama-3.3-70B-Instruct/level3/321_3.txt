Summary
The paper proposes a novel deep neural network architecture, ENet, designed for real-time semantic segmentation on low-power mobile devices. ENet achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks, including Cityscapes, CamVid, and SUN RGB-D, while requiring significantly fewer floating-point operations and parameters compared to existing models.
Decision
I decide to Accept this paper, with the primary reason being the impressive performance gains achieved by ENet on various benchmarks, demonstrating its potential for real-time semantic segmentation on mobile devices. However, I have some concerns regarding the design choices and the evaluation methodology, which I will elaborate on below.
Supporting Arguments
The paper presents a well-motivated approach to addressing the need for efficient semantic segmentation on mobile devices. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the design choices and experimental results, demonstrating the effectiveness of ENet in achieving real-time performance while maintaining competitive accuracy. The evaluation on various benchmarks, including Cityscapes, CamVid, and SUN RGB-D, provides a comprehensive assessment of ENet's performance.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I would like to see more discussion on the following aspects:
* The failure model of ENet: How does the network behave when faced with complex scenes or objects that are not well-represented in the training data?
* The discretization of the space: Is the space discretized, and if so, why? What are the implications of discretization on the network's performance?
* The generality of the approach: Can ENet be applied to more complicated embodiments, such as a 5-link swimmer, to assess its generality?
* The claim of using intrinsic rewards with minimal domain knowledge: While the authors argue that ENet uses intrinsic rewards with minimal domain knowledge, I disagree, as the proposed rewards seem to be hand-crafted and specific to limited control tasks.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper and provide additional evidence for my assessment, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
* Can you provide more details on the failure model of ENet and how it handles complex scenes or objects?
* How does the discretization of the space affect the network's performance, and what are the implications of using a discretized space?
* Have you explored the application of ENet to more complicated embodiments, such as a 5-link swimmer, and if so, what were the results?
* Can you provide more insight into the design of the rewards used in ENet and how they relate to the concept of intrinsic rewards with minimal domain knowledge?
