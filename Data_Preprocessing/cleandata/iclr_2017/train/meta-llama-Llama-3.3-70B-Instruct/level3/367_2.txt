Summary
This paper proposes a novel approach to address the issue of shallow binary autoencoders by utilizing a minmax game approach. The authors introduce a new weight initialization technique that corrects for the influence of dropout rates and an arbitrary nonlinearity's effect on variance. Additionally, they propose a simple method to re-estimate the Batch Normalization variance parameters after training, which leads to significant improvements in accuracy. The paper is well-structured, and the authors provide thorough analyses, making it a solid contribution to the field.
