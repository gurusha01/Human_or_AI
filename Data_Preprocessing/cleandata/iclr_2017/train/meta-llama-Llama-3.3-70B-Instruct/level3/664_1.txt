Summary
The paper proposes a novel application of the GAN framework in steganography, utilizing a steganalyser discriminator to enhance the generator's security. The method is tested by training an independent steganalyser on real and generated images to evaluate its effectiveness. The authors demonstrate that both SGAN and DCGAN models are capable of decreasing the detection accuracy of a steganalysis method almost to that of a random classifier.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the paper lacks context and background information on steganography and related works, making it difficult for the ICLR community to understand its practical applications. Secondly, the paper's results are sensitive to seed values, which can significantly impact accuracy and raises concerns about reproducibility.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's lack of context and background information makes it challenging to evaluate the significance and novelty of the proposed approach. Additionally, the sensitivity of the results to seed values undermines the reliability of the findings and raises questions about the robustness of the method. While the authors demonstrate promising results, these concerns need to be addressed to ensure the validity and generalizability of the approach.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide a more comprehensive introduction to steganography and related works, highlighting the significance and novelty of their approach. Additionally, the authors should investigate the sensitivity of their results to seed values and provide a more detailed analysis of the factors that influence the performance of the method. It would also be helpful to include more visualizations and examples to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper and provide additional evidence, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
1. Can you provide more context and background information on steganography and related works, highlighting the significance and novelty of your approach?
2. How do you plan to address the sensitivity of your results to seed values, and what measures can be taken to ensure the reproducibility of your findings?
3. Can you provide more visualizations and examples to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, and how it compares to existing methods in steganography?
