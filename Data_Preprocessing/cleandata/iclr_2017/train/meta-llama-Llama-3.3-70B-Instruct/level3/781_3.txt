Summary
The paper proposes a novel neural network architecture called Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNNs) for sequence modeling tasks. QRNNs combine the strengths of convolutional and recurrent neural networks, allowing for parallel computation across both timestep and minibatch dimensions while still capturing long-distance context dependencies. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of QRNNs on several natural language tasks, including document-level sentiment classification, language modeling, and character-level neural machine translation, achieving better predictive accuracy and significantly faster computation times compared to traditional recurrent neural networks.
Decision
I decide to Accept this paper, with the primary reason being the innovative architecture proposed and its impressive performance on various tasks. The paper provides a clear and well-motivated introduction to the problem, a thorough explanation of the QRNN architecture, and extensive experimental results demonstrating its advantages.
Supporting Arguments
The QRNN architecture addresses the limitations of traditional recurrent neural networks, which are constrained by their sequential computation and lack of parallelism. By alternating convolutional layers with a minimalist recurrent pooling function, QRNNs can capture long-distance context dependencies while allowing for parallel computation. The experimental results show that QRNNs outperform traditional recurrent neural networks on several tasks, including sentiment classification, language modeling, and machine translation, while achieving significant speedups in computation time.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest providing more detailed explanations of the QRNN architecture, particularly the convolutional and pooling components. Additionally, it would be helpful to include more visualizations or illustrations to facilitate understanding of the architecture and its components. The authors may also consider providing more analysis on the interpretability of the QRNN's hidden states, as mentioned in the conclusion.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
1. Can you provide more details on the implementation of the convolutional and pooling components in the QRNN architecture?
2. How do the authors plan to address the potential limitations of the QRNN architecture, such as its dependence on the filter size and the number of layers?
3. Can you provide more insights into the interpretability of the QRNN's hidden states, and how they compare to those of traditional recurrent neural networks?
