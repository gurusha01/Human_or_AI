Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper proposes a novel approach to rapidly adapting generative models in the low data regime using techniques from one-shot learning and matching networks. The authors introduce a generative matching networks model that leverages weak supervision in the form of labels to improve performance. The paper also explores the use of Bayesian neural networks for predicting learning curves and introduces a specialized learning curve layer to improve predictions.
Decision and Key Reasons
I decide to reject this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the paper lacks clarity and is difficult to follow, with scattered details and unclear implementation specifics. Secondly, the use of weak supervision in the form of labels is seen as a limitation, and the paper could benefit from exploring the method's performance in a completely unsupervised setting.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's notation and terminology are inconsistent, with unclear references to "shots" and "T", which makes it challenging to understand the methodology. Additionally, the paper could benefit from clearer definitions of the different functions used in the model, such as f, g, Ï†, sim, and R. The comparison to the VAE baseline is also questionable, as it does not have an associated Ctest, which raises concerns about the fairness of the evaluation.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, I suggest performing similar experiments on the MNIST dataset to allow for comparison with more models and exploring the method's performance with increasing numbers of shots. The paper's writing could also benefit from minor grammatical corrections, including missing determiners and inconsistent pronoun usage. Furthermore, the authors could provide more details on the implementation of the generative matching networks model and the specialized learning curve layer to improve reproducibility.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper and provide additional evidence, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
1. Can you provide more details on the implementation of the generative matching networks model and the specialized learning curve layer?
2. How do you plan to address the limitation of using weak supervision in the form of labels, and what alternative approaches have you considered?
3. Can you provide more information on the experimental setup and the datasets used in the evaluation, including the number of shots and the size of the training and testing sets?
