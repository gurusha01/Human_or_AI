The paper proposes an efficient approximation to the softmax function, leveraging the unbalanced distribution of words and matrix multiplies to speed up empirical calculations on GPUs. The authors also investigate the transferability of adversarial examples, specifically non-targeted and targeted attacks, on large models and a large-scale dataset. They develop novel ensemble-based approaches to generate transferable targeted adversarial examples and demonstrate their effectiveness in attacking a black-box image classification system, Clarifai.com.
I decide to accept this paper with two key reasons: (1) the paper tackles a specific and well-motivated problem, providing a clear and well-written contribution to the language modeling toolbox, and (2) the approach is well-supported by empirical results, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method in improving the speed-accuracy tradeoff.
The paper provides a thorough evaluation of the proposed approach, including a comparison with existing methods and an analysis of the geometric properties of the models. The results show that the ensemble-based approaches can generate almost perfectly transferable adversarial images, and the targeted adversarial examples can mislead Clarifai.com to predict labels irrelevant to the ground truth. The paper also provides a detailed analysis of the decision boundaries of the models, which helps to understand why adversarial examples transfer.
To further improve the paper, I would like to see a direct comparison with the speed-optimal method proposed by Zweig et al. (2013) to fully evaluate the performance and accuracy improvements of the proposed method. Additionally, it would be helpful to clarify how the clustering objective improves speed without losing much accuracy and to provide more insights into the geometric properties of the models.
I have several questions for the authors: (1) Can you provide more details on how the ensemble-based approaches are implemented, and how the ensemble weights are determined? (2) How do you ensure that the targeted adversarial examples generated using the ensemble-based approach are indeed transferable to other models? (3) Can you provide more examples of the targeted adversarial examples that can mislead Clarifai.com to predict labels semantically similar to the target labels? (4) How do you plan to extend this work to other applications, such as natural language processing or speech recognition?
