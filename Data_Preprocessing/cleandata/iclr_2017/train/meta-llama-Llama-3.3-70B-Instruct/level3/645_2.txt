Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper proposes a novel approach for pruning convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to enable efficient inference. The authors introduce a Taylor expansion-based criterion for pruning, which approximates the change in the loss function induced by removing a parameter. They also propose a greedy pruning procedure that iteratively removes the least important parameters, followed by fine-tuning using backpropagation. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach on various tasks, including transfer learning and large-scale image classification.
Decision and Reasons
I decide to reject this paper, with two key reasons for this choice:
1. Lack of thorough related work section: The paper does not provide a comprehensive review of existing work on neural network pruning, particularly in regards to significant advances in 2-view nonlinear representation learning.
2. Missing comparison with similar methods: The paper does not compare the proposed method, DGCCA, with a similar method proposed in [R1], which is crucial to prove the usefulness of DGCCA.
Supporting Arguments
The paper proposes a novel approach for pruning CNNs, but it lacks a thorough discussion of related work, particularly in the context of 2-view nonlinear representation learning. This makes it difficult to understand the significance of the proposed approach and how it differs from existing methods. Additionally, the paper does not provide a comparison with a similar method proposed in [R1], which is necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, I suggest the following:
* Provide a comprehensive review of existing work on neural network pruning, particularly in regards to significant advances in 2-view nonlinear representation learning.
* Compare the proposed method, DGCCA, with a similar method proposed in [R1] to demonstrate its effectiveness.
* Consider adding more experimental results to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed approach.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
* Can you provide more details on how the Taylor expansion-based criterion is derived and how it relates to existing pruning methods?
* How does the proposed approach differ from other pruning methods, such as those based on regularization or sparse coding?
* Can you provide more experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on different tasks and datasets?
