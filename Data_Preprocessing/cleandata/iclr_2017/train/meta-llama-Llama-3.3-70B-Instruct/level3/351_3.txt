Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper proposes a novel framework called Generative Multi-Adversarial Network (GMAN), which extends the traditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to multiple discriminators. The authors argue that this extension allows for more robust and efficient training of the generator, especially in cases where the discriminator is too harsh a critic. The paper explores various design perspectives, including the use of multiple discriminators as a formidable adversary or a forgiving teacher, and introduces a new metric called Generative Multi-Adversarial Metric (GMAM) to evaluate the performance of GMAN.
Decision and Reasons
Based on the review, I decide to Accept this paper. The two key reasons for this choice are:
1. Innovative Approach: The paper proposes a novel and innovative approach to addressing the challenges of training GANs, which is a significant contribution to the field of AI.
2. Strong Empirical Results: The paper presents strong empirical results, demonstrating the effectiveness of GMAN in various image generation tasks, including MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CelebA.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a clear and well-motivated introduction to the problem of training GANs, and the proposed GMAN framework is well-placed in the literature. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the benefits and limitations of their approach, and the empirical results are convincing and well-presented. The paper also raises important questions about the role of the discriminator in GANs and the potential benefits of using multiple discriminators.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors:
* Provide more detailed analysis of the computational complexity of GMAN compared to traditional GANs.
* Explore the potential applications of GMAN in other domains, such as natural language processing or reinforcement learning.
* Consider providing more visualizations of the generated images to help illustrate the quality of the results.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
* Can you provide more details on how the multiple discriminators are trained and updated during the training process?
* How do you ensure that the multiple discriminators are diverse and do not collapse to a single solution?
* Can you provide more insights on the choice of the hyperparameter Î» in the softmax function and its impact on the performance of GMAN?
