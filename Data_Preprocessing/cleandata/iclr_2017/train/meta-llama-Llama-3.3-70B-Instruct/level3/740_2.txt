The paper presents a new machine comprehension dataset, NewsQA, which consists of over 100,000 question-answer pairs based on news articles from CNN. The authors claim that NewsQA is a challenging dataset that requires reasoning mechanisms, such as synthesis of information across different parts of an article, and that it can help improve the performance of machine comprehension models.
I decide to reject this paper, primarily due to two key reasons. Firstly, the paper's submission lacks focus on the main message, specifically the ParMAC algorithm, and instead presents a dataset and its collection methodology. Secondly, the experimental section is limited, only showing the method's effectiveness on binary autoencoders and lacking comparison to alternative methods.
The paper's related work section lacks citations of relevant communication-efficient frameworks, such as COCOA and AIDE. The explanation of MAC in Section 2 is clear, but the part on MAC and EM is not particularly useful. Section 3 is poorly written, with unclear notation and lack of explanation of key concepts, such as data distribution and submodels. The conclusion contains overly strong and misleading statements, including ungrounded claims about parallel speedup and convergence.
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more context and motivation for the ParMAC algorithm, clarify the notation and explanation of key concepts in Section 3, and provide more comprehensive experimental results, including comparisons to alternative methods. Additionally, the authors should tone down the conclusion to make it more accurate and less misleading.
I would like the authors to answer the following questions to clarify my understanding of the paper: (1) Can you provide more details on the ParMAC algorithm and its significance in the context of machine comprehension? (2) How do you plan to address the limitations of the experimental section, particularly the lack of comparison to alternative methods? (3) Can you provide more insight into the collection methodology and how it encourages exploratory, curiosity-based questions that reflect human information seeking? 
The specific question or problem tackled by the paper is the creation of a challenging machine comprehension dataset that requires reasoning mechanisms. However, the approach is not well-motivated, and the paper lacks a clear explanation of the ParMAC algorithm. The paper does not support its claims, particularly in the experimental section, which is limited and lacks comparison to alternative methods. 
Overall, while the paper presents a potentially useful dataset, it falls short in terms of clarity, motivation, and experimental rigor, which is why I decide to reject it.
