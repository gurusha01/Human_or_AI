Summary
The paper presents Tartan (TRT), a hardware accelerator for inference with Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) that exploits the variable precision requirements of DNNs to deliver execution time proportional to the precision used per layer. TRT is evaluated on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and outperforms a state-of-the-art bit-parallel accelerator by 1.90× without any loss in accuracy, while being 1.17× more energy efficient.
Decision
I decide to Accept this paper with two key reasons: (1) the paper introduces a novel hardware accelerator that achieves significant performance and energy efficiency improvements over existing accelerators, and (2) the evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of TRT on various CNNs.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a clear and detailed description of the TRT architecture and its components, including the Serial Inner-Product Units (SIPs) and the Dispatcher and Reducer units. The evaluation methodology is sound, and the results show that TRT achieves significant speedups and energy efficiency improvements over the baseline accelerator. The paper also discusses the limitations of the work, including the assumption that each layer fits on-chip and the lack of exploration of memory compression techniques.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more information about the model architecture, including the number of layers, neurons, and connections. Additionally, a comparison of the time complexity of TRT with other accelerators would be helpful. The authors may also consider evaluating TRT on other types of neural networks, such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.
Questions for the Authors
I would like the authors to clarify the following points:
* How does TRT handle layers with different precision requirements?
* Can TRT be used for training neural networks, and if so, how would it need to be modified?
* How does TRT compare to other accelerators, such as Google's Tensor Processing Unit, in terms of performance and energy efficiency?
