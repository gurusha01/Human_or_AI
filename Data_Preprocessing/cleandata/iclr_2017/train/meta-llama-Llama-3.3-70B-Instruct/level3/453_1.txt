Summary
The paper proposes a novel approach to analyze the nonlinear dynamics of two-layered bias-free ReLU networks. The authors derive a close-form expression for the expected gradient of the loss function and use it to study the convergence of the network parameters to the optimal solution. They show that for a single ReLU node, the dynamics converges to the optimal solution with high probability if the initialization is properly chosen. For multiple ReLU nodes, they prove that the dynamics converges to the optimal solution without being trapped in local minima if the teacher parameters form an orthonormal basis and the initialization is symmetric-breaking.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper. The main reasons for this decision are:
1. Lack of convincing theoretical analysis: The paper's theoretical analysis is not convincing, and the optimization problem is essentially a mixed integer programming problem, which is NP-hard. The convergence of the proximal Newton algorithm is not guaranteed under practically useful conditions due to the discrete constraint set.
2. Unrealistic assumptions: The assumption in Theorem 3.1 may be difficult to verify in practice, especially in DNNs with complex loss surfaces. The paper's analysis relies on several unrealistic assumptions, such as the input following a Gaussian distribution and the teacher parameters forming an orthonormal basis.
Supporting arguments
The paper's approach is not well-motivated, and the authors do not provide a clear explanation of why their approach is better than existing methods. The paper's results are not supported by convincing theoretical analysis or empirical evidence. The authors' claims about the convergence of the dynamics are not substantiated by rigorous proofs or simulations.
Additional feedback
To improve the paper, the authors should provide more convincing theoretical analysis and empirical evidence to support their claims. They should also address the limitations of their approach and provide a clear explanation of why their method is better than existing methods. Additionally, the authors should consider more realistic assumptions and scenarios to make their analysis more applicable to practical problems.
