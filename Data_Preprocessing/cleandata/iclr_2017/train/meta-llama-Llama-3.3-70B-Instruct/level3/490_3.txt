Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper presents a novel approach to network morphism, a learning scheme that enables the transformation of a well-trained neural network into a new one with preserved knowledge. The authors extend previous works by introducing a graph-based representation of modular networks, allowing for the morphing of convolutional layers into arbitrary modules. The paper proposes two atomic morphing operations and provides algorithms for simple morphable modules and complex modules. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet, showing significant performance improvements with minimal extra computational cost.
Decision and Key Reasons
Based on the evaluation of the paper, I decide to Accept this paper. The two key reasons for this decision are:
1. Novel and well-motivated approach: The paper presents a novel and well-motivated approach to network morphism, addressing the central question of how a convolutional layer can be morphed into an arbitrary module. The graph-based representation of modular networks is a key innovation that enables the morphing process.
2. Strong empirical evidence: The paper provides extensive experimental results on benchmark datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach in achieving significant performance improvements with minimal extra computational cost.
Supporting Arguments
The paper is well-written, and the results appear promising. The introduction of a new dataset, WikiText, is a notable contribution. The notation used in the paper is sometimes confusing, but this can be improved with clearer differentiation. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the related work, positioning their approach within the context of knowledge transfer and modularized network architectures.
Additional Feedback and Questions
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors:
* Clarify the notation used in the paper, particularly with regards to the symbol p_ptr.
* Provide more details on the computational cost of the morphing process and its impact on the overall performance of the network.
* Consider exploring the application of their approach to other domains, such as natural language processing or computer vision tasks beyond image classification.
I would like the authors to answer the following questions to clarify my understanding of the paper:
* Can you provide more insight into the choice of the two atomic morphing operations and their impact on the morphing process?
* How do you plan to address the potential limitations of the graph-based representation of modular networks, such as scalability and interpretability?
