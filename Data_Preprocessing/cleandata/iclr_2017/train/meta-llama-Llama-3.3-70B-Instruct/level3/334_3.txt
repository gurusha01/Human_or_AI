This paper proposes a novel approach to analyzing the nonlinear dynamics of two-layered bias-free ReLU networks. The authors derive a close-form expression for the expected gradient of the loss function and use it to study the convergence of the network parameters to the optimal solution. The paper provides a thorough analysis of the dynamics of the network, including the case where the teacher parameters form an orthonormal basis.
The paper claims to contribute to the understanding of how and why deep learning works, by providing a theoretical analysis of the nonlinear dynamics of ReLU networks. The authors argue that their approach is well-motivated and similar to Spatial Transformer Networks, and that their results demonstrate the effectiveness of their method in learning a meaningful lattice for the visual search task.
I decide to reject this paper, with the main reason being the lack of sufficient experiments to support the claims made by the authors. The paper only reports results on a modified MNIST dataset, and does not provide any results on real datasets such as Toronto Face, CUB bird, or SVHN datasets. Additionally, the paper only compares the proposed method with variants of itself, and not with other relevant models such as Spatial Transformer Networks or DRAW.
To support this decision, I provide the following arguments:
* The paper's experimental evaluation is limited to a single dataset, which is not sufficient to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in a variety of settings.
* The paper does not provide any comparison with other state-of-the-art models, which makes it difficult to assess the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed method.
* The paper's theoretical analysis is thorough, but it is not clear how the results translate to practice, and whether the proposed method can be used in real-world applications.
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more extensive experimental evaluations, including results on multiple datasets and comparisons with other state-of-the-art models. Additionally, the authors could provide more details on how the proposed method can be used in practice, and what are the potential applications of their approach.
I would like to ask the authors the following questions to clarify my understanding of the paper:
* Can you provide more details on how the proposed method can be used in practice, and what are the potential applications of your approach?
* How do you plan to extend your approach to more complex networks, such as multilayer ReLU networks or other nonlinear networks?
* Can you provide more experimental results, including comparisons with other state-of-the-art models, to demonstrate the effectiveness of your approach in a variety of settings?
