Summary of the Paper
The paper proposes a novel learning framework, called Recurrent Inference Machines (RIM), for solving inverse problems. The framework abandons the traditional separation between model and inference, instead learning both components jointly without defining their explicit functional form. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of RIMs in experiments on various image reconstruction tasks, showing that they can outperform state-of-the-art methods.
Decision
I decide to reject the paper, with the main reason being that the idea of using discriminatively trained recurrent networks to solve inverse problems is not new and has been used before. Additionally, the claims about the benefits of RIMs over prior approaches are not compelling, as the advantages of parameter sharing can work both ways.
Supporting Arguments
The paper lacks sufficient novelty, as the concept of using recurrent neural networks to solve inverse problems has been explored before. The authors' claim that RIMs can handle different noise levels and scale sizes is not unique to their approach, as this can be achieved by training a single model for multiple forms of degradation. Furthermore, the paper does not provide a detailed discussion of prior work, which makes it difficult to understand the specific contributions of the authors.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, the authors should provide a more detailed discussion of prior work, highlighting the specific aspects of their recurrent architecture that enable better recovery for inverse problems. The authors should also consider a broader set of inverse tasks, such as in-painting, deconvolution, and different noise models, to demonstrate the versatility of their approach. Additionally, the authors should provide more experimental results to support their claims, including comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
1. How does the RIM framework differ from existing approaches that use recurrent neural networks to solve inverse problems?
2. Can the authors provide more experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness of RIMs on a wider range of inverse problems?
3. How do the authors plan to address the issue of lack of novelty, given that similar ideas have been explored before?
