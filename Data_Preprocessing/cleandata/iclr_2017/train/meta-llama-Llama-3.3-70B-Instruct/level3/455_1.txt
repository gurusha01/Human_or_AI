This paper introduces the Energy-based Generative Adversarial Network (EBGAN) model, which views the discriminator as an energy function that assigns low energies to the regions near the data manifold and higher energies to other regions. The authors propose using an autoencoder architecture for the discriminator, where the energy is the reconstruction error. This approach is shown to exhibit more stable behavior than regular GANs during training and can generate high-resolution images.
The paper tackles the specific question of improving the stability and quality of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) by introducing an autoencoder into the discriminator. The approach is well-motivated, building on the concept of energy-based models and the use of autoencoders for representation learning. The paper is also well-placed in the literature, drawing on previous work on GANs, autoencoders, and energy-based models.
The paper supports its claims with theoretical results, including a proof that the generator produces points that follow the underlying data distribution when the system reaches convergence. The authors also present empirical results on high-resolution image generation, demonstrating the effectiveness of the EBGAN model. The results show that EBGANs are more reliably trained than GANs and can generate high-quality images on datasets such as LSUN, CelebA, and ImageNet.
I decide to accept this paper, with the key reason being the novelty and effectiveness of the proposed EBGAN model. The paper presents a well-motivated and well-executed approach to improving the stability and quality of GANs, with strong theoretical and empirical results.
To improve the paper, I suggest including more related work, such as the paper "Improving Generative Adversarial Networks with Denoising Feature Matching", to provide context and comparison. Additionally, the authors could provide more details on the experimental settings and hyperparameter tuning, to facilitate replication and extension of the results.
I would like the authors to answer the following questions to clarify my understanding of the paper: (1) How does the choice of autoencoder architecture affect the performance of the EBGAN model? (2) Can the authors provide more insight into the theoretical implications of using an energy-based model for GANs, and how this relates to other approaches such as probabilistic GANs? (3) How does the EBGAN model handle mode collapse, and are there any plans to extend the model to conditional generation tasks?
