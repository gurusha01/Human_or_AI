Summary of the Paper's Claims and Contributions
The paper introduces Deep Variational Bayes Filters (DVBF), a novel method for unsupervised learning and identification of latent Markovian state space models. The authors claim that DVBF can overcome intractable inference distributions via variational inference, enabling the handling of highly nonlinear input data with temporal and spatial dependencies. They also argue that their approach can learn both system identification and inference jointly, exploiting Stochastic Gradient Variational Bayes. The paper presents experiments on vision-based tasks, demonstrating that DVBF can recover latent states that identify underlying physical quantities and show stable long-term predictions.
Decision and Key Reasons
I decide to Reject this paper, with two key reasons:
1. Lack of biology in methodology and evaluation: Although the paper applies computer vision to biology, it lacks actual biology in its methodology and evaluation. This raises concerns about the paper's relevance to biologists and the field of biology.
2. Inadequate evaluation of visual features: The paper fails to evaluate how well visual features can recover the hierarchical relationship of biological organisms. This is a crucial aspect of the paper's claims, and the lack of rigorous evaluation undermines the paper's contributions.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's use of a hierarchical clustering of visual categories with WordNet hierarchy as ground truth may not accurately represent biological inheritance relationships. Furthermore, the use of a tree structure is criticized as being lossy and imposing weird relationships, with a graph being a more suitable structure for visual relationships. The paper's claim that its method is competitive to human beings in building the tree of life is not supported by sufficient experimental evidence, with only qualitative results and no rigorous comparison.
Additional Feedback and Questions
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors:
* Incorporate more biology into their methodology and evaluation to increase the paper's relevance to biologists.
* Provide a more rigorous evaluation of visual features and their ability to recover hierarchical relationships.
* Consider using a graph structure instead of a tree structure to represent visual relationships.
* Provide more quantitative results and comparisons to support their claims.
I would like the authors to answer the following questions to clarify my understanding of the paper and provide additional evidence:
* Can you provide more details on how your method can be applied to real-world biological problems, and what benefits it can bring to biologists?
* How do you plan to address the limitations of your current evaluation methodology, and what additional experiments or analyses can you provide to support your claims?
* Can you provide more insights into the choice of WordNet hierarchy as ground truth, and how it relates to biological inheritance relationships?
