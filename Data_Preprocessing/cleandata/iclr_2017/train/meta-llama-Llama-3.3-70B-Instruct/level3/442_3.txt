This paper proposes a variational approximation to the information bottleneck principle, which is a fundamental concept in information theory. The authors derive a lower bound on the information bottleneck objective using variational inference and demonstrate its effectiveness in training deep neural networks. The experimental results show that the proposed method, called Deep Variational Information Bottleneck (Deep VIB), outperforms other regularization methods in terms of generalization performance and robustness to adversarial attacks.
The specific question tackled by this paper is how to apply the information bottleneck principle to deep neural networks in a computationally efficient manner. The approach is well-motivated, as it is based on a well-established concept in information theory, and the authors provide a clear derivation of the variational lower bound. The paper also provides a thorough analysis of the experimental results, including visualizations of the learned representations and comparisons to other regularization methods.
However, I have some concerns regarding the presentation of the model and the notation used. The paper could benefit from a clearer explanation of the notation and definitions, particularly in the earlier sections. Additionally, the authors' interpretation of the variational auto-encoder and warm-up training differs from the standard VAE framework, and this difference should be clearly explained.
Furthermore, I question the claim of independent work, as a similar paper by Chalk et al. (2016) is cited in the related work section. The authors should provide more evidence to support their claim of independent work.
In terms of the conference guidelines, I would answer the three key questions as follows:
1. What is the specific question/problem tackled by the paper? The paper tackles the problem of applying the information bottleneck principle to deep neural networks in a computationally efficient manner.
2. Is the approach well-motivated, including being well-placed in the literature? Yes, the approach is well-motivated, as it is based on a well-established concept in information theory, and the authors provide a clear derivation of the variational lower bound.
3. Does the paper support the claims? The paper provides a thorough analysis of the experimental results, including visualizations of the learned representations and comparisons to other regularization methods, which supports the claims made by the authors.
Based on these answers, I would decide to reject the paper, primarily due to the unclear presentation of the model and notation, as well as the lack of evidence to support the claim of independent work.
To improve the paper, I would suggest the following:
* Provide a clearer explanation of the notation and definitions, particularly in the earlier sections.
* Clearly explain the difference between the authors' interpretation of the variational auto-encoder and warm-up training and the standard VAE framework.
* Provide more evidence to support the claim of independent work.
* Consider revising the paper to address the concerns mentioned above and resubmitting it for review.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper are:
* Can you provide a more detailed explanation of the notation and definitions used in the paper?
* How does the authors' interpretation of the variational auto-encoder and warm-up training differ from the standard VAE framework, and what are the implications of this difference?
* Can you provide more evidence to support the claim of independent work, such as a detailed description of the development process and any relevant timestamps or documentation?
