This paper proposes a novel approach to network morphism, which enables the transformation of a convolutional layer into an arbitrary module in a neural network. The authors introduce a graph-based representation for modules and formulate the network morphism process as a graph transformation problem. They also propose two atomic morphing operations and provide algorithms for simple morphable modules and complex modules.
The paper claims to contribute to the field of network morphism by providing a systematic study on the problem at a higher level, and by answering the central question of whether and how a convolutional layer can be morphed into an arbitrary module. The authors also provide extensive experimental results on benchmark datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of their proposed approach.
I decide to reject this paper for the following two key reasons:
1. The paper lacks clarity in explaining the differences between the proposed approach and previous work, such as Gulcehre et al. The authors claim that their approach is different, but the exact differences are not clearly discussed.
2. The paper makes some claims that are incorrect or insignificant, such as the difference in using the RNN hidden state to decide when to use the pointer. The authors need to provide more evidence to support their claims.
To improve the paper, the authors should provide more details on the differences between their approach and previous work, and clarify the significance of their contributions. They should also provide more evidence to support their claims and address the inconsistencies in their paper.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper include:
* Can you provide more details on how the proposed approach differs from previous work, such as Gulcehre et al.?
* How do you decide when to use the pointer network, and what is the significance of using the RNN hidden state for this decision?
* Can you provide more evidence to support the claims made in the paper, such as the effectiveness of the proposed approach on benchmark datasets?
