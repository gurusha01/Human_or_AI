Summary of the Paper's Contribution
The paper proposes a novel perspective on Highway and Residual networks, suggesting that they perform unrolled iterative estimation. This viewpoint offers a unified theory for understanding these architectures, which can be seen as two approaches to the same problem. The authors derive both Residual and Highway networks from this perspective, providing a framework for understanding several recent findings, such as resilience to lesioning and benefits of layer dropout.
Decision: Reject
I decide to reject this paper due to two key reasons. Firstly, the experimental section is weak, with testing on only one real-world dataset against weak baselines. Secondly, the paper's contribution is marginal, as the idea of embedding categorical data has been handled in past literature, and the only new aspect is the explicit modeling of interactions among categories.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's experimental evaluation is limited, which makes it difficult to assess the effectiveness of the proposed method. The authors should evaluate their approach against numerous models proposed in the literature to demonstrate its superiority. Additionally, the paper's contribution is not significant, as the concept of embedding categorical data is not new. The authors should provide more substantial evidence to support their claims and demonstrate the practical impact of their approach.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, the authors should consider the following suggestions:
* Conduct a more comprehensive experimental evaluation, including multiple datasets and baselines.
* Provide a more detailed analysis of the results, including discussions on the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed approach.
* Clarify the novelty of the paper's contribution and provide more substantial evidence to support the claims.
* Consider using a deep convolutional network to automatically learn the interactions among categories, as suggested by the reviewer.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
* Can you provide more details on the experimental setup and the datasets used in the evaluation?
* How do you plan to address the weakness of the experimental section and provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the proposed approach?
* Can you clarify the novelty of the paper's contribution and provide more substantial evidence to support the claims?
* Have you considered using a deep convolutional network to automatically learn the interactions among categories, and if so, what were the results?
