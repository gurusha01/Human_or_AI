Summary
The paper proposes a novel dynamic normalization technique, called Charged Point Normalization (CPN), which aims to help gradient-based optimization algorithms escape saddle points in high-dimensional non-convex optimization problems. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the problem of saddle points and the behavior of first-order gradient descent algorithms around them. They also present empirical results on various neural network architectures, demonstrating the effectiveness of CPN in escaping saddle points.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the paper presents CPN as a new type of layer, which is misleading, as it is essentially a retraining of the model with convolutions of stride 2 instead of pooling layers. Secondly, the idea of using strided convolutions instead of pooling is not novel and has been explored before, making the paper's contribution unclear.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's contribution is unclear because the idea of using strided convolutions instead of pooling has been previously explored. The authors do not provide sufficient evidence to demonstrate the novelty of their approach. Additionally, the paper's presentation of CPN as a new type of layer is misleading, as it is essentially a retraining of the model with a different architecture.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, the authors should clarify the novelty of their approach and provide more evidence to demonstrate its effectiveness. They should also avoid presenting CPN as a new type of layer and instead focus on the retraining of the model with convolutions of stride 2. Additionally, the authors should consider providing more comprehensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of CPN on various datasets and architectures.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
1. Can you provide more evidence to demonstrate the novelty of your approach and how it differs from previous work on using strided convolutions instead of pooling?
2. How do you respond to the criticism that presenting CPN as a new type of layer is misleading, and how do you plan to revise the paper to address this issue?
3. Can you provide more comprehensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of CPN on various datasets and architectures, and how do you plan to address the limitations of your current experimental setup?
