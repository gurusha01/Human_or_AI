This paper proposes a novel approach to learning algorithmic tasks by leveraging the principle of divide and conquer, which is a fundamental concept in discrete mathematics and computer science. The authors introduce a recursive split and merge architecture that can be trained using only input-output pairs, without the need for explicit supervision or oracle intermediate decisions. The model is designed to optimize both accuracy and computational complexity, making it a promising approach for learning complex tasks.
The paper tackles the specific question of how to learn algorithmic tasks that can be solved using the divide and conquer principle, which is a well-motivated and well-placed problem in the literature. The approach is well-motivated by the success of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) in exploiting translation invariance and temporal dependencies, respectively. The authors argue that the divide and conquer principle can be used to create a powerful inductive bias that can be exploited by neural networks to learn complex tasks.
The paper provides preliminary empirical evidence that the proposed approach can be effective in learning simple tasks such as sorting and planar convex hull. The results show that the model can generalize well to larger scales and can learn to solve tasks with high accuracy, even when trained with weak supervision. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the model's complexity and show that it can be controlled by adjusting the hyperparameters.
However, I have some concerns that prevent me from accepting the paper in its current form. Firstly, the paper lacks additional information and details about the code, which makes it difficult to fully understand and replicate the results. Secondly, the conference's organization and presentation of the code were lacking, which delayed my assessment.
To improve the paper, I would like the authors to provide more details about the code and the experimental setup, including the hyperparameters used and the training procedures. I would also like to see more extensive experiments and evaluations of the model on more complex tasks and datasets. Additionally, I would like the authors to provide more insights into the model's behavior and how it learns to solve tasks, including visualizations and analyses of the learned representations.
Some specific questions I would like the authors to answer include: How do the hyperparameters affect the model's performance and complexity? How does the model learn to solve tasks with different levels of complexity and difficulty? Can the model be applied to other tasks and domains, such as graph problems or natural language processing? How does the model compare to other approaches, such as reinforcement learning or explicit external memory models?
Overall, I believe that the paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of machine learning and algorithmic learning, but it requires more work and experimentation to fully demonstrate its effectiveness and potential. I would like to see a revised version of the paper that addresses my concerns and provides more detailed and extensive evaluations of the model.
