Summary
The paper proposes a new architecture, called neural equivalence networks (EQNETs), for learning continuous semantic representations of mathematical and logical expressions. The goal is to assign continuous vectors to symbolic expressions such that semantically equivalent but syntactically diverse expressions are assigned to identical or highly similar continuous vectors. The authors evaluate their model on a range of datasets, including boolean and polynomial expressions, and demonstrate that EQNETs outperform existing architectures, including recursive neural networks (TREENNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs).
Decision
I decide to accept this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the paper tackles a fundamental problem in machine learning and artificial intelligence, namely, representing and inferring procedural knowledge. Secondly, the authors propose a novel architecture that demonstrates significant improvements over existing methods on a range of datasets.
Supporting Arguments
The paper presents a well-motivated approach to learning continuous semantic representations of symbolic expressions. The authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of their architecture, including the use of multi-layer neural networks and subexpression forcing to guide the learned representations. The evaluation is thorough and demonstrates the effectiveness of EQNETs on a range of datasets. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the impact of EQNET components, including subexpression forcing and output normalization, on performance.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more insight into the limitations of their approach and potential avenues for future work. For example, the authors mention that fixed-sized SEMVECs may limit the capacity to represent procedural knowledge, but do not provide a clear direction for addressing this limitation. Additionally, the authors could provide more discussion on the potential applications of EQNETs in areas such as automated theorem proving and program synthesis.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
1. Can you provide more details on the subexpression forcing mechanism and how it guides the learned representations?
2. How do you plan to address the limitation of fixed-sized SEMVECs and increase the capacity to represent procedural knowledge?
3. Can you provide more insight into the potential applications of EQNETs in areas such as automated theorem proving and program synthesis?
