Summary
The paper introduces Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNNs), a novel approach to neural sequence modeling that combines the strengths of convolutional and recurrent neural networks. QRNNs aim to address the limitations of traditional RNNs in handling long sequences by allowing parallel computation across both timestep and minibatch dimensions. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of QRNNs on several natural language tasks, including document-level sentiment classification, language modeling, and character-level neural machine translation, achieving better predictive accuracy and faster computation times compared to LSTM-based models.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, primarily due to two key reasons. Firstly, the paper lacks a clear motivation and introduction to its application, algorithm, or architecture, making it unclear from the start. Secondly, the exposition is unclear with unjustified assertions, such as the variance of experts for certain variables, which needs further explanation and justification.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's approach can be related to dictionary learning, and the authors should discuss relevant literature to provide context and comparison. Additionally, the use of a small horse data set with high feature dimension may limit the generalizability of the conclusions drawn from the results. While the paper presents promising results on several tasks, the lack of clarity and motivation in the introduction and the unclear exposition of certain concepts undermine the overall quality of the paper.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, the authors should provide a clearer introduction to the QRNN architecture and its motivations, as well as more detailed explanations of the convolutional and pooling components. They should also discuss the relationship between QRNNs and other sequence modeling approaches, such as dictionary learning, and provide more context and comparison with existing literature. Furthermore, the authors should consider using more diverse and larger datasets to demonstrate the generalizability of their approach.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper and provide additional evidence, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
1. Can you provide more details on the motivation behind the QRNN architecture and how it addresses the limitations of traditional RNNs?
2. How do the convolutional and pooling components of the QRNN interact, and what are the implications of this interaction for sequence modeling tasks?
3. Can you discuss the relationship between QRNNs and dictionary learning, and how the QRNN approach differs from or improves upon existing dictionary learning methods?
