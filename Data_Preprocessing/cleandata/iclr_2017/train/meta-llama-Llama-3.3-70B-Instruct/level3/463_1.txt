Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper proposes a novel neural network architecture, called Layer-RNN (L-RNN), which combines traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to learn multi-scale contextual information. The L-RNN module is designed to capture long-range dependencies within a layer, allowing the network to learn contextual information at multiple levels. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of the L-RNN module in two tasks: image classification on CIFAR-10 and semantic segmentation on PASCAL VOC 2012.
Decision and Reasons
I decide to reject this paper, with two key reasons:
1. Lack of novelty: The idea of combining CNNs and RNNs is not new, and previous works have addressed similar concepts. The authors need to demonstrate state-of-the-art results or provide a significant improvement over existing methods to justify the novelty of their approach.
2. Limited experimental evaluation: The paper only presents results on two datasets, CIFAR-10 and PASCAL VOC 2012, which may not be sufficient to demonstrate the generalizability of the L-RNN module. Additional experiments on larger datasets, such as ImageNet, would be necessary to fully evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed architecture.
Supporting Arguments
While the paper presents some promising results, particularly on the CIFAR-10 dataset, the experimental evaluation is limited, and the authors do not provide a thorough comparison with existing state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, the paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the L-RNN module's behavior and its ability to capture long-range dependencies.
Additional Feedback and Questions
To improve the paper, I would suggest the following:
* Provide a more detailed comparison with existing methods, including a thorough analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the L-RNN module.
* Conduct additional experiments on larger datasets to demonstrate the generalizability of the proposed architecture.
* Investigate the use of different RNN architectures, such as LSTM or GRU, and their impact on the performance of the L-RNN module.
* Consider adding a more detailed analysis of the computational complexity and memory requirements of the L-RNN module.
Some questions I would like the authors to address:
* How does the L-RNN module handle cases where the input data has varying sizes or aspect ratios?
* Can the authors provide more insights into the learned representations and features extracted by the L-RNN module?
* How does the performance of the L-RNN module compare to other methods that use attention mechanisms or graph-based approaches to model contextual relationships?
