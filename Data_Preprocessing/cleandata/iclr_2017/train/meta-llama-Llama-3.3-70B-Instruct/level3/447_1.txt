This paper introduces a novel approach to improving the performance of intelligent agents by enabling them to ask questions and receive user feedback. The authors design a simulator and synthetic tasks to study this problem in both offline supervised and online reinforcement learning settings. The results show that models improve when asking questions, and the approach is validated on real data using Amazon Mechanical Turk.
I decide to accept this paper with the following key reasons: 
1. The paper tackles a specific and well-defined problem of enabling intelligent agents to ask questions and receive user feedback, which is a crucial aspect of human-computer interaction.
2. The approach is well-motivated, and the authors provide a clear description of the tasks, models, and experimental settings.
The paper's contributions and conclusions could be strengthened by addressing the following points:
- Providing more detailed analyses of the results and their implications, such as the distribution of misspelled words and the impact of conversational history on the model's performance.
- Exploring the behavior of different models in various tasks and settings to gain a deeper understanding of the strengths and limitations of the approach.
- Discussing the potential applications and future directions of this research, such as integrating the question-asking mechanism with other dialogue systems or exploring its use in multi-turn conversations.
To clarify my understanding of the paper and provide additional evidence, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
- Can you provide more details on the simulator and the synthetic tasks designed for this study, such as the specific scenarios and datasets used?
- How do the results from the Mechanical Turk experiments compare to those from the simulator, and what do these differences reveal about the effectiveness of the approach in real-world settings?
- What are the potential limitations and challenges of scaling this approach to more complex and open-ended conversations, and how do you plan to address these challenges in future work?
