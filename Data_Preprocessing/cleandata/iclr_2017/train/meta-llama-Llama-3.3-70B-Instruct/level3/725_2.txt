This paper proposes a novel approach to environment simulation using recurrent neural networks, which can make temporally and spatially coherent predictions for hundreds of time-steps into the future. The authors introduce an action-dependent state transition function that allows the model to incorporate action information more effectively, and they also propose a prediction-independent simulator that can evolve the state without using the prediction during usage.
The paper claims to contribute to the state-of-the-art in environment modeling by providing an in-depth analysis of the factors affecting performance and by introducing a simulator that does not need to generate a high-dimensional image at each time-step. The authors evaluate their approach on three diverse and challenging families of environments, namely Atari 2600 games, a 3D car racing environment, and complex 3D mazes, and show that their simulators can be used for model-based exploration.
I decide to accept this paper with the following key reasons: 
1. The paper tackles a specific question/problem of environment simulation, which is a crucial component of many artificial intelligence systems.
2. The approach is well-motivated, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the connections between DNN, SFNN, and simplified SFNN.
3. The paper supports its claims with extensive experimental results, including comparisons with other state-of-the-art models and ablation studies.
However, I have some concerns that need to be addressed by the authors. For example, the authors mention that the prediction-independent simulator is more sensitive to changes in the state transition structure and training scheme, but they do not provide a clear explanation for this phenomenon. Additionally, the authors could provide more details on the computational efficiency of their approach, especially in comparison to other state-of-the-art models.
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more visualizations of the predicted frames, especially for the 3D environments, to help readers understand the quality of the predictions. Additionally, the authors could provide more analysis on the trade-off between short-term and long-term accuracy, and how it affects the overall performance of the model.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer include: 
1. Can the authors provide more details on the implementation of the prediction-independent simulator, especially on how they handle the case where the agent is interested in the effect of a sequence of actions rather than a single action?
2. How do the authors plan to address the issue of oversampling and undersampling in the policy-induced data distribution, and what are the potential consequences of this issue on the performance of the model?
3. Can the authors provide more comparisons with other state-of-the-art models, especially in terms of computational efficiency and scalability to larger environments?
