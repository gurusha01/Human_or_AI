Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper presents a novel framework for defining various recurrent neural network architectures, including a new general-purpose recurrent unit called the TBRU. The framework allows for easy incorporation of dynamic recurrent connections through the definition of a transition system, enabling applications such as syntactic dependency parsing and multitasking with extractive summarization. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework in achieving more accurate summarization models and increased parsing accuracy without significant efficiency loss.
Decision and Key Reasons
Based on the provided guidelines, I decide to Accept this paper. The two key reasons for this choice are:
1. The paper tackles a specific and well-motivated question: how to effectively combine the strengths of VAEs and PixelCNNs to model natural images. The authors provide a clear and well-placed literature review, demonstrating a thorough understanding of the current state of the art in generative modeling.
2. The paper supports its claims with rigorous empirical results, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed PixelVAE model on several benchmark datasets, including MNIST, LSUN bedrooms, and 64x64 ImageNet.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a clear and well-structured presentation of the proposed framework, including a detailed description of the PixelVAE model and its hierarchical architecture. The authors also provide a thorough analysis of the experimental results, including ablation studies and visualizations of the learned representations. The paper demonstrates a strong understanding of the underlying mathematical concepts and provides a clear and concise explanation of the technical details.
Additional Feedback and Questions
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more detailed analysis of the representations learned by the PixelVAE model, including a more in-depth discussion of the trade-offs between the different components of the model. Additionally, I would like to see more visualizations of the generated samples, particularly for the LSUN bedrooms dataset.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper are:
* Can you provide more details on the computational cost of the PixelVAE model compared to the standard PixelCNN implementation?
* How do the authors plan to extend the PixelVAE model to more complex datasets, such as CIFAR-10 or ImageNet-1K?
* Can you provide more insight into the choice of the number of autoregressive layers and the receptive field size of the PixelCNN layers in the decoder?
