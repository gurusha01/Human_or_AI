The paper proposes using Annealed Importance Sampling (AIS) to estimate log-likelihoods for decoder-based generative models and validates its accuracy using Bidirectional Monte Carlo (BDMC). The authors analyze the performance of various decoder-based models, including Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and Generative Moment Matching Networks (GMMNs), and compare their log-likelihoods using AIS. The results show that VAEs achieve substantially higher log-likelihoods than GANs and GMMNs, and that AIS is more accurate than Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) and the Importance Weighted Autoencoder (IWAE) bound.
However, I am not convinced by the execution of the paper, particularly with the choice of q(s | s') = p(s | s'), which may lead to a loose and high variance variational bound. The claim about the tightness of the bound in Appendix D is also flawed, as the learned transition distribution does not obey detailed balance, a necessary assumption for the claim to hold. The experimental results are not visually impressive, likely due to the mismatch between generative and inference trajectories caused by the choice of q(s | s').
Furthermore, the paper optimizes a variational bound on log likelihood but fails to report and compare log likelihoods against competing methods, which is a significant omission. I also suspect that some terms are being dropped from the training gradient in Section 5, which could affect the results. The paper has several technical issues, including unclear notation, missing specifications, and errors in figures and equations.
To improve the paper, I suggest alternative approaches, such as learning an energy function instead of a transition distribution, which could improve the results and address some of the concerns. I would like the authors to clarify the following points: (1) How does the choice of q(s | s') affect the variational bound, and what are the implications for the experimental results? (2) Can the authors provide more details on the implementation of AIS and BDMC, including the choice of hyperparameters and the number of intermediate distributions? (3) How do the authors plan to address the technical issues and errors in the paper?
Based on these concerns, I decide to reject the paper. The key reasons for this decision are the flawed execution of the paper, particularly with the choice of q(s | s') and the lack of comparison with competing methods. While the paper has some interesting ideas and results, the technical issues and errors detract from its overall quality and significance. 
To answer the conference guidelines, 
1. The specific question/problem tackled by the paper is the evaluation of decoder-based generative models using Annealed Importance Sampling (AIS) and Bidirectional Monte Carlo (BDMC).
2. The approach is well-motivated, including being well-placed in the literature, as it addresses the challenge of evaluating generative models and provides a new perspective on the comparison of different models.
3. The paper does not fully support its claims, as the execution is flawed, and the results are not convincing due to the technical issues and errors. 
I hope this feedback is helpful in improving the paper.
