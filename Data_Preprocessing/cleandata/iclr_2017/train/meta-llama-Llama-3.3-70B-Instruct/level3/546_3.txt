Summary
The paper proposes a novel deep neural network architecture, ENet, designed for real-time semantic segmentation on mobile devices. ENet achieves significant improvements in efficiency, requiring 75× less FLOPs and having 79× less parameters, while maintaining similar or better accuracy compared to existing models. The authors evaluate ENet on various datasets, including Cityscapes, CamVid, and SUN, and demonstrate its real-time performance on embedded systems.

I decide to Accept this paper, with the primary reason being the significant contributions to the field of semantic segmentation, particularly in terms of efficiency and real-time performance. The paper presents a well-motivated approach, thoroughly evaluates the proposed architecture, and provides detailed analysis of the design choices.
Supporting Arguments
The paper tackles a specific and important problem in the field of computer vision, namely, real-time semantic segmentation on mobile devices. The approach is well-motivated, and the authors provide a thorough review of existing architectures and their limitations. The evaluation of ENet on various datasets demonstrates its effectiveness and efficiency, and the authors provide detailed analysis of the design choices, including the use of bottleneck modules, dilated convolutions, and spatial dropout.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest the authors provide more insights into the trade-offs between accuracy and processing time, and explore the potential applications of ENet in other domains, such as data-center applications. Additionally, it would be interesting to see a comparison of ENet with other state-of-the-art models in terms of robustness and generalizability.
