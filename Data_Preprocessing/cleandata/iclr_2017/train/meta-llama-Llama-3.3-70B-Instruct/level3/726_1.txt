This paper proposes a novel learning framework for solving inverse problems, which abandons the traditional separation between model and inference. The authors introduce Recurrent Inference Machines (RIMs), a class of recurrent neural networks that directly learn to solve inverse problems. The paper is well-written, and the theoretical exposition is of high quality.
The specific question tackled by the paper is how to learn a representation that can effectively solve inverse problems, and the approach is well-motivated by the limitations of traditional methods. The paper provides a clear and concise overview of the background and related work, and the proposed framework is well-placed in the literature.
The paper supports its claims with experimental results on various image restoration tasks, including denoising and super-resolution. The results show that RIMs can outperform state-of-the-art methods, and the authors provide a detailed analysis of the performance of their model.
Based on the review, I decide to Accept this paper. The two key reasons for this choice are: (1) the paper proposes a novel and well-motivated framework for solving inverse problems, and (2) the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
The supporting arguments for this decision are: (1) the paper provides a clear and concise overview of the background and related work, (2) the proposed framework is well-placed in the literature, and (3) the experimental results are thorough and well-analyzed.
Additional feedback to improve the paper includes: (1) providing more details on the implementation of the RIMs, such as the architecture and hyperparameters used, (2) discussing the potential limitations and challenges of the proposed framework, and (3) exploring the application of RIMs to other inverse problems beyond image restoration.
Questions to the authors include: (1) How do the authors plan to extend the proposed framework to non-linear inverse problems?, (2) Can the authors provide more insights into the interpretability of the learned representations?, and (3) How do the authors plan to address the potential issue of overfitting in the proposed framework?
