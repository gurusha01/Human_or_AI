This paper proposes a novel approach to learning multi-sense word embeddings by leveraging multilingual distributional information. The authors present a multi-view Bayesian non-parametric algorithm that can effectively combine the benefits of crosslingual training and Bayesian non-parametrics. The approach is well-motivated, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the limitations of existing bilingual approaches and how their method addresses these limitations.
I decide to accept this paper with the following key reasons: 
1. The paper tackles a specific and important problem in natural language processing, namely learning multi-sense word embeddings.
2. The approach is well-motivated, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the limitations of existing bilingual approaches and how their method addresses these limitations.
The paper supports its claims with extensive experiments on word sense induction and contextual word similarity tasks. The results show that the proposed approach outperforms existing methods, especially when using multilingual training data. The authors also provide a qualitative illustration of the benefits of multilingual training, showing that the senses of words are more clearly clustered and separated when using multilingual data.
However, there are some areas that need improvement. For example, the plots in the paper are difficult to read in grayscale, which hinders the understanding of the results. Additionally, the authors could provide more analysis on the effect of language family distance on the performance of the model.
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the experimental setup, such as the specific datasets used and the hyperparameter tuning process. Additionally, the authors could provide more analysis on the limitations of their approach and potential avenues for future research.
I would like to ask the authors to clarify the following points:
* How do the authors plan to extend their approach to model polysemy in foreign languages?
* Can the authors provide more details on the sense vectors alignment across languages and how it can be used to generate a multilingual Wordnet like resource?
* How do the authors plan to address the issue of plot readability in grayscale? 
Overall, the paper presents a novel and interesting approach to learning multi-sense word embeddings, and with some revisions, it has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of natural language processing.
