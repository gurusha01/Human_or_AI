Summary
The paper presents a method for optimizing recurrent neural networks (RNNs) by controlling the orthogonality of the weight matrices. The authors propose a factorization technique that allows for bounding the spectral norms of the weight matrices, which can help to prevent vanishing and exploding gradients. The approach is evaluated on several tasks, including synthetic memory tasks and real-world datasets such as MNIST and Penn Treebank.
Decision
I decide to accept this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the paper tackles a specific and well-defined problem in the field of deep learning, namely the optimization of RNNs. Secondly, the approach presented in the paper is well-motivated and supported by a thorough analysis of the effects of orthogonality constraints on the optimization process.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a clear and concise introduction to the problem of vanishing and exploding gradients in RNNs, and motivates the need for controlling the orthogonality of the weight matrices. The authors propose a novel factorization technique that allows for bounding the spectral norms of the weight matrices, which can help to prevent vanishing and exploding gradients. The approach is evaluated on several tasks, including synthetic memory tasks and real-world datasets such as MNIST and Penn Treebank. The results show that the proposed approach can improve the optimization convergence rate and model performance, especially when the orthogonality constraints are loosened.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I would suggest providing more details on the implementation of the factorization technique, including the computational complexity and the running time of the method. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more experiments on the effects of different orthogonality constraints and regularization techniques on the optimization process. Furthermore, the authors could provide more insights on the relationship between the orthogonality of the weight matrices and the stability of the optimization process.
Questions for the Authors
I would like to ask the authors to clarify the following points:
* How does the factorization technique affect the computational complexity of the optimization process?
* Can the authors provide more insights on the relationship between the orthogonality of the weight matrices and the stability of the optimization process?
* How do the results of the paper relate to other approaches for optimizing RNNs, such as gradient clipping and weight normalization?
