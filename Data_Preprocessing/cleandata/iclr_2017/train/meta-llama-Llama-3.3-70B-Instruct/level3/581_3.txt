Summary
The paper proposes a novel approach to address the issue of catastrophic mistakes in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents. The authors introduce the concept of "intrinsic fear," which involves training a separate danger model to predict the likelihood of a catastrophe within a short number of steps. This danger model is used to penalize the Q-learning objective, shaping the reward function away from catastrophic states. The approach is evaluated on several environments, including Adventure Seeker, Cart-Pole, and Seaquest, and is shown to outperform traditional DQN methods in terms of avoiding catastrophes.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the paper's approach, although novel, lacks a strong motivation and fails to provide a convincing argument for why the proposed method is necessary. Secondly, the paper's evaluation is limited to a few environments, and it is unclear whether the approach will generalize to more complex domains.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's approach is based on the idea of using a separate danger model to predict the likelihood of a catastrophe. However, it is unclear why this approach is necessary, and why a more traditional approach, such as modifying the objective function or using external knowledge, would not be sufficient. Additionally, the paper's evaluation is limited to a few environments, and it is unclear whether the approach will generalize to more complex domains. The paper also lacks a thorough analysis of the trade-offs between avoiding catastrophes and achieving high rewards.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, I would suggest providing a more thorough motivation for the proposed approach, including a discussion of the limitations of traditional methods and the potential benefits of using a separate danger model. Additionally, the paper could benefit from a more extensive evaluation, including a comparison to other state-of-the-art methods and an analysis of the approach's performance in more complex domains. Finally, the paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the trade-offs between avoiding catastrophes and achieving high rewards.
Questions for the Authors
I would like to ask the authors to clarify the following points:
* Can you provide a more detailed motivation for the proposed approach, including a discussion of the limitations of traditional methods and the potential benefits of using a separate danger model?
* How do you plan to extend the approach to more complex domains, and what challenges do you anticipate in doing so?
* Can you provide a more thorough analysis of the trade-offs between avoiding catastrophes and achieving high rewards, including a discussion of the potential costs and benefits of using the proposed approach?
