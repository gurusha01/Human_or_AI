Summary
The paper proposes a novel framework for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) called Frame-based convolutional networks, which extends the traditional pixel basis to a more general notion of frames. This allows for non-orthogonal, overcomplete, and steerable feature spaces, enabling the network to learn more expressive and robust representations. The authors also introduce Dynamic Steerable Frame Networks (DSFNs), which combine the strengths of Dynamic Filter Networks and Spatial Transformer Networks, allowing for locally adaptive filtering with geometrical constraints.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the paper lacks a thorough comparison with state-of-the-art k-shot learning methods, such as Matching Networks, which makes it difficult to assess the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Secondly, the experimental setting for k-shot learning is not well-detailed, requiring more information for clarity and reproducibility.
Supporting Arguments
The paper presents an interesting idea with encouraging results, but the lack of comparison with existing methods and the limited experimental details hinder a thorough evaluation of the approach. Additionally, the use of accuracy difference for comparison is questionable, and raw accuracies would be a more suitable metric. The paper is also marred by numerous grammatical errors and formatting issues, particularly with citations, which need correction for publication readiness.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, the authors should provide a more comprehensive comparison with state-of-the-art k-shot learning methods and include more detailed experimental settings. They should also consider using raw accuracies as a metric for comparison and address the grammatical errors and formatting issues. Furthermore, the authors could benefit from providing more visualizations and examples to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper and provide additional evidence, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
1. How do the authors plan to address the lack of comparison with state-of-the-art k-shot learning methods?
2. Can the authors provide more detailed experimental settings for k-shot learning, including the specific datasets and evaluation metrics used?
3. How do the authors intend to address the grammatical errors and formatting issues in the paper?
