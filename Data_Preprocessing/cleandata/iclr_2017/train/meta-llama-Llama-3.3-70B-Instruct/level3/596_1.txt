Summary
The paper proposes a novel pruning method called NoiseOut, which reduces the number of parameters in neural networks by removing neurons with correlated activations during training. The approach introduces noise outputs to the network, which encourages higher correlation between neurons, making pruning more efficient. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of NoiseOut on various networks and datasets, achieving significant compression rates without loss of accuracy.

Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more qualitative analysis to understand why the proposed approach is effective for neural network pruning. Additionally, the introduction section could be improved to better motivate the use of noise outputs and clarify the function of the search controller. Some questions that I would like the authors to answer include: How does the choice of noise distribution affect the pruning process? Can the authors provide more insights into the relationship between Dropout, regularization, and NoiseOut? How does NoiseOut compare to other state-of-the-art pruning methods?
