Summary
The paper proposes a novel neural network pruning method, NoiseOut, which removes highly correlated neurons to reduce the number of parameters in dense layers. The authors also introduce a technique to encourage correlation between neurons by adding noise outputs to the network. The method is tested on various networks and datasets, demonstrating significant compression rates without loss of accuracy.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, primarily due to two key reasons. Firstly, the paper lacks thorough research and justification for the proposed pruning method, particularly in terms of theoretical proofs and experimental results. Secondly, the experimental results are unconvincing due to inconsistencies between figures and tables, and the lack of reported accuracy degradation while pruning.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's theoretical proofs rely on unreasonable assumptions and do not match the experimental conditions, failing to explain the effect of noise injection on correlated neurons. Furthermore, the experimental results are not convincing, with inconsistencies between figures and tables, and the lack of reported accuracy degradation while pruning raises concerns about the method's effectiveness. Additionally, the paper's comparison to other pruning methods is limited, and the authors do not provide a clear analysis of the computational cost and memory usage of the proposed method.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, the authors should provide more rigorous theoretical proofs and experimental results to support their claims. They should also address the inconsistencies in their results and provide a more detailed analysis of the computational cost and memory usage of the proposed method. Furthermore, the authors should consider comparing their method to other state-of-the-art pruning techniques and provide a more thorough discussion of the limitations and potential applications of their approach.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper and provide additional evidence, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
1. Can you provide more detailed theoretical proofs for the proposed pruning method, particularly in terms of the effect of noise injection on correlated neurons?
2. How do you explain the inconsistencies between figures and tables in the experimental results, and can you provide more detailed results to support your claims?
3. Can you provide a more detailed analysis of the computational cost and memory usage of the proposed method, and how it compares to other pruning techniques?
