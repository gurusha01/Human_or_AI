This paper proposes a novel learning framework for solving inverse problems, which abandons the traditional separation between model and inference. The authors introduce Recurrent Inference Machines (RIMs), a class of recurrent neural networks that directly learn to solve inverse problems. The framework is demonstrated to be effective in various image reconstruction tasks, including denoising and super-resolution.
The paper claims to contribute a new paradigm for solving inverse problems, which bridges the gap between deep learning and inverse problems. The authors argue that the traditional separation between model and inference is not necessary and that learning both components jointly can lead to better performance.
I decide to accept this paper with the key reason being that the approach is well-motivated and the results are impressive. The paper is well-written and technically rich, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the proposed framework.
The approach is well-motivated because it addresses a fundamental problem in inverse problems, which is the separation between model and inference. The authors argue that this separation is not necessary and that learning both components jointly can lead to better performance. The results are impressive because the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in various image reconstruction tasks.
One potential concern is that the framework may not be scalable to more complex problems, but the authors provide some evidence that the framework can be applied to non-linear inverse problems. Additionally, the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the proposed framework, which makes it easy to follow and understand.
To improve the paper, I would suggest that the authors provide more details on the implementation of the framework, such as the choice of hyperparameters and the training procedure. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more results on the application of the framework to other inverse problems, such as medical imaging and radio astronomy.
I would like to ask the authors to clarify the following points:
* How do the authors choose the hyperparameters for the framework, such as the number of layers and the learning rate?
* How do the authors train the framework, and what is the computational cost of training?
* Can the authors provide more results on the application of the framework to other inverse problems, such as medical imaging and radio astronomy?
* How does the framework compare to other deep learning-based methods for solving inverse problems, such as variational autoencoders and generative adversarial networks?
