Summary of the Paper's Claims and Contributions
The paper proposes a novel method for regularizing Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) called zoneout, which stochastically preserves hidden units' activations. The authors claim that zoneout improves performance across tasks, outperforming many alternative regularizers, and achieving results competitive with state-of-the-art on several datasets. The paper also provides an empirical investigation of various RNN regularizers and explores the benefits of zoneout in combination with other regularizers.
Decision and Key Reasons
Based on the review, I decide to reject the paper. The two key reasons for this decision are:
1. Lack of technical depth and novelty: The paper's core idea is a natural extension of existing work, and the theoretical contribution is deemed obvious and not adding much depth to the paper.
2. Methodological concerns: The experiment in section 4.3.1 is not an accurate measure of the proposed method's effectiveness, and the sensitivity analysis in section 4.3.2 is considered thin and would benefit from a comparison with other approaches.
Supporting Arguments
The paper shows empirical performance improvement over baselines, but the lack of technical depth and novelty is a significant concern. The authors' claim that the core idea of batch normalization is to align the distribution of training data is also disputed, as the primary purpose of batch normalization is to control the scale of the gradient. The paper's theoretical contribution, as presented in Equation 2, is not convincing, and the novelty of the paper seems low.
Additional Feedback and Suggestions
To improve the paper, the authors could provide a more detailed analysis of the effect of zoneout on the gradient flow and explore the benefits of zoneout in combination with other regularizers. Additionally, the authors could compare zoneout with other approaches, such as stochastic depth and recurrent dropout, and provide a more thorough sensitivity analysis.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper and provide additional evidence, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
1. Can you provide more insight into the theoretical contribution of zoneout and how it differs from existing work?
2. How do you respond to the criticism that the experiment in section 4.3.1 is not an accurate measure of the proposed method's effectiveness?
3. Can you provide more details on the sensitivity analysis in section 4.3.2 and how it was conducted?
