Summary
The paper proposes a novel neural network architecture called FractalNet, which is based on a self-similar design principle. The authors argue that this architecture can match the performance of residual networks (ResNets) on image classification tasks without relying on residual connections. The paper also introduces a regularization technique called drop-path, which prevents co-adaptation of parallel paths in the network. The authors provide experimental results on CIFAR, SVHN, and ImageNet datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of FractalNet and drop-path.
Decision
I decide to accept this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the paper tackles a specific and important problem in deep learning, namely the design of ultra-deep neural networks. Secondly, the approach is well-motivated and supported by experimental results, which demonstrate the effectiveness of FractalNet and drop-path.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a clear and well-structured presentation of the FractalNet architecture and the drop-path regularization technique. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the related work and demonstrate how FractalNet can match the performance of ResNets on image classification tasks. The experimental results are convincing, and the authors provide a detailed discussion of the results and their implications.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more insights into the theoretical foundations of FractalNet and drop-path. Additionally, it would be helpful to see more experiments on other datasets and tasks to further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. I would also like to see a more detailed comparison with other state-of-the-art methods, such as DenseNets and Wide ResNets.
Questions for the Authors
I would like to ask the authors to clarify the following points:
* Can you provide more insights into the theoretical foundations of FractalNet and drop-path?
* How do you plan to extend the FractalNet architecture to other tasks and domains?
* Can you provide more experiments on other datasets and tasks to further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach?
* How does the drop-path regularization technique compare to other regularization techniques, such as dropout and stochastic depth?
