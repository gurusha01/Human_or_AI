Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper proposes a novel approach to pruning convolutional neural networks (CNNs) by iteratively removing the least important feature maps based on a Taylor expansion-based criterion. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on various tasks, including transfer learning and large-scale image classification. The paper also provides a thorough analysis of the proposed criterion, including its relation to other pruning methods and its performance compared to random pruning.
Decision and Reasons
Based on the provided guidelines, I decide to Reject the paper. The main reasons for this decision are:
1. Lack of comparison with other external memory-based approaches: The paper does not provide a thorough comparison with other pruning methods, which makes it difficult to assess the novelty and significance of the proposed approach.
2. Weak experimental setups: The paper focuses on artificial tasks with moderate sequence length increases, which may not be representative of real-world scenarios. Additionally, the experimental evaluation could be more comprehensive, including more datasets and tasks.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's main contribution is the proposal of a novel pruning criterion based on Taylor expansion. While the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on various tasks, the lack of comparison with other pruning methods and the limited experimental evaluation raise concerns about the paper's significance and impact. Furthermore, the paper's focus on transfer learning and large-scale image classification may not be representative of other applications, such as natural language processing or reinforcement learning.
Additional Feedback and Questions
To improve the paper, I suggest the following:
1. Provide a more comprehensive comparison with other pruning methods, including a discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.
2. Conduct more extensive experimental evaluations, including more datasets and tasks, to demonstrate the robustness and generalizability of the proposed approach.
3. Investigate the applicability of the proposed approach to other domains, such as natural language processing or reinforcement learning.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper are:
1. How does the proposed pruning criterion relate to other pruning methods, such as Optimal Brain Damage or Optimal Brain Surgeon?
2. Can the authors provide more details on the experimental setups and the datasets used in the evaluation?
3. How do the authors plan to address the potential limitations of their approach, such as the reliance on transfer learning and the limited experimental evaluation?
