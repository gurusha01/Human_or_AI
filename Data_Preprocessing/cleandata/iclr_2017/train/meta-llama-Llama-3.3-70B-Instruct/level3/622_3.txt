Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper presents a systematic study on network morphism, a learning scheme that enables the transformation of a well-trained neural network into a new one with preserved knowledge. The authors investigate network morphism at a higher level, focusing on the morphing of convolutional layers into arbitrary modules. They introduce a graph-based representation for modular networks and formulate the network morphism process as a graph transformation problem. The paper proposes algorithms for simple morphable modules and complex modules, demonstrating that a convolutional layer can be morphed into any module. The authors also provide extensive experimental results on benchmark datasets, showing that the proposed morphing approach can achieve significant performance improvements with minimal extra computational cost.
Decision and Key Reasons
Based on the evaluation of the paper, I decide to Reject the paper. The two key reasons for this decision are:
1. Difficulty in following the paper due to heavy notation and overloading: The paper's notation and terminology are overly complex, making it challenging to understand some of the proofs, such as the proof of Lemma 2.
2. Unclear applicability of the analysis to traditional ResNet structures: The ResNet structure used in the paper is unconventional, with multiple layers being skipped, and it is unclear if the analysis applies to traditional ResNet structures with only one layer skipped.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's contribution to the field of network morphism is significant, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of the problem. However, the paper's complexity and lack of clarity in some sections hinder its overall impact. The experimental results are impressive, but the unclear applicability of the analysis to traditional ResNet structures raises concerns about the paper's generality.
Additional Feedback and Questions
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors:
* Simplify the notation and terminology to make the paper more accessible to readers.
* Clarify the applicability of the analysis to traditional ResNet structures.
* Provide more intuitive explanations of the graph-based representation and the network morphism process.
I would like the authors to answer the following questions to clarify my understanding of the paper:
* Can you provide a more detailed explanation of the proof of Lemma 2 and how it relates to the overall analysis?
* How do you plan to address the issue of unclear applicability of the analysis to traditional ResNet structures?
* Can you provide more insights into the experimental results and how they relate to the theoretical analysis?
