Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper explores the possibility of learning chess game concepts under weak supervision with convolutional neural networks. The authors propose a novel approach to learn interpretable hierarchical template representations from given data, specifically illustrating the approach on binary images of tic-tac-toe chessboards. They demonstrate that a CNN can automatically figure out complicated game rule concepts, such as the concept of a chessboard grid, the winning rule, and the concept of two sides, without being explicitly told. The paper also shows that cross-modal supervision for representation learning is still applicable in this case of higher-level semantics and that the technique of class activation mapping (CAM) can activate at non-salient regions.
Decision and Reasons
I decide to reject this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the experimental results are limited to a simple game of tic-tac-toe and may not be easily extensible to more complex games or natural images. Secondly, the paper lacks a thorough comparison with existing techniques for extracting image representations, such as those based on grammars, which makes it difficult to judge the significance of the paper.
Supporting Arguments
The paper presents a new formulation for extracting hierarchical template representations, but the experimental evaluation is a major concern. The approach seems limited to binary images, and the authors should comment on potential extensions to more complex images. Additionally, the quality and clarity of the paper could be improved with more detailed descriptions and explanations of the techniques and derivations. The originality of the suggested idea is reasonable, but its application is currently limited to binary data.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, the authors could provide more detailed descriptions of the techniques and derivations, as well as a thorough comparison with existing techniques for extracting image representations. They could also consider extending the approach to more complex games or natural images to demonstrate its generality. Furthermore, the authors may want to mention existing techniques for extracting image representations, such as those based on grammars, for comparison and context.
Questions for the Authors
I would like to ask the authors to clarify the following points: (1) How do they plan to extend the approach to more complex games or natural images? (2) Can they provide a more thorough comparison with existing techniques for extracting image representations? (3) How do they ensure that the learned representations are not simply a result of overfitting to the training data? (4) Can they provide more details on the implementation of the CAM technique and how it is used to visualize the learned representations?
