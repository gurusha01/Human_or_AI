This paper proposes a novel approach to simulating action-conditional dynamics, demonstrating its adaptability to various environments, including Atari games, 3D car racing, and mazes. The authors introduce an action-dependent state transition, which enables the model to incorporate action information more effectively, and a prediction-independent simulator that reduces computational burden. The paper provides an in-depth analysis of the factors affecting performance, including the interplay between warm-up length, prediction length, and the number of prediction-dependent transitions.
I decide to Accept this paper, with the primary reason being that it presents a well-motivated and well-placed approach in the literature, addressing the challenges of simulating complex environments. The paper's contributions, including the introduction of action-dependent state transitions and prediction-independent simulators, are notable and demonstrate a clear understanding of the problem domain.
The paper supports its claims through extensive experimental results, showcasing the model's ability to predict long-term dynamics in various environments. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the factors affecting performance, including the trade-off between short-term and long-term accuracy. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach is competitive with existing methods and can be used for model-based exploration.
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more insight into the limitations of their approach, particularly in terms of its sensitivity to different training approaches and the potential for overfitting to the training policy. Additionally, the authors could explore more sophisticated model architectures that can better capture the compositional structure of complex environments.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper include:
1. How do the authors plan to address the issue of oversampling certain regions of the state space and undersampling others, which can lead to biases in the data and affect the model's ability to learn the environment dynamics correctly?
2. Can the authors provide more details on the implementation of the prediction-independent simulator, including the specific architecture and training scheme used?
3. How do the authors envision extending their approach to more generative temporal models that can handle noisy state transitions, which is a common challenge in real-world environments?
