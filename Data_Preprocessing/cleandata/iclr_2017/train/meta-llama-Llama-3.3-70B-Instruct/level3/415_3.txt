The paper proposes a novel approach to network quantization, which is a crucial technique for reducing the memory footprint of deep neural networks. The authors introduce a regularization cost to achieve de-correlation among weight features in a layer, encouraging orthogonality, and demonstrate its effectiveness in improving generalization, especially when dealing with a large number of trainable parameters and limited training data.
The approach is well-motivated, building upon previous works that highlight the importance of orthogonal weight features in deep neural networks. The authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the problem, the proposed solution, and its theoretical foundations. The use of Hessian-weighted k-means clustering and entropy-constrained scalar quantization (ECSQ) are innovative and well-justified.
The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, achieving significant compression ratios with minimal performance loss. The comparison with existing methods, such as k-means clustering, highlights the advantages of the proposed approach.
