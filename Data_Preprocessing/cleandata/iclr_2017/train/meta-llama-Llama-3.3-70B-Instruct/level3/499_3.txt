The paper proposes a novel approach to network quantization, which is a crucial technique for reducing the memory footprint of deep neural networks. The authors introduce Hessian-weighted k-means clustering, a method that takes into account the importance of each network parameter when quantizing, and demonstrate its effectiveness in minimizing performance loss due to quantization. Additionally, they establish a connection between network quantization and entropy-constrained scalar quantization (ECSQ), allowing for the development of two efficient heuristic solutions: uniform quantization and an iterative algorithm for ECSQ.
I decide to reject this paper, primarily due to its excessive length and lack of clarity. The paper is too long for the conference format, and the goals of achieving better performance or more compact networks are not clearly defined. Furthermore, the relation between multiplicative RNNs and their generic tensor product predecessor is not adequately discussed in the related work section.
To improve the paper, I suggest making it shorter and clearer, possibly by leaving the CNN results for later publication and focusing on the RNN aspect. The authors should also provide more context and explanation for the optimization problem involved in training multiplicative RNNs and compare their approach to alternative strategies like model compression or hashed networks. Some discussions and figures are unclear and should be eliminated to make the experimental setup and results presentation more transparent.
I would like the authors to answer the following questions to clarify my understanding of the paper: (1) Can you provide more insight into the optimization problem involved in training multiplicative RNNs and how it relates to the proposed Hessian-weighted k-means clustering method? (2) How do the results on handwriting generation and machine translation experiments compare to other methods, and what are the implications of these results? (3) Can you elaborate on the connection between network quantization and ECSQ, and how this connection enables the development of the proposed heuristic solutions? 
By addressing these questions and revising the paper to improve clarity and focus, the authors can strengthen their contribution and provide a more compelling argument for the effectiveness of their approach.
