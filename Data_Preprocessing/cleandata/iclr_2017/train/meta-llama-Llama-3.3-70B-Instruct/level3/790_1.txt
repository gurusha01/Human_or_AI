This paper proposes a novel approach to learning secure communication protocols using neural networks. The authors introduce a modified GAN architecture with "encrypt" and "decrypt" modules, allowing for secure communication between two parties, Alice and Bob, while preventing a third party, Eve, from intercepting the message. The approach enables partial signal encryption, where some data remains unencrypted, and the encrypted portion is protected from Eve's prediction.
The paper tackles the specific question of whether neural networks can learn to use secret keys to protect information from other neural networks. The approach is well-motivated, building on the concept of adversarial training and generative adversarial networks (GANs). The authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of their methodology, including the neural network architecture, training objectives, and experimental results.
However, I decide to reject this paper due to two key reasons. Firstly, the approach faces significant barriers to practical impact due to the instability of GANs and the lack of reliable guarantees for data transmission safety. The authors acknowledge that training with an adversary is often unstable, and the success rate of their experiments is relatively low. Secondly, the existence of readily available and computationally feasible public key encryption systems, which have been successfully applied in various areas, raises questions about the practicality of the proposed approach.
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more rigorous theoretical guarantees for the security of their approach and explore ways to stabilize the training process. Additionally, they could investigate the application of their approach to specific real-world scenarios, such as secure multi-party computation or privacy-preserving data analysis.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper include: (1) How do the authors plan to address the instability of GANs and improve the success rate of their experiments? (2) Can they provide more detailed analysis of the encryption method learned by the neural networks, and how it compares to existing cryptographic algorithms? (3) How do the authors envision their approach being applied in practice, and what are the potential benefits and limitations compared to existing public key encryption systems?
