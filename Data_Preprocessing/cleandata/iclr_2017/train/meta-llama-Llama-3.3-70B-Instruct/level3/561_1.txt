Summary
The paper proposes a method for constructing a visual hierarchy of ImageNet classes using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and investigates two metrics for measuring inter-class similarity. The authors claim two contributions: constructing a biology evolutionary tree and providing insight into representations produced by deep networks. The paper attempts to leverage the advantage of deep networks to construct a tree of life, which is an interesting and ambitious goal.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the method for constructing the hierarchy is based on visual similarity, not biological evolution, which fails to deliver on the claim of constructing a biology evolutionary tree. Secondly, the exploration of representations produced by deep networks lacks technical depth and does not provide significant conclusions beyond the ability of CNNs to group categories by visual similarities.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's approach is not well-motivated, as it relies on visual similarity rather than biological evolution to construct the tree of life. The authors fail to provide quantitative experiments to support their claims, and the results are not scientifically rigorous. The paper's contributions are also limited, as the method for constructing the hierarchy is not novel, and the insights into representations produced by deep networks are not significant.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, the authors should provide a clearer motivation for their approach and a more detailed explanation of how their method relates to biological evolution. They should also conduct more rigorous experiments to support their claims and provide more significant insights into representations produced by deep networks. Additionally, the authors should consider using more advanced techniques, such as phylogenetic analysis, to construct the tree of life.
Questions for the Authors
I would like the authors to answer the following questions to clarify my understanding of the paper and provide additional evidence to support their claims:
1. How do the authors plan to address the limitation of their method being based on visual similarity rather than biological evolution?
2. Can the authors provide more detailed experiments to support their claims, such as comparing their method to other approaches for constructing phylogenetic trees?
3. How do the authors plan to provide more significant insights into representations produced by deep networks, such as analyzing the features learned by the CNNs?
