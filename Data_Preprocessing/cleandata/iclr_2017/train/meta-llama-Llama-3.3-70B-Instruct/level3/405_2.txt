This paper proposes a modification to the model architecture by incorporating action information directly into the state transitions, which is a minor technical novelty. The paper also explores the idea of jumpy predictions, where intermediate frames are omitted while predicting future frames, but its significance is not clearly demonstrated. The authors analyze different training schemes, which is an interesting observation, but the contribution of the proposed training scheme is not clear, as similar effects have been explored in other works.
The clarity of presentation is lacking, with some experimental setups not clearly stated, and some figures are difficult to interpret, making it hard to understand the results and contributions of the paper. The overall technical novelty and contribution of the proposed architecture and training scheme are not clear, and the paper presents some interesting experimental observations, but its significance and impact are not well demonstrated.
Based on the conference guidelines, I will answer the three key questions:
1. What is the specific question/problem tackled by the paper?
The paper aims to improve environment simulators by introducing recurrent neural networks that can make temporally and spatially coherent predictions for hundreds of time-steps into the future.
2. Is the approach well motivated, including being well-placed in the literature?
The approach is motivated by the need for environment simulation in various fields, including psychology, neuroscience, and reinforcement learning. However, the technical novelty of the proposed architecture and training scheme is minor, and the paper does not clearly demonstrate its significance.
3. Does the paper support the claims?
The paper presents some interesting experimental observations, but the results are not always clear, and the claims are not well-supported. The paper lacks a clear and concise presentation of the results, making it hard to understand the contributions of the paper.
Based on these questions, I decide to reject the paper. The main reasons for this decision are the lack of technical novelty, unclear presentation, and insufficient support for the claims.
To improve the paper, I suggest the following:
* Clearly state the technical novelty and significance of the proposed architecture and training scheme.
* Improve the presentation of the results, including clear and concise figures and tables.
* Provide more support for the claims, including additional experiments and analysis.
* Clarify the experimental setups and provide more details about the training schemes and hyperparameters.
I would like the authors to answer the following questions to clarify my understanding of the paper and provide additional evidence:
* Can you provide more details about the technical novelty of the proposed architecture and training scheme?
* How do you respond to the criticism that the paper lacks clear and concise presentation of the results?
* Can you provide additional experiments and analysis to support the claims made in the paper?
