Summary
The paper proposes a novel approach to handwriting generation using a physiologically plausible model of handwriting, known as the Sigma Lognormal model. The authors preprocess the input data to extract virtual targets and dynamic parameters, which are then used to train Recurrent Mixture Density Networks (RMDNs) to predict the next virtual target and dynamic parameters. The system is able to generate handwriting trajectories that capture the statistical and dynamic qualities of handwriting, and can be used for tasks such as style transfer and one-shot learning.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the paper's experimental evaluation is limited to a simplistic dataset, which fails to demonstrate the approach's scalability to more complex tasks. Secondly, the paper's neural network architecture is overly complex and confusing, which makes it difficult to understand and evaluate the approach's effectiveness.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's experimental evaluation is limited to the IAM online handwriting database, which is a relatively simple dataset. The authors do not provide any results on more complex datasets, such as those used in deep reinforcement learning papers. This makes it difficult to evaluate the approach's scalability and effectiveness in more challenging scenarios. Additionally, the paper's neural network architecture is complex and confusing, with multiple models and hyperparameters that are not clearly explained. This makes it difficult to understand how the approach works and how it can be improved.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, I would suggest the following: (1) evaluate the approach on more complex datasets to demonstrate its scalability; (2) simplify the neural network architecture and provide clear explanations of how it works; and (3) provide more detailed results and analysis of the approach's effectiveness. Additionally, I would like to see more discussion on the potential applications of the approach and how it can be used in real-world scenarios.
Questions for the Authors
I would like to ask the authors the following questions: (1) Can you provide more details on how the Sigma Lognormal model is used to preprocess the input data? (2) How do you select the hyperparameters for the RMDNs, and what is the effect of different hyperparameters on the approach's performance? (3) Can you provide more results and analysis on the approach's effectiveness in different scenarios, such as style transfer and one-shot learning?
