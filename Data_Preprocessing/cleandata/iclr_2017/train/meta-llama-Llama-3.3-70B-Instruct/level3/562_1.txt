Summary
The paper proposes an approach to sequence learning called Incremental Sequence Learning (ISL), which involves training a network on the first few steps of each sequence and gradually increasing the length of the sequences used for training. The authors demonstrate that ISL can significantly improve sequence learning performance, reducing the test error by 74% and achieving a 20-fold speedup in computation time compared to regular sequence learning. The paper also explores the origins of this performance improvement and finds that it is due to the ability of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to build up internal representations of the sequences.
Decision
I decide to accept this paper, with two key reasons for this choice: (1) the paper proposes a simple and effective approach to sequence learning that can be widely applicable, and (2) the authors provide a thorough analysis of the origins of the performance improvement, which sheds light on the importance of internal representations in sequence learning.
Supporting Arguments
The paper is well-motivated, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the problem and the proposed approach. The experimental results are convincing, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of the results, including comparisons with other approaches and ablation studies. The paper also provides a clear and concise explanation of the related work, which helps to situate the proposed approach in the context of existing research.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors consider providing more details on the implementation of the ISL approach, including the specific hyperparameters used and the computational resources required. Additionally, it would be helpful to see more examples of the generated sequences and a more detailed analysis of the classification results. Finally, I suggest that the authors consider exploring the applicability of the ISL approach to other sequence learning tasks, such as language modeling or speech recognition.
Questions for the Authors
I would like to ask the authors to clarify the following points: (1) How did they choose the specific hyperparameters for the ISL approach, and what is the sensitivity of the results to these hyperparameters? (2) Can they provide more details on the computational resources required to train the models, and how this compares to other sequence learning approaches? (3) How do they plan to extend the ISL approach to other sequence learning tasks, and what are the potential challenges and limitations of this approach?
