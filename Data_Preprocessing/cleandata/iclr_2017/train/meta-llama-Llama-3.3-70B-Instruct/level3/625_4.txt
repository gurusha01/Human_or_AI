Summary
The paper presents a novel approach to generating handwriting sequences using a hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm. The algorithm learns to use pre-learned skills to achieve a list of sub-goals in a 2D maze domain. The paper combines state-of-the-art advancements in Deep Learning (DL) and DRL, including the use of differential temporally extended memory networks, attention mechanisms, analogy making, and parameter prediction.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the problem's interest and novelty are not clearly motivated, and the use of deep networks in a simple 2D maze domain is not well-motivated. Secondly, the paper's evaluation is more similar to supervised learning than reinforcement learning due to the use of pre-trained skills, and the demonstrated generalization is limited to breaking down sentences into words.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's approach is not well-placed in the literature, as it ignores relevant literature on planning with skills. The paper's dense and disorganized structure makes it difficult to read, with too many technical details interfering with the general understanding of the paper. Additionally, the paper's results are not scientifically rigorous, as the evaluation is limited to a simple 2D maze domain and does not demonstrate significant generalization.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, the authors should provide a clearer motivation for the problem and its novelty. They should also provide a more detailed comparison with relevant literature on planning with skills. Additionally, the authors should consider simplifying the paper's structure and reducing the number of technical details to make it easier to read. Finally, the authors should provide more rigorous evaluation of their approach, including demonstrations of generalization to more complex domains.
