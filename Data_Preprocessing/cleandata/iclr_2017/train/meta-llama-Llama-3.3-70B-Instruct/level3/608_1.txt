Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper proposes a novel method for regularizing Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) called zoneout, which stochastically preserves hidden units' activations. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of zoneout in improving performance across various tasks, including character-level and word-level language modeling on the Penn Treebank and Text8 datasets, and classification on the permuted sequential MNIST dataset. The paper also provides a thorough analysis of the benefits of zoneout, including its ability to introduce stochasticity and improve the flow of information forward and backward through the network.
Decision and Key Reasons
I decide to accept this paper, with the key reasons being: (1) the paper tackles a specific and well-motivated problem in the field of RNN regularization, and (2) the approach is well-supported by empirical results and analysis. The paper provides a clear and concise explanation of the zoneout method, and the experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in improving performance on various tasks.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a thorough analysis of the benefits of zoneout, including its ability to introduce stochasticity and improve the flow of information forward and backward through the network. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of zoneout in improving performance on various tasks, and the results are competitive with state-of-the-art methods. The paper also provides a clear and concise explanation of the zoneout method, making it easy to understand and implement.
Additional Feedback and Suggestions
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more analysis on the relationship between zoneout and other regularization methods, such as dropout and stochastic depth. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more experiments on the effect of zoneout on different types of RNNs, such as LSTMs and GRUs. The authors may also consider providing more details on the hyperparameter tuning process, and the effect of different zoneout probabilities on the performance of the model.
Questions for the Authors
I would like to ask the authors to clarify the following points: (1) How does zoneout compare to other regularization methods, such as dropout and stochastic depth, in terms of its ability to introduce stochasticity and improve the flow of information forward and backward through the network? (2) Can the authors provide more analysis on the effect of zoneout on different types of RNNs, such as LSTMs and GRUs? (3) How do the authors plan to extend the zoneout method to other types of neural networks, such as feedforward networks and convolutional neural networks?
