Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper proposes a novel framework for equipping Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with the ability to produce direct energy estimates for samples. The authors develop a flexible adversarial training framework that ensures the generator converges to the true data distribution while enabling the discriminator to retain density information at the global optimum. The paper derives the analytic form of the induced solution and analyzes its properties, providing a rigorous characterization of the learned discriminator in the non-parametric setting. The authors also propose two methods for instantiating the framework in the typical parametric setting, demonstrating the effectiveness of their approach through experiments on synthetic and real datasets.
