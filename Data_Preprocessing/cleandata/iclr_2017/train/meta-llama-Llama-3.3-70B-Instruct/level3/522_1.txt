This paper proposes a convergence analysis of two-layer neural networks with ReLUs, offering a novel perspective through its assumptions and focus on ReLU nonlinearity. The authors provide a detailed analysis of the nonlinear weight dynamics of two-layered bias-free networks and prove convergence to the optimal solution under certain conditions.
The paper tackles the specific question of how simple approaches like gradient descent can solve a complicated non-convex optimization effectively. The approach is well-motivated, as it uses a dynamical system to analyze the nonlinear gradient descent dynamics of certain two-layered nonlinear networks. The authors also provide a clear placement of their work in the literature, discussing the limitations of previous works and how their approach addresses these limitations.
The paper supports its claims through a detailed analysis of the nonlinear dynamics of the network. The authors derive novel and concise gradient update rules for multilayer ReLU networks and prove convergence to the optimal solution under certain conditions. The results are scientifically rigorous, and the authors provide a clear explanation of their methodology and proofs.
However, the paper is difficult to read due to numerous English mistakes and typos. The novelty and key insights of the paper are not well-motivated or presented, and the use of realistic assumptions is debatable. The paper's form is suboptimal in terms of writing and presentation, obscuring the clarity and relevance of its results.
Based on these reasons, I decide to reject this paper. The main reasons for this decision are the poor writing and presentation, as well as the lack of clear motivation and presentation of the novelty and key insights.
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors revise the writing and presentation to make it clearer and more concise. They should also provide a clearer motivation for their approach and highlight the key insights and contributions of their work. Additionally, the authors should address the limitations of their approach and provide more realistic assumptions.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper and provide additional evidence to support their claims include:
* Can the authors provide more intuition behind their approach and how it addresses the limitations of previous works?
* How do the authors plan to address the issue of poor writing and presentation in the paper?
* Can the authors provide more realistic assumptions and scenarios to demonstrate the applicability of their approach?
* How do the authors plan to extend their approach to more complex neural network architectures and larger datasets?
