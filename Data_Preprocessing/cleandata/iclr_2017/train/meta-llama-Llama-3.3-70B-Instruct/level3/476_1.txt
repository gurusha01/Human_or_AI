Summary
The paper proposes a novel method for finding dependent subspaces across multiple views of data, with a focus on preserving neighborhood relationships between data points. The approach directly maximizes the similarity of neighborhoods between views, using a well-defined objective function that takes into account the local dependencies between data points. The method is shown to outperform existing approaches, such as Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) and Locality Preserving CCA (LPCCA), on various datasets, including artificial and real-world data.
Decision
I decide to Accept this paper, with two key reasons: (1) the paper tackles a significant problem in data analysis, and (2) the approach is well-motivated and supported by solid experimental results.
Supporting Arguments
The paper addresses a crucial issue in data analysis, where finding relationships between multiple views of data is essential. The proposed method is well-motivated, as it directly focuses on the data relationships, rather than just maximizing simple correlations between data coordinates. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, showing that it outperforms existing methods on various datasets. Additionally, the paper provides a clear and well-written presentation of the method, making it easy to understand and follow.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors consider the following points: (1) provide more insights into the choice of the objective function and the optimization technique used, (2) discuss the potential limitations of the approach and possible extensions to non-linear transformations, and (3) consider applying the method to more challenging datasets, such as those with high-dimensional data or complex relationships between views.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions: (1) Can you provide more details on the choice of the parameter Îµ in the smoothed neighbor distribution (Equation 8)? (2) How do you plan to extend the approach to non-linear transformations, and what are the potential challenges and benefits of such an extension? (3) Have you considered applying the method to datasets with more than two views, and if so, what are the results and challenges encountered?
