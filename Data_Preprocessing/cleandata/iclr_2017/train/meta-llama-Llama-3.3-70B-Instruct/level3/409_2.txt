Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper proposes a novel approach to semi-supervised reinforcement learning (SSRL), which enables an agent to learn a policy that generalizes to unseen scenarios without requiring a reward function. The authors introduce the concept of semi-supervised skill generalization (S3G), which leverages unlabeled experiences to infer the reward function and improve the policy's generalization capabilities. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of S3G in various simulated control tasks, showcasing its ability to outperform traditional reinforcement learning methods and reward regression approaches.
