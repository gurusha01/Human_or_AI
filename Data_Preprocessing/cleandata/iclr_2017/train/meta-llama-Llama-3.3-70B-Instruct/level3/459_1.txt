Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper proposes a framework for sequence-to-sequence transduction using a noisy channel model, which decomposes the transduction problem into a source model and a channel model. The source model is trained on unpaired output data, while the channel model is trained on paired input-output data. The paper also introduces a latent alignment variable to enable the channel model to compute probabilities with incomplete conditioning contexts. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on three natural language processing tasks: abstractive sentence summarization, machine translation, and morphological inflection generation.
Decision
I decide to accept this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the paper tackles a specific and well-defined problem in sequence-to-sequence transduction, and proposes a novel and well-motivated approach to address it. Secondly, the paper provides a thorough and well-structured evaluation of the proposed approach, including experiments on multiple tasks and datasets, and comparisons with existing state-of-the-art models.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's approach is well-motivated by the need to exploit unpaired output data in sequence-to-sequence transduction tasks. The use of a noisy channel model and a latent alignment variable is a clever way to address the challenge of computing probabilities with incomplete conditioning contexts. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, particularly in tasks where unpaired output data is abundant. The paper also provides a clear and detailed description of the model and the experimental setup, making it easy to follow and replicate the results.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I would suggest providing more analysis and discussion on the limitations and potential extensions of the proposed approach. For example, the paper could explore the use of other types of models, such as attention-based models, or investigate the application of the approach to other sequence-to-sequence tasks. Additionally, the paper could provide more details on the computational resources and training time required for the experiments, to give a better sense of the practicality of the approach.
Questions for the Authors
I would like to ask the authors to clarify the following points:
* How do the authors plan to extend the approach to other sequence-to-sequence tasks, such as dialogue generation or text summarization?
* Can the authors provide more details on the training procedure and the hyperparameter tuning process for the experiments?
* How do the authors think the proposed approach could be used in combination with other techniques, such as data augmentation or transfer learning, to further improve the results?
