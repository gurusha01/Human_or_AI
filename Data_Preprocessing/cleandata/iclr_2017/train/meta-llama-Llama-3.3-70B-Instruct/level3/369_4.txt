Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper presents a novel approach to neural architecture search, leveraging a recurrent neural network (RNN) as a controller to generate model descriptions of neural networks. The controller is trained using reinforcement learning to maximize the expected accuracy of the generated architectures on a validation set. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on two challenging benchmarks: CIFAR-10 for image classification and Penn Treebank for language modeling. The results show that the proposed method can design novel architectures that rival or outperform state-of-the-art models, including those designed by humans.
Decision and Key Reasons
I decide to accept this paper, with two key reasons:
1. The paper tackles a specific and important problem in the field of deep learning, namely, the automated design of neural network architectures.
2. The approach is well-motivated, and the results demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods, including state-of-the-art models.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a clear and well-structured presentation of the proposed approach, including the formulation of the problem, the design of the controller RNN, and the training procedure using reinforcement learning. The authors also provide a thorough analysis of the results, including comparisons with existing methods and ablation studies to understand the contributions of different components of the approach.
Additional Feedback and Questions
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the computational resources required to train the controller RNN and the child networks. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more analysis on the robustness of the proposed approach to different hyperparameter settings and the sensitivity of the results to the choice of the reward function.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer:
* How do the authors plan to extend the proposed approach to more complex tasks, such as multi-task learning or transfer learning?
* Can the authors provide more insights into the learned architectures, such as the types of layers and connections that are preferred by the controller RNN?
* How does the proposed approach compare to other automated machine learning methods, such as Bayesian optimization or gradient-based optimization?
