The paper proposes a novel approach to few-shot classification by introducing an improved version of matching networks with better scalability properties. The technique combines episodic few-shot training with randomly-sampled partitions of the training set classes to closely match training and testing scenarios. The proposed technique achieves state-of-the-art results on several benchmark datasets, despite its straightforward idea and prior works on zero-shot and few-shot learning.
Based on the provided guidelines, I will evaluate the paper by answering the three key questions:
1. What is the specific question/problem tackled by the paper?
The paper tackles the problem of few-shot classification, specifically improving the scalability of matching networks.
2. Is the approach well motivated, including being well-placed in the literature?
The approach is well-motivated, as it builds upon existing work on few-shot learning and matching networks. The authors provide a clear explanation of the limitations of current approaches and how their technique addresses these limitations.
3. Does the paper support the claims?
The paper provides empirical evidence to support its claims, demonstrating state-of-the-art results on several benchmark datasets. However, the paper lacks a clear description of the training algorithm, which could be improved with the addition of pseudocode for better understanding.
Based on these evaluations, I decide to Accept the paper, with the main reason being its ability to achieve state-of-the-art results on several benchmark datasets. The paper provides a well-motivated approach to few-shot classification, and the empirical evidence supports the claims made by the authors.
To improve the paper, I suggest adding pseudocode for the training algorithm to provide a clearer understanding of the technique. Additionally, the authors could provide more details on the experimental setup and hyperparameter tuning to facilitate reproducibility.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper include:
* Can you provide more details on the experimental setup and hyperparameter tuning used to achieve the state-of-the-art results?
* How does the proposed technique handle cases where the support set is small or noisy?
* Are there any plans to extend the technique to other few-shot learning tasks, such as few-shot object detection or segmentation?
