Summary
The paper proposes a novel approach to constructing a tree of life for biological species using the deep representation of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained for image classification. The authors leverage the hierarchical feature representation learned by deep networks to quantify the visual similarity of species and construct a tree of life. The method is based on the intuition that if two species share similar features, their cross activations in the softmax layer should be high.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the paper lacks a thorough discussion and comparison with existing methods, such as ensembling, which has shown to produce gains in recent work. Secondly, the experiments have a confound due to the competitive learning architecture having more free parameters than the baseline, requiring comparison to ensembling or a baseline with larger hidden layers.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's approach, although novel, is not well-motivated in the context of existing literature. The authors do not provide a clear explanation of how their method differs from or improves upon existing methods. Additionally, the experiments are flawed due to the confound mentioned earlier, which makes it difficult to determine the true effectiveness of the proposed method.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, the authors should provide a more thorough discussion of the related work and compare their method to existing approaches. They should also address the confound in the experiments by comparing their method to a baseline with larger hidden layers or using ensembling. Furthermore, the authors should improve the formatting of the paper, including fixing the paragraph break in the abstract and providing explanations for variables in the Figure 1 caption.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper and provide additional evidence, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
1. How does the proposed method differ from existing methods, such as ensembling, and what are the advantages of using deep representation for constructing a tree of life?
2. Can the authors provide more details on the experiments, including the specific architectures used and the hyperparameters tuned, to address the confound mentioned earlier?
3. How do the authors plan to address the limitations of their method, such as the reliance on visual similarity, and explore other applications of deep learning in Bioinformatics?
