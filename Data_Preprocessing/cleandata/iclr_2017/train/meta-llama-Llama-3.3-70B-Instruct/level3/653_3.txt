Summary
The paper proposes a novel approach to generating image-like containers for steganography applications using Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN). The authors introduce a Steganographic Generative Adversarial Networks (SGAN) model, which consists of a generator network, a discriminator network, and a steganalyzer network. The SGAN model is trained to produce realistic images that can deceive a steganalyzer, and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can decrease the detection accuracy of a steganalysis method.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, with the main reason being that the experimental evaluation is limited in scope and data sets. While the paper presents some promising results, the experiments are conducted on a single dataset (Celebrities) and with a limited number of steganographic algorithms.
Supporting Arguments
The paper explores an interesting and relevant problem, and the theoretical part is well-written. However, the experimental evaluation is not comprehensive enough to support the claims made in the paper. The authors only test their approach on a single dataset and with a limited number of steganographic algorithms, which raises concerns about the generalizability of the results. Additionally, the paper could benefit from more comparisons with other state-of-the-art steganalysis methods and a more detailed analysis of the results.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors expand the experiments to include more datasets, architectures, and evaluation methods. For example, they could test their approach on other datasets, such as ImageNet or CIFAR-10, and compare their results with other state-of-the-art steganalysis methods. They could also experiment with different steganographic algorithms, such as WOW or S-UNIWARD, and analyze the results in more detail. Furthermore, the authors could provide more insights into the trade-off between the realism of the generated images and their quality as containers against steganalysis.
Questions
I would like the authors to answer the following questions to clarify my understanding of the paper and provide additional evidence to support their claims:
1. How do the authors plan to extend their approach to more advanced steganographic algorithms, such as WOW or S-UNIWARD?
2. Can the authors provide more details about the experimental setup, such as the hyperparameters used for training the SGAN model and the steganalyzer network?
3. How do the authors plan to address the issue of overfitting, which seems to be a problem in the current experimental setup?
