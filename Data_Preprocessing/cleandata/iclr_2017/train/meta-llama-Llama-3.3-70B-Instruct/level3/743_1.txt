Summary of the Paper's Claims and Contributions
The paper presents a variational approximation to the information bottleneck (IB) method, which is a technique for learning representations that are maximally informative about a target variable while being maximally compressive about the input data. The authors propose a deep variational information bottleneck (VIB) method, which uses a neural network to parameterize the IB model and leverages the reparameterization trick for efficient training. The paper claims that VIB outperforms other regularization methods in terms of generalization performance and robustness to adversarial attacks.
Decision and Key Reasons
Based on the review, I decide to Reject the paper. The two key reasons for this decision are:
1. Lack of Clarity: The paper is hard to read due to unclear language and notation. For example, the abstract refers to "input" without defining what it means, and the introduction introduces parameters like dimension N, epsilon, and ensemble E without sufficient explanation.
2. Limited Practical Applications: The discussion of exponential tailed halting time distributions may have limited practical applications, and the paper could benefit from comparing stochastic gradient descent, momentum, ADAM, and other optimization methods on different deep learning architectures to demonstrate the universality of the approach.
Supporting Arguments
The paper explores an interesting concept of universality in halting time distributions, but the actual stopping time might be more relevant than the scaled one. The authors' approach to using variational inference to construct a lower bound on the IB objective is novel, but the paper could benefit from more detailed explanations and justifications for the choices made. Additionally, the experimental results, while promising, are limited to a few datasets and could be more comprehensive.
Additional Feedback and Suggestions
To improve the paper, I suggest the following:
* Provide clearer explanations and definitions of key terms and notation.
* Consider comparing VIB to other optimization methods and architectures to demonstrate its universality.
* Provide more detailed justifications for the choices made in the variational inference approach.
* Consider adding more experimental results and analyzing the performance of VIB on a wider range of datasets.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
* Can you provide more detailed explanations of the notation and terminology used in the paper?
* How do you plan to address the limited practical applications of the exponential tailed halting time distributions?
* Can you provide more comprehensive experimental results and comparisons to other optimization methods and architectures?
