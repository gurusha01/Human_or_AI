Summary
The paper proposes a novel approach to understanding the behavior of deep neural networks by analyzing the preimages of activities at arbitrary levels. The authors demonstrate how to compute these preimages for fully connected multi-layer rectifier networks and show that they form piecewise linear manifolds in the input space. This provides a new perspective on how deep networks can efficiently approximate complex input distributions.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, primarily due to two key reasons. Firstly, the experiments fail to show significant improvement against baselines, which is a major drawback of the proposed method. Secondly, the approach lacks originality in some aspects, such as unrolling sparse coding inference as a feed-forward network, which has been explored before.
Supporting Arguments
While the paper provides a thorough analysis of the preimage concept and its implications for deep networks, the lack of empirical evidence supporting the claims is a significant limitation. The authors' failure to demonstrate improved performance over existing methods undermines the practical relevance of their approach. Furthermore, the fact that unrolling sparse coding inference as a feed-forward network is not a new concept reduces the novelty of the proposed method.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors focus on providing more convincing empirical evidence to support their claims. This could involve conducting more extensive experiments, exploring different architectures, and comparing their approach to state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, the authors could investigate the potential applications of their approach in real-world tasks, such as image classification, object detection, or segmentation.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper and provide additional evidence, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
1. Can you provide more details on the experimental setup and the baselines used for comparison?
2. How do you plan to address the lack of originality in some aspects of your approach?
3. Can you elaborate on the potential applications of your approach in real-world tasks and how it can be used to improve the efficiency of deep neural networks?
