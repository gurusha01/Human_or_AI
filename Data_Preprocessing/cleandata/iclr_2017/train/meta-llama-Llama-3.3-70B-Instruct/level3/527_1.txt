Summary of the Paper's Claims and Contributions
The paper proposes a novel recurrent neural network architecture called multiplicative LSTM (mLSTM), which combines the strengths of long short-term memory (LSTM) and multiplicative recurrent neural network (mRNN) architectures. The authors argue that mLSTM is better suited for sequence modeling tasks, particularly character-level language modeling, due to its ability to have flexible input-dependent transitions. The paper presents experimental results on several character-level language modeling tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of mLSTM in achieving competitive performance and outperforming standard LSTM and its deep variants.
Decision and Key Reasons
Based on the review, I decide to Reject the paper. The two key reasons for this decision are:
1. Lack of significant originality: The paper's contribution is weak, as similar work has already been done in previous studies. The proposed mLSTM architecture is mainly an application of existing ideas, and the paper does not provide sufficient new insights or breakthroughs.
2. Limited experimental results: Although the paper presents some encouraging experimental results, they are not sufficient to demonstrate the broader applicability of mLSTM. The results are limited to character-level language modeling tasks, and the paper does not provide enough evidence to support the claim that mLSTM can be applied to other areas.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's approach is well-motivated, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the mLSTM architecture and its potential benefits. However, the paper's scope is limited, and the experimental results are not comprehensive enough to support the claims made. The use of non-standard modifications to standard algorithms is also notable, which may limit the paper's impact and reproducibility.
Additional Feedback and Suggestions
To improve the paper, the authors could consider the following suggestions:
* Provide more comprehensive experimental results, including evaluations on other sequence modeling tasks and comparisons with state-of-the-art models.
* Discuss the potential limitations and challenges of the mLSTM architecture and provide more insights into its applicability to different areas.
* Consider adding more theoretical analysis or mathematical derivations to support the claims made about the mLSTM architecture.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper and provide additional evidence, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
* Can you provide more details about the hyperparameter tuning process and the sensitivity of the results to different hyperparameter settings?
* How do you plan to address the potential limitations of the mLSTM architecture, such as its increased computational complexity and potential overfitting issues?
* Can you provide more insights into the potential applications of the mLSTM architecture beyond character-level language modeling, and how it can be adapted to other sequence modeling tasks?
