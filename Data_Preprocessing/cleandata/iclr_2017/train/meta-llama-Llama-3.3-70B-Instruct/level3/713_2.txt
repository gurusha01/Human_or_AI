Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper introduces a novel approach to learning reward functions for robotic tasks using visual demonstrations. The method leverages pre-trained deep models to extract features from videos of humans performing tasks, and then uses these features to learn a reward function that can be used by a reinforcement learning algorithm to learn the task. The approach is able to learn complex robotic manipulation skills, such as door opening, from a few video demonstrations.
Decision to Accept
I decide to accept this paper with minor revisions. The paper presents a well-motivated and well-executed approach to learning reward functions for robotic tasks, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.
Supporting Arguments
The paper tackles a specific and important problem in reinforcement learning, namely the difficulty of designing reward functions for complex tasks. The approach is well-motivated by the need for efficient and scalable learning methods that can learn from small amounts of data. The use of pre-trained deep models to extract features from videos is a key insight, and the method for learning the reward function from these features is simple and effective. The results demonstrate the ability of the method to learn complex tasks, such as door opening, from a few video demonstrations.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the implementation of the PI2 reinforcement learning algorithm, and how it is used to learn the door opening skill. Additionally, it would be helpful to see more quantitative results, such as comparisons to other methods or ablation studies, to further demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.
Questions for the Authors
I would like to ask the authors to clarify the following points:
* How do the authors plan to extend the method to more complex tasks, such as tasks that require multiple steps or tasks that have varying levels of difficulty?
* How do the authors plan to handle cases where the demonstrations are noisy or incomplete?
* Can the authors provide more details on the feature selection algorithm used to select the most discriminative features from the pre-trained deep model?
