Summary
This paper proposes a novel approach to learning state representations in robots using deep neural networks and robotic priors. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach in learning a one-dimensional representation of a Baxter robot's head position from raw images. The paper contributes to the field of robotics and artificial intelligence by introducing a new method for unsupervised learning of state representations.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, primarily due to two key reasons. Firstly, the paper lacks clear motivation and demonstration of how each modality contributes to the task of learning state representations. Secondly, the connection between the proposed joint product embedding and residual networks is unclear and not well-motivated.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's approach to combining multiple modalities for product representation is effective, but it is not clear how each modality contributes to the task. The authors do not provide a thorough analysis of the importance of each modality, making it difficult to understand the significance of their approach. Additionally, the use of the term "embedding" to refer to the dot product of two items is unconventional and renders the output layer in Figure 2 pointless.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, the authors should focus on motivating their architectural choices and providing a more concise presentation of their approach. The paper is currently too long at 11 pages, and some sections, such as the related work section, could be shortened or removed. The authors should also provide more details on the experimental setup and the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of their approach.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper and provide additional evidence for my assessment, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
1. Can you provide more details on how each modality contributes to the task of learning state representations?
2. How do you plan to extend your approach to learn more complex representations, such as objects positions in three dimensions?
3. Can you provide more information on the experimental setup, including the simulation environment and the data collection process?
4. How do you plan to address the limitation of your approach, which is the assessment of the training quality, especially in situations where ground truth is unavailable?
