Summary of the Paper
The paper proposes a novel approach to sequence-to-sequence prediction tasks, specifically text summarization, by introducing a "Read-Again" model and a copy mechanism. The Read-Again model allows the encoder to read the input sequence twice, with the first read biasing the second read, enabling the encoder to capture the meaning of each word in the context of the entire sentence. The copy mechanism enables the decoder to generate out-of-vocabulary words by copying them from the input sequence, reducing the need for a large vocabulary size.
Decision
I decide to accept this paper, with two key reasons: (1) the approach is well-motivated and sound, addressing two significant shortcomings of current encoder-decoder models, and (2) the paper provides thorough experimental evaluations, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach on the Gigaword dataset and DUC competition, outperforming state-of-the-art models.
Supporting Arguments
The paper is well-structured, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the proposed approach, including the Read-Again model and the copy mechanism. The experimental evaluations are thorough, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in improving the performance of text summarization models. The paper also provides a detailed analysis of the importance weight visualization, which shows that the Read-Again model indeed extracts useful information from the first reading to help bias the second reading results.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest the authors provide more insights into the relationship between the Read-Again model and other attention-based models, such as the Transformer model. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more analysis on the copy mechanism, such as how it handles rare words and how it affects the overall performance of the model. The authors may also consider providing more examples of the visualization of the copy mechanism to demonstrate its effectiveness in generating out-of-vocabulary words.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like to ask the authors the following questions:
1. How do the authors plan to extend the Read-Again model to handle longer input sequences, such as documents or articles?
2. Can the authors provide more insights into the training process, such as how the model is initialized and how the hyperparameters are tuned?
3. How does the copy mechanism handle cases where the out-of-vocabulary word is not present in the input sequence?
