The paper proposes a novel loss framework for language modeling, which improves upon the conventional classification framework by utilizing the metric space of word embeddings to generate a more informed data distribution. The authors introduce two key improvements: (1) augmenting the cross-entropy loss with an additional term that minimizes the KL-divergence between the model's prediction and an estimated target distribution based on word embeddings, and (2) reusing the input embedding matrix in the output projection layer. The paper provides a thorough theoretical analysis and empirical validation of the proposed framework, demonstrating its effectiveness on the Penn Treebank and Wikitext-2 datasets.
Based on the provided guidelines, I will evaluate the paper as follows:
1. The specific question/problem tackled by the paper is the improvement of language modeling by utilizing the metric space of word embeddings to generate a more informed data distribution.
2. The approach is well-motivated, building upon existing work in language modeling and word embeddings, and is well-placed in the literature.
3. The paper supports its claims with thorough theoretical analysis and empirical validation, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed framework on two benchmark datasets.
