Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper proposes a novel approach to analyzing bioacoustic signals using a Bayesian non-parametric formulation of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), specifically the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process-HMM (HDP-HMM). This approach allows for the automatic identification of song units in bioacoustic signals without requiring prior knowledge of the number of states. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on two real-world bioacoustic datasets: humpback whale songs and multi-species bird songs.
Decision
Based on the review, I decide to Accept the paper with minor revisions. The paper presents a well-motivated approach to bioacoustic signal analysis, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. However, there are some areas that require clarification and additional analysis, which are discussed below.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's strengths include its well-motivated approach, novel application of HDP-HMM to bioacoustic signal analysis, and promising experimental results. The authors provide a clear explanation of the HDP-HMM model and its application to bioacoustic signal analysis. The experimental results demonstrate the ability of the proposed method to identify song units in bioacoustic signals, which is a significant contribution to the field of bioacoustics.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, I suggest the following:
1. Provide more analysis on the decoder's iterations and examples of local maxima.
2. Include ablation studies on attention modeling and reasoning types to further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
3. Report mean F1 scores for questions that converged in each iteration and performance on different types of reasoning.
4. Clarify the explanation of the Document and Question encoding matrix and correct any errors or inconsistencies.
5. Consider adding more related work on bioacoustic signal analysis and comparing the proposed approach to existing methods.
Questions for the Authors
1. Can you provide more details on the computational cost of the proposed method and its scalability to larger datasets?
2. How do you plan to address the issue of over-classification due to high degree of variability in vocal species repertoires?
3. Can you provide more examples of the application of the proposed method to other bioacoustic datasets and its potential impact on ecological monitoring and conservation of biodiversity?
