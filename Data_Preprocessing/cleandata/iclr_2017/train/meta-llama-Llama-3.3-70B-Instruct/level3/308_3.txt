This paper proposes a novel approach to question classification by utilizing answer information to improve question representation. The authors introduce Group Sparse Autoencoders (GSA) and Group Sparse Convolutional Neural Networks (GSCNNs) to encode group information from answer sets into question representations. The paper's strengths include its theoretical foundations, interesting use of concepts from analysis and differential topology, and proposals for avoiding instability in GANs.
The paper tackles the specific question of how to effectively utilize answer information to improve question classification performance. The approach is well-motivated, drawing on existing work in dictionary learning and sparse coding. The authors provide a clear and well-structured presentation of their methodology, including the introduction of GSA and GSCNNs.
The paper supports its claims with experimental results on four datasets, demonstrating significant improvements over strong baselines. The results are scientifically rigorous, with a clear description of the experimental setup and evaluation metrics.
However, the paper's length and technical nature may make it challenging for some readers to follow. Some parts of the paper, such as the discussion of the relationship between GSA and sparse coding, could be further developed.
To improve the paper, I suggest shortening certain sections, such as the introduction to basic autoencoders, and moving proofs to the appendix. Additionally, clarifying or correcting specific points in the text, such as theorem numbering and references, would enhance the paper's readability.
I would like the authors to answer the following questions to clarify my understanding of the paper:
1. Can you provide more details on how the group sparse constraint is enforced in GSCNNs, and how it affects the learning process?
2. How do you select the hyperparameters, such as the number of groups and the sparsity parameters, in GSA and GSCNNs?
3. Can you discuss the potential applications of GSA and GSCNNs beyond question classification, such as in other natural language processing tasks or computer vision?
Based on the paper's strengths and weaknesses, I decide to accept the paper, with the suggestion that the authors address the minor improvements mentioned above. The paper's contributions to the field of question classification and its potential impact on related areas make it a valuable addition to the conference program.
