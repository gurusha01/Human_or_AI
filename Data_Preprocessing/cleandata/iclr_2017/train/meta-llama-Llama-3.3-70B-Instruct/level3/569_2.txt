This paper presents a novel approach to one-shot learning using Attentive Recurrent Comparators (ARCs), which achieve strong experimental results on the Omniglot dataset, surpassing human performance. The authors propose a bottom-up design approach, where the model learns to estimate the similarity of a set of objects by cycling through them and making observations, conditioned on the observations made in all the other objects.
I decide to Accept this paper, with the primary reason being the impressive experimental results on the Omniglot dataset, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ARC model. The second reason is the well-motivated approach, which is grounded in the idea of early fusion of information across the entire context of the task, and the use of attention and recurrence to learn to focus on the salient aspects needed to ascertain similarity.
The paper provides a clear and detailed explanation of the ARC model, including the attention mechanism and the use of convolutional feature extractors. The experimental results are thorough and well-presented, with comparisons to strong baselines and state-of-the-art methods. The authors also provide a qualitative analysis of the model's behavior, which helps to understand how the model is making its predictions.
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more insights into the ablation study, to better understand the contribution of each component of the ARC model. Additionally, it would be helpful to see more results on other datasets, to demonstrate the generalizability of the proposed approach. I would like the authors to answer the following questions: (1) How do the authors plan to address the potential computational expense of the sequential execution of the recurrent core? (2) Can the authors provide more details on the hyperparameter tuning process, and how it affects the performance of the model? (3) How do the authors envision extending the ARC model to other modalities, such as natural language processing or speech recognition?
