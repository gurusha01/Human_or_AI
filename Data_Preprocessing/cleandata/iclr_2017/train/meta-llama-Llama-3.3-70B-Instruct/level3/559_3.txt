This paper proposes a novel approach to simplifying matching networks by utilizing a single prototype per class, which is obtained by averaging the embedding of training class samples. The authors report empirical comparisons with matching networks, demonstrating the effectiveness of their approach.
The idea of averaging prototypes is interesting, and the paper provides a good starting point for exploring this concept. However, there are some areas that require improvement. The discussion of related work is limited, and the authors should consider extending this section to include works on learning distance metrics for nearest neighbor classification, such as those by Weinberger et al. (2005) and Min et al. (2009).
The results section could be consolidated to better distinguish between outperformed and non-outperformed methods. Additionally, the accuracy of the reported results is questionable, and the authors should consider reporting better results of matching networks on certain tasks to provide a more comprehensive comparison.
To improve the paper, the authors should discuss related work more thoroughly and report prior empirical results in a less partial manner. This will help to provide a more balanced view of the proposed approach and its contributions to the field.
Based on the conference guidelines, I will answer the three key questions:
1. What is the specific question/problem tackled by the paper? 
The paper tackles the problem of simplifying matching networks by using a single prototype per class.
2. Is the approach well motivated, including being well-placed in the literature? 
The approach is partially motivated, but the discussion of related work is limited, and the authors should consider extending this section to include relevant works.
3. Does the paper support the claims? 
The paper provides some empirical evidence to support its claims, but the results section could be improved, and the accuracy of the reported results is questionable.
My decision is to reject the paper, with the main reason being the limited discussion of related work and the questionable accuracy of the reported results.
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors:
* Extend the related work section to include relevant works on learning distance metrics for nearest neighbor classification.
* Consolidate the results section to better distinguish between outperformed and non-outperformed methods.
* Report better results of matching networks on certain tasks to provide a more comprehensive comparison.
* Discuss related work more thoroughly and report prior empirical results in a less partial manner.
I would like the authors to answer the following questions to clarify my understanding of the paper:
* How do the authors plan to extend the related work section to include relevant works on learning distance metrics for nearest neighbor classification?
* Can the authors provide more details on the experimental setup and the datasets used to evaluate the proposed approach?
* How do the authors plan to improve the results section to provide a more comprehensive comparison with matching networks?
