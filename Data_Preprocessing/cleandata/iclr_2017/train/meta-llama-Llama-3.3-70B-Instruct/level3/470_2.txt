Summary of the Paper's Claims and Contributions
The paper proposes a novel approach to combining Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs) with the Stick-Breaking process, a Bayesian nonparametric prior, to tackle component collapsing and achieve stochastic dimensionality in representation. The authors introduce the Stick-Breaking Variational Autoencoder (SB-VAE), which uses the Kumaraswamy distribution as an approximate posterior to perform inference for the weights of the Stick-Breaking process. The paper claims that the SB-VAE learns highly discriminative latent representations that often outperform the Gaussian VAE's, and demonstrates this through experiments on various image datasets.
Decision and Key Reasons
I decide to reject this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, I argue that the claimed stochastic dimensionality of the latent variable is incorrect, as all latent variables are used but parametrized differently to give an impression of sparsity. Secondly, I question the comparison of component collapsing effects between the proposed model and the standard Gaussian prior, suggesting that the positive nature of Ï€ may lead to different behavior.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's approach to using latent variables is similar to the soft-gating mechanism used in LSTM or attentional models, without involving marginalization. This raises concerns about the true stochasticity of the latent variables. Furthermore, the addition of a histogram of latent variables could help clarify whether associated weights are large due to actual usage or zero inputs. The semi-supervised results are compared to a weaker version of a model from a previous paper, but a comparison to a stronger version, such as the M1+M2 model, would provide a fairer evaluation.
Additional Feedback and Questions
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more detailed explanations of the Kumaraswamy distribution and its relationship to the Beta distribution. Additionally, they should clarify the computational cost of assembling the stick segments and provide more experimental results to support their claims. I would like the authors to answer the following questions: (1) How do the authors respond to the criticism that the stochastic dimensionality of the latent variable is not truly stochastic? (2) Can the authors provide more insight into the behavior of the Stick-Breaking process and its relationship to the Gaussian prior? (3) How do the authors plan to extend their approach to full Dirichlet processes with non-trivial base measures?
