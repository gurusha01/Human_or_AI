Summary of the Paper
The authors propose a novel pedestrian detection method based on the Fast R-CNN framework, which utilizes batch normalization to reduce training time and improve generalization performance. They also employ the EdgeBoxes algorithm to generate high-quality region proposals, leading to improved detection speed and accuracy. The method is evaluated on two benchmark datasets, INRIA and ETH, and achieves satisfactory performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, primarily due to two reasons. Firstly, the results on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets are inconclusive, and the authors' claims about the effectiveness of their method are not fully supported. Secondly, the paper lacks a thorough analysis of the impact of batch normalization on the performance of the Fast R-CNN framework, which is a crucial component of the proposed method.
Supporting Arguments
The authors' use of batch normalization is motivated by the need to reduce internal covariate shift, but they do not provide a detailed analysis of how this technique affects the performance of the Fast R-CNN framework. Additionally, the results on the INRIA and ETH datasets, while promising, are not sufficient to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over existing state-of-the-art approaches. The authors also do not consider utilizing nearby samples from competing classes when applying interpolation or extrapolation-based augmentation, which could potentially improve the robustness of their method.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors apply the feature space augmentation idea directly to the classification model during training and explore its impact on convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures. They should also provide a more detailed analysis of the effect of batch normalization on the performance of the Fast R-CNN framework and consider utilizing nearby samples from competing classes to improve the robustness of their method. Furthermore, the authors should extend their experiments to more datasets, including MNIST and CIFAR-10, to demonstrate the generalizability of their approach.
Questions for the Authors
I would like the authors to clarify the following points:
1. How does the batch normalization layer affect the performance of the Fast R-CNN framework, and what are the benefits of using this technique in the context of pedestrian detection?
2. Why do the authors choose to use the EdgeBoxes algorithm for region proposal generation, and how does this algorithm compare to other state-of-the-art methods, such as Selective Search?
3. Can the authors provide more details on the experimental setup and hyperparameter tuning process, including the choice of learning rate, batch size, and number of iterations?
