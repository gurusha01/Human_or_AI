This paper presents a novel framework for learning activation functions in deep neural networks using a nonparametric approach. The authors propose a principled method for estimating activation functions via a Fourier basis expansion, which allows for the learning of arbitrary functions at each node in the network. The paper also provides a theoretical justification for the approach, demonstrating that the resulting networks generalize well.
The specific question tackled by the paper is how to learn activation functions in deep neural networks, which is a crucial aspect of neural network design. The approach is well-motivated, as it addresses a significant limitation of current deep learning methods, which typically rely on predefined activation functions. The paper is well-placed in the literature, building upon existing work on neural network architecture and activation functions.
The paper supports its claims through a combination of theoretical analysis and empirical experiments. The authors provide a detailed analysis of the properties of the proposed activation functions and demonstrate their effectiveness on several benchmark datasets, including MNIST and CIFAR-10. The results show that the proposed approach can achieve significant improvements in performance compared to traditional activation functions.
I decide to accept this paper, with the main reason being the novelty and potential impact of the proposed approach. The paper presents a well-motivated and well-executed study that addresses a significant challenge in deep learning.
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more detailed explanations of the theoretical analysis, particularly in the appendix. Additionally, it would be helpful to include more visualizations of the learned activation functions to provide a better understanding of their properties. Furthermore, the authors may want to consider exploring the application of their approach to other domains, such as natural language processing or computer vision, to demonstrate its broader applicability.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper include:
* Can you provide more insight into the choice of the Fourier basis expansion for the activation functions? How did you determine the optimal number of basis functions to use?
* How do the learned activation functions compare to traditional activation functions, such as ReLU or sigmoid, in terms of their properties and performance?
* Can you discuss the potential limitations of the proposed approach, such as the increased computational cost or the risk of overfitting, and how you addressed these challenges in your experiments?
