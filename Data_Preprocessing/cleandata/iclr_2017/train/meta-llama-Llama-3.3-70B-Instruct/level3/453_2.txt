This paper proposes a novel approach to analyzing the nonlinear dynamics of two-layered ReLU networks. The authors derive a close-form expression for the expected gradient of the loss function and use it to study the convergence of gradient descent. The paper provides a thorough analysis of the dynamics for both single and multiple ReLU nodes, and the results are supported by simulations.
The specific question tackled by the paper is how gradient descent converges in two-layered ReLU networks. The approach is well-motivated, as it fills a gap in the current understanding of deep learning by providing a theoretical analysis of the nonlinear dynamics of ReLU networks. The paper is also well-placed in the literature, as it builds upon existing work on the analysis of neural networks and provides new insights into the behavior of ReLU networks.
The paper supports its claims through a combination of theoretical analysis and simulations. The authors provide a detailed derivation of the expected gradient and use it to study the convergence of gradient descent. The simulations provide additional evidence for the convergence of gradient descent and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
Based on the analysis, I decide to accept this paper. The two key reasons for this choice are: (1) the paper provides a novel and thorough analysis of the nonlinear dynamics of two-layered ReLU networks, and (2) the results are supported by simulations and provide new insights into the behavior of ReLU networks.
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more discussion on the implications of their results for the design of neural networks. Additionally, it would be helpful to include more simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in different scenarios.
I would like the authors to answer the following questions to clarify my understanding of the paper: (1) Can the authors provide more intuition on why the expected gradient is a good approximation of the actual gradient? (2) How do the results of the paper relate to existing work on the analysis of neural networks? (3) Are there any potential limitations or extensions of the proposed approach that the authors have not discussed in the paper?
