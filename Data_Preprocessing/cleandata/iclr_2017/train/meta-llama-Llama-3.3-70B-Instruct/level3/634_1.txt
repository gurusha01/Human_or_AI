The paper proposes a novel approach called Differentiable Canonical Correlation Analysis (DCCA), which enables the computation of canonical correlation analysis as a fully differentiable neural network layer. This allows for parameter optimization via back-propagation through the CCA projection matrices. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in cross-modality retrieval experiments on two public image-to-text datasets, surpassing both Deep CCA and a multi-view network with freely-learned projections.
I decide to reject this paper, with the main reason being that the value of the proposed method is not clearly demonstrated, and the results are not compelling enough for a full ICLR paper. Specifically, the paper lacks experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of DCCA in mining diverse adversarial examples for training robust classifiers, and comparing it to existing methods like FGS.
The approach is well-motivated, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the background and related work. However, the paper does not provide sufficient details about the network architecture used, such as the number of layers and their internal structure, which makes it difficult to understand the results. Additionally, the application of DCCA to all layers, including the input and output layers, is not shown, which would reinforce the interpretation of the results and provide a more complete understanding.
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more detailed experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of DCCA, including comparisons to existing methods and evaluations on more datasets. Additionally, the authors should provide more details about the network architecture and the application of DCCA to all layers. I would also like to see more analysis on the learned representations and the correlation coefficients, to better understand the strengths and limitations of the proposed method.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer include: How does the proposed method compare to existing methods like FGS in terms of robustness and accuracy? Can the authors provide more details about the network architecture and the application of DCCA to all layers? How do the learned representations and correlation coefficients change when using different objectives and optimization strategies? What are the potential applications of the proposed method beyond cross-modality retrieval?
