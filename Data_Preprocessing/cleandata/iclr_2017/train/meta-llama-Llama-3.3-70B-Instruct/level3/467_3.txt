This paper proposes a novel approach to simulate action-conditional dynamics in various environments, including Atari games, 3D car racing, and mazes. The authors introduce an extension of GANs, called BiGAN, which includes an inference path and a discriminator operating on the joint latent/data space. The paper evaluates the performance of BiGAN on supervised tasks and provides an in-depth analysis of the factors affecting its performance.
The paper claims to contribute to the field by introducing a new approach to environment simulation, which can be used for model-based exploration and planning. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on several environments, including Atari games and 3D mazes, and show that it can be used for live human play.
I decide to accept this paper with one key reason being that it presents a well-motivated and well-placed approach in the literature. The authors provide a clear and concise overview of the related work and demonstrate a good understanding of the challenges and limitations of existing approaches.
The paper supports its claims with extensive experimental results, including comparisons with state-of-the-art methods and ablation studies. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the factors affecting the performance of their approach, including the impact of different training schemes and hyperparameters.
However, I have some concerns regarding the paper's clarity and organization. The paper is well-written, but some sections are dense and difficult to follow. Additionally, the authors could provide more details on the training process, such as learning rates and initialization, which would be helpful for reproducing the results.
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more context and background information on the problem of environment simulation and its applications. They could also consider adding more visualizations and illustrations to help readers understand the approach and its results. Furthermore, the authors could discuss the potential limitations and challenges of their approach and provide more insights into future directions for research.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper include:
* Can you provide more details on the architecture and training process of the BiGAN model?
* How do you handle the issue of mode collapse in the BiGAN model?
* Can you provide more insights into the choice of hyperparameters and training schemes used in the experiments?
* How do you plan to address the potential limitations and challenges of your approach in future work?
