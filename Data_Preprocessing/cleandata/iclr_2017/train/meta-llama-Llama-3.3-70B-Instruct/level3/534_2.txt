Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper proposes a simple warm restart technique for stochastic gradient descent (SGD) to improve its anytime performance when training deep neural networks. The authors introduce a cosine annealing schedule for the learning rate, which is reset to its initial value at each restart. They demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach, called SGDR, on several datasets, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and a downsampled version of ImageNet. The results show that SGDR achieves competitive or even better results than the current state-of-the-art methods, while requiring fewer epochs.
Decision and Reasons
I decide to accept this paper, with two key reasons for this choice:
1. Novelty and significance: The paper proposes a new and simple technique for improving the anytime performance of SGD, which is a widely used optimization algorithm in deep learning. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of SGDR on several datasets, making it a significant contribution to the field.
2. Empirical evaluation: The paper provides a thorough empirical evaluation of SGDR on several datasets, including comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods. The results are well-presented and demonstrate the advantages of SGDR.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a clear and well-motivated introduction to the problem of optimizing deep neural networks, and the proposed technique is well-placed in the literature. The authors provide a comprehensive overview of related work on restart techniques in gradient-free and gradient-based optimization. The experimental results are well-designed and demonstrate the effectiveness of SGDR on several datasets. The paper also provides a detailed analysis of the results and discusses the implications of the findings.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest the authors consider the following:
* Provide more insights into the theoretical aspects of SGDR, such as its convergence properties and the effect of the cosine annealing schedule on the optimization process.
* Investigate the application of SGDR to other optimization algorithms, such as AdaDelta and Adam, as suggested in the conclusion.
* Consider providing more details on the implementation of SGDR, such as the choice of hyperparameters and the computational resources required.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
* Can you provide more insights into the choice of the cosine annealing schedule and its effect on the optimization process?
* How do you select the initial learning rate and the restart period for SGDR, and are there any guidelines for choosing these hyperparameters?
* Have you considered applying SGDR to other domains, such as natural language processing or computer vision, and if so, what are the preliminary results?
