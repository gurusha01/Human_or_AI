This paper proposes a novel approach to extend count-based exploration to high-dimensional state spaces using hash functions. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method on various control and Atari domains, achieving near state-of-the-art performance on several challenging tasks. The key contribution of this paper is the introduction of a simple yet powerful exploration strategy that can be used in conjunction with existing reinforcement learning algorithms.
To evaluate this paper, I will answer the three key questions outlined in the conference guidelines.
1. What is the specific question/problem tackled by the paper?
The paper tackles the problem of exploration in high-dimensional state spaces, which is a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning. The authors propose a novel approach to extend count-based exploration to high-dimensional state spaces using hash functions.
2. Is the approach well motivated, including being well-placed in the literature?
The approach is well-motivated, and the authors provide a clear overview of the existing literature on exploration strategies in reinforcement learning. They also highlight the limitations of existing methods and demonstrate how their approach addresses these limitations.
3. Does the paper support the claims?
The paper provides extensive experimental results to support the claims made by the authors. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on various control and Atari domains, including Montezuma's Revenge, which is a notoriously challenging task.
Based on these questions, I decide to Reject this paper, with the primary reason being that the proposed approach using hashing fails to achieve significant improvements over past approaches, such as VIME, in certain domains like Montezuma's Revenge and control domains. Additionally, the use of hashing may not be the best approach for estimating densities in complex environments, where learning methods may be more effective for understanding the environment.
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more analysis on the limitations of their approach and explore alternative methods for estimating densities in complex environments. Furthermore, the authors could investigate the use of more advanced hash functions or techniques, such as deep learning-based methods, to improve the performance of their approach.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper include:
* How do the authors plan to address the limitations of their approach in complex environments?
* Can the authors provide more insight into the choice of hash function and its impact on the performance of the approach?
* How does the proposed approach compare to other exploration strategies, such as curiosity-driven exploration, in terms of performance and computational efficiency?
