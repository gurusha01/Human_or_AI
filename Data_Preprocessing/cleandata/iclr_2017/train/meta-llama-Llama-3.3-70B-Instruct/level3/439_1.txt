Summary
The paper presents a novel recurrent neural network architecture, multiplicative LSTM (mLSTM), which combines the strengths of long short-term memory (LSTM) and multiplicative recurrent neural network (mRNN) architectures. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of mLSTM in character-level language modeling tasks, showing significant improvements over standard LSTM and its deep variants. The paper is well-written, and the experiments are thorough and well-motivated.
Decision
I decide to accept this paper, with the primary reason being the significant improvements shown in the experimental results, particularly in the more complex tasks. The paper presents a well-motivated approach, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed architecture.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a clear and concise introduction to the background and motivation of the work. The authors effectively compare and contrast their approach with existing architectures, such as LSTM and mRNN. The experimental results are thorough and well-presented, demonstrating the advantages of mLSTM in various character-level language modeling tasks. The use of dynamic evaluation and the results on the Hutter Prize dataset are particularly impressive, showing a significant improvement over the state-of-the-art.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest the authors consider the following points:
* Provide more analysis on the computational complexity of the proposed architecture and its implications for practical applications.
* Investigate the applicability of mLSTM to other sequence modeling tasks, such as word-level language modeling or tasks with continuous input units.
* Consider adding more visualizations or illustrations to help readers understand the architecture and its components.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to address the following questions:
* Can you provide more insight into the choice of hyperparameters and the sensitivity of the results to these choices?
* How do you envision the proposed architecture being applied to more complex tasks, such as multimodal sequence modeling or tasks with multiple input streams?
* Are there any plans to release the code or pre-trained models for the proposed architecture to facilitate further research and applications?
