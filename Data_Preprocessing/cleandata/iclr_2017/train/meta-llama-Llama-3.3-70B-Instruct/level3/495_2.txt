This paper presents a thorough evaluation of various factors that impact the effectiveness of features extracted from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for instance-level image retrieval. The authors investigate five key factors, including feature aggregation and normalization, output layer selection, image resizing, multi-scale feature representation, and PCA and whitening. Through extensive experiments on four datasets, the authors provide valuable insights into the effects of these factors on retrieval performance and propose a new multi-scale image representation method that outperforms state-of-the-art methods.
I decide to accept this paper with minor revisions. The key reasons for this decision are: (1) the paper tackles a specific and relevant problem in the field of computer vision, and (2) the approach is well-motivated and supported by thorough experiments.
The paper supports its claims through rigorous experiments and analysis, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method. The authors provide detailed discussions on the impact of each factor, which helps to advance our understanding of the underlying mechanisms. The proposed multi-scale image representation method shows significant improvements over previous methods, and the layer ensemble technique further boosts the performance.
To improve the paper, I suggest the authors provide more discussions on the computational cost and efficiency of the proposed method, as well as its potential applications in other computer vision tasks. Additionally, it would be helpful to include more visualizations or examples to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
I would like the authors to answer the following questions to clarify my understanding of the paper: (1) How do the authors plan to extend the proposed method to other computer vision tasks, such as object detection or image classification? (2) Can the authors provide more insights into the trade-offs between the different factors, such as feature aggregation and normalization, and output layer selection? (3) How do the authors think the proposed method can be improved or extended to handle more challenging datasets or scenarios?
