This paper proposes a novel method, Deep Variational Bayes Filters (DVBF), for learning nonlinear dynamical systems from raw, non-Markovian sequence data. The approach leverages stochastic gradient variational Bayes to overcome intractable inference distributions, enabling the learning of latent state-space models that can handle complex temporal and spatial dependencies. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of DVBF in a series of vision-based experiments, showcasing its ability to recover latent states that identify underlying physical quantities and generate stable long-term predictions.
I decide to Accept this paper, with two key reasons for this choice: (1) the proposed method is well-motivated and clearly presented, with a strong theoretical foundation and promising experimental results; and (2) the paper provides a significant contribution to the field of probabilistic modeling and filtering of dynamical systems, addressing a long-standing challenge in learning nonlinear state-space models from high-dimensional data.
The paper supports its claims through a combination of theoretical derivations and empirical evaluations. The authors provide a thorough explanation of the DVBF method, including its underlying assumptions and the optimization procedure used to learn the model parameters. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of DVBF in recovering latent states and generating long-term predictions, outperforming existing methods such as Deep Kalman Filters.
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more discussion on the tradeoffs between DVBF and related methods, such as SVAE, and include a comparison of their performance in the experiments. Additionally, the authors could clarify the role of uncertainty about transition parameters 'v' and provide more insight into the choice of prior distributions for these parameters.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper include: (1) How do the authors choose the number of latent dimensions and the architecture of the recognition model? (2) Can the authors provide more details on the implementation of the transition network and the optimization procedure used to learn the model parameters? (3) How do the authors plan to extend the DVBF method to more complex and high-dimensional data, such as videos or 3D scenes?
