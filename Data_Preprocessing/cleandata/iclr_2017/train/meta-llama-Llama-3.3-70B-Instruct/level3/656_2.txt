This paper proposes a novel approach to learning algorithmic tasks by leveraging the principle of divide and conquer, which is a fundamental concept in discrete mathematics and computer science. The authors introduce a recursive split and merge architecture that learns to solve tasks by recursively splitting the input into smaller sub-problems and then merging the solutions to these sub-problems. The key insight is that many algorithmic tasks have a natural hierarchical structure, and by exploiting this structure, the model can learn to solve tasks more efficiently and effectively.
The paper tackles a specific question: how to learn algorithmic tasks using a divide-and-conquer approach, and the approach is well-motivated by the literature on dynamic programming and neural networks. The authors provide a clear and well-structured presentation of their ideas, and the paper is easy to follow.
However, I have some concerns regarding the claims made in the paper. While the authors demonstrate promising results on two paradigmatic problems, sorting and planar convex hull, the generalization of their approach to more complex tasks is not clear. Additionally, the comparison to other baselines is limited, and it is not clear how the proposed approach compares to other state-of-the-art methods.
My decision is to reject the paper, with the main reason being that the claims made in the paper are not fully supported by the experimental results. While the authors demonstrate some promising results, the evaluation is limited, and more extensive experiments are needed to fully validate the approach.
To improve the paper, I would suggest the following:
* Provide more extensive experimental results, including comparisons to other state-of-the-art methods.
* Evaluate the approach on more complex tasks to demonstrate its generalizability.
* Provide more details on the implementation, including the hyperparameter settings and the training procedures.
* Consider adding more theoretical analysis to support the claims made in the paper.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper are:
* How do the authors plan to extend the approach to more complex tasks, and what are the potential challenges and limitations?
* How does the proposed approach compare to other state-of-the-art methods, such as recurrent neural networks and graph neural networks?
* What are the implications of the proposed approach for other areas of machine learning, such as reinforcement learning and natural language processing?
