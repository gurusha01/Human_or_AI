Summary
The paper proposes a novel approach to generating image-like containers for steganography applications using Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN). The authors introduce a Steganographic Generative Adversarial Networks (SGAN) model, which consists of a generator network, a discriminator network, and a steganalyzer network. The SGAN model is trained to produce realistic images that can deceive a steganalyzer, and the authors demonstrate that their approach can decrease the detection accuracy of a steganalysis method.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the paper ignores recent works that contradict its claims, and the study suffers from not considering recent advancements in the field. Secondly, the paper's claims of achieving state-of-the-art performance and outperforming other methods are misleading and incorrect due to the omission of recent works.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's approach to generating image-like containers for steganography applications is not new, and most of the ideas have been already explored in previous works. The experimental setup has problems, such as tuning experiments being conducted only on a single dataset and network, and aggressive tuning that may be overfitting to the test set. The paper's findings are not surprising, and the results are not scientifically rigorous. The authors' opinion on the preference for unsupervised methods when training samples are limited is also questionable, as there are examples where training with limited data is still beneficial.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, the authors should consider recent advancements in the field and compare their approach to state-of-the-art methods. They should also conduct more rigorous experiments on multiple datasets and networks to demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach. Additionally, the authors should provide more details on the implementation of their SGAN model and the steganalysis algorithms used in the experiments.
Questions for the Authors
I would like to ask the authors to clarify the following points:
* How do the authors plan to address the issue of overfitting to the test set, and what measures will they take to ensure that their approach generalizes to other datasets and networks?
* Can the authors provide more details on the implementation of their SGAN model, including the architecture of the generator and discriminator networks, and the training procedure used?
* How do the authors plan to extend their approach to more advanced steganographic algorithms, such as WOW, HUGO, and S-UNIWARD, and what are the potential challenges and limitations of their approach in these cases?
