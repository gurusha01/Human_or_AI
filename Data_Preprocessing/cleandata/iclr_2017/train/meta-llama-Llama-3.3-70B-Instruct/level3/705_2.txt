Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper proposes a novel approach to perceptual similarity judgment by re-training a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) with object persistence constraints. The authors demonstrate that this approach, called Object Persistence Net (OPnet), can learn to associate different views of the same object and develop a similarity judgment that can transfer to novel objects, including those from untrained categories. The paper also shows that OPnet outperforms other approaches, such as AlexNet and a joint embedding model, in instance and categorical retrieval tasks.
Decision and Key Reasons
I decide to reject this paper, with two key reasons: (1) the limited novelty of the work compared to the authors' previous publication, with only marginal improvements in recall despite a more sophisticated architecture; and (2) the "hacky" clustering and grouping approach in section 4, which could be improved by using object detectors and spectral clustering instead of k-means.
Supporting Arguments
While the paper presents an interesting approach to perceptual similarity judgment, the novelty of the work is limited compared to the authors' previous publication. The improvements in recall are marginal, and the architecture is more sophisticated, but not significantly so. Furthermore, the clustering and grouping approach in section 4 is simplistic and could be improved by using more advanced techniques, such as object detectors and spectral clustering. This would likely lead to more accurate results and a more robust approach.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors consider using more advanced clustering and grouping techniques, such as object detectors and spectral clustering. Additionally, the authors could provide more detailed analysis of the results, including a more thorough comparison with other approaches and a discussion of the limitations of the current approach. It would also be helpful to see more examples of the top-ranking results and a more detailed description of the synthesized object database.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions: (1) How do the authors plan to address the limited novelty of the work and the marginal improvements in recall? (2) Can the authors provide more details on the clustering and grouping approach in section 4 and why they chose to use k-means instead of more advanced techniques? (3) How do the authors plan to extend the approach to more general settings, such as real-world images with varying lighting and scale conditions?
