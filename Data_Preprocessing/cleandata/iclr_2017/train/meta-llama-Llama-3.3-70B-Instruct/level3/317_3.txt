Summary of the Paper
The paper presents a novel approach to distributed training of deep learning models, which combines the benefits of synchronous and asynchronous stochastic optimization. The authors propose a method called synchronous stochastic optimization with backup workers, which mitigates the straggler effect in synchronous optimization while avoiding the staleness problem in asynchronous optimization. The approach is empirically validated on several datasets, including ImageNet and CIFAR-10, and is shown to converge faster and to better test accuracies than asynchronous optimization.
Decision
I decide to accept this paper, with the main reason being that the approach is well-motivated and supported by thorough empirical evaluations. The paper addresses a significant problem in distributed deep learning, and the proposed solution is innovative and effective.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a clear and concise introduction to the problem of distributed training, and the authors do an excellent job of motivating the need for a new approach. The proposed method is well-explained, and the empirical evaluations are thorough and convincing. The results show that the approach outperforms asynchronous optimization in terms of convergence speed and test accuracy, which is a significant contribution to the field.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more analysis of the resulting networks, such as visualizing the learned features or analyzing the effect of the backup workers on the optimization process. Additionally, it would be helpful to provide more details on the implementation, such as the specific hardware and software used, to facilitate reproducibility.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like to ask the authors the following questions:
* Can you provide more details on how the backup workers are selected and how their gradients are aggregated?
* How does the approach handle cases where the straggler effect is severe, and the backup workers are not sufficient to mitigate it?
* Have you considered applying the approach to other optimization algorithms, such as Adam or Adagrad, and if so, what were the results?
