Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper explores the properties of the Hessian matrix of a loss function in deep learning, specifically its eigenvalue distribution. The authors demonstrate that the Hessian is highly singular, with a bulk of eigenvalues concentrated around zero and a discrete set of eigenvalues that depend on the input data. They also show that the singularity of the Hessian increases with the size of the network and that the discrete eigenvalues are robust to changes in the loss function.
Decision and Key Reasons
I decide to reject this paper, with the main reasons being that the experimental analysis is somewhat preliminary and lacks careful controls to support the claim of generalization. Additionally, the task of predicting the final state of the tower may be too binary and simplistic, and more challenging tasks may be needed to develop a truly generalizable physics model.
Supporting Arguments
While the paper provides interesting insights into the properties of the Hessian matrix, the experimental analysis is limited to a few examples and lacks a thorough investigation of the factors that influence the eigenvalue distribution. Furthermore, the paper does not provide a clear understanding of how the singularity of the Hessian affects the training dynamics and the generalization performance of the model.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more detailed experiments and analysis, including visualizations of the eigenvalue distribution and tests on more complex datasets. Additionally, the authors could explore more challenging tasks, such as high-frame-rate sequence prediction, to develop a truly generalizable physics model. It would also be helpful to provide more context on the implications of the singularity of the Hessian on the theoretical work in deep learning.
Questions for the Authors
I would like to ask the authors to clarify the following points:
* How do the authors plan to address the issue of overfitting to the training data, and what additional controls can be implemented to support the claim of generalization?
* Can the authors provide more insight into how the singularity of the Hessian affects the training dynamics and the generalization performance of the model?
* How do the authors plan to extend their work to more complex datasets and tasks, and what are the potential implications of their findings on the development of more generalizable physics models?
