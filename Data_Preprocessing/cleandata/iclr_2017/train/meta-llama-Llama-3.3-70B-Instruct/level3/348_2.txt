Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper proposes a novel approach to controlling the expansivity of gradients during backpropagation in Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) by manipulating orthogonality constraints and regularization on matrices. The authors introduce a factorization technique that allows for bounding matrix norms and controlling the degree of expansivity induced during backpropagation. They also explore the effect of loosening hard orthogonality constraints and introducing soft constraints on hidden-to-hidden transition matrix orthogonality.
Decision and Reasons
I decide to Accept this paper with minor revisions. The reasons for this decision are:
1. The paper tackles a specific and well-motivated problem in the context of RNNs, namely the vanishing and exploding gradient problem.
2. The approach proposed by the authors is novel and well-supported by theoretical analysis and empirical experiments.
3. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their methodology and results.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a thorough analysis of the vanishing and exploding gradient problem in RNNs and proposes a novel solution that involves factorizing the weight matrix into orthogonal bases and a diagonal spectral matrix. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through a series of experiments on synthetic and real-world tasks, including the copy task, adding task, and sequential MNIST task. The results show that loosening hard orthogonality constraints and introducing soft constraints can improve optimization convergence rate and model performance.
Additional Feedback and Questions
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors:
1. Provide more details on the computational complexity of their approach and its scalability to larger models and datasets.
2. Compare their approach to other existing methods for controlling the expansivity of gradients in RNNs, such as gradient clipping and weight normalization.
3. Investigate the effect of their approach on other types of neural networks, such as feedforward networks and convolutional neural networks.
Some questions I would like the authors to address in their response are:
1. How do the authors plan to extend their approach to more complex models and datasets?
2. Can the authors provide more insights into the relationship between the spectral margin and the convergence rate of the optimization algorithm?
3. How do the authors think their approach can be combined with other techniques for improving the stability and performance of RNNs?
