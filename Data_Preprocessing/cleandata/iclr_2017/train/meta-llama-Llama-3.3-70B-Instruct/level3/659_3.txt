The paper proposes a novel approach to training stochastic feedforward neural networks (SFNN) by leveraging the connection between SFNN, Simplified-SFNN, and deterministic deep neural networks (DNN). The authors introduce an intermediate model, Simplified-SFNN, which approximates SFNN by simplifying its upper latent units above stochastic ones. This connection enables an efficient training procedure for SFNN using pre-trained parameters of DNN.
I decide to reject this paper for the following two key reasons: 
1. The approach has limited novelty due to overlapping related work, and its applicability is restricted to domains where a monotonic alignment is available.
2. The evaluation methodology is flawed, as it compares a model that uses external alignment with a vanilla soft-attention model that learns alignments from scratch, which is an unfair comparison.
To support these reasons, I provide the following arguments:
* The paper's contribution is not significantly novel, as similar ideas have been explored in previous works. The authors' approach to training SFNN using pre-trained DNN parameters is not substantially different from existing methods.
* The evaluation methodology is problematic, as it compares the proposed model with a baseline that is not equipped with the same level of information. This makes it difficult to assess the true effectiveness of the proposed approach.
To improve the paper, I suggest the following:
* The authors should provide a more thorough discussion of the related work and clearly articulate the novelty of their approach.
* The evaluation methodology should be revised to ensure a fair comparison between the proposed model and the baseline. This could involve using a more suitable baseline or modifying the evaluation protocol to account for the differences in the models.
I would like the authors to answer the following questions to clarify my understanding of the paper and provide additional evidence to support their claims:
* Can the authors provide more details on how their approach differs from existing methods for training SFNN?
* How do the authors plan to address the limited applicability of their approach to domains where a monotonic alignment is available?
* Can the authors provide additional experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach in different scenarios and datasets?
