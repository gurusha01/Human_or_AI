Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper introduces a novel framework called Generative Multi-Adversarial Network (GMAN), which extends the traditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework to multiple discriminators. The authors propose a range of design perspectives, from a formidable adversary to a forgiving teacher, and demonstrate that GMAN can be reliably trained with the original, untampered minimax objective. The paper also introduces a new metric, called Generative Multi-Adversarial Metric (GMAM), to evaluate the performance of GMAN. The experimental results show that GMAN outperforms traditional GANs in terms of convergence speed and image quality on various image generation tasks.
Decision and Reasons
Based on the review, I decide to Accept this paper. The two key reasons for this choice are:
1. The paper introduces a novel and well-motivated framework that extends the traditional GAN framework to multiple discriminators, which has the potential to improve the stability and quality of generative models.
2. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of GMAN in terms of convergence speed and image quality, and the introduction of a new metric (GMAM) provides a useful tool for evaluating the performance of GMAN.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a thorough analysis of the effects of introducing multiple discriminators and explores various design perspectives, which demonstrates a deep understanding of the underlying concepts. The experimental results are also well-presented and demonstrate the superiority of GMAN over traditional GANs. Additionally, the paper provides a clear and concise introduction to the background and related work, which helps to situate the contributions of the paper.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more detailed analysis of the computational cost of GMAN compared to traditional GANs, as well as more extensive experiments on larger datasets. Additionally, it would be helpful to provide more insight into the choice of hyperparameters and the sensitivity of the results to these choices.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like to ask the authors the following questions:
1. Can you provide more details on the implementation of the GMAM metric and how it is used to evaluate the performance of GMAN?
2. How do you choose the number of discriminators (N) and the hyperparameters for the softmax function in GMAN?
3. Can you provide more insight into the computational cost of GMAN compared to traditional GANs, and how this affects the scalability of the framework?
