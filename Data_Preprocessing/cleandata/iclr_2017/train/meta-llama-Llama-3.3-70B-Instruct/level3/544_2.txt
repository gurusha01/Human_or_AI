Summary of the Paper
The paper proposes a novel approach to learning bilingual word vectors offline, leveraging the concept of orthogonal transformations to align word vector spaces. The authors introduce a new "inverted softmax" method to improve the accuracy of translation predictions and demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through various experiments.
Decision
I decide to Accept this paper, with the primary reason being the significant improvement in translation precision achieved by the proposed method, particularly when using the expert training dictionary. The paper's well-motivated approach, thorough experimentation, and rigorous evaluation also contribute to this decision.
Supporting Arguments
The paper tackles a specific question in the field of bilingual word vectors, providing a clear and well-structured solution. The authors' approach is well-placed in the literature, building upon existing work and addressing the limitations of previous methods. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, with notable improvements in translation precision. The use of orthogonal transformations and the inverted softmax method are particularly innovative and contribute to the paper's strengths.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest the authors consider the following:
* Provide more detailed analysis of the results, particularly in terms of the impact of word frequency on translation performance.
* Explore the application of the proposed method to other language pairs and domains.
* Consider using more advanced sentence vector representations, such as those incorporating word order or sentence length information.
* Investigate the potential of the inverted softmax method in other NLP tasks, such as language modeling or text classification.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper and provide additional evidence for my assessment, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
* Can you provide more insight into the choice of hyperparameters for the inverted softmax method and how they were optimized?
* How do the results of the proposed method compare to other state-of-the-art approaches in bilingual word vector learning?
* Are there any plans to release the code and pre-trained models for the proposed method, and if so, how will they be made available to the research community?
