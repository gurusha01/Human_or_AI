Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper proposes a novel deep learning model, GRU-D, for handling missing values in multivariate time series data. The model effectively captures informative missingness by incorporating masking and time interval directly into the GRU architecture. The authors demonstrate the model's performance on synthetic and real-world healthcare datasets, showing promising results and providing insightful findings.
Decision: Reject
The primary reason for this decision is the lack of evaluation of the architecture choices, which requires an ablation study to determine their importance. Additionally, the paper fails to evaluate the model on standard datasets, making the results unconvincing due to the existence of a state-of-the-art simple TFIDF-SVM method.
Supporting Arguments
The paper tackles the specific question of handling missing values in multivariate time series data, which is a significant problem in many applications. The approach is well-motivated, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the model's architecture and its components. However, the lack of evaluation of the architecture choices and the absence of standard dataset comparisons limit the paper's contributions.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, the authors should consider conducting an ablation study to evaluate the importance of each component in the GRU-D model. Additionally, they should compare their model's performance with state-of-the-art methods on standard datasets to demonstrate its effectiveness. The authors may also want to consider providing more details on the hyperparameter tuning process and the computational resources required to train the model.
