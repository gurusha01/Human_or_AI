Summary
The paper proposes a novel method for regularizing Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) called zoneout, which stochastically preserves hidden units' activations. The authors demonstrate that zoneout improves performance across various tasks, including character-level and word-level language modeling on the Penn Treebank and Text8 datasets, and achieves state-of-the-art results on permuted sequential MNIST. The method is simple to implement and can be combined with other regularizers to further improve performance.
Decision
I decide to accept this paper, with the main reason being that the approach is well-motivated and supported by empirical evidence. The authors provide a clear explanation of the zoneout method and its relationship to existing regularization techniques, such as dropout and stochastic depth. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of zoneout in improving the performance of RNNs on various tasks.
Supporting Arguments
The paper tackles the specific question of regularizing RNNs, which is a well-known challenge in the field. The approach is well-motivated, as it addresses the issue of vanishing gradients and the need for robustness to changes in the hidden state. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the relationship between zoneout and existing regularization techniques, which helps to understand the strengths and limitations of the proposed method. The experimental results are convincing, as they demonstrate the effectiveness of zoneout in improving the performance of RNNs on various tasks, including language modeling and image classification.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more insight into the hyperparameter selection process for zoneout. While the authors mention that low zoneout probabilities (0.05-0.2) on states reliably improve performance, it would be helpful to understand how these values were selected and whether they are task-dependent. Additionally, the authors may want to consider exploring the application of zoneout to other types of neural networks, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to further demonstrate its versatility.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like to ask the authors the following questions:
1. Can you provide more details on the hyperparameter selection process for zoneout, and whether the optimal values are task-dependent?
2. How do you think zoneout could be applied to other types of neural networks, such as CNNs, and what potential benefits or challenges do you foresee?
3. Have you considered exploring the use of zoneout in combination with other regularization techniques, such as weight decay or early stopping, to further improve the performance of RNNs?
