Summary
The paper proposes a novel perspective on Highway and Residual networks, suggesting that they perform unrolled iterative estimation. This viewpoint offers a unified theory for understanding these architectures, which are commonly used in deep learning. The authors demonstrate that both Highway and Residual networks can be derived from this perspective, providing a framework for understanding their behavior and performance.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the paper lacks a clear motivation for the proposed approach and its connection to existing methods, which raises questions about its novelty and significance. Secondly, the paper bears similarities to existing papers, such as CCPM, but fails to discuss the conceptual similarities and differences between them.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's lack of motivation and connection to existing methods makes it difficult to understand the significance of the proposed approach. Additionally, the omission of discussion on similar ideas, such as Compact Bilinear Pooling, limits the paper's contribution to the field. While the paper provides some experimental results, they are not sufficient to support the claims made, and the analysis is not thorough enough to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, the authors should provide a clear motivation for the proposed approach and discuss its connection to existing methods. They should also address the similarities and differences between their approach and existing papers, such as CCPM. Furthermore, the authors should provide more comprehensive experimental results and analysis to demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
1. Can you provide a clear motivation for the proposed approach and its connection to existing methods?
2. How do you address the similarities and differences between your approach and existing papers, such as CCPM?
3. Can you provide more comprehensive experimental results and analysis to demonstrate the effectiveness of your approach?
