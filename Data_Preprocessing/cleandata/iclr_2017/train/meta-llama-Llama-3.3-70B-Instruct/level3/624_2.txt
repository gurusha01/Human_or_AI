This paper presents a novel approach to estimating the similarity of a set of objects by introducing Attentive Recurrent Comparators (ARCs), a class of neural networks that combine attention and recurrence to cycle through objects and make observations. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of ARCs in various visual tasks, including one-shot learning, and show that they outperform existing methods, including Deep Convolutional Siamese Networks and Hierarchical Bayesian Program Learning.
I decide to accept this paper with the following key reasons: 
1. The paper tackles a specific and well-defined problem of estimating the similarity of objects, which is a fundamental task in machine learning.
2. The approach is well-motivated and placed in the literature, drawing on existing work on attention mechanisms and recurrent neural networks.
The paper supports its claims with extensive experimental results, including qualitative and quantitative analysis, and demonstrates the effectiveness of ARCs in various settings. However, I have some concerns regarding the paper's presentation and methodology. For instance, the explanation of Figure 2 could be improved, and it is unclear whether the results are due to the learning algorithm not being run long enough or the scaling of the input.
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the implementation of the ARC model, including the specific architecture and hyperparameters used. Additionally, it would be helpful to include more comparisons with other existing methods, such as Matching Networks and Memory Augmented Neural Networks, to further demonstrate the effectiveness of ARCs.
I would like the authors to answer the following questions to clarify my understanding of the paper:
1. Can you provide more details on the attention mechanism used in the ARC model, including the specific formulation and implementation?
2. How do you handle the case where the number of objects is large, and the ARC model needs to cycle through all of them?
3. Can you provide more insights into the qualitative analysis of the ARC model's operation, including the strategies it learns to compare objects?
