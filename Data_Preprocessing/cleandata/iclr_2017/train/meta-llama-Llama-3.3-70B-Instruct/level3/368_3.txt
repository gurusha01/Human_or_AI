The paper proposes a method to evaluate generative models like VAE, GAN, and GMMN, addressing the need for a more systematic approach than visual judgment. The authors introduce a new dataset, NewsQA, which contains over 100,000 question-answer pairs based on news articles from CNN. The dataset is designed to encourage exploratory, curiosity-based questions that reflect human information seeking, and the authors argue that it requires reasoning mechanisms, such as synthesis of information across different parts of an article.
I decide to reject this paper, with the main reason being that the technical contribution of the paper is limited, building upon existing work with the main novelty being its application to generative models. Additionally, the paper contains errors, such as in section 2.3, which may indicate a lack of rigor in the methodology.
The approach is well-motivated, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of the dataset, including the types of answers and the forms of reasoning required to solve it. However, the paper does not support its claims, as the experimental results reveal that GANs and GMMNs have lower test accuracy than VAEs, despite producing visually appealing samples, indicating potential underfitting or overfitting issues.
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors address the errors and provide more rigorous methodology, as well as more detailed analysis of the experimental results. Additionally, it would be helpful to provide more context about the related work and how the proposed method differs from existing approaches.
I would like to ask the authors to clarify the following points: (1) How do the authors plan to address the errors in the paper, and what steps will they take to ensure the rigor of the methodology? (2) Can the authors provide more detailed analysis of the experimental results, including the performance of the models on different types of questions and answers? (3) How do the authors plan to extend the proposed method to other types of generative models, and what are the potential limitations of the approach?
