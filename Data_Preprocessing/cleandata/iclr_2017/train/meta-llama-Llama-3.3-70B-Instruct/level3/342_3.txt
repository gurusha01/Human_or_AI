Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper proposes a novel approach to semi-supervised reinforcement learning (SSRL), which enables an agent to learn a policy that generalizes to unseen scenarios by leveraging both labeled and unlabeled experiences. The authors introduce a method called Semi-Supervised Skill Generalization (S3G), which combines maximum entropy control and inverse reinforcement learning to infer the reward function in unlabeled settings. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of S3G in various continuous control tasks, showing improved generalization performance compared to baseline methods.
