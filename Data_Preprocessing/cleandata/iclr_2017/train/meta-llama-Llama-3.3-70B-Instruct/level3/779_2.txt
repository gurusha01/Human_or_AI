Summary
The paper presents a comprehensive analysis of vocabulary selection techniques for neural machine translation, exploring various methods to constrain the output vocabulary to a small subset relevant to the current source sentence. The authors evaluate the effectiveness of different selection techniques, including word alignments, phrase pairs, and discriminative SVM classifiers, and demonstrate significant speed-ups in decoding time without compromising accuracy.
Decision
I recommend accepting this paper, with the primary reason being that it provides a useful contribution to the field of neural machine translation by exploring various vocabulary selection techniques and demonstrating their effectiveness. However, I also believe that the paper could be improved by addressing some of the limitations and suggestions outlined below.
Supporting Arguments
The paper is well-motivated, and the authors provide a clear overview of the problem and the proposed solutions. The experiments are thorough, and the results are convincing, demonstrating significant speed-ups in decoding time without compromising accuracy. The paper also provides a good overview of related work and clearly places the proposed approach within the context of existing research.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors consider the following points:
* Provide a stronger case for using vocabulary over characters or subword units, as this is not explicitly motivated in the paper.
* Mention other approaches, such as the discriminative word lexicon and neural version, for modeling vocabulary.
* Include the coverage rate of the actual full vocabulary and explore the technique's applicability to larger vocabularies.
* Consider alternative approaches to reducing vocabulary size for training, such as using a single sentence's vocabulary instead of the union of all vocabularies in a mini-batch.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to address the following questions:
* Can you provide more details on why word alignments were found to be more effective than other selection methods?
* How do you plan to address the limitation of the current approach, which relies on a pre-computed word alignment table?
* Can you provide more insights into the trade-off between speed and accuracy for different vocabulary sizes, and how this trade-off can be optimized in practice?
