Summary of the Paper
The paper proposes a differentiable formulation of Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA), which enables the computation of CCA projection matrices to be cast as a layer within a multi-view neural network. This allows for gradient flow through the computation of the CCA projection matrices, enabling parameter optimization via back-propagation. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in cross-modality retrieval experiments on two public image-to-text datasets, surpassing both Deep CCA and a multi-view network with freely-learned projections.
Decision
I decide to accept this paper, with the main reason being that it addresses an important problem in machine learning and provides a well-motivated approach to solving it. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide enough detail for re-implementation.
Supporting Arguments
The paper tackles the issue of building causal models and applies it to a heart disease dataset, correctly identifying common causes of heart disease through experiments. The authors provide a thorough explanation of the differentiable CCA layer and its application to cross-modality retrieval. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, showing improved retrieval performance compared to existing methods.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more discussion on the robustness of their approach with respect to hyper-parameter choice, particularly when dealing with medical data. Additionally, the conclusions of the experimental evaluation could be strengthened by discussing statistical significance and interpretation of results. The authors should also consider providing more references to previous work on causal classifiers, such as Lopez-Paz et al.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
1. Can you provide more details on how the differentiable CCA layer is implemented, particularly with respect to the computation of the partial derivatives of the CCA projection matrices?
2. How do you plan to release the heart failure dataset used in the experiments, and what steps will you take to ensure reproducibility of the results?
3. Can you discuss the potential applications of the differentiable CCA layer beyond cross-modality retrieval, and how it could be used in other machine learning tasks?
