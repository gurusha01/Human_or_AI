Summary of the Paper
The paper introduces the "Energy-based Generative Adversarial Network" (EBGAN) model, which views the discriminator as an energy function that attributes low energies to the regions near the data manifold and higher energies to other regions. The authors propose to use an auto-encoder architecture as the discriminator, where the energy is the reconstruction error. They demonstrate that this form of EBGAN exhibits more stable behavior than regular GANs during training and can be used to generate high-resolution images.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the paper lacks a solid rationale for the choice of architecture and the value of the extracted trends and durations as inputs. Secondly, the authors ignored a large body of work on financial time series modeling using probabilistic models and related techniques, which could provide an alternative way to frame the "separate trends from noise" problem.
Supporting Arguments
The paper tackles an interesting problem setting of time series prediction with a hybrid architecture, but the reviewer questions the formulation of the machine learning task and the justification of the proposed architecture. The authors did not provide a strong argument for why they formulated the machine learning task as they did, and an equally straightforward choice would have been to feed the output of the ConvNet into the LSTM. Additionally, the paper lacks a solid rationale for the choice of architecture and the value of the extracted trends and durations as inputs.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, the authors should provide a clearer justification for their architectural choices and consider alternative approaches, such as using probabilistic models for financial time series modeling. They should also provide more detailed experiments and comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods to demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach.
Questions for the Authors
1. Can you provide more insight into why you chose to use an auto-encoder architecture as the discriminator, and how this choice affects the performance of the EBGAN model?
2. How do you respond to the criticism that your approach lacks a solid rationale for the choice of architecture and the value of the extracted trends and durations as inputs?
3. Can you provide more detailed experiments and comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods to demonstrate the effectiveness of your approach?
