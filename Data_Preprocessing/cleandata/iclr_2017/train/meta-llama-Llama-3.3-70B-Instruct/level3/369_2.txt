Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper introduces a novel method for neural architecture search, which utilizes a recurrent neural network (RNN) as a controller to generate model descriptions of neural networks. The controller is trained using reinforcement learning to maximize the expected accuracy of the generated architectures on a validation set. The method is applied to two benchmark datasets, CIFAR-10 and Penn Treebank, and achieves state-of-the-art results on both tasks.
Decision and Key Reasons
I decide to accept this paper with minor revisions. The two key reasons for this decision are: (1) the paper tackles a specific and important problem in the field of deep learning, namely the automation of neural architecture design, and (2) the approach is well-motivated and supported by strong empirical results on challenging benchmarks.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a clear and well-structured introduction to the problem of neural architecture search and the proposed solution. The method is based on a solid foundation of reinforcement learning and RNNs, and the authors provide a thorough explanation of the controller's architecture and training procedure. The experimental results are impressive, with the method achieving state-of-the-art results on both CIFAR-10 and Penn Treebank. The authors also provide a thorough analysis of the results, including ablation studies and comparisons to other methods.
Additional Feedback and Questions
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the computational resources required to train the controller and the child networks. Additionally, it would be helpful to include more visualizations of the generated architectures and to provide a more detailed analysis of the controller's behavior during training. Some questions that I would like the authors to address in their response are: (1) How do the authors plan to make the code and models publicly available, and what are the plans for maintaining and updating the codebase? (2) Can the authors provide more insights into the controller's decision-making process and how it explores the architecture space? (3) Are there any plans to apply the method to other tasks or domains, such as natural language processing or computer vision?
