Summary
The paper introduces a new online structure learning technique for Gaussian Sum-Product Networks (SPNs) that can learn the structure of the network in a single pass through the data. The algorithm starts with a fully factorized distribution and updates the structure and parameters as new data points are processed. The technique is evaluated on several benchmark datasets and is shown to outperform other algorithms, including online Bayesian moment matching, online expectation maximization, and stacked restricted Boltzmann machines.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the paper lacks a clear discussion and comparison with existing approaches for online structure learning of SPNs. Secondly, the paper's evaluation task is related to entity typing, but this connection is not explicitly discussed, and it is unclear whether the proposed dataset provides any advantages over existing resources.
Supporting Arguments
The paper proposes a new online structure learning technique for Gaussian SPNs, which is a significant contribution to the field. However, the paper does not provide a thorough discussion of existing approaches for online structure learning of SPNs, making it difficult to understand the novelty and significance of the proposed technique. Additionally, the paper's evaluation task is related to entity typing, but this connection is not explicitly discussed, and it is unclear whether the proposed dataset provides any advantages over existing resources.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide a more detailed discussion of existing approaches for online structure learning of SPNs and clearly explain the advantages of their proposed technique. Additionally, the authors should explicitly discuss the connection between the evaluation task and entity typing and provide more evidence to support the claim that the proposed dataset is relevant to the ICLR conference.
Questions for the Authors
I would like the authors to answer the following questions to clarify my understanding of the paper:
1. How does the proposed online structure learning technique for Gaussian SPNs differ from existing approaches?
2. What are the advantages of the proposed technique over existing approaches?
3. Can the authors provide more evidence to support the claim that the proposed dataset is relevant to the ICLR conference?
4. How does the evaluation task relate to entity typing, and what are the implications of this connection for the proposed dataset?
