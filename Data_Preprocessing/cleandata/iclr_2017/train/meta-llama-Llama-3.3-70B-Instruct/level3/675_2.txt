The paper proposes a novel approach to learning sequence predictors by increasing sequence length during training, with the premise that longer sequences are harder to learn. This method is tested on a single non-standard dataset derived from MNIST, which may not be representative of the algorithm's general applicability. 
I decide to reject this paper, with the two key reasons being the lack of evaluation on multiple datasets and the need for significant trimming to improve overall quality and readability. The paper's evaluation part is interesting, with several ablation studies and comparisons to other strategies, but it needs to be tested on other datasets and applications to demonstrate its generalizability.
The paper's approach is well-motivated, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the problem and the proposed solution. However, the presentation and organization of the paper could be improved, with clearer explanations of equations and symbols, and consistent naming conventions. Additionally, the paper lacks clarity on certain aspects, such as the calculation of the "Best value for the average over 10 runs" and the connection between the transfer learning part and the main contribution of the paper.
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors conduct experiments on multiple datasets to demonstrate the algorithm's general applicability. They should also trim the paper significantly to improve its overall quality and readability. Furthermore, the authors should provide clearer explanations of equations and symbols, and use consistent naming conventions throughout the paper. 
I would like the authors to answer the following questions to clarify my understanding of the paper: 
1. How do the authors plan to address the issue of the algorithm's general applicability, given that it is only tested on a single non-standard dataset?
2. Can the authors provide more details on the calculation of the "Best value for the average over 10 runs" and how it relates to the main contribution of the paper?
3. How do the authors plan to improve the presentation and organization of the paper, given that it is currently too long and lacks clarity on certain aspects?
