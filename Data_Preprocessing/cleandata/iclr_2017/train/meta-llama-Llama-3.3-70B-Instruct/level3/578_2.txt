Summary
The paper presents an empirical study on the influence of incremental sequence learning on generative RNNs, specifically in the context of sequence learning. The authors propose a simple yet effective approach, Incremental Sequence Learning, which involves gradually increasing the length of the sequences used for training as the network learns to predict the early parts of the sequences. The study demonstrates that this approach significantly improves sequence learning performance, reducing the test error by 74% and achieving a 20-fold speedup in computation time compared to regular sequence learning.
Decision
I decide to accept this paper, with two key reasons for this choice: (1) the paper presents a well-motivated and well-placed contribution in the literature, addressing a significant problem in sequence learning, and (2) the empirical study provides strong evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed approach, with thorough analysis and comparison to other methods.
Supporting Arguments
The paper is well-structured and clearly written, making it easy to follow the authors' arguments and methodology. The introduction provides a thorough background on incremental learning, transfer learning, and representation learning, setting the stage for the proposed approach. The experimental setup is well-designed, with a suitable dataset and evaluation metrics. The results are impressive, demonstrating significant improvements in both computation time and generalization performance. The authors also provide a thorough analysis of the causes of the observed improvements, ruling out alternative explanations and providing evidence for the importance of the RNN's ability to build up internal representations of the sequences.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors consider providing more analysis on the limitations of the proposed approach and potential avenues for future work. Additionally, it would be helpful to include more visualizations or examples of the generated sequences to illustrate the quality of the results. Furthermore, the authors may want to consider comparing their approach to other state-of-the-art methods in sequence learning, to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the proposed approach.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like to ask the authors the following questions:
1. Can you provide more details on the hyperparameter tuning process for the proposed approach, and how the threshold value of 4 was chosen?
2. How do you think the proposed approach would perform on other sequence learning tasks, such as language modeling or speech recognition?
3. Can you provide more insight into the trade-offs between the proposed approach and other curriculum learning methods, and how the choice of approach depends on the specific problem and dataset?
