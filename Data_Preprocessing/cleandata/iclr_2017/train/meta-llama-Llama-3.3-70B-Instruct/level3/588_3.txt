This paper presents a novel approach to evaluating the performance of decoder-based generative models, such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and Generative Moment Matching Networks (GMMNs). The authors propose using Annealed Importance Sampling (AIS) to estimate the log-likelihood of these models, which is a crucial metric for evaluating their performance. The paper claims to provide a more accurate and reliable method for evaluating decoder-based models, which is a significant contribution to the field.
I decide to reject this paper, primarily due to two key reasons. Firstly, the evaluation of the proposed approach may be insufficient to assess its effectiveness, particularly in comparison to existing methods. The paper lacks a baseline approach for comparison, making it challenging to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach with respect to the difficulty of the problem. Secondly, the paper raises several minor notes about formatting, referencing, and consistency, which, although not critical, detract from the overall quality of the paper.
The approach presented in the paper is well-motivated, and the use of AIS to estimate log-likelihoods is a novel and interesting idea. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the accuracy of AIS and compare it to existing methods, such as Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) and the Importance Weighted Autoencoder (IWAE) bound. The results show that AIS is more accurate and reliable than these existing methods, which is a significant contribution to the field.
However, I would like the authors to address several questions and concerns to improve the paper. For instance, how does the choice of intermediate distributions and the number of samples affect the accuracy of AIS? Can the authors provide more details on the computational cost of AIS compared to existing methods? Additionally, how does the proposed approach handle models with complex observation models, such as non-Gaussian or heavy-tailed distributions?
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more detailed comparisons with existing methods, including baseline approaches, and address the minor notes about formatting, referencing, and consistency. Furthermore, the authors should consider providing more insights into the computational cost and scalability of the proposed approach, as well as its applicability to more complex models and datasets. Overall, while the paper presents a promising approach, it requires further refinement and evaluation to demonstrate its effectiveness and reliability.
