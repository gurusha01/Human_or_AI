Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper proposes a novel adversarial learning formulation that enables the discriminator to retain density information, allowing it to be used as an evaluation metric. The authors introduce a flexible adversarial training framework and prove that it ensures the generator converges to the true data distribution while enabling the discriminator to retain density information. They also derive the analytic form of the induced solution and analyze its properties. The paper presents two effective approximation techniques to optimize the training objective and verifies the results empirically.
Decision to Reject
I decide to reject this paper, primarily because it lacks novelty, as it mostly extends existing research by Mi et al. (2016) with additional vocabulary selection strategies and experiments. Furthermore, the paper is more suitable for an NLP venue rather than the current conference.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's contributions, although practical and convincing, do not significantly advance the state-of-the-art in the field. The proposed formulation, while novel, is closely related to existing work, and the experiments, although thorough, do not demonstrate a substantial improvement over existing methods. Additionally, the paper's focus on NLP tasks makes it a better fit for a specialized conference.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, the authors could consider highlighting the key differences between their work and existing research, such as Mi et al. (2016), and demonstrating a more significant improvement over existing methods. They could also explore the application of their formulation to other tasks or domains, to demonstrate its broader applicability. Furthermore, the authors could provide more detailed analysis of the results, including a more thorough comparison with baseline models and a discussion of the limitations of their approach.
Questions for the Authors
1. How do the authors respond to the criticism that their work lacks novelty, and what do they believe are the key contributions of their paper?
2. Can the authors provide more detailed analysis of the results, including a comparison with other state-of-the-art models, to demonstrate the effectiveness of their formulation?
3. How do the authors plan to address the limitations of their approach, such as the reliance on Euclidean distance in the nearest-neighbor based approximation, and what potential solutions do they propose?
