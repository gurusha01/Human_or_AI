The paper presents a novel approach to neural architecture search, utilizing a recurrent neural network as a controller to generate model descriptions of neural networks. The controller is trained with reinforcement learning to maximize the expected accuracy of the generated architectures on a validation set. This approach achieves impressive results, rivaling the best human-invented architectures on CIFAR-10 and Penn Treebank datasets.
I decide to reject this paper, primarily due to two key reasons. Firstly, despite the convincing results, the paper lacks novelty in its core concept. The idea of using a recurrent neural network as a controller to generate neural network architectures is not entirely new, and the paper does not provide significant improvements or breakthroughs in this area. Secondly, the paper has some minor errors, such as incorrect units in Table 3 and a figure reference error in Section 5.1.1, which, although not critical, indicate a lack of attention to detail.
Supporting arguments for these reasons include the fact that the paper's approach, although well-written and clearly presented, does not offer substantial contributions to the field of neural architecture search. The experiments, while demonstrating good performance, do not provide a comprehensive analysis of the approach's strengths and weaknesses. Furthermore, the paper's discussion of related work, although thorough, does not adequately distinguish the proposed approach from existing methods.
To improve the paper, I suggest the authors provide a more detailed analysis of the controller's behavior and the generated architectures, including a discussion of the trade-offs between different hyperparameters and the impact of the reinforcement learning objective on the search process. Additionally, the authors should address the minor errors and provide more descriptive figure and table captions to enhance the paper's clarity and readability.
I would like the authors to answer the following questions to clarify my understanding of the paper: (1) How do the authors plan to address the lack of novelty in their approach, and what potential improvements or extensions could be made to the method? (2) Can the authors provide more insight into the controller's decision-making process and the factors that influence the generated architectures? (3) How do the authors intend to address the minor errors and improve the overall presentation of the paper?
