This paper proposes a novel sequence learning approach, RL Tuner, which combines supervised learning and reinforcement learning (RL) to refine a pre-trained recurrent neural network (RNN) for sequence generation tasks. The approach uses RL to impose structure on the generated sequences, while maintaining the information learned from the data. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of RL Tuner in generating more pleasing and structured melodies, compared to a baseline RNN model.
I decide to accept this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the paper tackles a specific and well-defined problem in sequence generation, which is a significant challenge in many applications, including music generation. Secondly, the approach proposed in the paper is well-motivated and grounded in the literature, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in improving the quality of the generated melodies.
The paper supports its claims through a combination of quantitative and qualitative evaluations. The quantitative results show that the RL Tuner models outperform the baseline RNN model in terms of adherence to music theory rules, while the qualitative results demonstrate that the generated melodies are more pleasing and structured. The paper also provides a thorough analysis of the results, including an ablation study and a comparison with other approaches.
To improve the paper, I would suggest providing more details on the hyperparameter tuning process, as well as a more comprehensive comparison with other state-of-the-art approaches in music generation. Additionally, it would be interesting to see the application of RL Tuner to other sequence generation tasks, such as text generation or dialogue systems.
I would like to ask the authors to clarify the following points: (1) How did they select the hyperparameters for the RL Tuner models, and what was the effect of different hyperparameter settings on the results? (2) Can they provide more details on the music theory rules used to define the reward function, and how these rules were selected? (3) How do they plan to extend the RL Tuner approach to more complex sequence generation tasks, such as polyphonic music generation or text generation with multiple speakers?
