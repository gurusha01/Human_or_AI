Summary
The paper proposes a method to compute the preimage of activities at arbitrary levels in a deep rectifier network, which is the set of inputs that result in the same node activity. The authors demonstrate that these preimages are piecewise linear manifolds in the input space and can be used as building blocks for describing the input manifolds of specific classes. The paper also discusses the implications of this concept for modeling image manifolds and achieving efficient classification.
Decision
I decide to accept this paper with the reason that it provides a novel and well-motivated approach to understanding the behavior of deep rectifier networks. The paper is well-placed in the literature and provides a clear and concise explanation of the concept of preimages and their relation to image manifolds.
Supporting Arguments
The paper supports its claims with a thorough mathematical analysis of the preimage concept and its application to deep rectifier networks. The authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the procedure for computing preimages and demonstrate its effectiveness in capturing the manifolds of classes in input space. The paper also provides a good discussion of the implications of this concept for modeling image manifolds and achieving efficient classification.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more empirical evidence to support their claims, such as experiments on real-world datasets. Additionally, the authors could provide more details on how the preimage concept can be used to enhance the efficiency of training deep networks. It would also be interesting to see a comparison with other methods for modeling image manifolds, such as those using generative models.
Questions for the Authors
I would like to ask the authors to clarify the following points:
* How do the authors plan to extend their method to convolutional networks, which are commonly used in practice?
* Can the authors provide more details on how the preimage concept can be used to improve the robustness of deep networks to adversarial attacks?
* How do the authors plan to investigate the empirical validity of their assumed models of image manifolds and their relation to preimages?
