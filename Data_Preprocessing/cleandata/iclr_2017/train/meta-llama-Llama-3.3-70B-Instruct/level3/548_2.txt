Summary
The paper proposes a novel method called Charged Point Normalization (CPN) for accelerating optimization near saddle points in high-dimensional non-convex optimization problems. CPN introduces a dynamic normalization function that repels the current parameter vector from a running average of recent parameter values, allowing the optimization algorithm to escape saddle points. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of CPN on various datasets and architectures, including simple deep neural networks, convolutional neural networks, and recurrent neural networks.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the paper lacks a clear and concise explanation of how CPN differs from existing methods, such as momentum, and why it is better suited for escaping saddle points. Secondly, the experimental results, although promising, are not standardized and lack a rigorous comparison with other state-of-the-art methods.
Supporting Arguments
The paper proposes an interesting approach to escaping saddle points, but it falls short in providing a clear and intuitive understanding of how CPN works. The notation and mathematical derivations are often confusing, and the authors could benefit from providing a simple diagram to illustrate the concept. Additionally, the relationship between CPN and momentum is not fully explored, and the authors should investigate how CPN can be related to or improve upon existing momentum-based methods.
The experimental results, although showing promising performance, are not comprehensive and lack a standardized comparison with other methods. The authors should recreate Figure 4 of Dauphin et al. with CPN to provide a more direct comparison. Furthermore, the paper could benefit from a more rigorous analysis of the theoretical results, such as Eqn 1 and Thm 1, which seem irrelevant to the main contribution of the paper.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, I suggest the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of CPN, including a simple diagram to illustrate the concept. They should also explore the relationship between CPN and momentum, and investigate how CPN can be related to or improve upon existing momentum-based methods. Additionally, the authors should standardize their experimental results and provide a more comprehensive comparison with other state-of-the-art methods.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
1. Can you provide a simple diagram to illustrate how CPN differs from momentum and why it is better suited for escaping saddle points?
2. How does CPN relate to existing momentum-based methods, and can you provide a more comprehensive comparison with these methods?
3. Can you provide more details on the hyperparameter selection process for CPN, and how the authors plan to address the potential issues with numerical instability and exponential decay?
