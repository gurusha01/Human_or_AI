The paper proposes a novel approach to modeling volatility in financial time series using a recurrent variational neural network. The authors extend the Stochastic Gradient Variational Bayes (SGVB) method to perform posterior inference for the weights of Stick-Breaking processes, allowing for a Bayesian nonparametric version of the variational autoencoder. The paper's main technical contribution is the stacking of two levels of recurrence, one for the latent process and one for the observables, which appears to be a novel, if minor, contribution.
I decide to reject this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the experimental validation is limited, and the authors should compare their model to more state-of-the-art models, such as those implemented in R packages like `stochvol' and `fGarch'. Secondly, the paper lacks details on the network architecture, such as the number of hidden units and embedding dimension, which should be provided for clarity.
To support these reasons, I provide the following arguments. The paper's approach is well-motivated, and the use of SGVB for posterior inference for the weights of Stick-Breaking processes is an interesting contribution. However, the experimental results are not comprehensive, and the comparison to other models is limited. Additionally, the paper lacks transparency in its implementation, making it difficult to reproduce the results.
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the network architecture and experimental setup. They should also compare their model to other state-of-the-art models and provide more comprehensive experimental results. Furthermore, the authors should discuss how the model could be extended to forecast volatility at longer horizons, as many applications require this.
I would like the authors to answer the following questions to clarify my understanding of the paper and provide additional evidence to support their claims. How do the authors plan to extend the model to forecast volatility at longer horizons? Can they provide more details on the network architecture and experimental setup? How do the authors plan to compare their model to other state-of-the-art models, and what metrics will they use to evaluate performance?
