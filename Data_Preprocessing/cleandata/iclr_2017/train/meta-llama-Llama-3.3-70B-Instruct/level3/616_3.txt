This paper proposes a novel approach to combining algorithms and machine learning for state estimation in robotics, specifically by using end-to-end learnable histogram filters (E2E-HFs). The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in two localization tasks, a hallway localization task and a drone localization task, and show that it outperforms traditional methods such as long-short-term memory networks (LSTMs) in terms of data efficiency and performance.
The specific question tackled by the paper is how to balance the trade-off between data efficiency and generality in state estimation problems, and the authors propose to use algorithmic priors to provide a structure for the learning process. The approach is well-motivated, as it leverages the strengths of both algorithms and machine learning to achieve better performance.
However, I decide to reject this paper due to two key reasons. Firstly, the experimental validation of the model is weak, with results shown only for simplified toy set-ups, and lacks comparison to state-of-the-art methods on real-world datasets. Secondly, the clarity of the writing can be improved, with confusing terminology and unclear explanations, particularly regarding the "imagination" and "memory" concepts and the "feature space" illustration.
To support these reasons, I provide the following arguments. The paper claims that the E2E-HF approach is more data-efficient than traditional methods, but the experiments are limited to two simple tasks, and it is unclear whether the approach will generalize to more complex scenarios. Additionally, the paper lacks a clear comparison to state-of-the-art methods, making it difficult to assess the significance of the results. Furthermore, the writing is often unclear, with confusing terminology and concepts that are not well-explained, which makes it difficult to understand the approach and its implications.
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more extensive experimental validation, including comparisons to state-of-the-art methods on real-world datasets. Additionally, the authors should clarify the writing, providing clear explanations of the concepts and terminology used, and avoiding confusing or unclear language. Specifically, I would like the authors to answer the following questions: (1) How does the E2E-HF approach compare to state-of-the-art methods in terms of performance and data efficiency? (2) Can the approach be applied to more complex state estimation problems, and if so, how? (3) How do the algorithmic priors used in the E2E-HF approach affect the learning process, and what are the implications for the performance of the model?
