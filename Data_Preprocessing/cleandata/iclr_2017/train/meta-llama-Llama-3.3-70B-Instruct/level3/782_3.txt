Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper proposes a novel approach to pruning convolutional neural networks (CNNs) by iteratively removing the least important feature maps based on a Taylor expansion-based criterion. The authors demonstrate that their approach outperforms other pruning criteria, including the widely used Optimal Brain Damage (OBD) method, in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency. The paper also introduces a new normalization technique to scale the pruning criterion across layers, which improves the performance of the pruning algorithm.
