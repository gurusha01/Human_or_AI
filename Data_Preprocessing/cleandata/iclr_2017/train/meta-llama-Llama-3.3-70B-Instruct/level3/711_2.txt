Summary
The paper proposes a novel architecture for question classification tasks, leveraging the potential of answer data to improve question representation. The authors introduce Group Sparse Autoencoders (GSA) and Group Sparse Convolutional Neural Networks (GSCNNs), which incorporate group sparse constraints to learn meaningful representations from answer sets. The model is evaluated on four datasets, demonstrating significant improvements over strong baselines.
Decision
I decide to Accept this paper, with two key reasons: (1) the paper tackles a specific and important problem in question classification, and (2) the proposed approach is well-motivated and supported by experimental results.
Supporting Arguments
The paper clearly addresses a unique challenge in question classification, where traditional techniques neglect the potential of answer data. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the problem and propose a novel solution, GSA and GSCNNs, which is well-placed in the literature. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, with significant improvements over strong baselines on four datasets.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest the authors provide more details on the hyperparameter tuning process, particularly for the grid search on the dev set. Additionally, it would be helpful to include more visualizations of the learned representations, similar to Figure 3 and 4, to provide a better understanding of the model's behavior.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
1. Can you provide more details on the initialization methods for the projection matrix in GSA, particularly the random initialization and initialization from questions/answers?
2. How do you plan to address the potential overfitting issue due to the grid search on the dev set?
3. Can you provide more insights into the learned representations, particularly the group sparse constraints, and how they contribute to the improved performance?
