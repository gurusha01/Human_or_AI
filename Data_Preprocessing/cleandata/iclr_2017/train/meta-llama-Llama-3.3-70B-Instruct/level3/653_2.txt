Summary of the Paper's Claims and Contributions
The paper proposes a novel approach to generating image-like containers for steganography applications using Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN). The authors introduce a Steganographic Generative Adversarial Networks (SGAN) model, which consists of a generator network, a discriminator network, and a steganalyzer network. The SGAN model is designed to produce realistic images that can serve as containers for secure message embedding, while also deceiving steganalysis methods. The paper presents experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of the SGAN model in decreasing the detection accuracy of steganalysis methods.
Decision and Key Reasons
I decide to reject this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the paper's novelty and practical significance are limited due to the existing knowledge on the topic, including a deep learning textbook that summarizes similar results. Secondly, there is an error in Equation (4) where the same K is used for different mini-batch sizes, despite K differing when mini-batch sizes change.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's approach is well-motivated, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the SGAN model and its components. However, the paper's contribution to the field of steganography and deep learning is not significant enough to warrant acceptance. The experimental results presented in the paper are interesting, but they do not provide sufficient evidence to support the claims made by the authors. Additionally, the error in Equation (4) raises concerns about the validity of the results presented in the paper.
Additional Feedback and Questions
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more detailed explanations of the SGAN model and its components, as well as more comprehensive experimental results. Additionally, the authors should address the error in Equation (4) and provide a corrected version of the equation. I would like the authors to answer the following questions: (1) How do the authors plan to address the limitation of the SGAN model in terms of its ability to generalize to different steganalysis methods? (2) Can the authors provide more detailed information about the experimental setup and the parameters used to train the SGAN model? (3) How do the authors plan to extend the SGAN model to more advanced steganographic algorithms, such as WOW, HUGO, and S-UNIWARD?
