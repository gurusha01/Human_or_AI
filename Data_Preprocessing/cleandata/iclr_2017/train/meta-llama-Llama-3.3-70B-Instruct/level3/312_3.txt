Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper proposes a novel approach to designing neural network architectures using a combination of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and reinforcement learning (RL). The authors introduce Neural Architecture Search, a method that uses an RNN to generate model descriptions of neural networks and trains this RNN with RL to maximize the expected accuracy of the generated architectures on a validation set. The approach is demonstrated on two benchmark datasets, CIFAR-10 and Penn Treebank, where it achieves state-of-the-art results.
Decision and Key Reasons
Based on the review, I decide to accept the paper with minor revisions. The two key reasons for this decision are:
1. Novelty and Impact: The paper proposes a novel and promising approach to neural architecture search, which has the potential to significantly impact the field of deep learning.
2. Strong Empirical Results: The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on two challenging benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results and outperforming human-designed architectures.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a clear and well-motivated introduction to the problem of neural architecture search, highlighting the limitations of current methods and the need for more flexible and automated approaches. The authors also provide a thorough review of related work, positioning their approach within the context of existing research.
The technical contributions of the paper are sound, and the authors provide a detailed description of their method, including the use of RNNs and RL to generate and optimize neural network architectures. The experimental results are impressive, demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach on two benchmark datasets.
Additional Feedback and Questions
To further improve the paper, I suggest the authors provide more analysis on the computational cost of their approach, including the training time and resources required to achieve the reported results. Additionally, it would be helpful to see more visualizations of the generated architectures and a more detailed comparison with human-designed architectures.
Some questions I would like the authors to address in their response include:
* How do the authors plan to extend their approach to more complex tasks and datasets, such as ImageNet or natural language processing tasks?
* Can the authors provide more insight into the optimization process, including the choice of hyperparameters and the convergence of the RL algorithm?
* How do the authors plan to make their approach more accessible to the broader research community, including the release of code and models?
