This paper introduces Deep Variational Bayes Filters (DVBF), a novel approach to learning state space models from raw non-Markovian sequence data. The authors propose a method that combines stochastic gradient variational Bayes with a reparametrization of the transition model, allowing for efficient inference and learning of latent dynamics. The paper is well-structured, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the methodology and its advantages over existing approaches.
The specific question tackled by the paper is how to learn latent state-space models from high-dimensional sequence data, such as images, while overcoming the challenges of intractable inference and non-Markovian observations. The approach is well-motivated, and the authors provide a thorough review of related work, highlighting the limitations of existing methods and the benefits of their proposed approach.
The paper supports its claims through a series of experiments on various environments, including a dynamic pendulum, a bouncing ball, and two bouncing balls. The results demonstrate that DVBF outperforms existing methods, such as Deep Kalman Filters, in recovering latent states with full information and achieving stable long-term predictions.
Based on the provided guidelines, I would accept this paper. The key reasons for this decision are:
1. The paper tackles a specific and relevant problem in the field of machine learning and provides a well-motivated approach to addressing it.
2. The methodology is sound, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the technical details and advantages of their approach.
3. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and its ability to outperform existing approaches.
To improve the paper, I would suggest the following:
* Provide more details on the implementation of the DVBF model, such as the architecture of the neural networks used and the hyperparameter settings.
* Consider adding more experiments or comparisons to other existing methods to further demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach.
* Clarify the relationship between the proposed method and other related work, such as the Embed to Control (E2C) method, and provide more discussion on the advantages and limitations of each approach.
Questions for the authors:
* Can you provide more details on the choice of hyperparameters and the optimization process used in the experiments?
* How do you plan to extend the proposed method to more complex and high-dimensional environments, such as those encountered in real-world applications?
* Can you provide more discussion on the potential applications and implications of the proposed method in fields such as robotics, control, and computer vision?
