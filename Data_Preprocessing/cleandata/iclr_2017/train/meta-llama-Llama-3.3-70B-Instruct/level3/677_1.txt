Summary of the Paper
The paper proposes a novel method called zoneout for regularizing Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). Zoneout stochastically preserves hidden units' activations, which helps to improve the robustness of RNNs to perturbations in the hidden state. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of zoneout on several tasks, including character-level and word-level language modeling, and classification on permuted sequential MNIST. They also show that zoneout outperforms other regularization methods, such as dropout and recurrent dropout, and achieves competitive or state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, with the main reason being the lack of comparison with state-of-the-art methods, such as Graph Kernels, and the failure to motivate the problem with potential applications. Although the paper proposes an interesting idea and has a clear organization, the evaluation is limited to a few tasks and does not provide a comprehensive comparison with other methods.
Supporting Arguments
The paper lacks a thorough comparison with other regularization methods, such as Graph Kernels, which are widely used in graph mining tasks. Additionally, the authors do not provide a clear motivation for the problem they are trying to solve, and the potential applications of zoneout are not well-explained. The experiments are also limited to a few tasks, and the results are not always consistent across different tasks. For example, the authors report that zoneout improves performance on character-level language modeling, but the results on word-level language modeling are not as strong.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, the authors should provide a more comprehensive comparison with other regularization methods, including Graph Kernels. They should also motivate the problem they are trying to solve and explain the potential applications of zoneout. Additionally, the authors should conduct more experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of zoneout on a wider range of tasks. The presentation of the paper could also be improved, with clearer explanations and fewer typos.
Questions for the Authors
I would like to ask the authors to clarify the following points:
* How does zoneout compare to other regularization methods, such as Graph Kernels, in terms of performance and computational efficiency?
* What are the potential applications of zoneout, and how can it be used in real-world scenarios?
* Can the authors provide more experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of zoneout on a wider range of tasks, including graph mining tasks?
* How does zoneout handle long-term dependencies in RNNs, and can it be used to improve the performance of RNNs on tasks that require long-term memory?
