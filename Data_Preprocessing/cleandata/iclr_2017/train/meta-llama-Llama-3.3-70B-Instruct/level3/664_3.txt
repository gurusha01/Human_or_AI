Summary
The paper proposes a novel approach to steganography using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), specifically introducing a 'steganalyser' element to the GAN model for detecting hidden messages. The authors claim that their Steganographic Generative Adversarial Networks (SGAN) model can generate image-like containers that are less susceptible to steganalysis, making it a potential tool for secure message embedding.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, primarily due to the lack of clarity on the premise and employment of the SGAN method, as well as the limited experiments and analysis presented.
Supporting Arguments
The paper lacks a clear explanation of the SGAN method's use-case and application, making it difficult to understand the significance of the proposed approach. Additionally, the experiments and analysis are limited, with only a few scenarios tested, and the results are not thoroughly explored. The paper also raises questions about the appropriateness of using the proposed method over others, such as HUGO, WOW, and LSB, and the impact of the seed value on the quality of results.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, the authors should provide a more detailed explanation of the SGAN method and its advantages over existing approaches. They should also conduct more extensive experiments, exploring the parameter space and comparing their method to other steganalysis techniques. Furthermore, the authors should address the questions raised about the seed value and its impact on the results.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
1. Can you provide a more detailed explanation of the SGAN method and its advantages over existing approaches?
2. How do you plan to address the issue of overfitting, which seems to be a problem in the current implementation?
3. Can you provide more extensive experiments, exploring the parameter space and comparing your method to other steganalysis techniques?
4. How does the seed value affect the quality of the results, and what measures can be taken to mitigate its impact?
