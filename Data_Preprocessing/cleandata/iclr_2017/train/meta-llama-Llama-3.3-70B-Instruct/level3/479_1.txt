Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper introduces a novel approach to neural architecture search, leveraging a recurrent neural network as a controller to generate and optimize neural network architectures. This method, termed Neural Architecture Search, demonstrates impressive results on both image classification (CIFAR-10) and language modeling (Penn Treebank) tasks, rivaling and even surpassing state-of-the-art models designed by humans. The approach's flexibility and ability to search variable-length architecture spaces make it a significant contribution to the field of deep learning.
Decision and Key Reasons
Based on the evaluation, I decide to Accept this paper. The primary reasons for this decision are:
1. Originality and Impact: The paper presents a genuinely novel approach to automating the design of neural network architectures, which has the potential to significantly impact the field by reducing the need for manual architecture design and potentially leading to more efficient and effective models.
2. Strong Empirical Performance: The method demonstrates strong performance on challenging benchmarks, outperforming or matching state-of-the-art models in several cases. This suggests that the approach is not only theoretically sound but also practically effective.
Supporting Arguments
- The paper is well-motivated, clearly explaining the need for automated architecture design and the limitations of current methods.
- The approach is well-placed within the literature, drawing on concepts from reinforcement learning, neural networks, and architecture search, while also contributing a new perspective.
- The experiments are comprehensive, covering both image classification and language modeling tasks, and including comparisons with state-of-the-art models and baselines like random search.
Additional Feedback for Improvement
To further enhance the paper, I suggest:
- Providing more details on the computational resources required for the distributed training setup, as this could be a limiting factor for replication or application in less resource-rich environments.
- Including a more in-depth analysis of the learned architectures, beyond just their performance metrics. Understanding the design principles or patterns that the controller learns could provide valuable insights for future architecture design.
- Considering the application of Neural Architecture Search to other domains or tasks, such as natural language processing or reinforcement learning, to demonstrate its broader applicability.
Questions for Clarification
To better understand certain aspects of the paper, I would like the authors to clarify:
- How the choice of hyperparameters for the controller (e.g., number of layers, hidden units) was determined, and whether these choices significantly impact the performance of the method.
- Whether there are any plans to release the code for the controller itself, in addition to the models found by the controller, to facilitate further research and development based on this work.
- How the method handles overfitting, especially given the large search space and the potential for the controller to overfit to the validation set used for reward calculation.
