This paper proposes a novel approach to learning activation functions in deep neural networks using nonparametric estimation. The authors introduce a class of nonparametric models for activation functions, which can be incorporated into the back-propagation framework, allowing for easy implementation. The paper also provides a theoretical justification for the choice of nonparametric activation functions and demonstrates that networks with these activation functions generalize well.
The specific question tackled by the paper is how to learn activation functions in deep neural networks, which is a crucial aspect of neural network design. The approach is well-motivated, as it addresses the limitation of current deep learning methods, which treat the choice of activation function as a hyper-parameter. The paper provides a thorough analysis of the proposed method, including a two-stage training process and a theoretical justification for the choice of nonparametric activation functions.
However, I decide to reject this paper due to two key reasons. Firstly, the paper lacks a clear comparison with existing methods, making it difficult to assess the significance of the proposed approach. Secondly, the experimental results, although promising, are limited to a few datasets and do not provide a comprehensive evaluation of the method's performance.
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide a more detailed comparison with existing methods, including a discussion of the advantages and limitations of their approach. Additionally, the authors should consider conducting more extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of their method on a wider range of datasets and tasks.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper include: How does the proposed method compare to existing approaches to learning activation functions, such as piecewise linear activation functions? What are the computational costs associated with the proposed method, and how do they compare to existing methods? How do the authors plan to address the potential limitations of their approach, such as the need for a two-stage training process? 
Overall, while the paper presents an interesting and novel approach to learning activation functions, it requires further development and evaluation to demonstrate its significance and effectiveness.
