Summary of the Paper
The paper proposes a novel approach to learning bilingual word vectors, which can be used to translate words from one language to another. The authors prove that the optimal linear transformation between word vector spaces should be orthogonal and can be obtained using the singular value decomposition (SVD) on a dictionary of translation pairs. They also introduce a new "inverted softmax" method for identifying translation pairs, which improves the accuracy of the predicted translations.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, with the main reason being that the approach, although well-motivated, does not significantly contribute to the existing work in this area. The use of SVD to obtain orthogonal transformations and the introduction of the inverted softmax are interesting, but the paper does not provide sufficient evidence to demonstrate the superiority of this approach over existing methods.
Supporting Arguments
The paper presents several experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, including the use of expert training dictionaries, pseudo-dictionaries, and aligned sentences. However, the results are not significantly better than those obtained using existing methods, such as CCA. Additionally, the paper does not provide a clear comparison with other state-of-the-art methods, making it difficult to assess the contribution of the proposed approach.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, the authors should provide a more detailed comparison with existing methods, including a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of each approach. They should also consider providing more experimental results, including evaluations on different languages and datasets. Furthermore, the authors should clarify the relationship between the proposed approach and other methods, such as CCA, and provide a more detailed analysis of the results.
