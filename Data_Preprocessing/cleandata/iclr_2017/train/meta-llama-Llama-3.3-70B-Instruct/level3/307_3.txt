This paper introduces a new dataset for evaluating end-to-end goal-oriented dialog systems in a restaurant setting. The authors aim to rank candidate responses for each turn of the dialog, which is a more limited goal than generating responses. The paper's contribution is interesting, but the reviewer is skeptical about the utility of end-to-end trained systems in narrow-domain settings, where domain knowledge can be used to engineer better systems.
The reviewer's decision is to accept the paper, with the key reason being that the contribution is interesting and worthy of publication, despite some limitations. The paper provides a new dataset and a thorough evaluation of different approaches for generating adversarial examples, which is a valuable contribution to the field.
The reviewer provides several supporting arguments for this decision. Firstly, the paper's focus on ranking responses rather than generating them limits its potential for generalization to new domains. Secondly, the method of obtaining candidate responses in practice is unclear, and it is unclear how this would be done in a new domain without manual re-engineering. Finally, the use of a simulation to generate data constrains the variability in training responses, and the reviewer suggests publishing the list of rules used for NL-generation to increase transparency.
The reviewer also provides additional feedback to improve the paper. They suggest that the authors consider generating responses instead of ranking them, which would allow for better generalization to new domains. They also ask the authors to clarify how they plan to obtain candidate responses in practice and to provide more details on the simulation used to generate data.
The reviewer asks several questions to clarify their understanding of the paper, including: How do the authors plan to use the ranked responses in a real-world dialog system? How do they plan to handle out-of-vocabulary words or unseen scenarios? What is the potential impact of the proposed approach on the development of more robust dialog systems? 
Overall, the reviewer finds the paper to be a valuable contribution to the field, despite some limitations, and suggests several ways to improve it.
