Summary
The paper proposes a novel approach to constructing a tree of life for biological species using deep neural networks. The authors leverage the hierarchical feature representation learned by convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to quantify the visual similarity of species and build a phylogenetic tree. The method is based on the intuition that if two species share similar features, their cross activations in the softmax layer should be high. The authors conduct experiments on a small scale with limited species and classes, and demonstrate that their approach can construct a tree of life that is competitive with human-built trees based on visual similarity.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the technical novelty of the paper is limited, as most parts of the pipeline are standard, including the use of pre-trained models for feature extraction and previous methods for hierarchical clustering. Secondly, the experiments are conducted on a small scale with limited species and classes, and lack quantitative results, relying only on visualization and comparison with WordNet.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's approach, while interesting, is not particularly novel or groundbreaking. The use of CNNs for feature extraction and hierarchical clustering is a well-established technique, and the authors do not provide significant new insights or improvements to these methods. Furthermore, the experiments are limited in scope and scale, which makes it difficult to evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of the approach. The lack of quantitative results and reliance on visualization and comparison with WordNet also makes it challenging to assess the performance of the method.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, I would suggest that the authors conduct more extensive experiments on a larger scale with diverse species and classes. They should also provide quantitative results and evaluate their approach using established metrics, such as precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, the authors could explore more advanced techniques for feature extraction and hierarchical clustering, such as using attention mechanisms or graph-based methods. Finally, the authors should provide more detailed analysis and discussion of their results, including the limitations and potential biases of their approach.
Questions for the Authors
I would like to ask the authors to clarify the following points:
* How do the authors plan to scale their approach to larger datasets and more diverse species?
* What are the limitations and potential biases of their approach, and how do they plan to address these issues?
* Can the authors provide more quantitative results and evaluation metrics to assess the performance of their method?
* How do the authors plan to improve the technical novelty and significance of their approach, given the limited innovation in the current pipeline?
