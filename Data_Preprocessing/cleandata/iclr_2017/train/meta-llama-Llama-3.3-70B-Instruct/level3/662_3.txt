The paper proposes a thorough evaluation of various factors that impact the effectiveness of features extracted from Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for instance-level image retrieval tasks. The authors investigate five key factors: feature aggregation and normalization, output layer selection, image resizing, multi-scale feature representation, and PCA and whitening. 
I decide to accept this paper with two key reasons: the paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the factors affecting CNN-based image retrieval, and the proposed multi-scale image representation method demonstrates superior performance over existing methods on four benchmark datasets. 
The paper's strengths include its extensive experimentation, detailed analysis, and the proposal of a new multi-scale image representation method. The authors' findings on the impact of different factors on retrieval performance are well-motivated and well-placed in the literature. The results are correct, and the methodology is scientifically rigorous. 
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors consider additional experiments on other real-world tasks to validate the proposed approach and increase its overall impact. It would also be beneficial to provide more insights into the computational cost and efficiency of the proposed method, as well as its potential applications in other computer vision tasks. 
I would like the authors to answer the following questions to clarify my understanding of the paper: (1) How do the authors plan to extend their work to other computer vision tasks, such as object detection and segmentation? (2) Can the authors provide more details on the computational cost and efficiency of their proposed method, particularly in comparison to existing methods? (3) How do the authors think their work can be applied to real-world image retrieval tasks, and what are the potential challenges and limitations? 
These questions will help me better understand the paper's contributions and provide more constructive feedback to the authors. Overall, the paper is well-written, and the authors have made a significant contribution to the field of image retrieval.
