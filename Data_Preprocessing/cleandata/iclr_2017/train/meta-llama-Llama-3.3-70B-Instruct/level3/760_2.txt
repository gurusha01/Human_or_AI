This paper presents an innovative approach to learning object representations by composing templates learned from binary images using a hierarchical model. The authors propose a protocol to test whether a convolutional neural network (CNN) understands the concepts of a chess game, such as the chessboard grid, winning rule, and two sides, by training the network on rendered tic-tac-toe chessboards with weak labels and analyzing the learned representations using class activation mapping (CAM). The results show that the network's attention is fixed on the chessboard grids and can predict the right move to finish the game, indicating that the network has learned the concepts of the game.
However, I decide to reject this paper due to two key reasons. Firstly, the paper fails to provide a thorough discussion of relevant literature, claiming to be the first to learn interpretable parts without comparing to existing works. Secondly, the experimental evaluation is limited to toy datasets, and the approach is not applied to real images or compared to other generative models like VAE and GANS.
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide a more comprehensive discussion of related works, including concept learning, cross-modal supervision, and class activation mapping. Additionally, the authors should apply their approach to more complex datasets and compare their results to other state-of-the-art models. The technical discussion and algorithm should be moved from the appendix to the main paper for better clarity.
I would like to ask the authors to clarify the following points: How does the proposed approach relate to sum product networks, grammars, and the Deep Rendering model? What are the optimization constraints during message passing, and how are the learning and inference algorithms optimized? How do the authors plan to address the limitations of their approach, including the lack of comparison to other models and the limited experimental evaluation? 
Overall, while the paper presents an interesting approach to learning object representations, it requires significant improvements in terms of literature review, experimental evaluation, and technical discussion to be considered for acceptance.
