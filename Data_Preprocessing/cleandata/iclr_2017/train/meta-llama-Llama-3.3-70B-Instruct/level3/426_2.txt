This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of bilingual word representation learning, providing a unified framework for offline bilingual representation learning and introducing several key innovations. The authors prove that the optimal linear transformation between word vector spaces should be orthogonal and can be obtained using the singular value decomposition (SVD) on a dictionary of translation pairs. They also introduce a novel "inverted softmax" approach, which significantly improves the accuracy of predicted translations.
The paper's key contributions include a theoretical framework for offline bilingual representation learning, the introduction of the inverted softmax, and the use of cognate words to learn bilingual representations without expert bilingual signal. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach at both the word and sentence levels, achieving state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks.
Based on the conference guidelines, I will answer the three key questions:
1. What is the specific question/problem tackled by the paper? 
The paper tackles the problem of learning bilingual word representations in an offline setting without direct word-to-word alignments between source and target languages.
2. Is the approach well motivated, including being well-placed in the literature? 
Yes, the approach is well-motivated, and the paper provides a clear and thorough review of the existing literature on bilingual word representation learning.
3. Does the paper support the claims? 
Yes, the paper provides extensive experimental results to support its claims, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach on several benchmarks.
Based on these questions, I decide to Accept this paper. The paper presents a significant contribution to the field, and the authors provide a clear and well-motivated approach that is supported by extensive experimental results.
To improve the paper, I suggest the following:
* Clarify the header for table 3 to make it easier to understand the results.
* Provide additional results in the appendix to further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
* Consider adding an additional experiment using both expert and cognate dictionaries to further evaluate the robustness of the proposed approach.
I would like the authors to answer the following questions to clarify my understanding of the paper:
* Can you provide more details on how the inverted softmax approach mitigates the hubness problem?
* How do you plan to extend the proposed approach to more diverse language pairs, where the number of identical character strings may be limited?
* Can you provide more insights into the results in table 6, specifically the differences between the rows and the performance of the inverted softmax approach?
