Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper proposes a novel deep learning model, GRU-D, which effectively handles missing values in multivariate time series data by incorporating masking and time interval directly into the GRU architecture. The model captures informative missingness and achieves state-of-the-art performance on real-world healthcare datasets, including MIMIC-III and PhysioNet. The authors demonstrate the model's ability to exploit missing patterns, make online predictions, and scale with growing data sizes.
Decision: Accept
The paper tackles a specific question of handling missing values in time series data, which is a common problem in many applications.

Supporting Arguments
1. Effective handling of missing values: The paper proposes a novel approach to handle missing values by incorporating masking and time interval into the GRU architecture. The experiments demonstrate that this approach outperforms existing methods, including mean imputation, forward imputation, and simple concatenation of masking and time interval vectors.
2. State-of-the-art performance: The GRU-D model achieves state-of-the-art performance on real-world healthcare datasets, including MIMIC-III and PhysioNet, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing informative missingness.
3. Online prediction and scalability: The paper demonstrates the model's ability to make online predictions and scale with growing data sizes, making it suitable for real-world applications.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, the authors could:
1. Provide more insights into the decay mechanism: The paper introduces a decay mechanism to capture the temporal missing patterns, but more insights into how this mechanism works and how it is learned from the data would be helpful.
2. Compare with other deep learning models: While the paper compares the GRU-D model with other RNN-based models, it would be interesting to see how it performs compared to other deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or transformers.
3. Explore applications beyond healthcare: The paper focuses on healthcare applications, but the proposed model could be applied to other domains where missing values are a common problem. Exploring these applications could provide further insights into the model's effectiveness.
Questions for the Authors
1. Can you provide more details on how the decay mechanism is learned from the data, and how it adapts to different missing patterns?
2. How do you plan to extend the GRU-D model to handle more complex missing patterns, such as non-random missingness or missing values with temporal dependencies?
3. Have you considered applying the GRU-D model to other domains, such as finance or climate science, where missing values are a common problem?
