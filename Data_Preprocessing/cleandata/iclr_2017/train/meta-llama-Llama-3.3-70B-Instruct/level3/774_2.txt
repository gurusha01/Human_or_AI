Summary of the Paper
The paper proposes a novel deep pedestrian detection method based on the Fast R-CNN framework, which utilizes batch normalization to reduce training time and improve generalization performance. The EdgeBoxes algorithm is used to generate high-quality region proposals, and the model is trained on the INRIA dataset and evaluated on both INRIA and ETH datasets. The results show that the proposed method achieves satisfactory performance comparable to other state-of-the-art methods.
Decision
I decide to accept this paper, with the main reason being that it presents a well-motivated approach to pedestrian detection, leveraging the strengths of both Fast R-CNN and batch normalization. The use of EdgeBoxes for region proposal generation is also a good choice, given its efficiency and effectiveness.
Supporting Arguments
The paper is well-structured and easy to follow, with clear explanations of the proposed method and its components. The experimental results are thorough and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on two benchmark datasets. The use of batch normalization is well-justified, and the authors provide a good analysis of the benefits of using this technique in the context of pedestrian detection.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the implementation of the EdgeBoxes algorithm and its parameters. Additionally, it would be helpful to include more visualizations of the detection results, such as examples of successful and failed detections, to provide a better understanding of the method's strengths and weaknesses. Furthermore, the authors may want to consider evaluating their method on more datasets, such as the Caltech Pedestrian Dataset, to demonstrate its generalizability.
Questions for the Authors
1. Can you provide more details on the hyperparameter tuning process for the batch normalization layer and the EdgeBoxes algorithm?
2. How do you plan to address the issue of detecting pedestrians in low-resolution images, which was mentioned as an open issue in the conclusion?
3. Have you considered using other region proposal generation algorithms, such as Selective Search, and if so, why did you choose EdgeBoxes over them?
