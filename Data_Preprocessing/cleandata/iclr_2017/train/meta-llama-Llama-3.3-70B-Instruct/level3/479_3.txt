Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper proposes a novel approach to neural architecture search, using a recurrent neural network as a controller to generate model descriptions of neural networks. The controller is trained with reinforcement learning to maximize the expected accuracy of the generated architectures on a validation set. The approach has been successfully applied to image classification on CIFAR-10 and language modeling on Penn Treebank, achieving state-of-the-art results.
Decision and Key Reasons
I decide to Accept this paper, with two key reasons: (1) the approach is well-motivated and has a strong empirical performance on challenging benchmarks, and (2) the paper provides a clear and detailed description of the methodology and experiments.
Supporting Arguments
The paper tackles the specific question of automatically finding good neural network architectures, which is a fundamental problem in deep learning. The approach is well-placed in the literature, building on existing work in reinforcement learning and neural architecture search. The paper provides a thorough evaluation of the approach, including comparisons with state-of-the-art models and ablation studies. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in finding high-performing architectures.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest including results from CNN/Daily Mail for a more comprehensive comparison with existing models. Additionally, visualizing the entire M^q sequence over time could help understand the query regression and its human interpretability, making the model more transparent and explainable.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions: (1) How do the authors plan to extend the approach to more complex tasks, such as object detection or segmentation? (2) Can the authors provide more details on the computational resources required to train the controller and the child networks? (3) How do the authors plan to make the approach more efficient and scalable to larger models and datasets?
