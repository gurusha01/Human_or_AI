Summary
The paper proposes a novel approach to improve language modeling by incorporating a cache model on top of a pre-trained recurrent neural network (RNN). The neural cache model stores past hidden activations as memory and accesses them through a dot product with the current hidden activation, allowing for efficient and scalable adaptation to recent history. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on multiple datasets, including Penn Treebank, WikiText-2, and WikiText-103, and show significant performance gains over standard RNN models and other memory-augmented neural networks.
Decision
I recommend accepting this paper due to its interesting findings and thorough analysis. The paper tackles a specific question of how to improve language modeling by adapting to recent history, and the approach is well-motivated and well-placed in the literature. The results are convincing, and the authors provide extensive analysis of hyperparameters and comparisons with other models.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a clear and concise introduction to the problem of language modeling and the limitations of standard RNN models. The authors propose a simple yet effective solution, the neural cache model, which is easy to implement and requires no additional training. The experiments are well-designed, and the results are impressive, showing significant improvements over baseline models. The paper also provides a thorough analysis of hyperparameters and comparisons with other models, which helps to understand the strengths and limitations of the proposed approach.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I would suggest providing more insights into the interpretation of the neural cache model and its relationship to other memory-augmented neural networks. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more experiments on other datasets and tasks, such as machine translation or question answering, to demonstrate the generalizability of the proposed approach. The authors may also consider providing more details on the computational cost and efficiency of the neural cache model, as well as its potential applications in real-world scenarios.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like to ask the authors the following questions:
1. Can you provide more insights into the choice of the dot product as the memory lookup operator, and how it compares to other possible operators?
2. How do you think the neural cache model can be extended to other sequence prediction tasks, such as machine translation or question answering?
3. Can you provide more details on the computational cost and efficiency of the neural cache model, and how it compares to other memory-augmented neural networks?
