Summary
The paper proposes a novel adversarial learning formulation that enables the discriminator to retain density information, allowing it to be used as a general-purpose probabilistic generative model. The authors provide a rigorous characterization of the learned discriminator in the non-parametric setting and propose two methods for instantiating it in the parametric setting. The experimental results verify the theoretical analysis and show that the proposed model can obtain samples of state-of-the-art quality.
Decision
I decide to Accept this paper with minor revisions.
Reasons
The paper tackles a specific question/problem, which is the limitation of adversarial learning approaches in providing sensible energy estimates for samples. The approach is well-motivated, and the authors provide a clear and thorough analysis of the proposed formulation. The experimental results are convincing, and the paper is well-written and easy to follow.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a rigorous theoretical analysis of the proposed formulation, which is a significant strength. The authors also provide a thorough comparison with existing methods, such as GANs and energy-based GANs, and demonstrate the advantages of their approach. The experimental results are well-presented and convincing, showing that the proposed model can obtain high-quality samples and retain density information.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more detailed analysis of the limitations of their approach and potential future directions. Additionally, it would be helpful to include more visualizations of the learned discriminator and generator distributions to provide a better understanding of the proposed model's behavior.
Questions for the Authors
1. Can you provide more details on the choice of the regularization term K(pgen) and its impact on the learned discriminator?
2. How do you plan to address the potential issue of mode collapse in the proposed model?
3. Can you provide more insights on the relationship between the proposed formulation and existing methods, such as variational autoencoders and flow-based models?
