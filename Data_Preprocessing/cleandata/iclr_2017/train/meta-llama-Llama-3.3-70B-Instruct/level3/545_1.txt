Summary
The paper proposes a new learning model called Compositional Kernel Machines (CKMs) that extends classic kernel machines using sum-product networks and compositional kernel functions. CKMs aim to address the limitations of deep architectures and other kernel methods by providing a more efficient and effective way to learn nonlinear concepts. The authors demonstrate the potential of CKMs on several image classification tasks, including the NORB dataset, and show promising results compared to deep methods.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the experiments presented in the paper are preliminary and lack competitive results on standard benchmarks such as MNIST, CIFAR10/100, and Imagenet. Secondly, the comparison to convnets is questionable, particularly in the NORB compositions experiment, where the use of sparse ORB features may have given CKMs an advantage.
Supporting Arguments
While the idea of CKMs is intriguing, the paper falls short in demonstrating its effectiveness on a wide range of tasks. The authors rely heavily on the NORB dataset, which is a relatively small and simple dataset. The results on this dataset, although promising, do not necessarily generalize to more complex and large-scale datasets. Furthermore, the comparison to convnets is not thorough, and the authors do not provide a clear explanation of why CKMs should be preferred over convnets in certain scenarios.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors conduct more extensive experiments on a variety of datasets, including standard benchmarks such as MNIST, CIFAR10/100, and Imagenet. Additionally, the authors should provide a more detailed comparison to convnets, including an analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of each approach. The authors may also consider exploring other applications of CKMs, such as structured prediction, regression, and reinforcement learning problems.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper and provide additional evidence, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
1. How do the authors plan to address the limited representation power of CKMs, which build on top of feature descriptors, unlike convnets which learn kernels directly from data?
2. Can the authors provide more details on the experimental setup and hyperparameter tuning for the NORB compositions experiment?
3. How do the authors envision CKMs being used in practice, particularly in scenarios where data is scarce or noisy?
