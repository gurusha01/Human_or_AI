Summary
The paper proposes a Generative Multi-Adversarial Network (GMAN) framework, which extends the traditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to multiple discriminators. The authors explore various design perspectives, ranging from a formidable adversary to a forgiving teacher, and introduce a generative multi-adversarial metric (GMAM) to evaluate the performance of GMAN. The experimental results demonstrate that GMAN achieves faster convergence to a higher quality steady state on various image generation tasks, including MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CelebA.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the paper lacks clarity on the authors' objective and how it relates to the original GAN objective. Secondly, the relationship between the retrieval objective and the "CCA layer" is unclear, and the authors fail to provide a convincing justification for why the original gradient computation is problematic.
Supporting Arguments
The paper proposes a novel framework, GMAN, which has the potential to improve the training of GANs. However, the authors fail to provide a clear explanation of how GMAN differs from the original GAN objective and how it addresses the challenges of training GANs. Additionally, the introduction of multiple discriminators and the softmax function is not well-motivated, and the authors do not provide a convincing argument for why this approach is necessary.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide a clearer explanation of the GMAN framework and its relationship to the original GAN objective. They should also provide more details on the experimental setup and the evaluation metrics used. Furthermore, the authors should consider adding a comparison with other state-of-the-art GAN variants and provide a more detailed analysis of the results.
Questions
I would like the authors to answer the following questions to clarify my understanding of the paper:
1. Can you provide a clear explanation of how GMAN differs from the original GAN objective and how it addresses the challenges of training GANs?
2. How do you justify the introduction of multiple discriminators and the softmax function, and what are the benefits of this approach?
3. Can you provide more details on the experimental setup and the evaluation metrics used, and how do you ensure that the results are reproducible?
