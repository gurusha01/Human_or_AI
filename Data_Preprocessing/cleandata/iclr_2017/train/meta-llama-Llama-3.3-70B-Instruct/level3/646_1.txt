Summary
The paper introduces a novel neural network architecture called FractalNet, which is based on self-similarity and can be used to build ultra-deep neural networks without the need for residual learning. The authors demonstrate that FractalNet can match the performance of standard residual networks on both CIFAR and ImageNet classification tasks. They also introduce a new regularization technique called drop-path, which can be used to regularize fractal networks and provide a means of enforcing speed vs. accuracy tradeoffs.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the QA model presented is not novel and bears a strong resemblance to existing models, which raises concerns about the originality of the work. Secondly, the IQA model is impractical due to its requirement for human interaction in the training process, which is either too labor-intensive or not truly interactive if questions are predefined.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's contribution to the field of neural networks is limited by the lack of novelty in the QA model. While the authors demonstrate that FractalNet can match the performance of standard residual networks, they do not provide sufficient evidence to show that their approach is significantly better or more efficient. Additionally, the impracticality of the IQA model raises concerns about the scalability and applicability of the approach.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, the authors could provide more detailed comparisons with existing models and techniques, and demonstrate the advantages of their approach more clearly. They could also consider alternative evaluation metrics and provide more analysis of the results. Furthermore, the authors could explore ways to make the IQA model more practical and efficient, such as automating the question generation process or using more advanced techniques for human-computer interaction.
Questions for the Authors
I would like to ask the authors to clarify the following points:
* How do the authors plan to address the lack of novelty in the QA model, and what steps will they take to demonstrate the originality of their work?
* Can the authors provide more details on how the IQA model can be made more practical and efficient, and what alternatives they have considered?
* How do the authors plan to evaluate the performance of FractalNet in more complex and real-world scenarios, and what metrics will they use to measure its success?
