Summary of the Paper's Claims and Contributions
The paper proposes a novel deep learning model, GRU-D, which effectively exploits informative missingness patterns in multivariate time series data. The model is based on Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) and incorporates two representations of missing patterns: masking and time interval. The authors claim that their model outperforms existing approaches, including GRU-mean, GRU-forward, and GRU-simple, on several real-world healthcare datasets, including MIMIC-III and PhysioNet.
Decision and Key Reasons
Based on the review, I decide to Reject the paper. The two key reasons for this decision are:
1. Lack of Novelty: The paper's approach, although well-motivated, is not novel enough, as character information and residual networks have been applied in previous works.
2. Insufficient Evaluation: The paper lacks competitive baselines for comparison, and the evaluation is not thorough enough, with unclear creation and domain of the "Question" dataset.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's approach, although well-motivated, is not significantly different from existing works. The use of masking and time interval to capture missing patterns is a good idea, but it has been explored in previous research. The paper's evaluation is also limited, with no comparison to state-of-the-art models on widely used datasets for short text classification.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, the authors should:
1. Conduct a more thorough literature review to better position their work in the context of existing research.
2. Evaluate their model on more datasets, including widely used benchmarks for short text classification.
3. Compare their model to state-of-the-art approaches to demonstrate its effectiveness.
4. Provide more details on the creation and domain of the "Question" dataset to ensure reproducibility.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the proposed GRU-D model differ from existing approaches that use masking and time interval to capture missing patterns?
2. Can the authors provide more details on the creation and domain of the "Question" dataset?
3. How do the authors plan to address the lack of novelty in their approach and demonstrate the effectiveness of their model compared to state-of-the-art approaches?
