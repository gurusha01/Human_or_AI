Summary of the Paper
The paper claims to provide a thorough evaluation of various factors that impact the effectiveness of features extracted from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image retrieval tasks. The authors propose a new multi-scale image representation method and demonstrate its superiority over existing methods on four datasets.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the paper does not provide new insights, as it concatenates existing methods and performs parameter tweaking to achieve state-of-the-art results, which is not sufficiently novel or interesting for the community. Secondly, the setting of the state-of-the-art results is misleading, as it is mainly due to the usage of the deeper VGG-19 network rather than the choice of parameters.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's conclusions may not be applicable to other networks, such as ResNet or Inception, and the parameter tweaking was only done on the Oxford dataset. The lack of comparison with other papers, such as Gordo et al and Radenovic et al, is notable, and the authors' arguments for not training their networks are not convincing. The paper's contribution is limited, as it only confirms existing knowledge, such as using the last conv layer, original image sizes, and PCA with whitening. The paper's title is misleading, as it claims to provide "best practices for CNNs" but only considers a single CNN architecture, VGG-19.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, the authors should consider comparing their method with other state-of-the-art methods, such as those using ResNet or Inception architectures. They should also provide more detailed analysis of the impact of different factors on the retrieval performances and explore the applicability of their method to other datasets. Furthermore, the authors should clarify the novelty of their contribution and provide more convincing arguments for not training their networks.
Questions for the Authors
I would like the authors to answer the following questions to clarify my understanding of the paper:
1. How do the authors plan to extend their method to other CNN architectures, such as ResNet or Inception?
2. Can the authors provide more detailed analysis of the impact of different factors on the retrieval performances, such as the effect of changing the number of scales or the weighting method?
3. How do the authors plan to address the limitation of their method, which is only applicable to the Oxford dataset?
