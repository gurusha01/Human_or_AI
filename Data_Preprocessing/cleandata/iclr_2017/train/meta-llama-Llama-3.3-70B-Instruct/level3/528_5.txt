Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper proposes a novel deep learning model, GRU-D, which effectively handles missing values in multivariate time series data by incorporating masking and time interval directly into the GRU architecture. The model captures informative missingness and achieves state-of-the-art performance on real-world healthcare datasets, including MIMIC-III and PhysioNet. The authors demonstrate the model's ability to exploit missing patterns, make online predictions, and scale with growing data sizes.
