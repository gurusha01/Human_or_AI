Summary
The paper proposes a novel approach to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) by introducing the concept of frames, which are a generalization of orthogonal bases. The authors argue that using frames as a basis for representing sensory data can lead to improved performance and additional properties, such as steerability. They also propose Dynamic Steerable Frame Networks (DSFNs), which combine the advantages of steerable function spaces with the power of neural network function estimators. The paper presents experiments on image classification, edge detection, and video classification tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the paper's performance is sensitive to hyperparameters, and poor choices can lead to drastic performance drops. Secondly, the paper contains typos, formatting issues, and unclear phrasing, making it hard to understand in some places.
Supporting Arguments
The proposed regularization technique for k-shot learning uses orthogonal grouping of units in a neural network, which is an interesting approach. However, the method's performance is highly dependent on the choice of hyperparameters alpha and beta. The best performance is obtained with a group size ratio of 0.5, which seems unusual and contradicts the motivation of the approach. Furthermore, the paper lacks clarity in some sections, and the role of θ_map in the proposed method is not well-explained. The clustering process is also not clearly described, and it is unclear why the authors visualize filter grouping while the algorithm groups activations.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, the authors should provide more detailed explanations of the proposed method, including the role of θ_map and the clustering process. They should also conduct more experiments to demonstrate the robustness of the approach to different hyperparameter choices. Additionally, the authors should proofread the paper carefully to eliminate typos and formatting issues.
Questions for the Authors
1. Can you provide more insight into the role of θ_map in the proposed method and how it affects the learning process?
2. How do you justify the choice of group size ratio of 0.5, and have you explored other ratios?
3. Can you provide more details on the clustering process and why you visualize filter grouping instead of activation grouping?
4. How do you plan to address the sensitivity of the method to hyperparameter choices, and have you considered using hyperparameter tuning techniques?
