Summary
The paper proposes a novel approach to distributed stochastic optimization, called synchronous stochastic optimization with backup workers, which aims to mitigate the straggler effect in synchronous optimization while avoiding gradient staleness. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through empirical evaluations on several deep learning models, including Inception and PixelCNN, and show that it outperforms asynchronous stochastic optimization in terms of test accuracy and convergence speed.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, primarily due to two reasons. Firstly, the paper exceeds the page limit, which makes it difficult to follow and understand. Secondly, the introduction is poorly motivated and contains too much background information, which could be condensed for better clarity.
Supporting Arguments
The paper raises an interesting question about the existence of adversarial examples in generative models and how they can be defined. However, the discovery of adversarial examples in generative models, or the lack thereof, would be a significant result, whether positive or negative. The adversarial examples presented in the paper appear convincing but seem noisier than those found in other models, potentially indicating a difference in difficulty. Furthermore, the paper's title is misleading, which could burden future research on other types of generative models.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors condense the introduction and focus on the key contributions of the paper. Additionally, the authors should provide more detailed explanations of their approach and empirical evaluations, and consider adding more visualizations to help illustrate their results. The authors should also address the issue of the paper's title and ensure that it accurately reflects the content of the paper.
Questions for the Authors
I would like the authors to clarify the following points:
1. How do the authors plan to address the issue of the paper's title and ensure that it accurately reflects the content of the paper?
2. Can the authors provide more detailed explanations of their approach and empirical evaluations, and consider adding more visualizations to help illustrate their results?
3. How do the authors plan to condense the introduction and focus on the key contributions of the paper, while still providing sufficient background information for readers who may not be familiar with the topic?
