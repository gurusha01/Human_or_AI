This paper proposes a novel approach to few-shot learning using a meta-learner model based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The authors claim that their model is able to learn an optimization algorithm that can quickly generalize to new tasks with few examples, outperforming traditional gradient-based optimization methods. 
I decide to reject this paper, primarily due to two key reasons. Firstly, the paper's claim of being "cortical inspired" is troublesome and lacks direct evidence from neuroscience to support the idea of open bigrams constituting a separate layer in the cortex for handwriting recognition, which is not the focus of this paper. Secondly, the model used in the paper is not clearly explained, with important details such as the objective function and network output missing from the description.
The comparison between the proposed model and the baseline Viterbi decoder is not fair, as the Viterbi decoder only has access to unigrams, while the proposed model has access to more information. The dataset used in the paper appears to be biased in favor of the proposed approach, with longer words and limited data, which raises concerns about the validity of the results. Additionally, the paper contains several minor errors, including typos and inconsistencies in the presentation of results.
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details about the model architecture, including the objective function and network output. They should also consider using a more balanced dataset and providing a more fair comparison with baseline models. Furthermore, the authors could explore the use of additional techniques, such as data augmentation or transfer learning, to improve the performance of their model.
I would like the authors to answer the following questions to clarify my understanding of the paper: (1) Can you provide more details about the objective function used to train the meta-learner model? (2) How do you ensure that the meta-learner model is not overfitting to the training data? (3) Can you provide more information about the dataset used in the experiments, including the number of classes and examples per class? (4) How do you plan to extend the model to more challenging scenarios, such as few-shot learning with many classes or few examples per class?
