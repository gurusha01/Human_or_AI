Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper proposes a novel method for finding dependent subspaces across multiple views of data, with a focus on preserving neighborhood relationships between data points. The method, which the authors call "dependent neighborhoods of views," directly maximizes the similarity of neighborhoods between subspaces of each view, using a well-defined objective function that favors sparse and informative neighborhoods. The approach is shown to outperform existing methods, such as Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) and Locality Preserving CCA (LPCCA), in experiments on artificial and real-world data sets.
Decision: Accept
I decide to accept this paper because it presents a well-motivated and novel approach to a important problem in data analysis, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the method in preserving neighborhood relationships between views.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a clear and well-written introduction to the problem of finding dependent subspaces across multiple views, and motivates the need for a new approach that focuses on preserving neighborhood relationships. The proposed method is well-defined and easy to understand, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of its properties and extensions. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the method in a variety of settings, including artificial and real-world data sets, and the results are compared to existing methods to show the advantages of the proposed approach.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the optimization technique used to maximize the objective function, and consider providing more visualizations of the results to help illustrate the effectiveness of the method. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more experiments on larger and more complex data sets to demonstrate the scalability of the approach.
Questions for the Authors
I would like to ask the authors to clarify the following points:
* How do the authors choose the parameter Ïƒi,V in the neighbor probability distribution, and what is the effect of different choices on the results?
* Can the authors provide more details on the computational complexity of the method, and how it compares to existing methods?
* How do the authors plan to extend the method to handle nonlinear transformations and more complex data sets?
