Summary
The paper proposes a novel framework for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) by introducing the concept of frames, which are a generalization of orthogonal bases. The authors argue that using frames as a basis for representing sensory data can lead to improved performance and additional properties, such as steerability, which allows for continuous transformation of features. The paper also introduces Dynamic Steerable Frame Networks (DSFNs), which combine the advantages of steerable function spaces with the power of neural network function estimators.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the paper's contribution, although novel and interesting, is not significantly different from existing work on steerable filters and CNNs. Secondly, the experimental results, although promising, are limited to only two datasets, Cifar-10+ and Cambridge Hand-Gesture, and do not provide a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed framework.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's contribution is built upon existing work on steerable filters and CNNs, and the authors do not provide a clear justification for why their approach is significantly different or better than existing methods. The experimental results, although promising, are limited in scope and do not provide a thorough evaluation of the proposed framework. Additionally, the paper could benefit from more detailed analysis and discussion of the results, as well as a more comprehensive comparison with existing methods.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide a more detailed analysis and discussion of the results, as well as a more comprehensive comparison with existing methods. Additionally, the authors could consider evaluating their framework on more datasets and tasks, such as image classification, object detection, and segmentation, to demonstrate its generalizability and effectiveness. The authors could also provide more insight into the choice of frames and steering functions, and how they affect the performance of the network.
Questions for the Authors
I would like to ask the authors to clarify the following points:
* How do the authors choose the frames and steering functions, and what is the intuition behind their choice?
* Can the authors provide more insight into the computational cost and memory requirements of the proposed framework, and how it compares to existing methods?
* How do the authors plan to extend their framework to more complex tasks and datasets, such as image classification, object detection, and segmentation?
