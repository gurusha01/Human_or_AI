Summary
The paper proposes a systematic investigation of different context types and representations for learning word embeddings, a crucial aspect of natural language processing. The authors aim to provide a comprehensive evaluation of various context definitions and their effectiveness across multiple tasks and datasets, ultimately offering a guideline for context selection in the community.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, with the primary reason being that the approach, although well-motivated, lacks a thorough comparison to existing, more advanced models. Additionally, the absence of baselines from readily available models undermines the paper's contribution.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's contribution, while valuable, is unclear due to the insufficient comparison to more advanced models like Neural Turing Machine and Neural GPU. The authors' evaluation of context types and representations, although comprehensive, may not provide significant insights without a thorough comparison to existing state-of-the-art models. Furthermore, the lack of baselines from existing models makes it challenging to assess the paper's claims and results.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, I suggest the authors conduct a more thorough comparison to existing models, including advanced architectures like Neural Turing Machine and Neural GPU. Additionally, incorporating baselines from readily available models would strengthen the paper's contribution and results. The authors may also consider exploring more complex tasks and datasets to further demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper and provide additional evidence, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
1. How do the authors plan to address the lack of comparison to more advanced models, and what specific models do they intend to include in their evaluation?
2. Can the authors provide more details on the datasets and tasks used in their evaluation, and how they were selected?
3. How do the authors envision their work being used as a guideline for context selection in the community, and what specific recommendations do they plan to provide?
