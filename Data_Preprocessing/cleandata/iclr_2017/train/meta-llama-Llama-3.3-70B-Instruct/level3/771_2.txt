Summary
The paper proposes a novel approach to improve word representations by leveraging an external lexicon and determining the most appropriate paraphrase in a given context. The authors introduce a fuzzy approach to control the contamination caused by polysemous words, annotating each paraphrase with a degree of reliability based on multilingual similarities. The method is evaluated on several benchmarks, including word similarity datasets and word analogical reasoning tasks, and is shown to outperform prior works.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, primarily due to two key reasons. Firstly, the writing style and grammar are unclear and unintelligible at times, making it difficult to understand the ideas being communicated. Secondly, the evaluation of the paper is lacking, relying on Google's analogy dataset which has known issues and limitations.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's writing style and grammar issues make it challenging to follow the authors' arguments and understand the technical details of the proposed method. This lack of clarity raises concerns about the validity and reliability of the results presented. Furthermore, the evaluation of the paper is limited, relying on a single dataset with known issues, which may not provide a comprehensive understanding of the method's performance.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors revise the writing style and grammar to make the content more accessible and easier to understand. Additionally, the authors should consider evaluating their method on a more diverse set of benchmarks, including datasets with known challenges and limitations, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the method's performance. It would also be beneficial to provide qualitative results or motivation to help understand why the method works, where it fails, and what insights it offers into word representations and lexicons.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper and provide additional evidence, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
1. Can you provide more details on how the fuzzy approach is used to control the contamination caused by polysemous words?
2. How do you plan to address the limitations of the evaluation, particularly with regards to the use of Google's analogy dataset?
3. Can you provide more qualitative results or motivation to help understand the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed method?
