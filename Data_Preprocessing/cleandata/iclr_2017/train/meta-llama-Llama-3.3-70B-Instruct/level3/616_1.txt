Summary
The paper proposes a novel approach to state estimation in robotics by combining algorithmic priors with machine learning. The authors introduce end-to-end learnable histogram filters (E2E-HFs), which allow for the simultaneous learning of motion and measurement models. The approach is demonstrated to be data-efficient, improve performance, and enable unsupervised learning.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, with two key reasons for this choice: (1) the experiments presented are weak, lacking quantitative results, real baselines, and convincing qualitative results, and (2) the paper lacks normal experimental validation, with figure 6 being particularly unclear and confusing.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's experimental evaluation is limited, and the results are not convincing. The comparison to other methods, such as LSTMs, is not thorough, and the evaluation metrics are not clearly defined. Additionally, the paper lacks a clear and concise presentation of the results, making it difficult to understand the implications of the proposed approach.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, I suggest the following: (1) provide more comprehensive experimental evaluations, including quantitative results and comparisons to real baselines, (2) clarify the presentation of the results, including figure 6, and (3) provide more details on the implementation and training procedures.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper and provide additional evidence, I would like the authors to answer the following questions: (1) Can you provide more details on the experimental setup and evaluation metrics used in the paper? (2) How do you plan to address the computational limits of the proposed approach, particularly for higher-dimensional problems? (3) Can you provide more insights into the learned models and their relationship to the algorithmic priors?
