The paper under review aims to contribute to the growing field of word embedding models by systematically investigating different context types and representations for learning word embeddings. The authors claim to provide the first comprehensive evaluation of context definitions and their effectiveness across 21 datasets and 4 tasks, with the goal of serving as a guideline for context selection in the community.
Based on my evaluation, I decide to Reject this paper, primarily due to the lack of thorough analysis and comparison with existing methods. The two key reasons for this choice are: (1) the paper fails to analyze Glove-like objective functions, which are often more effective than the algorithms used, and (2) the paper does not provide a comparison with other published vectors or models in absolute terms, making it difficult to assess the significance of the results.
The paper's approach, while well-motivated, lacks a thorough analysis of the subject, particularly in terms of comparing dependency trees and standard window contexts for word vector learning. Furthermore, the paper does not offer any interesting insights that could impact other people's work, nor does it advance the state of the art or provide new resources for others. The results, while empirical, are not scientifically rigorous, and the claims are not well-supported.
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors conduct a more comprehensive analysis of existing methods, including Glove-like objective functions, and provide a comparison with other published vectors or models. Additionally, the authors could provide more insights into the implications of their results and how they can be used to advance the field. I would like the authors to answer the following questions: (1) How do the results of this paper compare to existing word embedding models, such as Word2Vec and GloVe? (2) What are the implications of the findings on context selection, and how can they be used to improve word embedding models? (3) How do the authors plan to address the lack of thorough analysis and comparison with existing methods in future work?
