Summary
The paper proposes a novel approach to improve vector-space word representations by utilizing a lexicon and alleviating the adverse effects of polysemy. The authors introduce a fuzzy approach to control the contamination caused by polysemous words, annotating each paraphrase with a degree of reliability based on multilingual similarities. The proposed method is evaluated through extensive experiments, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving word vectors and outperforming prior works.
Decision
I decide to Accept this paper, with two key reasons: (1) the paper proposes a well-motivated and novel approach to address the polysemy problem, and (2) the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in improving word vectors.
Supporting Arguments
The paper is well-structured, and the authors provide a clear introduction to the problem and their proposed solution. The experimental evaluation is thorough, and the results show that the proposed method outperforms prior works in several benchmarks. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the effects of parameters and corpus size on the effectiveness of their approach.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more discussion on the interplay between motion and behavior, as well as the potential applications of their approach in more challenging scenarios, such as those involving animals or complex behaviors. Additionally, the authors may consider providing more details on the computational resources required to train their model and the potential limitations of their approach.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like to ask the authors the following questions:
1. Can you provide more details on how the fuzzy paraphrases are employed in the model, and how the control function is utilized to improve the word vectors?
2. How do you plan to extend your approach to more challenging scenarios, such as those involving animals or complex behaviors?
3. Can you provide more information on the computational resources required to train your model, and the potential limitations of your approach?
