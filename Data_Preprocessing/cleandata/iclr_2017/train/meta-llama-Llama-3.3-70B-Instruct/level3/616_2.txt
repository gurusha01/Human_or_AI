Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper proposes a novel approach to combining problem-specific algorithms with machine learning, demonstrating its effectiveness in the context of state estimation in robotics. The authors introduce end-to-end learnable histogram filters (E2E-HFs), which leverage the structure of histogram filters to learn motion and measurement models from data. This approach allows for data-efficient learning, improved performance, and even unsupervised learning of state estimation.
