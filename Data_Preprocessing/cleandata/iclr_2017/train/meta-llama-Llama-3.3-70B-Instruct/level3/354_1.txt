The paper proposes a novel approach to integrate efficient inference within the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework, called Adversarially Learned Inference (ALI). The method jointly learns a generation network and an inference network using an adversarial process, which allows for learning mutually coherent inference and generation networks. The approach achieves reasonable performance compared to baselines with lower cost, and the paper is well-written with clear figures, tables, and convincing results.
I decide to accept this paper with two key reasons: (1) the approach is well-motivated and placed in the literature, and (2) the paper supports its claims with convincing experiments and clear writing. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the related work, and the proposed method is shown to be effective in learning a generative model that produces high-quality samples while learning an efficient inference network.
The paper provides supporting arguments for the effectiveness of the approach, including the ability to learn a latent representation that is useful for auxiliary tasks, such as semi-supervised learning. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the importance of learning inference jointly with generation, and the results show that the proposed approach is superior to other methods.
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more discussion on snapshot accuracy and variability, and comparison with true ensembles. Additionally, I note a minor issue with the axis range in Figure 5, which could be improved for better visualization. I would like the authors to answer the following questions to clarify my understanding of the paper: (1) How does the choice of the discriminator architecture affect the performance of the ALI model? (2) Can the authors provide more insights into the trade-off between the quality of the generated samples and the accuracy of the inference network? (3) How does the ALI model perform on datasets with complex structures, such as images with multiple objects or scenes?
