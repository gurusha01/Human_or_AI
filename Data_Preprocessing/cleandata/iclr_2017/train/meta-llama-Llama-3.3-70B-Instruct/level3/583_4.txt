Summary
The paper proposes a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling process for generative autoencoders, allowing for sampling from the learned latent distribution. This approach improves the quality of generated samples, especially when the learned latent distribution is far from the prior. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method on various models, including VAEs and AAEs, and show that it can reduce visual artifacts in generated samples.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the paper lacks transparency in its human subject study, with unclear details on the number of subjects, their expertise, and the sample presentation process. Secondly, the experiments are limited to a single setting, generating Arabic digits and English letters, providing insufficient evidence for the metric's generality.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's human subject study is a crucial aspect of evaluating the proposed metric, but the lack of transparency raises concerns about the diversity and reliability of the results. Furthermore, the limited experimental setting does not provide sufficient evidence for the metric's applicability to other domains or tasks. While the paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the MCMC sampling process on various models, the results are not convincing enough to support the claims made in the paper.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors conduct a more comprehensive human subject study with a larger and more diverse group of participants. Additionally, the authors should experiment with their metric on a wider range of tasks and domains to demonstrate its generality. The paper could also benefit from a more detailed analysis of the results, including a discussion of the limitations and potential biases of the proposed metric.
Questions for the Authors
I would like the authors to clarify the following points:
1. Can you provide more details on the human subject study, including the number of participants, their expertise, and the sample presentation process?
2. How do you plan to address the limited experimental setting and demonstrate the metric's generality to other domains or tasks?
3. Can you provide a more detailed analysis of the results, including a discussion of the limitations and potential biases of the proposed metric?
