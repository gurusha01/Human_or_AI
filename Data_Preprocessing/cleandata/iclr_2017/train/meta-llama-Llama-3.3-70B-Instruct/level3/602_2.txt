Summary of the Paper's Claims and Contributions
The paper presents a novel loss framework for language modeling, which addresses the limitations of the conventional classification framework used in recurrent neural network language models (RNNLMs). The authors propose augmenting the cross-entropy loss with an additional term that minimizes the KL-divergence between the model's prediction and an estimated target distribution based on the word embeddings space. This framework leads to two improvements: (1) better learning by training against a more informative data distribution, and (2) reusing the input embedding matrix in the output projection layer, which reduces the number of trainable variables. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their framework on the Penn Treebank and Wikitext-2 datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance.
Decision and Key Reasons
Based on the review, I decide to Accept the paper. The two key reasons for this decision are:
1. The paper presents a well-motivated and novel loss framework that addresses the limitations of the conventional classification framework used in RNNLMs.
2. The authors provide empirical evidence that their framework outperforms the conventional one on two benchmark datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of their approach.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a clear and well-structured presentation of the proposed framework, including a detailed analysis of the augmented loss term and its theoretical justification. The authors also provide extensive experimental results, including comparisons with baseline models and ablation studies, which demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach. Additionally, the paper discusses related work and highlights the novelty of the proposed framework.
Additional Feedback and Questions
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors:
* Provide more insights into the role of the hyperparameter Î±, which controls the weight of the augmented loss term.
* Investigate the applicability of their framework to other NLP tasks, such as neural machine translation and text summarization.
* Consider providing more qualitative analysis of the results, such as examples of generated text or visualizations of the learned word embeddings.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer:
* How do the authors plan to extend their framework to handle out-of-vocabulary words or rare words?
* Can the authors provide more details on the computational resources required to train their models, and how they plan to make their approach more efficient?
* How do the authors think their framework can be used in conjunction with other techniques, such as attention mechanisms or transfer learning?
