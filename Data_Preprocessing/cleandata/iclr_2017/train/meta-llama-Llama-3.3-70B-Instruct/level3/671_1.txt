Summary
The paper proposes a new neural architecture called PixelVAE, which combines the strengths of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and PixelCNNs. PixelVAE uses an autoregressive decoder based on PixelCNN to model the output distribution, allowing it to capture fine details in images while still learning a useful latent representation. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of PixelVAE on several datasets, including MNIST, LSUN bedrooms, and 64x64 ImageNet, achieving state-of-the-art performance in some cases.
Decision
I decide to accept this paper, with the main reason being that it presents a novel and well-motivated approach to image modeling, combining the strengths of VAEs and PixelCNNs. The paper is well-written, and the experiments are thorough and well-executed.
Supporting Arguments
The paper tackles a specific question/problem in the field of image modeling, namely how to combine the strengths of VAEs and PixelCNNs to achieve better performance. The approach is well-motivated, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the limitations of existing methods and how PixelVAE addresses these limitations. The experimental results are impressive, demonstrating the effectiveness of PixelVAE on several datasets.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the implementation of PixelVAE, such as the architecture of the encoder and decoder networks, and the hyperparameters used in the experiments. Additionally, it would be helpful to include more visualizations of the results, such as samples generated by PixelVAE, to give a better sense of the quality of the results.
Questions for the Authors
I would like to ask the authors to clarify the following points:
* How does the number of autoregressive layers in PixelVAE affect the performance of the model?
* Can the authors provide more details on the hierarchical architecture of PixelVAE, and how it is used to model images at different scales?
* How does PixelVAE compare to other state-of-the-art image modeling methods, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)?
