Summary of the Paper's Claims and Contributions
The paper introduces the concept of semi-supervised reinforcement learning (SSRL), where an agent learns to perform a task in a set of "labeled" environments with reward functions, and then generalizes to a set of "unlabeled" environments without reward functions. The authors propose an approach called semi-supervised skill generalization (S3G), which builds on the framework of maximum entropy control and involves an EM algorithm with partial labels to estimate a reward function and fit a control policy. The paper provides experiments on 4 tasks in MuJoCo, demonstrating the effectiveness of S3G in improving the generalization of a learned policy.
Decision and Key Reasons
Based on the review, I decide to Accept the paper. The key reasons for this decision are:
1. The paper tackles a specific and well-motivated problem in reinforcement learning, and the approach is well-placed in the literature.
2. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of S3G in improving the generalization of a learned policy, and the paper provides a clear and well-written explanation of the method and its results.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a clear and well-motivated introduction to the problem of SSRL, and the proposed approach of S3G is well-explained and supported by experimental results. The experiments demonstrate that S3G can improve the generalization of a learned policy, and the paper provides a detailed analysis of the results. The paper also discusses the relationship between S3G and other approaches, such as inverse reinforcement learning and transfer learning.
Additional Feedback and Questions
To improve the paper, I suggest providing more implementation details to fully reproduce the experiments, and discussing the potential limitations and future directions of the approach. Additionally, I would like the authors to clarify the following points:
* How does the choice of reward function architecture affect the performance of S3G?
* Can S3G be applied to more complex tasks, such as those with high-dimensional state and action spaces?
* How does S3G compare to other approaches, such as meta-learning and few-shot learning, in terms of its ability to generalize to new environments?
Overall, the paper provides a clear and well-motivated contribution to the field of reinforcement learning, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of S3G in improving the generalization of a learned policy. With some additional clarification and discussion, the paper has the potential to make a significant impact in the field.
