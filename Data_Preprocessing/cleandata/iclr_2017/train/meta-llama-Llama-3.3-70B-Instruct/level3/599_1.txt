This paper presents a novel approach to handling missing values in multivariate time series data using a modified gated recurrent unit (GRU) called GRU-D. The authors propose a decay mechanism that captures the temporal structure of missing values, allowing the model to effectively utilize informative missingness patterns. The paper is well-structured, and the authors provide a clear definition of the task, interesting baselines, and extensive tests on datasets.
The positives of the paper include a novel approach to handling missing values, a clear definition of the task, and extensive tests on datasets. The authors also provide a thorough comparison of their model with other state-of-the-art models, demonstrating the effectiveness of their approach.
However, there are some negatives that need to be addressed. The paper contains typos and poorly placed sections, which can make it difficult to follow. Additionally, the authors do not provide a clear discussion of statistical methods, which is an important aspect of any machine learning paper.
The results of the paper are promising, but below expectations. The authors demonstrate that their model outperforms other state-of-the-art models on several datasets, but the margins are not significant. Furthermore, there are concerns about the comparison between GRU-D and GRU-simple models, as well as the fairness of the evaluation.
The paper makes several unsubstantiated claims about the relationship between the presence rate of data and diagnostics, the effectiveness of concatenating masking and time interval vectors, and the ability of GRU-D to capture informative missingness. These claims need to be reframed and supported by evidence.
Based on the conference guidelines, I would reject this paper with the following reasons:
1. The paper does not provide a clear and thorough discussion of statistical methods, which is an important aspect of any machine learning paper.
2. The results of the paper are promising but below expectations, and there are concerns about the comparison between GRU-D and GRU-simple models, as well as the fairness of the evaluation.
To improve the paper, the authors should address the following points:
* Provide a clear and thorough discussion of statistical methods.
* Reframe and support the unsubstantiated claims made in the paper.
* Improve the clarity and organization of the paper, including fixing typos and poorly placed sections.
* Provide more detailed comparisons of RNN baselines and variations.
* Evaluate the model on multi-layer RNNs.
I would like the authors to answer the following questions to clarify my understanding of the paper and provide additional evidence:
* Can you provide more details about the statistical methods used in the paper?
* How do you ensure the fairness of the evaluation between GRU-D and GRU-simple models?
* Can you provide more evidence to support the claims made about the relationship between the presence rate of data and diagnostics, the effectiveness of concatenating masking and time interval vectors, and the ability of GRU-D to capture informative missingness?
