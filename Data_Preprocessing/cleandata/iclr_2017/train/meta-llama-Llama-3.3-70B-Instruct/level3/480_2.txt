This paper proposes a novel approach to improve vector-space word representations by leveraging a lexicon and alleviating the adverse effects of polysemy. The authors introduce a fuzzy approach to control the contamination caused by polysemous words, annotating each paraphrase with a degree of reliability based on multilingual similarities. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms prior works and achieves top scores in several benchmarks.
I decide to accept this paper with some reservations. The key reason for this decision is that the paper tackles a specific and relevant problem in natural language processing, and the proposed approach shows promising results. However, I have some concerns regarding the presentation of results, particularly in figures 4 and 5, which are unclear or difficult to interpret.
To support my decision, I argue that the paper addresses a significant challenge in word representation learning, namely the handling of polysemous words. The authors' fuzzy approach is well-motivated and grounded in the literature, and the experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method. Nevertheless, I would like to see some improvements in the presentation of results, such as rephrasing or splitting figures to enhance clarity.
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more detailed explanations of the control function and its impact on the results. Additionally, it would be helpful to include more quantitative evaluations, such as recognition results on the handwriting application, to further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. I also question the suitability of the model for non-deterministic animal behavior and suggest that a GAN might be a more natural fit for the predictive part of the task.
I would like the authors to answer the following questions to clarify my understanding of the paper and provide additional evidence to support their claims: (1) Can you provide more details on the control function and its relationship to the fuzzy paraphrases? (2) How do you plan to extend the proposed approach to other models, and what changes would be required? (3) Can you provide more quantitative evaluations, such as recognition results on the handwriting application, to further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method?
