Summary of the Paper's Claims and Contributions
The paper proposes a new weight initialization technique that adjusts for the variance introduced by dropout in neural networks. The authors derive a new initialization method that corrects for the influence of dropout rates and an arbitrary nonlinearity's effect on neuron output variance. They also propose a simple technique to re-estimate the Batch Normalization variance parameters after training, which improves the accuracy of networks trained with dropout. The paper claims that these methods lead to faster and more accurate convergence, and achieve state-of-the-art results on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 without data augmentation.
Decision and Key Reasons
I decide to Accept this paper, with the key reasons being:
1. The paper tackles a specific and well-motivated problem in neural network training, namely the variance introduced by dropout.
2. The proposed weight initialization technique and Batch Normalization variance re-estimation method are well-supported by theoretical derivations and empirical experiments.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a clear and well-structured presentation of the problem, methodology, and results. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their proposed methods through experiments on various datasets and architectures, including fully connected and convolutional neural networks. The results show significant improvements in convergence speed and accuracy, especially for highly regularized networks. The paper also provides a thorough discussion of the limitations and potential extensions of the proposed methods.
Additional Feedback and Suggestions
