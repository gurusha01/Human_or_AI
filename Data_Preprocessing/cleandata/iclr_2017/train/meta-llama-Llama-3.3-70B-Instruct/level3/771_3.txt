Summary of the Paper's Claims and Contributions
The paper proposes a novel approach to improve distributed word representations by incorporating context-sensitivity of paraphrase candidates using fuzzy paraphrases. The authors introduce a method to annotate each paraphrase with a degree of reliability, like a member of a fuzzy set, and use these fuzzy paraphrases to learn a corpus by jointly learning a generated text. The paper claims that this approach alleviates the adverse effects of polysemous words and improves the quality of the learned word vector-space.
Decision and Key Reasons
I am undecided about recommending this paper for acceptance. The main reason for my indecision is that while the paper presents a sensible idea, I am not convinced by the experiments and results. Specifically, the tables and figures do not clearly distinguish the fuzzy paraphrase approach from prior work, and the results do not show a significant improvement over existing methods.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's main argument is that the proposed approach improves word vectors by incorporating context-sensitivity of paraphrase candidates. However, the experimental results do not convincingly demonstrate this claim. For example, Tables 3 and 4 do not show a clear trend or significant improvement over prior work. Additionally, the parameterization of the control function is not convincingly optimal, and the reviewer suggests experimenting with different choices and considering nearby word embeddings.
Additional Feedback and Suggestions
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more convincing experimental results, such as comparing their approach to other state-of-the-art methods and evaluating the performance on a wider range of tasks and datasets. Additionally, the authors could provide more details on the parameterization of the control function and explore different choices to optimize its performance. It would also be helpful to discuss the limitations of the approach and potential confounding factors, such as corpus size and vocabulary size.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper and provide additional evidence, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
1. Can you provide more details on the parameterization of the control function and how it was optimized?
2. How do you plan to address the limitations of the approach, such as the potential confounding factors of corpus size and vocabulary size?
3. Can you provide more convincing experimental results, such as comparing your approach to other state-of-the-art methods and evaluating the performance on a wider range of tasks and datasets?
