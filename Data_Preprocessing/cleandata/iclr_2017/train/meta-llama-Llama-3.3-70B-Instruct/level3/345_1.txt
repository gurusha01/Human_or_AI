Summary
The paper proposes a novel approach to adapt neural network language models to their recent history by introducing a neural cache model. This model stores past hidden activations as memory and accesses them through a dot product with the current hidden activation, allowing for efficient and scalable adaptation to dynamic environments. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on several language modeling datasets and the LAMBADA dataset, showing significant performance gains over state-of-the-art models.
Decision
I decide to Accept this paper, with the main reason being that the approach is well-motivated and provides a clear contribution to the field of neural network language models. The paper presents a novel and efficient method for adapting language models to their recent history, which is a significant challenge in natural language processing.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a clear and well-structured presentation of the neural cache model, including its technical details and experimental results. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on several datasets, including the challenging LAMBADA dataset, and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art models. The paper also provides a thorough discussion of related work and clearly positions the neural cache model within the context of existing research.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the training algorithm and its scalability, as well as the hyper-parameter search process. Additionally, it would be helpful to include more analysis on the interpretability of the results and the expected relationship between hyper-parameters. I would also like to see more discussion on the potential applications of the neural cache model beyond language modeling.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like to ask the authors the following questions:
* Can you provide more details on the computational cost of the neural cache model and how it compares to other memory-augmented neural networks?
* How do you plan to extend the neural cache model to other natural language processing tasks, such as machine translation or question answering?
* Can you provide more insight into the hyper-parameter search process and how you selected the optimal values for the cache size and interpolation parameter?
