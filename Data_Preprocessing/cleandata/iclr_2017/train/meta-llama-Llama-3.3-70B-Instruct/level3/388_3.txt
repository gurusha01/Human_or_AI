Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper proposes a novel approach to analyzing bioacoustic signals using a Bayesian non-parametric (BNP) formulation of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), specifically the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process-HMM (HDP-HMM). This approach allows for the automatic identification of song units in bioacoustic signals, which is a crucial step in understanding animal communication. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on two real-world bioacoustic datasets: humpback whale songs and multi-species bird songs.
Decision: Accept
I decide to accept this paper because it presents a well-motivated and well-executed approach to analyzing bioacoustic signals. The authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem, a thorough review of related work, and a detailed description of their methodology. The experimental results are promising, and the authors provide a thoughtful discussion of the limitations and potential extensions of their work.
Supporting Arguments
The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem of analyzing bioacoustic signals. The related work section is thorough, and the authors provide a detailed description of their methodology, including the HDP-HMM model and the Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling techniques used for inference. The experimental results are promising, and the authors provide a thoughtful discussion of the limitations and potential extensions of their work. The use of real-world bioacoustic datasets and the comparison with expert annotations add credibility to the results.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors consider providing more details on the computational complexity of their approach and potential ways to accelerate the MCMC sampling process. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more examples of the song units identified by the HDP-HMM model and a more detailed analysis of the errors made by the model. Finally, the authors may want to consider exploring other applications of their approach, such as classification or behavioral analysis.
Questions for the Authors
I would like to ask the authors to clarify the following points:
1. How do the authors plan to address the computational complexity of their approach, which may limit its applicability to larger datasets?
2. Can the authors provide more details on the features used to represent the bioacoustic signals, and how they were selected?
3. How do the authors plan to extend their approach to more complex bioacoustic signals, such as those with multiple species or background noise?
