Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper introduces a novel approach to controlling the expansivity of gradients during backpropagation in Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) by manipulating orthogonality constraints and regularization on matrices. The authors propose a factorization technique that allows for bounding the spectral norms of weight matrices, enabling the control of gradient stability. They also explore the use of soft orthogonality constraints, such as penalties and Gaussian priors, to encourage orthogonality in the transition matrices.
Decision and Key Reasons
I decide to accept this paper, with two key reasons:
1. The paper presents a well-motivated and theoretically sound approach to addressing the vanishing and exploding gradient problems in RNNs.
2. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in improving optimization convergence rate and model performance on various tasks, including synthetic memory tasks and real-world datasets like MNIST and PTB.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a clear and thorough explanation of the vanishing and exploding gradient problems, and the proposed approach is well-grounded in mathematical derivations. The experimental results are comprehensive and demonstrate the benefits of loosening orthogonality constraints and using soft orthogonality constraints. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the spectral evolution of the transition matrices, which sheds light on the underlying mechanisms of the proposed method.
Additional Feedback and Questions
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors:
* Provide more insights into the choice of hyperparameters, such as the spectral margin and the strength of the orthogonality-encouraging penalty.
* Explore the application of the proposed method to other types of neural networks, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
* Investigate the relationship between the proposed method and other techniques for addressing vanishing and exploding gradients, such as gradient clipping and normalization.
Some questions I would like the authors to address:
* How do the results change when using different activation functions, such as ReLU or tanh, in the RNNs?
* Can the proposed method be used in conjunction with other regularization techniques, such as dropout or weight decay?
* Are there any potential limitations or drawbacks to using the proposed method, and how can they be mitigated?
