Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper introduces a novel Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture called Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNNs), which combines the strengths of convolutional and recurrent neural networks. QRNNs allow for parallel computation across both timestep and minibatch dimensions, enabling high throughput and good scaling to long sequences. The authors propose various extensions of QRNN, including Zoneout, Densely-connected, and seq2seq with attention, to improve its performance. The approach is evaluated on several tasks and datasets, including sentiment classification, language modeling, and machine translation, demonstrating significant speed-up and competitive accuracy compared to traditional RNNs.
Decision and Key Reasons
Based on the evaluation of the paper, I decide to Accept the paper. The two key reasons for this choice are:
1. The paper addresses an important problem in the field of sequence modeling, which is the limitation of traditional RNNs in handling long-term dependencies and parallelizing computations.
2. The authors provide a well-motivated and well-designed approach, QRNNs, which demonstrates significant speed-up and competitive accuracy compared to traditional RNNs on several tasks and datasets.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a clear and concise introduction to the problem of sequence modeling and the limitations of traditional RNNs. The authors then propose a novel architecture, QRNNs, which combines the strengths of convolutional and recurrent neural networks. The paper provides a thorough evaluation of QRNNs on several tasks and datasets, including sentiment classification, language modeling, and machine translation. The results demonstrate significant speed-up and competitive accuracy compared to traditional RNNs.
Additional Feedback and Questions
To further improve the paper, I would like to see more analysis on the trade-offs between the parallelization of computations and the loss of expressiveness in QRNNs. Specifically, I would like to know:
* How do the authors plan to address the potential loss of expressiveness in QRNNs, particularly in handling long-term dependencies?
* Can the authors provide more insights into the performance of QRNNs on tasks that require more complex dependencies, such as copy or addition tasks?
* How do the authors plan to extend QRNNs to other sequence modeling tasks, such as speech recognition or dialogue systems?
Overall, the paper provides a significant contribution to the field of sequence modeling, and with some additional analysis and insights, it has the potential to be a highly impactful work.
