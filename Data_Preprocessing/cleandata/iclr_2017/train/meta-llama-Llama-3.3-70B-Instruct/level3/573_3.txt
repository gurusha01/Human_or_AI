Summary of the Paper's Claims and Contributions
The paper proposes a novel approach to optimizing Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for information seeking tasks by formulating them as reinforcement learning problems and utilizing Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE). The authors argue that this approach allows for the explicit modeling of information gain, which is a key aspect of information seeking tasks. The paper presents theoretical examples and empirical results to demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.
Decision and Key Reasons
Based on the review guidelines, I decide to Reject this paper. The two key reasons for this decision are:
1. Lack of Sufficient Empirical Evidence: While the paper presents some theoretical examples and empirical results, the evidence is not sufficient to demonstrate the benefits and generality of the proposed approach. The comparison to previous RL frameworks is incomplete and unclear, making it difficult to determine the source of performance differences.
2. Disorganized and Unclear Experiment Section: The experiment section is disorganized and hard to read, which makes it challenging to understand the results and their implications. A summary table to present the results more clearly would be helpful.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's approach to modeling information gain is novel and interesting, but it requires more rigorous evaluation and comparison to existing methods. The theoretical examples provided are helpful in understanding the concept, but they are not sufficient to demonstrate the practical effectiveness of the approach. The empirical results are limited and do not provide a clear picture of the approach's performance.
Additional Feedback and Suggestions
To improve the paper, I suggest the following:
* Provide more comprehensive empirical evidence to demonstrate the benefits and generality of the proposed approach.
* Clarify the comparison to previous RL frameworks and provide a more detailed analysis of the results.
* Reorganize the experiment section to make it easier to read and understand.
* Consider adding a summary table to present the results more clearly.
* Provide more discussion on the implications of the results and the potential applications of the proposed approach.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper and provide additional evidence, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
* Can you provide more details on the experimental setup and the datasets used in the empirical evaluation?
* How do you plan to address the issue of lack of convergence in the optimization process, as mentioned in Proposition 4?
* Can you provide more insight into the construction of the counterexamples in Section 3 and how they relate to the proposed approach?
* How do you envision the proposed approach being applied in practice, and what are the potential benefits and challenges?
