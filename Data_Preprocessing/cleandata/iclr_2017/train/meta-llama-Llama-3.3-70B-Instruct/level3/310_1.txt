Summary
The paper introduces Deep Variational Bayes Filters (DVBF), a novel approach for unsupervised learning and identification of latent Markovian state space models. DVBF leverages stochastic gradient variational Bayes to overcome intractable inference distributions, enabling the handling of highly nonlinear input data with temporal and spatial dependencies. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of DVBF in various vision-based experiments, showcasing its ability to recover latent states that identify underlying physical quantities and generate stable long-term predictions.
Decision
I decide to Accept this paper, with two key reasons for this choice:
1. The paper tackles a crucial problem in understanding communications between agents, comparing machine problem-solving approaches to those of humans, which is a well-motivated and well-placed contribution in the literature.
2. The approach is well-supported by empirical results, demonstrating the effectiveness of DVBF in recovering latent states and generating stable long-term predictions.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a clear and concise introduction to the problem, followed by a thorough explanation of the proposed approach. The authors demonstrate a good understanding of the literature, highlighting the limitations of existing methods and the advantages of their approach. The experimental results are well-presented, with a clear comparison to existing methods (e.g., Deep Kalman Filters). The use of annealing and inverse temperature scheduling is also well-motivated and effectively implemented.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest the authors consider the following:
* Provide more details on the implementation of DVBF, such as the specific architectures used for the observation and transition networks.
* Include more visualizations of the learned latent spaces, to help illustrate the effectiveness of DVBF in capturing underlying physical quantities.
* Consider adding more experiments or comparisons to other state-of-the-art methods, to further demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of DVBF.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
* Can you provide more insight into the choice of hyperparameters, such as the inverse temperature scheduling and batch size?
* How do you plan to extend DVBF to more complex environments or tasks, such as those involving multiple agents or partial observability?
* Can you discuss potential applications of DVBF in real-world scenarios, such as robotics or autonomous systems?
