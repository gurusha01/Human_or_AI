Summary of the Paper
The paper presents a novel approach to learning bilingual word vectors offline, leveraging a linear transformation between vector spaces that is proven to be orthogonal. This transformation is obtained using the singular value decomposition (SVD) on a dictionary of translation pairs. The authors introduce an "inverted softmax" to improve the accuracy of predicted translations and demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods.
Decision and Key Reasons
I decide to reject this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the paper lacks detail in certain sections, making it difficult to fully understand and replicate the research. Secondly, the absence of open-source code and insufficient information about the experimental setup compromise the replicability of the results.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's contributions are significant, and the approach shows promise. However, the lack of detail in the paper, particularly in the methodology and experimental setup, makes it challenging to evaluate the results and replicate the research. Furthermore, the absence of open-source code and insufficient information about the experimental setup raise concerns about the reproducibility of the results. While the paper presents impressive results, the lack of transparency and replicability is a significant concern.
Additional Feedback and Questions
To improve the paper, I suggest providing more detail about the methodology, experimental setup, and hyperparameter tuning. Additionally, making the code and data publicly available would significantly enhance the paper's reproducibility and credibility. I would like the authors to answer the following questions: (1) Can you provide more information about the hyperparameter tuning process and the selection of the optimal parameters? (2) How did you ensure that the pseudo-dictionary constructed from identical character strings is of high quality and representative of the language pair? (3) Can you provide more details about the sentence vector construction and the retrieval process for sentence translations? 
Conference Suitability
I question the suitability of ICLR as the venue for this paper, as the research seems more closely related to natural language processing and machine translation, which might be a better fit for conferences like IROS or ICRA. However, the paper's focus on the theoretical aspects of bilingual word vectors and the orthogonal transformation might still make it a good fit for ICLR. 
Specific Question/Problem, Approach, and Claims
The paper tackles the problem of learning bilingual word vectors offline, proposing a novel approach based on an orthogonal linear transformation. The approach is well-motivated, and the claims are supported by experimental results. However, the lack of detail and replicability concerns raise questions about the validity and generalizability of the results. 
Final Assessment
In conclusion, while the paper presents an interesting and promising approach to learning bilingual word vectors offline, the lack of detail, replicability concerns, and suitability for the conference venue raise significant concerns. I hope the authors will address these concerns and provide more detail and transparency in their research to improve the paper's credibility and impact.
