Summary
The paper proposes a novel method for finding dependent subspaces across multiple views of data, with a focus on preserving neighborhood relationships. The approach directly maximizes the similarity of neighborhoods between subspaces of each view, using a well-defined objective function that favors sparse and informative neighborhoods. The method is shown to outperform traditional Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) and other state-of-the-art methods in experiments on artificial and real-world datasets.
Decision
I decide to Accept this paper, with two key reasons: (1) the paper presents a well-motivated and novel approach to finding dependent subspaces, and (2) the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in preserving neighborhood relationships.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a clear and concise introduction to the problem of finding dependent subspaces, and motivates the need for a method that focuses on neighborhood relationships. The proposed approach is well-supported by theoretical arguments and is shown to have strong invariance properties. The experimental results are thorough and demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over other state-of-the-art approaches.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed method and explore ways to improve its scalability. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more experiments on datasets with more than two views, to demonstrate the applicability of the method to more complex scenarios.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
1. Can you provide more details on the choice of the parameter Îµ in the smoothed neighbor distribution (Equation 8)?
2. How do you plan to extend the method to handle nonlinear transformations, and what are the potential challenges and benefits of such an extension?
3. Can you provide more insights into the interpretation of the optimized projection matrices, and how they can be used to gain a better understanding of the relationships between the views?
