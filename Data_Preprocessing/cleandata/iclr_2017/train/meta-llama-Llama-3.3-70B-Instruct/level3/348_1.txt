Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper presents a theoretical treatment of transformation groups applied to convolutional neural networks (CNNs), focusing on the concept of steerability to achieve more efficient usage of network parameters. The authors explore the idea of limiting the transformations to be orthogonal, which can help stabilize gradient norm and improve optimization convergence. They propose a weight matrix factorization and parameterization strategy to bound matrix norms and control the degree of expansivity induced during backpropagation.
Decision and Key Reasons
I decide to reject this paper, with two key reasons:
1. The idea of steerability, although important, seems simple and has been explored before in image processing. The formal group theory treatment may be overkill for discrete groups.
2. The experimental description is unclear, making it difficult to replicate the implementation of capsules or transformation groups.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's contribution to the field of CNNs is limited by its focus on discrete groups, such as rotations. A more valuable contribution would be guiding the implementation of continuous transformations. Additionally, the experimental results are not clearly presented, and the paper lacks a thorough comparison with existing methods.
Additional Feedback and Questions
To improve the paper, the authors should provide a clearer explanation of the experimental setup and results. They should also consider comparing their method with existing approaches and exploring the application of continuous transformations. Some questions I would like the authors to answer include:
* How do the authors plan to extend their method to continuous transformations?
* Can they provide more details on the experimental setup and results, including a comparison with existing methods?
* How do the authors address the potential overkill of using formal group theory for discrete groups?
