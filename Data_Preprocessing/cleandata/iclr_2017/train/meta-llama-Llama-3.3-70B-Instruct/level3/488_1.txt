Summary
The paper proposes a novel approach to constructing a phylogenetic tree, also known as the Tree of Life, using the deep representation of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) trained for image classification. The authors leverage the hierarchical feature representation learned by deep networks to quantify the visual similarity of species and construct a tree of life. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach through experiments on various species, including fish, canine, and vehicle categories.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the paper lacks a thorough comparison with existing literature on phylogenetic tree construction, particularly those using machine learning and deep learning techniques. Secondly, the experimental evaluation, although promising, is limited to a specific dataset (ImageNet) and does not provide a comprehensive analysis of the proposed approach's robustness and generalizability.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's contribution to the field of bioinformatics and deep learning is notable, as it provides a new perspective on using deep representations for phylogenetic tree construction. However, the lack of comparison with existing literature, such as Wang et al. (2012), makes it difficult to assess the significance and novelty of the proposed approach. Additionally, the experimental evaluation, although demonstrating promising results, is limited to a specific dataset and does not provide a thorough analysis of the approach's robustness and generalizability.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide a more comprehensive literature review, including a comparison with existing machine learning and deep learning approaches for phylogenetic tree construction. Additionally, the authors should consider evaluating their approach on multiple datasets and providing a more thorough analysis of the approach's robustness and generalizability. This could include experiments on different species, datasets, and evaluation metrics.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper and provide additional evidence for my assessment, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
1. How does the proposed approach compare to existing machine learning and deep learning approaches for phylogenetic tree construction, such as Wang et al. (2012)?
2. Can the authors provide a more comprehensive analysis of the approach's robustness and generalizability, including experiments on multiple datasets and evaluation metrics?
3. How do the authors plan to address the limitation of the proposed approach to image classification datasets, and can they provide a plan for extending the approach to other types of data, such as genomic or proteomic data?
