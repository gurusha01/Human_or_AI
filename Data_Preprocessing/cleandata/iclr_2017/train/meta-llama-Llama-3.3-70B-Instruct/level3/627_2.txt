Summary
The paper proposes a novel approach to dialogue agents, where the agent learns to interact with users by asking questions. The authors design a simulator and a set of synthetic tasks in the movie question answering domain, allowing the agent to ask questions in both offline supervised and online reinforcement learning settings. The paper demonstrates that the agent improves its performance when asking questions, and validates the approach using real data collected via Amazon Mechanical Turk.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the paper's approach to using a latent variable model conditioned on an image is not well-motivated, and the image is only used during training and not for actual translation. Secondly, the experimental results show weak improvements over the baseline, with only 0.6 METEOR and 0.2 BLEU advantage, which are not statistically significant.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's approach to using a latent variable model conditioned on an image is flawed, as the image is not used during actual translation. This raises questions about the effectiveness of the approach in real-world scenarios. Furthermore, the experimental results are underwhelming, with small improvements over the baseline that are not statistically significant. The qualitative analysis presented in the paper is also inconclusive and unconvincing, failing to support the proposed approach.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, the authors should reconsider their approach to using a latent variable model conditioned on an image, and explore alternative methods that can effectively utilize the image during actual translation. Additionally, the authors should conduct more rigorous experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach, including larger-scale evaluations and more comprehensive comparisons to baseline models.
Questions for the Authors
I would like the authors to clarify the following points:
1. How do the authors plan to address the issue of the image not being used during actual translation?
2. Can the authors provide more detailed analysis of the experimental results, including error bars and statistical significance tests?
3. How do the authors plan to improve the qualitative analysis to make it more convincing and supportive of the proposed approach?
