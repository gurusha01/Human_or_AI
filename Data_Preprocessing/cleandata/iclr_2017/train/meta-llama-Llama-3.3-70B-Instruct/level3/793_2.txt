The paper proposes a novel approach to enhance the modeling power of dynamic systems like RNNs by utilizing the previous error signal of the output layer as an additional input. This idea is well-motivated and has the potential to improve the performance of sequence-to-sequence models.
Based on the provided keypoints, I decide to reject this paper with two key reasons: (1) the paper makes an erroneous assumption about test label information being available in real-world applications, and (2) the experiment is limited to one dataset and reports inaccurate state-of-the-art results.
The assumption about test label information being available in real-world applications is not always true, which limits the applicability of the proposed approach. Furthermore, the experiment is limited to one dataset, and the reported state-of-the-art results are not accurate, which raises concerns about the validity of the claims made in the paper.
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more rigorous experiments on multiple datasets and evaluate the performance of their approach in real-world scenarios where test label information may not be available. Additionally, the authors should provide more detailed information about the model size and architecture to facilitate a more thorough evaluation of their approach.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper include: (1) How do the authors plan to address the issue of test label information not being available in real-world applications? (2) Can the authors provide more detailed information about the model size and architecture used in their experiments? (3) How do the authors plan to extend their approach to tackle summarization problems with large input text, as mentioned in the conclusion? 
These points are here to help, and not necessarily part of my decision assessment. I believe that addressing these concerns and providing more rigorous experiments and evaluations can significantly improve the paper and make it more suitable for publication.
