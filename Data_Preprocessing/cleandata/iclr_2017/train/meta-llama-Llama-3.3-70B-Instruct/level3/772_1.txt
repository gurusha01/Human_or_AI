This paper presents a thorough evaluation of various factors that impact the performance of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image retrieval tasks. The authors investigate five key factors, including feature aggregation and normalization, output layer selection, image resizing, multi-scale feature representation, and PCA and whitening. The paper provides a detailed analysis of the impact of each factor on the retrieval performance and proposes a new multi-scale image representation method that outperforms state-of-the-art methods on four benchmark datasets.
I decide to accept this paper with some minor revisions. The main reasons for this decision are:
1. The paper tackles a specific and well-defined problem in the field of image retrieval, which is the evaluation of various factors that impact the performance of CNNs for this task.
2. The approach is well-motivated and grounded in the literature, with a clear explanation of the factors being evaluated and their potential impact on the retrieval performance.
3. The paper provides a thorough and detailed analysis of the experimental results, with a clear presentation of the findings and their implications for the field.
Some minor revisions are needed to improve the clarity and readability of the paper. Specifically, the authors could provide more context and background information on the image retrieval task and the CNN architectures being evaluated. Additionally, the paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the implications of the findings and their potential applications in real-world scenarios.
To improve the paper, I would like the authors to address the following questions:
* How do the findings of this paper relate to other work in the field of image retrieval, and what are the potential implications for real-world applications?
* Can the authors provide more insight into the reasons behind the superior performance of the proposed multi-scale image representation method, and how it can be further improved or extended?
* Are there any potential limitations or drawbacks to the proposed approach, and how can they be addressed in future work?
Overall, this is a well-written and well-structured paper that provides a valuable contribution to the field of image retrieval. With some minor revisions, it has the potential to be a strong and impactful publication.
