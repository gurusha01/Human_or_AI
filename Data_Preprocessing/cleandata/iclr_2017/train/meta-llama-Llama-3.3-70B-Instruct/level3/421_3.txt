Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper proposes a novel approach to understanding the loss surface of deep neural networks, focusing on the topological and geometrical aspects of the optimization landscape. The authors provide new theoretical results that quantify the amount of uphill climbing required to progress to lower energy configurations in single hidden-layer ReLU networks and prove that this amount converges to zero with overparametrization under mild conditions. They also introduce a dynamic programming algorithm, Dynamic String Sampling, to efficiently approximate geodesics within each level set, providing a tool to verify the connectedness of level sets and estimate their geometric regularity.
Decision: Accept
I decide to accept this paper because it addresses a fundamental question in the field of deep learning, namely, the nature of the loss surface of neural networks. The paper provides a well-motivated and technically sound approach to understanding this problem, combining theoretical results with empirical evidence. The authors' use of Dynamic String Sampling to explore the geometry of level sets is a significant contribution, and their results have important implications for the optimization of deep learning models.
Supporting Arguments
The paper is well-motivated, and the authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem of optimizing deep neural networks.

Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more detailed explanations of the Dynamic String Sampling algorithm and its implementation. Additionally, they could provide more extensive empirical results to support their theoretical findings. It would also be helpful to include a more detailed discussion of the implications of their results for the optimization of deep learning models.
