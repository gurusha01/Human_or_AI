The paper proposes a novel approach to state estimation in robotics by combining algorithmic priors with machine learning. The authors introduce end-to-end learnable histogram filters (E2E-HFs), which allow for the learning of motion and measurement models in a differentiable manner. This approach enables the optimization of the models for the filtering process, rather than just optimizing model accuracy. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of E2E-HFs in two localization tasks, showing improved data efficiency and performance compared to traditional histogram filters and LSTM baselines.
Based on the provided guidelines, I will evaluate the paper as follows:
1. The paper claims to contribute a new approach to state estimation in robotics by combining algorithmic priors with machine learning, which is a well-motivated and timely research question.
2. I decide to accept the paper, with the main reason being that the approach is well-motivated and the results demonstrate improved performance and data efficiency compared to existing methods.
3. The supporting arguments for this decision include the clear presentation of the problem and the proposed approach, the thorough evaluation of the method on two localization tasks, and the discussion of the results and their implications.
Additional feedback to improve the paper includes:
* Providing more details on the experimental setup and the hyperparameters used for the different methods.
* Discussing the limitations of the approach and potential avenues for future work, such as scaling the method to higher-dimensional problems.
* Considering additional evaluation metrics and comparison to other state-of-the-art methods in the field.
Questions to the authors:
* Can you provide more insight into the choice of the histogram filter as the underlying algorithmic prior, and how it compares to other possible choices?
* How do you plan to address the computational limitations of the approach for higher-dimensional problems, and what potential solutions do you envision?
* Can you discuss the potential applications of the proposed approach to other areas of robotics and artificial intelligence, beyond state estimation?
