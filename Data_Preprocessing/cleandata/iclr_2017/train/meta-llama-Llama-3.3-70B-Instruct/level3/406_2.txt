This paper proposes a novel optimization algorithm, Entropy-SGD, which leverages the local geometry of the energy landscape to improve the generalization performance of deep neural networks. The approach is well-motivated, addressing a significant problem in the field, and the paper is well-written, although it requires domain knowledge to understand.
The specific question tackled by the paper is how to modify the traditional SGD algorithm to actively seek flat regions in the energy landscape, which are known to generalize better. The authors propose to maximize a local-entropy-based objective function, which favors well-generalizable solutions lying in large flat regions of the energy landscape.
The approach is well-placed in the literature, building upon previous work on the geometry of the energy landscape and the importance of flat minima. The authors provide a clear and concise overview of the related work, highlighting the key differences and similarities between their approach and existing methods.
The paper supports its claims through a combination of theoretical analysis and empirical experiments. The authors provide a theoretical justification for the Entropy-SGD algorithm, showing that it results in a smoother energy landscape and improved generalization error. The empirical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of Entropy-SGD on a range of deep learning benchmarks, including convolutional and recurrent neural networks.
Based on the analysis, I decide to accept this paper. The two key reasons for this choice are: (1) the paper proposes a novel and well-motivated approach to improving the generalization performance of deep neural networks, and (2) the paper provides a clear and concise overview of the related work and supports its claims through a combination of theoretical analysis and empirical experiments.
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more intuition on how the Entropy-SGD algorithm works in practice, and how it differs from existing methods such as SGD and SGLD. Additionally, the authors may want to consider providing more detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the Entropy-SGD algorithm and its scalability to larger deep learning models.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper are: (1) How does the choice of the hyperparameter Î³ affect the performance of the Entropy-SGD algorithm? (2) Can the authors provide more insight into the relationship between the local entropy objective and the ELBO used in variational inference? (3) How does the Entropy-SGD algorithm perform on larger deep learning models, such as those used in computer vision and natural language processing applications?
