This paper proposes a novel approach to visual servoing by combining learned visual features, predictive dynamics models, and reinforcement learning. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method on a complex synthetic car following benchmark, achieving substantial improvement over conventional approaches and model-free deep reinforcement learning algorithms.
The paper tackles the specific question of how to learn a visual servoing mechanism that can adapt to new targets with minimal data. The approach is well-motivated, building on the idea that learned visual features and predictive dynamics models can be used to improve the robustness and generalization of visual servoing.
However, I have some concerns regarding the experimental evaluation. The results presented in figures 4, 5, and 6 are not entirely convincing due to the absence of error bars, which makes it difficult to assess the statistical significance of the improvements. Furthermore, the comparison to baseline models and the evaluation of performance changes with varying viewpoints are limited.
Based on these concerns, I decide to reject the paper. The main reasons for this decision are the lack of sufficient experiments to justify the effectiveness of the approach and the need for more rigorous evaluation of the results.
To improve the paper, I suggest the following:
* Provide more extensive experimental evaluations, including comparisons to baseline models and evaluations of performance changes with varying viewpoints.
* Include error bars in the figures to assess the statistical significance of the improvements.
* Consider additional tests, such as using multiple viewpoints, blurred images, and random initial conditions, to verify the robustness of the approach.
* Provide more details on the implementation of the fitted Q-iteration algorithm and the choice of hyperparameters.
* Consider using more advanced reinforcement learning algorithms, such as deep Q-networks or policy gradient methods, to improve the performance of the visual servoing mechanism.
I would like the authors to answer the following questions to clarify my understanding of the paper:
* Can you provide more details on the choice of hyperparameters for the fitted Q-iteration algorithm and how they were tuned?
* How do you plan to extend the approach to more complex scenarios, such as visual servoing in cluttered environments or with multiple targets?
* Can you provide more insights into the learned feature dynamics and how they relate to the visual servoing task?
* How do you think the approach can be improved to handle cases where the target object is partially occluded or has varying appearance?
