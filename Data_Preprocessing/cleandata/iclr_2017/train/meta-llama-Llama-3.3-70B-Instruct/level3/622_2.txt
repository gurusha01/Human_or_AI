This paper presents a novel approach to network morphism, extending the concept to a higher level by morphing convolutional layers into arbitrary modules. The authors introduce a graph-based representation for modules, allowing for the formulation of network morphism as a graph transformation problem. They propose two atomic morphing operations and provide algorithms for simple morphable modules and complex modules. The paper also explores the compatibility of network morphism equations and handles non-linearity and batch normalization layers.
I decide to Accept this paper, with two key reasons for this choice: 
1. The paper tackles a specific and well-defined problem in the field of neural networks, providing a clear and concise contribution to the existing body of research.
2. The approach is well-motivated, building upon existing work in network morphism and providing a novel extension to the concept.
The paper supports its claims with theoretical analysis and empirical results, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed morphing approach on benchmark datasets. The authors provide a rigorous framework for analyzing the structure of Res Net architectures, which has the potential to lead to a deeper understanding of state-of-the-art models.
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more empirical results to support their claims, particularly on the CIFAR 10 dataset without batch normalization. Additionally, the authors should elaborate on the implications of their framework for other architectures, such as Fractal Nets and densely connected convolutional networks. 
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper include: 
- Can you provide more details on the computational cost of the proposed morphing approach, particularly in comparison to other methods?
- How do the authors plan to extend their work to more complex architectures, such as those with multiple branches or recursive connections?
- Are there any potential limitations or challenges to applying the proposed morphing approach to real-world problems, and if so, how do the authors plan to address them? 
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of neural networks, providing a novel approach to network morphism and demonstrating its effectiveness on benchmark datasets. With some additional empirical results and clarification on the implications of the framework, the paper has the potential to make a substantial impact on the field.
