Summary
The paper proposes a novel approach to constructing a tree of life for biological species using the deep representation of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained for image classification. The authors leverage the hierarchical feature representation learned by deep networks to quantify the visual similarity of species and construct a tree of life. The method is based on the intuition that if two species share similar features, their cross activations in the softmax layer should be high.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the paper lacks strong motivation and concrete application, making it less relevant to the RL community. Secondly, the task solved by the paper is considered simple and a simplification of more complex problems, with no strong underlying applications to support its interest.
Supporting Arguments
The paper proposes a new approach to constructing a tree of life, but it does not provide a clear motivation for why this problem is important or how it relates to the broader field of reinforcement learning. The authors also do not provide a thorough analysis of the limitations and potential applications of their method. Furthermore, the problem of constructing a tree of life is a relatively simple option-learning problem with richer supervision, which limits the impact of the paper.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, the authors could provide a more detailed analysis of the limitations and potential applications of their method. They could also consider exploring more complex problems and providing a clearer motivation for why their approach is relevant to the RL community. Additionally, the authors could provide more experimental results and comparisons to other methods to demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach.
Questions for the Authors
I would like to ask the authors to clarify the following points:
* How does the proposed method relate to the broader field of reinforcement learning, and what are the potential applications of this approach?
* Can the authors provide more experimental results and comparisons to other methods to demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach?
* How do the authors plan to address the limitations of their method, such as the simplicity of the problem and the lack of strong underlying applications?
