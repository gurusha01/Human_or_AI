The paper proposes a novel learning framework, Recurrent Inference Machines (RIM), which abandons the traditional separation between model and inference in solving inverse problems. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of RIMs in various image reconstruction tasks, showing that they can outperform state-of-the-art methods. The paper is well-motivated, and the approach is well-placed in the literature, addressing the limitations of traditional methods in solving inverse problems.
However, I decide to reject this paper due to two key reasons. Firstly, the paper lacks clarity and presentation, making it difficult to follow. The writing is often unclear, with typos, unusual phrasing, and loose terminology, which hinders the reader's understanding of the content. Secondly, the paper lacks comparison with other transfer learning regimes, which is essential to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
The notation used in the paper is cluttered and could be simplified, and the concept of "distributed transfer learning" is unclear and requires revision. The captions to figures and tables are not informative, requiring readers to jump back and forth to understand the content. These issues significantly impact the paper's overall quality and readability.
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors refine the writing, simplify the notation, and provide more informative captions. Additionally, they should compare their method with other transfer learning regimes to demonstrate its effectiveness. The authors should also clarify the concept of "distributed transfer learning" and provide more details on the experimental setup and results.
I would like the authors to answer the following questions to clarify my understanding of the paper: (1) Can you provide more details on the experimental setup and hyperparameter tuning for the RIM model? (2) How do you plan to address the issue of optimization complexity and class imbalance in the proposed framework? (3) Can you provide more comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods in inverse problems, such as compressed sensing and sparse coding?
