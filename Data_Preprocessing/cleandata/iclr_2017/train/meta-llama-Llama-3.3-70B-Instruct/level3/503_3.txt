Summary
The paper proposes a novel approach to few-shot learning called prototypical networks, which learns a metric space where classification can be performed by computing Euclidean distances to prototype representations of each class. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on the Omniglot and miniImageNet datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results on the former and competitive results on the latter. They also show that their approach can be adapted to zero-shot learning, achieving state-of-the-art results on the Caltech UCSD birds dataset.
Decision
I decide to accept this paper, with the main reason being the simplicity and effectiveness of the proposed approach. The authors provide a clear and well-motivated explanation of their method, and the experimental results demonstrate its competitiveness with state-of-the-art approaches.
Supporting Arguments
The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with a clear structure and concise explanations. The authors provide a thorough review of related work, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of existing approaches. The proposed approach is simple to implement and computationally efficient, making it a attractive solution for few-shot learning tasks. The experimental results are thorough and well-presented, demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach on multiple datasets.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more analysis on the choice of hyperparameters, such as the number of classes per episode and the use of prototype normalization. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more comparisons with other few-shot learning approaches, such as fine-tuning and distillation. Finally, the authors may consider providing more visualizations of the learned prototypes and embeddings to gain a better understanding of the model's behavior.
Questions for the Authors
1. Can you provide more insight into the choice of hyperparameters, such as the number of classes per episode and the use of prototype normalization?
2. How do you think the proposed approach can be extended to more complex datasets, such as those with multiple modalities or high-dimensional features?
3. Can you provide more comparisons with other few-shot learning approaches, such as fine-tuning and distillation, to demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed approach?
