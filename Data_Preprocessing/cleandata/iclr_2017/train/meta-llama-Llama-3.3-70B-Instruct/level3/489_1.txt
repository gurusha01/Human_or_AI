Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper proposes a novel perspective on Highway and Residual networks, viewing them as performing unrolled iterative estimation. This perspective offers a unified theory for understanding these architectures, which have been previously introduced from an optimization perspective. The authors demonstrate that both Residual and Highway networks can be directly derived from this new perspective, providing a framework for understanding several recent findings, such as resilience to lesioning and benefits of layer dropout.
Decision to Accept
I decide to accept this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the paper tackles a specific and important question in the field of deep learning, namely, the understanding of Highway and Residual networks. Secondly, the approach is well-motivated and well-placed in the literature, providing a novel and unified perspective on these architectures.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a clear and well-structured argument, starting with a brief survey of findings that contradict the traditional representation view of deep learning. The authors then propose the unrolled iterative estimation view, which is supported by mathematical derivations and empirical evidence. The paper also provides a comparative case study of Highway and Residual networks, demonstrating their similarities and differences. The authors' use of visualization studies and experimental results to support their claims adds strength to their argument.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more detailed explanations of the mathematical derivations, particularly in Section 3.3. Additionally, it would be helpful to include more visualizations and plots to illustrate the differences between Highway and Residual networks. The authors may also consider discussing the potential applications and implications of their findings in more detail.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
1. Can you provide more intuition on why the unrolled iterative estimation view is a more suitable explanation for Highway and Residual networks than the traditional representation view?
2. How do you think the findings of this paper can be applied to other areas of deep learning, such as recurrent neural networks or generative models?
3. Can you elaborate on the potential limitations and challenges of the unrolled iterative estimation view, and how they can be addressed in future research?
