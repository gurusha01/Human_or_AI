This paper proposes a novel method for unsupervised learning and identification of latent Markovian state space models, called Deep Variational Bayes Filters (DVBF). The approach leverages recent advances in Stochastic Gradient Variational Bayes (SGVB) to overcome intractable inference distributions via variational inference. The paper is well-motivated, and the resulting model is novel, making it a valuable contribution to the field.
I decide to reject this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the experiments presented in the paper, while interesting, are not entirely convincing. For instance, the regression results in Figure 3 are not impressive, particularly with regards to obtaining angle and velocity from the state using a non-linear function. Additionally, the bouncing ball experiment is not convincing, especially in prediction, as the problem is fully determined by its initial velocity and position, making the results less impressive.
Secondly, certain aspects of the paper, such as the comparison to the model from Watter et al. (2015), are missing or unclear. The paper claims that DVBF outperforms Deep Kalman Filters (DKF) in recovering latent spaces with full information, but the comparison is not thorough, and the results are not entirely convincing.
To improve the paper, I would suggest providing more detailed comparisons to existing methods, such as Watter et al. (2015) and Krishnan et al. (2015). Additionally, the authors should consider providing more convincing experimental results, such as more complex environments or more detailed analysis of the learned latent spaces. The authors should also clarify the combination of coordinates in a 3x3 checkerboard in Figure 5a, as it is unclear and requires further explanation.
I would like to ask the authors to clarify the following points: (1) How do the authors plan to address the issue of the bouncing ball experiment being fully determined by its initial velocity and position? (2) Can the authors provide more detailed comparisons to existing methods, such as Watter et al. (2015) and Krishnan et al. (2015)? (3) How do the authors plan to improve the regression results in Figure 3, particularly with regards to obtaining angle and velocity from the state using a non-linear function? Answering these questions would help to clarify the contributions of the paper and provide more convincing evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed method.
