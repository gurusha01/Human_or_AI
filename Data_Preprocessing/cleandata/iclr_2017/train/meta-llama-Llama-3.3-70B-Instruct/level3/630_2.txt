This paper proposes a novel approach to learning activation functions in deep neural networks using nonparametric estimation. The authors introduce a class of nonparametric models for activation functions, which can be incorporated into the back-propagation framework, allowing for easy implementation. The paper also provides a theoretical justification for the choice of nonparametric activation functions and demonstrates that networks with these activation functions generalize well.
The specific question tackled by the paper is how to learn activation functions in deep neural networks, which is a crucial aspect of neural network design. The approach is well-motivated, as it addresses the limitation of current deep learning literature, which often treats the choice of activation function as a hyper-parameter. The paper provides a thorough analysis of the properties of the proposed nonparametric activation functions and demonstrates their effectiveness on several benchmark datasets.
I decide to accept this paper because it presents a well-motivated and theoretically sound approach to learning activation functions in deep neural networks. The paper provides a clear and concise explanation of the proposed method, and the experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness.
One key reason for this choice is that the paper provides a thorough analysis of the properties of the proposed nonparametric activation functions, including their Lipschitz continuity and smoothness. This analysis is crucial in demonstrating the theoretical soundness of the approach. Another key reason is that the paper provides a clear and concise explanation of the proposed method, making it easy to understand and implement.
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more detailed comparisons with other methods for learning activation functions, such as polynomial basis expansion. Additionally, the authors could explore the application of their approach to more complex neural network architectures, such as recurrent neural networks or generative adversarial networks.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper are: (1) How do the authors choose the parameters of the nonparametric activation functions, such as the interval [âˆ’L, L] and the tail truncation T? (2) Can the authors provide more insight into why Fourier basis expansion is successful in practice, while other methods, such as polynomial basis expansion, are not? (3) How do the authors plan to extend their approach to more complex neural network architectures, and what are the potential challenges and limitations of their approach?
