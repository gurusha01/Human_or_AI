This paper presents a significant advancement in the field of environment simulation, particularly in the context of agent-based systems. The authors propose a novel approach to simulating action-conditional dynamics, which enables agents to anticipate the consequences of their actions within an environment. The paper claims to improve upon previous environment simulators by introducing recurrent neural networks that can make temporally and spatially coherent predictions for hundreds of time-steps into the future.
I decide to accept this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the approach is well-motivated and well-placed in the literature, building upon the work of Oh et al. (2015) and addressing the challenges and open questions in the field. Secondly, the paper provides an in-depth analysis of the factors affecting performance and presents extensive experimental results, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach in various environments, including Atari games, 3D car racing, and mazes.
The paper supports its claims through a thorough evaluation of the proposed approach, including a comparison with existing methods and an analysis of the impact of different training schemes and hyperparameters. The results show that the proposed approach can achieve state-of-the-art performance in Atari games and demonstrate its potential in more complex environments. The paper also provides a detailed discussion of the limitations and potential extensions of the approach, including the need for more sophisticated model architectures and the importance of addressing the issue of policy-induced biases in the data.
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more insight into the interpretability of the results, particularly in terms of understanding how the model is learning to simulate the environment. Additionally, it would be beneficial to explore the potential applications of the proposed approach in real-world scenarios, such as robotics or autonomous driving.
I would like to ask the authors to clarify the following points: (1) How do the authors plan to address the issue of policy-induced biases in the data, and what potential solutions do they propose? (2) Can the authors provide more details on the computational efficiency of the proposed approach, particularly in comparison to existing methods? (3) How do the authors envision the proposed approach being used in real-world applications, and what potential challenges do they anticipate?
