Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper presents a novel approach to neural architecture search, using a recurrent neural network (RNN) as a controller to generate model descriptions of neural networks. The controller is trained with reinforcement learning to maximize the expected accuracy of the generated architectures on a validation set. The method, called Neural Architecture Search, is able to design novel network architectures that rival the best human-invented architectures in terms of test set accuracy. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach on two benchmark datasets, CIFAR-10 and Penn Treebank, achieving state-of-the-art results.
Decision
I decide to Accept this paper, with two key reasons for this choice: (1) the paper presents a unique and innovative approach to neural architecture search, and (2) the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach on challenging benchmarks.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's strengths include its performance improvements and innovative approach to quantization, aligning with modern machine learning principles. The use of a recurrent neural network as a controller allows for flexible and variable-length architecture search, which is a significant contribution to the field. The experimental results on CIFAR-10 and Penn Treebank demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, achieving state-of-the-art results and outperforming other methods.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, I suggest the authors provide more details on the implementation of the controller RNN, including the architecture and hyperparameters used. Additionally, it would be helpful to include more analysis on the search space and the exploration-exploitation trade-off in the reinforcement learning process. Furthermore, the authors could provide more insights on the interpretability of the generated architectures and the potential applications of the approach in other domains.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
1. Can you provide more details on the controller RNN architecture and hyperparameters used in the experiments?
2. How do you handle the exploration-exploitation trade-off in the reinforcement learning process, and what are the implications for the search space?
3. Can you provide more insights on the interpretability of the generated architectures, and how do you plan to extend the approach to other domains?
By addressing these questions, the authors can provide more clarity and depth to the paper, and further demonstrate the potential of the Neural Architecture Search approach.
