Summary of the Paper's Claims and Contributions
The paper presents a novel approach to incorporating prior procedural knowledge into neural networks through the use of a differentiable interpreter for the Forth programming language. The authors introduce the Forth Neural Abstract Machine (∂4), which allows programmers to write program sketches with slots that can be filled with behavior trained from program input-output data. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of ∂4 on two neural programming tasks, sorting and addition, and shows that it can learn complex transduction tasks with substantially less data and better generalization over problem sizes.
Decision and Key Reasons
Based on the review guidelines, I decide to accept this paper. The two key reasons for this choice are:
1. Novelty and Significance: The paper presents a novel approach to incorporating prior procedural knowledge into neural networks, which is a significant contribution to the field of artificial intelligence.

Supporting Arguments
The paper is well-written and provides a clear explanation of the proposed approach, including the architecture of the ∂4 machine and the training procedure. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the results, highlighting the benefits of using prior procedural knowledge in neural networks. The paper is well-placed in the literature, building on existing work on neural programming and differentiable abstract machines.
Additional Feedback and Suggestions
To further improve the paper, I suggest the following:
* Provide more details on the implementation of the ∂4 machine, including the specific Forth words used and the neural network architecture.
* Consider adding more experiments to demonstrate the scalability and robustness of the proposed approach.
* Discuss potential applications of the proposed approach in other domains, such as natural language processing or computer vision.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like to ask the authors the following questions:
* Can you provide more details on how the prior procedural knowledge is incorporated into the neural network, and how the slots are filled with behavior trained from program input-output data?
* How do you handle cases where the prior procedural knowledge is incomplete or incorrect, and how do you ensure that the neural network learns to generalize to new situations?
* Are there any plans to extend the proposed approach to other programming languages or domains, and what are the potential challenges and opportunities in doing so?
