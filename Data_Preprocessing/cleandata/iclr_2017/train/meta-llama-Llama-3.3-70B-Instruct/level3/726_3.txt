Summary
The paper proposes a novel learning framework, called Recurrent Inference Machines (RIMs), which abandons the traditional separation between model and inference in solving inverse problems. Instead, RIMs learn both components jointly without defining their explicit functional form, allowing for a more flexible and powerful approach to inverse problems. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of RIMs in various image reconstruction tasks, including denoising and super-resolution, and show that they can outperform state-of-the-art methods.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the theoretical basis for the information bottleneck is unclear and lacks rigorous argument for why it should improve generalization. Secondly, the experimental results are unconvincing, with worse performance on CIFAR-10 and poor results on MNIST compared to existing papers.
Supporting Arguments
The paper proposes a new framework for solving inverse problems, but the theoretical justification for this approach is lacking. The authors claim that RIMs can learn a prior and an inference method jointly, but it is unclear how this is achieved and why it should lead to better generalization. Furthermore, the experimental results are not convincing, with RIMs performing worse than existing methods on some tasks. While the authors show some promising results on image denoising and super-resolution, these results are not sufficient to demonstrate the effectiveness of RIMs.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, the authors should provide a more rigorous theoretical justification for the RIM framework and demonstrate its effectiveness on a wider range of tasks. Additionally, the authors should compare RIMs to existing methods more thoroughly and provide more detailed analysis of the results. It would also be helpful to see more visualizations of the results and to have a clearer explanation of the RIM architecture and its components.
Questions for the Authors
I would like to ask the authors to clarify the following points:
* Can you provide a more detailed explanation of the theoretical basis for the RIM framework and how it relates to existing methods for solving inverse problems?
* How do you choose the hyperparameters for the RIM architecture, and what is the effect of different hyperparameters on the performance of the model?
* Can you provide more detailed analysis of the results, including visualizations and comparisons to existing methods?
* How do you plan to extend the RIM framework to more complex inverse problems, such as non-linear inverse problems?
