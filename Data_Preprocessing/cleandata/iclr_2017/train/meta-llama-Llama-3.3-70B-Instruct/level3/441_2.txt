Summary of the Paper's Contributions
This paper presents a novel approach to sequence generation using recurrent mixture density networks, with a focus on handwriting and calligraphic art forms. The authors propose a physiologically plausible model of handwriting, based on the Sigma Lognormal model, which describes complex handwriting trajectories via the vectorial superimposition of lognormal strokes. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach in generating sequences that possess the statistical and dynamic qualities of handwriting, and explores various applications, including learning from small datasets and style transfer.
Decision and Key Reasons
Based on the provided guidelines, I decide to Accept this paper. The key reasons for this decision are:
1. The paper presents high novelty work, with a learned variable computation mechanism that is doing something interesting and unique in the field of sequence generation.
2. The authors have addressed the reviewer's concerns and added new comparisons, leading to an updated review score of 7, indicating a strong and well-written paper.
Supporting Arguments
The paper is well-motivated, with a clear explanation of the problem and the proposed approach. The authors provide a thorough background on the Sigma Lognormal model and its application to handwriting synthesis. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, with impressive examples of generated handwriting sequences that capture the statistical qualities of the priming sequence.
Additional Feedback and Questions
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more detailed comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, including LSTMs, to demonstrate the advantages of their approach. Additionally, a more in-depth discussion of the proposed gating mechanism and its relation to currently popular ones, such as those used in LSTMs and GRUs, would strengthen the presentation.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper are:
* How do the authors plan to extend their approach to text-to-handwriting synthesis, and what are the potential challenges and limitations of this extension?
* Can the authors provide more details on the data augmentation method used in the paper, and how it contributes to the performance of the network?
* How do the authors evaluate the quality of the generated handwriting sequences, and what metrics are used to measure their similarity to real handwriting?
