Summary
The paper introduces a novel extension of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) by replacing the traditional pixel basis with a generalized notion of frames, which can be non-orthogonal and overcomplete. The authors propose Dynamic Steerable Frame Networks (DSFNs) that can locally adapt filters in every feature map, conditioned on the input, and demonstrate improved performance on image classification and edge detection tasks.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the experiments are limited in scope, with only one set of results on a real-world dataset (Cifar-10+) and no evaluation of the model in other domains or tasks. Secondly, the paper lacks an ablation study to assess the utility of the weight sharing and gating operations, which seem important for the model's performance.
Supporting Arguments
The paper presents a well-motivated approach, building on existing work on steerable filters and CNNs. The introduction of frames as a generalized basis for CNNs is a promising direction, and the authors provide a clear and well-written explanation of their methodology. However, the experimental evaluation is limited, and the authors do not provide sufficient evidence to support the claims of improved performance and data efficiency. Additionally, the lack of an ablation study makes it difficult to assess the contribution of individual components to the model's performance.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, I suggest the authors conduct more extensive experiments on various datasets and tasks, including a thorough evaluation of the model's performance on different domains and tasks. An ablation study would also be beneficial to understand the role of each component in the model's performance. Furthermore, the authors could provide more visualizations and examples to illustrate the effectiveness of the DSFNs in different scenarios.
Questions for the Authors
1. Can you provide more details on the choice of frames used in the experiments, and how they were selected?
2. How do the authors plan to address the limited scope of the experiments, and what additional datasets or tasks do they intend to evaluate the model on?
3. Can you provide an ablation study to assess the utility of the weight sharing and gating operations, and how they contribute to the model's performance?
