This paper presents a novel approach to learning algorithmic tasks using neural networks, leveraging the principle of divide and conquer to create a recursive split and merge architecture. The authors introduce a learning framework that optimizes the architecture not only for accuracy but also for computational complexity, using only input-output example pairs. The paper is well-written, easy to follow, and presents good results, making it a strong contribution to the field.
I decide to accept this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the paper tackles a specific and well-defined problem, namely learning algorithmic tasks using neural networks, and presents a well-motivated approach to solving it. The authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their methodology, making it easy to understand and follow. Secondly, the paper presents empirical evidence that supports the claims made by the authors, demonstrating the effectiveness of their approach on tasks such as sorting and planar convex hull.
The approach presented in the paper is well-motivated, and the authors provide a thorough discussion of the related work in the field. The use of a recursive split and merge architecture is a novel and interesting approach to learning algorithmic tasks, and the authors demonstrate its effectiveness through empirical results. The paper also raises interesting questions about the consistency of weak supervision and the links between this approach and hierarchical reinforcement learning.
To improve the paper, I would suggest that the authors consider providing more detailed analysis of the results, including a more thorough discussion of the limitations of their approach and potential avenues for future work. Additionally, the authors may want to consider providing more visualizations or illustrations of the recursive split and merge architecture, to help readers better understand the methodology.
I would like the authors to answer the following questions to clarify my understanding of the paper: (1) Can you provide more details on how the dynamic hyperparameter Î· is used to control the training process, and how it is updated during training? (2) How do you plan to extend the merge step to perform both selection and concatenation in a fully learned manner, and what are the potential challenges and limitations of this approach? (3) Can you provide more discussion on the potential applications of this approach to other domains, such as graph problems or NP-hard tasks, and what are the potential benefits and challenges of using this approach in these domains?
