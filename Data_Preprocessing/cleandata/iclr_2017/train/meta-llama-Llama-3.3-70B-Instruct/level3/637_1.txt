Summary
The paper proposes a novel approach to learning state representations in an unsupervised manner using deep neural networks and robotic priors. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach in learning a one-dimensional representation of a Baxter robot's head position from raw images. The paper claims to contribute to the field of state representation learning by providing a method that can learn specialized feature detectors without supervision.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the paper's approach to learning rules from KB embeddings seems unusual and unclear, which raises questions about the validity and generalizability of the proposed method. Secondly, the paper lacks a clear comparison to other methods, such as graph random walk, which could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the proposed approach.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's use of robotic priors to constrain the learning process is an interesting idea, but it is not entirely clear how these priors are formalized and implemented. The authors provide some equations and descriptions of the priors, but more details and explanations are needed to fully understand the approach. Additionally, the paper's evaluation is limited to a single task and environment, which raises questions about the scalability and applicability of the proposed method to more complex scenarios.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details and explanations about the formalization and implementation of the robotic priors. Additionally, the authors should consider comparing their approach to other methods, such as graph random walk, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the proposed approach. The authors should also consider evaluating their approach in more complex scenarios and environments to demonstrate its scalability and applicability.
Questions for the Authors
I would like to ask the authors to clarify the following points:
* Can you provide more details and explanations about the formalization and implementation of the robotic priors?
* How do you plan to evaluate the scalability and applicability of the proposed approach to more complex scenarios and environments?
* Can you provide a comparison to other methods, such as graph random walk, to demonstrate the effectiveness and uniqueness of the proposed approach?
