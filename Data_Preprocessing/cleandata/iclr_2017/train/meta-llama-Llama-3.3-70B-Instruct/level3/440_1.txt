This paper introduces a novel approach to model-based control of stochastic dynamical systems using Bayesian deep neural networks and policy optimization based on simulated rollouts. The approach utilizes alpha-divergence minimization for Bayesian neural network (BNN) training, which has significant practical impact, particularly in terms of explainability. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method on several benchmark problems, including the Wet-Chicken problem, gas turbine control, and an industrial benchmark.
I decide to accept this paper with minor revisions. The key reasons for this decision are:
1. The paper tackles a specific and important problem in model-based reinforcement learning, which is the ability to handle stochastic dynamical systems with complex statistical patterns.
2. The approach is well-motivated and placed in the literature, building upon recent advances in Bayesian neural networks and alpha-divergence minimization.
3. The paper provides a thorough evaluation of the proposed method on several benchmark problems, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness.
However, there are some aspects that require clarification and minor revisions:
* The usage of random input $z_n$ in the neural network needs further clarification, particularly regarding its treatment and the assumption of normality.
* The paper lacks an overview of the computational complexity of training BNNs, which is essential for understanding their practical applicability.
* The comparisons with Gaussian processes should include variants that support stochastic inputs to provide a more comprehensive evaluation.
* Minor corrections are needed, such as fixing equation notation and adding subplot labels.
* More information is required on the gas turbine data, including its availability and dimensionality.
To improve the paper, I suggest the authors:
* Provide a clear explanation of the role of $z_n$ and its normality assumption.
* Include a discussion on the computational complexity of training BNNs and its implications for practical applications.
* Consider adding more comparisons with other methods, such as stochastic neural networks or other Bayesian approaches.
* Clarify the availability and dimensionality of the gas turbine data.
* Address the minor corrections and formatting issues.
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of model-based reinforcement learning, and with minor revisions, it has the potential to be a high-quality publication. 
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper are:
* Can you provide more details on the normality assumption of $z_n$ and its implications for the model?
* How do you choose the hyper-parameters for the BNNs, and what is the sensitivity of the results to these choices?
* Can you provide more information on the gas turbine data, including its availability and dimensionality?
* How do you plan to address the computational complexity of training BNNs in future work?
