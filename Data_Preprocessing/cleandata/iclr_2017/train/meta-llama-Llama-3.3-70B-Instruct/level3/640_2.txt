Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper proposes a multi-view Bayesian non-parametric algorithm for learning multi-sense word embeddings, leveraging multilingual context to improve sense identification. The approach uses a principled method to learn a variable number of senses per word, outperforming bilingual and monolingual models in word sense induction and word similarity tasks.
Decision and Key Reasons
I decide to reject this paper, with two key reasons: (1) the paper is difficult to follow, lacking clear comparisons to baseline models and making it hard to understand the novelty of the proposed work; and (2) the experimental setup is flawed, with differences in training data and computational power potentially affecting the results.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's writing style and organization make it challenging to comprehend the authors' contributions and the significance of their approach. The comparison to baseline models is not straightforward, and the authors do not provide sufficient details about the experimental setup, such as the specific datasets and hyperparameters used. Furthermore, the paper's focus on word sense induction and word similarity tasks, while important, does not demonstrate the impact of the proposed solution on downstream tasks, which would strengthen the paper's claims.
Additional Feedback and Questions
To improve the paper, I suggest the authors: (1) clarify the writing style and provide more detailed comparisons to baseline models; (2) describe the experimental setup more thoroughly, including dataset specifics and hyperparameter tuning; and (3) demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on downstream tasks, such as text classification or machine translation. I would like the authors to answer the following questions: (1) How do the authors plan to address the issue of polysemy in foreign languages, and what are the potential applications of their approach in multilingual settings? (2) Can the authors provide more insights into the choice of language families and their impact on the disambiguation signal? (3) How do the authors plan to extend their approach to model polysemy in foreign languages, and what are the potential benefits of generating a multilingual Wordnet-like resource?
