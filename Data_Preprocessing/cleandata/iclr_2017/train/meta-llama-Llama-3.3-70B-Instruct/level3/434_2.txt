Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper proposes a Bayesian non-parametric approach to analyze bioacoustic signals, specifically using Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Hidden Markov Models (HDP-HMM) to identify song units in whale and bird signals. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in unsupervised learning from bioacoustic data, showcasing its ability to automatically infer the number of hidden states and segment the signals into meaningful units.

Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest the authors consider the following points:
* Provide more details on the computational complexity of the HDP-HMM approach and its scalability to larger datasets.
* Investigate the use of other feature extraction methods, such as convolutional neural networks, to improve the robustness of the approach.
* Consider applying the HDP-HMM approach to other bioacoustic signals, such as those from other animal species, to demonstrate its broader applicability.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
* Can you provide more information on the choice of hyperparameters for the HDP-HMM model, such as the concentration parameter Î³ and the truncation level Lk?
* How do you plan to address the issue of computational expense and scalability of the HDP-HMM approach to larger datasets?
* Have you considered using other evaluation metrics, such as precision and recall, to assess the performance of the HDP-HMM approach in segmenting bioacoustic signals?
