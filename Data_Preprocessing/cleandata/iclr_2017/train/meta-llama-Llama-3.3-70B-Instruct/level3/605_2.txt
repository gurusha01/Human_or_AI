Summary
The paper proposes a novel approach to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) by introducing the concept of frames, which are a generalization of orthogonal bases. The authors argue that using frames as a basis for representing signals can lead to improved performance and additional properties, such as steerability, which allows for continuous transformation of filters under arbitrary Lie groups. The paper also introduces Dynamic Steerable Frame Networks (DSFNs), which combine the advantages of steerable function spaces with the power of neural network function estimators.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the paper lacks a clear evaluation metric to compare the performance of the proposed approach with existing methods. While the authors provide some experimental results, they are not comprehensive enough to fully support the claims made in the paper. Secondly, the paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the computational cost and efficiency of the proposed approach, particularly in comparison to existing methods.
Supporting Arguments
The paper proposes an interesting and original approach to CNNs, and the idea of using frames as a basis for representing signals is well-motivated. The authors provide some experimental results that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, particularly in the context of edge detection and video classification. However, the results are not comprehensive enough to fully support the claims made in the paper, and the authors could benefit from providing more detailed comparisons with existing methods.
Additionally, the paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the computational cost and efficiency of the proposed approach. While the authors claim that the proposed approach can be implemented at the same computational cost as existing methods, this is not fully supported by the experimental results provided.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, the authors could provide more comprehensive experimental results, including a clear evaluation metric to compare the performance of the proposed approach with existing methods. The authors could also benefit from providing a more detailed analysis of the computational cost and efficiency of the proposed approach, particularly in comparison to existing methods.
Some questions that I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper include:
* How do the authors plan to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach in comparison to existing methods?
* What is the computational cost and efficiency of the proposed approach, particularly in comparison to existing methods?
* How do the authors plan to address the issue of overfitting in the proposed approach, particularly in the context of small datasets?
Overall, while the paper proposes an interesting and original approach to CNNs, it requires more comprehensive experimental results and a more detailed analysis of the computational cost and efficiency of the proposed approach to fully support the claims made in the paper.
