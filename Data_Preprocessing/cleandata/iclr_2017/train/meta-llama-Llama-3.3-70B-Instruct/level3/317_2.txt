Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper proposes a novel approach to distributed stochastic optimization, which combines the benefits of synchronous and asynchronous methods. The authors introduce a synchronous stochastic optimization algorithm with backup workers, which mitigates the straggler effect while avoiding gradient staleness. The paper provides a thorough analysis of the trade-offs between synchronous and asynchronous methods, and demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach through extensive experiments on various models, including Inception and PixelCNN.

Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors:
* Provide more details on the implementation of the backup workers, including how they are selected and how their gradients are aggregated.
* Consider adding more experiments to evaluate the robustness of the proposed approach to different types of stragglers and network conditions.
* Provide more insights into the theoretical implications of the proposed approach, including its convergence properties and potential limitations.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
* Can you provide more details on how the backup workers are selected and how their gradients are aggregated?
* How do you handle the case where a backup worker is also a straggler?
* Can you provide more insights into the potential limitations of the proposed approach, including its scalability and robustness to different types of stragglers and network conditions?
