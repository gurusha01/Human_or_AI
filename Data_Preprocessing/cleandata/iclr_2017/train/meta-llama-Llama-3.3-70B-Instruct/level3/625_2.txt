Summary
The paper proposes a novel approach to learning handwriting generation using a physiologically plausible model of handwriting, known as the Sigma Lognormal model. The authors preprocess the input data to extract virtual targets and dynamic parameters, which are then used to train Recurrent Mixture Density Networks (RMDNs) to predict the next virtual target and dynamic parameters. The system demonstrates promising results in generating handwriting sequences that capture the statistical qualities of the input data.
Decision
I decide to accept this paper with minor revisions. The main reason for this decision is that the paper proposes a novel and inspiring approach to handwriting generation, which has the potential to scale up to large domains. The experiments demonstrate promising results, and the system's ability to learn from small datasets and perform style transfer is particularly impressive.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's strengths include its novel approach to handwriting generation, which combines the Sigma Lognormal model with RMDNs. The authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of the methodology, and the experiments demonstrate the system's ability to generate handwriting sequences that are similar to the input data. The paper also highlights the potential benefits of using a physiologically plausible model of handwriting, such as capturing both the geometry and dynamics of handwriting.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more references to related work, particularly in the area of handwriting generation and recognition. Additionally, the authors could provide more details on the implementation of the RMDNs, such as the architecture and hyperparameters used. The paper could also benefit from more quantitative evaluations of the system's performance, such as comparing the generated handwriting sequences to the input data using metrics such as accuracy or similarity.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
1. Can you provide more details on the preprocessing step, particularly on how the virtual targets and dynamic parameters are extracted from the input data?
2. How do you plan to extend the system to generate readable handwritten text, and what are the potential challenges and limitations of this approach?
3. Can you provide more quantitative evaluations of the system's performance, such as comparing the generated handwriting sequences to the input data using metrics such as accuracy or similarity?
