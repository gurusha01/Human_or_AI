Summary
The paper proposes a novel learning framework, Recurrent Inference Machines (RIMs), which abandons the traditional separation between model and inference in inverse problems. Instead, RIMs learn both components jointly without defining their explicit functional form, allowing for a more flexible and powerful approach to solving inverse problems. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of RIMs on various image restoration tasks, including denoising and super-resolution, and show that they can outperform state-of-the-art methods.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the experimental results on CIFAR-10 are substantially worse than expected, which raises concerns about the generalizability of the proposed approach. Secondly, the paper lacks convincing experimental results to demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods, particularly in terms of quantitative evaluations.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's related work section is well-written and provides a good background for the research. The connection to VAEs in section 5 is interesting, but the explanation of mutual information in section 3 could be improved. The authors propose a novel framework that has the potential to bridge the gap between inverse problems and deep learning, but the experimental results are not convincing enough to support the claims made in the paper.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, the authors should conduct further experiments to demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods, particularly in terms of quantitative evaluations. Additionally, the authors should provide more detailed explanations of the mutual information concept and its connection to the proposed framework. The authors should also consider providing more visualizations and qualitative results to support their claims.
Questions for the Authors
I would like the authors to answer the following questions to clarify my understanding of the paper and provide additional evidence to support their claims:
1. Can you provide more detailed explanations of the mutual information concept and its connection to the proposed framework?
2. How do you plan to address the poor performance on CIFAR-10, and what additional experiments do you propose to conduct to demonstrate the generalizability of the approach?
3. Can you provide more quantitative evaluations and comparisons with existing methods to support the claims made in the paper?
