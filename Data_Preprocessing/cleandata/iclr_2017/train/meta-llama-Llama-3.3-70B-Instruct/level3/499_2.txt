This paper proposes a novel approach to network quantization, which is a crucial technique for reducing the memory footprint of deep neural networks. The authors introduce a Hessian-weighted k-means clustering method that takes into account the importance of each network parameter, as measured by the Hessian matrix of the loss function. This approach is shown to outperform conventional k-means clustering and other quantization methods, especially when combined with entropy-constrained scalar quantization (ECSQ).
The paper is well-motivated, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the problem and the proposed solution. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, achieving significant compression ratios with minimal performance loss. The use of Hessian-weighting and ECSQ is a key innovation, allowing for more efficient quantization and better preservation of the network's performance.
However, I have some concerns regarding the computational complexity of the proposed approach. The computation of the Hessian matrix can be costly, especially for large networks. The authors propose an alternative method using the second moment estimates of gradients, which is a good approximation, but its accuracy may vary depending on the specific network and optimizer used.
My decision is to accept this paper, with the following key reasons:
1. The paper proposes a novel and effective approach to network quantization, which is a significant contribution to the field.
2. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, achieving significant compression ratios with minimal performance loss.
To improve the paper, I suggest the authors provide more details on the computational complexity of the proposed approach and its scalability to larger networks. Additionally, it would be helpful to include more comparisons with other state-of-the-art quantization methods and to investigate the robustness of the proposed approach to different network architectures and datasets.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer:
1. How does the computational complexity of the proposed approach compare to other quantization methods, such as k-means clustering and uniform quantization?
2. Can the authors provide more insights into the choice of the Hessian matrix as a measure of importance for network parameters?
3. How does the proposed approach perform on other datasets and network architectures, such as recurrent neural networks and transformers?
