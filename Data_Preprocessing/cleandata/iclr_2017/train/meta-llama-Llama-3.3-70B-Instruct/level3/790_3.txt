This paper proposes a novel approach to secure data transmission using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for encrypted communications. The authors introduce a 3-part neural network architecture for encoding and decoding data, which learns to protect the confidentiality of plaintexts using shared keys. The approach is well-motivated, building on the concept of adversarial training and the use of neural networks for cryptographic purposes.
However, I decide to reject this paper for two key reasons. Firstly, the proposed 3-part neural network architecture lacks practical value and is outperformed by provable cryptography systems. The authors' experiments demonstrate that the neural networks can learn to perform forms of encryption and decryption, but the results are not convincing, and the approach may not offer significant advantages over traditional cryptographic methods. Secondly, the paper's discussion of selective protection, which involves hiding correlated data fields while publishing the rest, may not provide substantial benefits over traditional decorrelation and encryption methods.
To support my decision, I argue that the paper's results are not rigorous enough to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The authors' experiments are limited, and the evaluation metrics used are not comprehensive. Furthermore, the paper lacks a thorough comparison with existing cryptographic methods, making it difficult to assess the significance of the proposed approach.
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more extensive experiments and evaluations, including comparisons with traditional cryptographic methods. Additionally, they should consider addressing the potential limitations and vulnerabilities of their approach, such as the risk of overfitting and the lack of provable security guarantees. I would like the authors to answer the following questions: (1) How do the authors plan to address the scalability and efficiency of their approach for larger datasets and more complex cryptographic tasks? (2) Can the authors provide more insights into the neural network architecture and the training process, including the choice of hyperparameters and the optimization algorithms used? (3) How do the authors intend to extend their approach to support more advanced cryptographic primitives, such as digital signatures and secure multi-party computation?
