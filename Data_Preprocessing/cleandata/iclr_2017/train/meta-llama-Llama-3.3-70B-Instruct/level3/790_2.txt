This paper explores an innovative application of adversarial training to encryption, where neural networks learn to protect information from other neural networks. The authors present a clear and well-motivated approach, building on existing literature in cryptography and machine learning. The paper's contributions are significant, as it demonstrates that neural networks can learn to perform forms of encryption and decryption without being taught specific algorithms.
I decide to reject this paper, primarily due to concerns with the experiments in Section 3. Specifically, the scenario and the roles of Bob and Eve in reconstructing certain values are unclear. Additionally, I have minor concerns that Eve should be stronger than Alice and Bob to compensate for the missing key, and that the authors have planned to add results to address this. Furthermore, the natural encryption cases where the key length is typically much shorter than the message length could make the scenario easier for Eve.
The paper's approach is well-motivated, and the authors provide a clear explanation of their objectives and training methods. However, the experiments and results require more clarification and robustness. To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the experimental setup, including the specific roles of Bob and Eve, and address the concerns mentioned above.
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
1. Can you provide more details on the scenario and roles of Bob and Eve in Section 3, and how they reconstruct certain values?
2. How do you plan to address the concern that Eve should be stronger than Alice and Bob to compensate for the missing key?
3. Can you discuss the implications of the natural encryption cases where the key length is typically much shorter than the message length on the scenario and results?
By addressing these concerns and providing more clarity on the experiments and results, the authors can strengthen their paper and demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach to learning encryption and decryption using neural networks.
