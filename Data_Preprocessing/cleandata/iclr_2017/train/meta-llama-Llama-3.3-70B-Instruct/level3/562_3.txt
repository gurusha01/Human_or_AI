Summary
The paper proposes a novel approach to sequence learning called Incremental Sequence Learning (ISL), which trains a generative recurrent neural network by gradually increasing the length of the sequence used for training. The authors demonstrate that ISL significantly improves sequence learning performance, reducing the test error by 74% and achieving a 20-fold speedup in computation time compared to regular sequence learning. The paper also explores the origins of this performance improvement and shows that ISL enables the network to build up internal representations of the sequences, which is aided by training on the early parts of sequences first.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the qualitative results are not convincing, and the paper lacks baseline samples and more convincing figures to support the claims. Secondly, the paper requires further work in terms of conceptual development and experimental evaluation to fully demonstrate the effectiveness of ISL.
Supporting Arguments
The proposed ISL approach is well-motivated, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the methodology. However, the experimental results are not comprehensive, and the paper lacks a thorough comparison with other state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, the paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the learned representations and the network's behavior during training.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more convincing qualitative results, such as visualizations of the generated sequences and comparisons with other methods. Additionally, the authors should consider providing a more detailed analysis of the learned representations and the network's behavior during training. This could involve visualizing the activations of the network's layers or analyzing the learned representations using techniques such as dimensionality reduction.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
1. Can you provide more details on the experimental setup, such as the hyperparameter tuning process and the computational resources used?
2. How do you plan to address the lack of convincing qualitative results, and what additional visualizations or comparisons would you provide to support the claims?
3. Can you provide a more detailed analysis of the learned representations and the network's behavior during training, such as visualizations of the activations of the network's layers or analysis of the learned representations using techniques such as dimensionality reduction?
