Summary
The paper introduces a novel approach to steganography using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), specifically Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGANs). The authors propose a Steganographic Generative Adversarial Networks (SGAN) model, which consists of a generator network, a discriminator network, and a steganalyzer network. The SGAN model is designed to generate realistic images that can serve as containers for secure message embedding, while also deceiving steganalysis methods. The paper presents experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of the SGAN model in decreasing the detection accuracy of steganalysis methods.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the experimental results are insufficient to validate the idea, with two out of three experiments lacking a train/test split and ignoring standard protocols. Secondly, the paper lacks clarity and specificity in its presentation, making it difficult to understand the exact form of the energy function and the details of the SGAN model.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's experimental results are limited and do not provide a comprehensive evaluation of the SGAN model. The lack of a train/test split and standard protocols in two out of three experiments raises concerns about the validity of the results. Furthermore, the paper's presentation is unclear and lacks specificity, making it difficult to understand the technical details of the SGAN model. The authors are encouraged to experimentally answer questions about the impact of the missing rejection step in Langevin MCMC, the effect of the generator on the burn-in process, and the approximation of training the generator from certain variables.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, the authors should focus on providing more comprehensive and rigorous experimental results, including a train/test split and standard protocols. Additionally, the authors should clarify and specify the technical details of the SGAN model, including the exact form of the energy function. The authors should also provide more baseline comparisons and diagnostic experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the SGAN model.
Questions for the Authors
I would like the authors to answer the following questions to clarify my understanding of the paper and provide additional evidence:
1. Can you provide more details on the experimental setup and protocols used in the paper?
2. How do you plan to address the lack of clarity and specificity in the presentation of the SGAN model?
3. Can you provide more baseline comparisons and diagnostic experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the SGAN model?
