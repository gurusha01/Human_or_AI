This paper proposes a novel neural network architecture, called Layer-RNN (L-RNN), which combines traditional convolutional layers with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to learn multi-scale contextual information. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of L-RNNs in image classification and semantic segmentation tasks, achieving promising results on CIFAR-10 and PASCAL VOC 2012 datasets.
The paper's strengths include a clear description of the proposed architecture, well-built experiments, and a simple yet effective idea. The authors also provide a detailed comparison to related work architectures, which helps to understand the novelty and advantages of L-RNNs. Additionally, the paper's quality is sound, with well-built and analyzed experiments, and its clarity is generally good.
However, the paper's weaknesses include an incremental idea that is somewhat derivative from existing work, and results that are good but do not improve over the state of the art. The paper's originality is minor, as it combines well-known ideas in a new way, and its significance is a good step forward in learning good practices for building neural networks for task-specific applications.
Based on the conference guidelines, I will answer the three key questions:
1. What is the specific question/problem tackled by the paper? The paper tackles the problem of learning multi-scale contextual information in neural networks for image classification and semantic segmentation tasks.
2. Is the approach well motivated, including being well-placed in the literature? The approach is well-motivated, and the authors provide a clear overview of the related work and the advantages of L-RNNs.
3. Does the paper support the claims? The paper provides experimental results that support the claims, but the results are not groundbreaking, and the paper does not improve over the state of the art.
Based on these questions, I decide to Accept the paper, as it provides a clear and well-motivated contribution to the field, despite its incremental nature.
To improve the paper, I suggest the following:
* Provide more detailed analysis of the results, including ablation studies and visualizations of the learned features.
* Compare the L-RNN architecture to other state-of-the-art architectures, such as attention-based models and graph-based models.
* Investigate the application of L-RNNs to other tasks, such as object detection and image generation.
I would like the authors to answer the following questions to clarify my understanding of the paper:
* Can you provide more details on the initialization of the recurrence matrix V in the L-RNN module?
* How do you plan to extend the L-RNN architecture to other tasks and applications?
* Can you provide more visualizations of the learned features and attention maps to better understand the behavior of the L-RNN module?
