Summary of the Paper's Claims and Contributions
The paper proposes a novel framework called Generative Multi-Adversarial Network (GMAN), which extends the traditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to multiple discriminators. The authors claim that GMAN can be reliably trained with the original, untampered minimax objective, unlike traditional GANs which require modifying the objective to accelerate training. The paper also introduces a new metric, Generative Multi-Adversarial Metric (GMAM), to evaluate the performance of GMAN. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of GMAN on various image generation tasks, showing that it produces higher quality samples in a fraction of the iterations compared to standard GANs.
Decision and Reasons
Based on the review, I decide to Reject the paper. The main reasons for this decision are:
1. Lack of clarity in the overall objective: The paper's objective is unclear, and the combination of the CCA objective and the top-layer objective is not well-defined.
2. Poor definition of the top-layer objective: The use of "cosine distance" or "squared cosine distance" is potentially misleading and not fully explained.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's proposal to combine a CCA objective with a downstream loss is an interesting idea, but the execution and presentation need improvement. The paper uses loose terminology, such as "correlation" and "cross-correlation" between vectors, which needs to be clearly defined. Additionally, the claim about the approach being "fully differentiable" while regular CCA is not is unclear and may need revisiting.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, the authors should:
1. Clearly define the overall objective and the combination of the CCA objective and the top-layer objective.
2. Provide a more detailed explanation of the top-layer objective and its relationship to the CCA objective.
3. Use precise terminology and definitions throughout the paper.
4. Clarify the claim about the approach being "fully differentiable" and provide more evidence to support this claim.
Questions for the Authors
1. Can you provide a more detailed explanation of how the CCA objective and the top-layer objective are combined?
2. How do you define the top-layer objective, and what is its relationship to the CCA objective?
3. Can you provide more evidence to support the claim that the approach is "fully differentiable"?
4. How do you plan to address the issues with loose terminology and unclear definitions in the paper?
