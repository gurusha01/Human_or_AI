Summary
The paper proposes a novel approach to sequence learning, called Incremental Sequence Learning, which involves gradually increasing the length of sequences used for training as the network learns to predict the early parts of the sequences. The authors evaluate this approach on a new sequence learning task, predicting and classifying MNIST pen stroke sequences, and demonstrate that it significantly improves sequence learning performance, reducing the test error by 74% and achieving a 20-fold speedup in computation time.
Decision
I decide to accept this paper, with two key reasons for this choice: (1) the paper proposes a well-motivated and novel approach to sequence learning, which is supported by a thorough analysis of the results, and (2) the experimental evaluation is rigorous and demonstrates significant improvements in sequence learning performance.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a clear and well-structured presentation of the proposed approach, including a detailed description of the Incremental Sequence Learning method and its evaluation on the MNIST pen stroke sequence data set. The authors also provide a thorough analysis of the results, including a comparison with other curriculum learning methods and an investigation of the origins of the performance improvement. The use of a new sequence learning task and data set, as well as the provision of a TensorFlow implementation and the data set, adds to the paper's strengths.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors consider providing more insight into the limitations of the proposed approach and potential avenues for future research. Additionally, it would be helpful to include more visualizations of the generated sequences and classification outputs to provide a better understanding of the network's behavior. I would also like to see more discussion on the potential applications of Incremental Sequence Learning beyond the MNIST pen stroke sequence data set.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like to ask the authors the following questions:
1. Can you provide more details on the construction of the pen stroke sequence data set, including the thresholding and thinning steps?
2. How do you think the proposed approach could be extended to other sequence learning tasks, such as language modeling or speech recognition?
3. Can you provide more insight into the role of the adaptive batch size in the Incremental Sequence Learning method, and how it contributes to the performance improvement?
