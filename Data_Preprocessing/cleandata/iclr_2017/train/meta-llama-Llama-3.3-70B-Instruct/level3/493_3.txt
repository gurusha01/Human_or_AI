Summary
The paper proposes Compositional Kernel Machines (CKMs), a novel approach to object recognition that combines the benefits of instance-based learning and kernel methods. CKMs address the curse of dimensionality by representing an exponential number of virtual instances, which can be efficiently summed over using a sum-product function. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of CKMs on various image classification tasks, including the NORB dataset, and show that they can outperform deep methods in certain scenarios.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, with the main reasons being the lack of coherence and depth in certain sections, particularly the policy learning section, and the need for rewriting the experimental part of the paper to improve clarity and readability.
Supporting Arguments
While the paper proposes an interesting and novel approach to object recognition, it falls short in terms of presentation and clarity. The policy learning section, in particular, seems disconnected from the rest of the paper and lacks motivation. Additionally, the experimental section requires rewriting, with issues such as missing legends for identifying curves in figures, making it difficult to appreciate the results. The paper's contribution is notable, but it is still considered preliminary work, and further refinement is needed to make it more convincing.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, I suggest the authors focus on clarifying the policy learning section and providing more motivation for its inclusion. Additionally, the experimental section should be rewritten to improve clarity and readability, with attention to details such as figure legends and curve identification. The authors should also consider providing more context and background information on the NORB dataset and the tasks used to evaluate the CKMs.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper and provide additional evidence, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
1. Can you provide more motivation and context for the policy learning section, and explain how it relates to the rest of the paper?
2. How do you plan to address the issue of scalability in CKMs, particularly when dealing with large datasets?
3. Can you provide more details on the experimental setup and the hyperparameters used to evaluate the CKMs on the NORB dataset?
4. How do you envision CKMs being applied to real-world object recognition tasks, and what are the potential advantages and limitations of this approach?
