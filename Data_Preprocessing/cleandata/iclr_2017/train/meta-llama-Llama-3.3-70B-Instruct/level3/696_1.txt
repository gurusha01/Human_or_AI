Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper proposes a novel deep pedestrian detection method based on the Fast R-CNN framework, incorporating batch normalization to reduce training time and improve generalization performance. The authors also utilize the EdgeBoxes algorithm to generate high-quality region proposals, improving detection speed and accuracy. The method is evaluated on two benchmark datasets, INRIA and ETH, and achieves satisfactory performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, primarily due to two key reasons. Firstly, the paper's contribution, although valuable, may be better suited for a computer vision or NLP conference, rather than an AI conference focused on reading comprehension tasks. Secondly, the paper lacks discussion on more complex datasets involving multi-hop inference, which is a crucial aspect of reading comprehension tasks.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's approach to pedestrian detection is well-motivated, and the use of batch normalization and EdgeBoxes algorithm is well-placed in the literature. However, the paper's focus on pedestrian detection, rather than reading comprehension tasks, makes it less relevant to the AI conference. Additionally, the lack of discussion on more complex datasets involving multi-hop inference limits the paper's contribution to the field of reading comprehension.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, the authors could consider exploring the application of their method to more complex reading comprehension tasks, such as multi-hop inference or question answering. Additionally, the authors could provide more analysis on the effectiveness of the EdgeBoxes algorithm in generating high-quality region proposals and its impact on detection performance.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
1. How do the authors plan to extend their method to more complex reading comprehension tasks, such as multi-hop inference or question answering?
2. Can the authors provide more analysis on the effectiveness of the EdgeBoxes algorithm in generating high-quality region proposals and its impact on detection performance?
3. How do the authors think their method could be adapted to other computer vision tasks, such as object detection or image segmentation?
