This paper proposes a novel recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture for action-conditional future prediction, which combines actions into the recurrent connection of the LSTM core. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on several complex visual domains, including Atari games, 3D car racing environments, and mazes. The paper provides a thorough analysis of the factors affecting performance, including the impact of different training schemes and architectures.
The key contributions of this paper are: (1) the introduction of a new RNN architecture that incorporates actions into the recurrent connection, (2) a comprehensive analysis of the effects of different training schemes on short-term and long-term prediction capabilities, and (3) the demonstration of state-of-the-art results on several challenging domains.
I decide to accept this paper for the following reasons:
1. The paper tackles a specific question/problem, namely, how to improve the accuracy of action-conditional future prediction in complex visual domains.
2. The approach is well-motivated, building on previous work in the field, and the authors provide a clear explanation of their architecture and training schemes.
3. The paper supports its claims with extensive experimental results, including comparisons with baseline models and analyses of the effects of different training schemes.
Some supporting arguments for my decision include:
* The authors provide a thorough analysis of the effects of different training schemes, including the impact of prediction-dependent and observation-dependent transitions on short-term and long-term accuracy.
* The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed architecture on several challenging domains, including Atari games and 3D environments.
* The authors provide a clear and well-written explanation of their approach, making it easy to follow and understand.
To improve the paper, I would suggest the following:
* Provide more details on the implementation of the model, including the specific hyperparameters used and the computational resources required.
* Consider adding more comparisons with other state-of-the-art models in the field, to further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
* Provide more analysis on the limitations of the proposed approach, including potential biases in the data and the impact of noisy state transitions.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper include:
* Can you provide more details on the specific challenges faced in implementing the proposed architecture, and how you addressed them?
* How do you plan to extend the proposed approach to more complex and dynamic environments, such as those with multiple agents or changing rules?
* Can you provide more analysis on the trade-offs between short-term and long-term accuracy, and how they impact the overall performance of the model?
