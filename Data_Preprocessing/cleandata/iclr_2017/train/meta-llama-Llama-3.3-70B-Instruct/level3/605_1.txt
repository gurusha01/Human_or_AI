Summary
The paper introduces the concept of Frame-based convolutional networks, which extends the traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) by using non-orthogonal and overcomplete frames as an alternative to the standard pixel basis. The authors propose Dynamic Steerable Frame Networks (DSFNs), a hybrid of Dynamic Filter Networks and Spatial Transformer Networks, that can locally adapt filters and transform them under arbitrary Lie groups. The approach is demonstrated to improve performance on image classification, edge detection, and video classification tasks.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, with two key reasons being: (1) the lack of motivation and sufficient application areas to prove the effectiveness of the proposed method, and (2) the experimental results are not convincing, with limited experiments and no clear comparison to state-of-the-art methods.
Supporting Arguments
While the idea of using frames as an alternative to the pixel basis is interesting, the paper lacks a clear motivation for why this approach is necessary and how it can be beneficial for various applications. The experimental results are limited to a few tasks, and the comparison to other methods is not thorough. For example, the authors claim that the DSFN outperforms a Dynamic Filter Network on an edge detection task, but the difference in performance is not significant. Additionally, the authors do not provide a clear comparison to state-of-the-art methods on the video classification task.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, the authors should provide a clearer motivation for the proposed approach and demonstrate its effectiveness on a wider range of applications. The experimental results should be more thorough, with a clear comparison to state-of-the-art methods. The authors should also consider providing more details on the implementation of the DSFN, such as the architecture of the Pose-Generating network and the Dynamic Filtering mechanism.
