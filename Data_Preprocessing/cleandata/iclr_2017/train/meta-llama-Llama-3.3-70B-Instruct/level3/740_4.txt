Summary
The paper introduces NewsQA, a large-scale machine comprehension dataset consisting of over 100,000 question-answer pairs based on news articles from CNN. The dataset is designed to encourage exploratory and curiosity-based questions that require reasoning mechanisms, such as synthesis of information across different parts of an article. The authors analyze the dataset and demonstrate its challenge and usefulness as a machine comprehension benchmark, showing a significant performance gap between humans and deep neural models.
Decision
I decide to accept this paper, with the main reason being that it presents a well-motivated and well-designed dataset that addresses a significant need in the field of machine comprehension. The paper provides a thorough analysis of the dataset and demonstrates its effectiveness in evaluating the performance of machine comprehension models.
Supporting Arguments
The paper is well-written and clearly presents the motivation, design, and analysis of the NewsQA dataset. The authors provide a thorough comparison with existing datasets and demonstrate the uniqueness and challenge of NewsQA. The experimental results show a significant performance gap between humans and deep neural models, highlighting the need for further research in machine comprehension. The paper also provides a detailed description of the data collection methodology, which is essential for reproducing and extending the work.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the crowdsourcing process, such as the number of crowdworkers involved, the instructions provided to them, and the quality control measures taken to ensure the accuracy of the answers. Additionally, the authors could provide more analysis on the types of questions that are most challenging for the machine comprehension models and explore ways to improve their performance on these questions.
Questions for the Authors
I would like to ask the authors to clarify the following points:
* How did they ensure the quality and accuracy of the answers provided by the crowdworkers?
* What are the plans for releasing the dataset and making it available to the research community?
* How do the authors envision the NewsQA dataset being used in future research, and what are the potential applications of the dataset in real-world scenarios?
