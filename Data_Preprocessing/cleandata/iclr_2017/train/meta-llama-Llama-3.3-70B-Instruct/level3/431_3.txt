Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper proposes a novel approach to improve word vector representations by alleviating the adverse effects of polysemous words when using a lexicon. The authors introduce a fuzzy paraphrase set, where each paraphrase is annotated with a degree of reliability, and use this set to learn word vectors. The approach is shown to be effective in improving word vector quality, and the authors demonstrate its superiority over prior works.
Decision and Key Reasons
I decide to accept this paper, with the key reasons being:
1. The paper is technically sound and effectively highlights the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed simplified model.
2. The release of the open-source code is a valuable contribution to the community, similar to a novel dataset.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's technical soundness is evident in the clear explanation of the proposed approach, the fuzzy paraphrase set, and the learning method. The authors also provide a thorough evaluation of the approach, including experiments with different paraphrase sets, parameters, and corpus sizes. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in improving word vector quality.
However, the paper's novelty is limited, as the idea of modeling deep learning computation is not particularly new. The authors' ability to use the framework to make novel architectural decisions that improve training scalability would have added significant value to the paper.
Additional Feedback and Questions
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors:
1. Provide more discussion on the potential applications of the proposed approach in real-world scenarios.
2. Consider exploring the use of other types of paraphrase sets or learning methods to further improve the word vector quality.
3. Clarify the computational complexity of the proposed approach and its scalability to large-scale datasets.
I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
1. How do the authors plan to extend the proposed approach to other languages or domains?
2. Can the authors provide more insights into the choice of the control function and its impact on the learning process?
3. How do the authors envision the proposed approach being used in conjunction with other word vector learning methods, such as word2vec or GloVe?
