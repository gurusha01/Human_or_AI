The paper proposes a method for evaluating the log-likelihood of decoder-based generative models using annealed importance sampling (AIS). The authors demonstrate that AIS can provide more accurate estimates of log-likelihood compared to existing methods such as kernel density estimation (KDE) and importance weighted autoencoders (IWAE). The paper also provides a thorough analysis of the performance of various decoder-based models, including variational autoencoders (VAEs), generative adversarial networks (GANs), and generative moment matching networks (GMMNs).
I decide to reject this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the paper lacks qualitative experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. While the authors provide a thorough analysis of the performance of various decoder-based models, they do not provide sufficient qualitative results to support their claims. Secondly, the paper does not demonstrate the tightness of the variational bound in the case of a learned transition operator, which is a crucial aspect of the proposed method.
To support my decision, I provide the following arguments. The paper proposes a method for evaluating the log-likelihood of decoder-based generative models, which is a crucial aspect of evaluating the performance of these models. However, the authors do not provide sufficient qualitative results to demonstrate the effectiveness of their method. For example, they do not provide visualizations of the samples generated by the models, which would help to demonstrate the quality of the samples. Additionally, the authors do not demonstrate the tightness of the variational bound in the case of a learned transition operator, which is a crucial aspect of the proposed method.
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more qualitative experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. For example, they could provide visualizations of the samples generated by the models, or demonstrate the performance of the models on a variety of tasks. Additionally, the authors should demonstrate the tightness of the variational bound in the case of a learned transition operator, which would help to establish the validity of their method.
I would like to ask the authors the following questions to clarify my understanding of the paper. Can you provide more qualitative results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method? How do you demonstrate the tightness of the variational bound in the case of a learned transition operator? Can you provide more details on the implementation of the proposed method, including the choice of hyperparameters and the computational resources required? 
Overall, while the paper proposes a promising method for evaluating the log-likelihood of decoder-based generative models, it lacks sufficient qualitative experiments and demonstration of the tightness of the variational bound to support its claims. With additional experiments and analysis, the paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of generative modeling.
