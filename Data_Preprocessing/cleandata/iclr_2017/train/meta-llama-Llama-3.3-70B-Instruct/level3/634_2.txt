Summary
The paper introduces a novel layerwise origin-target synthesis method, specifically a differentiable Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) layer, which enables gradient flow through the computation of CCA projection matrices. This allows CCA to be used as a building block within multi-modality neural networks, optimizing the networks towards a task-specific objective while benefiting from the optimality of the CCA projections. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in cross-modality retrieval experiments on two public image-to-text datasets, surpassing both Deep CCA and a multi-view network with freely-learned projections.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the paper lacks depth in analysis and quantitative evidence to support its efficacy compared to other methods. While the authors provide some experimental results, they do not thoroughly compare their approach to existing methods, making it difficult to assess its significance. Secondly, the paper's visualization and conclusions are underwhelming, making it challenging to draw meaningful insights from the results.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's contribution, although sound and interesting, is not sufficiently supported by rigorous analysis and empirical evidence. The authors rely heavily on experimental results, but these are limited to two datasets and do not provide a comprehensive comparison to other methods. Additionally, the paper's visualization and conclusions are not well-supported, making it difficult to understand the implications of the results. For example, the authors claim that their approach is superior to Deep CCA, but the results are not convincingly demonstrated.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more thorough analysis and quantitative evidence to support their claims. This could include a more comprehensive comparison to existing methods, as well as additional experiments on more datasets. Additionally, the authors should work on improving the visualization and conclusions, making it easier to understand the implications of the results. Some specific questions I would like the authors to answer include: How does the proposed approach compare to other methods in terms of computational complexity and scalability? Can the authors provide more insight into the learned representations and how they relate to the task at hand? How do the authors plan to extend this work to other multi-modality tasks and applications? 
Questions for the Authors
1. Can you provide more details on how the differentiable CCA layer is implemented and how it is integrated into the multi-modality neural network?
2. How do you plan to address the issue of scalability and computational complexity, particularly when dealing with large datasets and complex models?
3. Can you provide more insight into the learned representations and how they relate to the task at hand, particularly in terms of the correlation between the projected views?
