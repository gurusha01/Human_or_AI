Summary
The paper proposes a novel approach to domain-invariant representation learning, called Central Moment Discrepancy (CMD), which matches higher-order central moments of domain-specific hidden activation distributions. The authors demonstrate that CMD is a metric on the set of probability distributions on a compact interval and that convergence in CMD implies convergence in distribution. The approach is evaluated on two benchmark datasets, Amazon reviews and Office, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on most tasks.
Decision
I decide to Accept this paper with two key reasons: (1) the paper introduces a well-motivated and novel approach to domain-invariant representation learning, and (2) the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on benchmark datasets.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a clear and well-structured introduction to the problem of domain-invariant representation learning and motivates the proposed approach. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the related work and demonstrate the advantages of their approach over existing methods. The experimental results are comprehensive and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on two benchmark datasets. The paper also provides a detailed analysis of the parameter sensitivity of the proposed method, which is an important aspect of any machine learning approach.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more insights into the theoretical properties of the proposed method, such as the convergence rate of the CMD metric. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more experimental results on other datasets and tasks to further demonstrate the generalizability of the proposed approach. The authors may also consider providing more details on the computational complexity of the proposed method and its scalability to large datasets.
Questions for the Authors
I would like to ask the authors to clarify the following points:
* Can you provide more insights into the choice of the parameter K, which determines the number of central moments to match?
* How does the proposed method handle cases where the domain-specific hidden activation distributions have different supports or shapes?
* Can you provide more details on the computational complexity of the proposed method and its scalability to large datasets?
