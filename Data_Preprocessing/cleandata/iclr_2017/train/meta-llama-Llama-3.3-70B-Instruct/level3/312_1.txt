Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper presents a novel approach to neural architecture search, leveraging a recurrent neural network (RNN) as a controller to generate model descriptions of neural networks. The controller is trained with reinforcement learning to maximize the expected accuracy of the generated architectures on a validation set. The method, called Neural Architecture Search, is applied to two benchmark datasets: CIFAR-10 for image classification and Penn Treebank for language modeling. The results demonstrate that the approach can design novel network architectures that rival or surpass the best human-invented architectures in terms of test set accuracy.
Decision to Accept
I recommend accepting this paper due to its well-written content, interesting topic, and strong results. The paper tackles a significant problem in the field of deep learning, namely the automation of architecture search, and presents a well-motivated and well-executed approach to addressing this challenge.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a clear and concise introduction to the problem of neural architecture search and the motivation behind the proposed approach. The methodology is well-described, and the experiments are thoroughly conducted, demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach on two challenging benchmark datasets. The results are impressive, with the proposed method achieving state-of-the-art performance on both datasets. Additionally, the paper provides a thorough analysis of the results, including ablation studies and comparisons to other methods.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the hyperparameters used for the controller RNN, such as the learning rate, weight initialization, and dropout rates. This would facilitate replication and future work. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more visualizations of the generated architectures, as well as a more detailed analysis of the search space and the optimization process.
