The paper proposes a novel method for pruning convolutional neural networks (CNNs) by iteratively removing the least important feature maps based on a Taylor expansion-based criterion. The approach is well-motivated, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of the proposed method, including its relation to existing techniques such as Optimal Brain Damage (OBD). The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in reducing the computational cost of CNNs while maintaining their accuracy.
I decide to accept this paper with the following key reasons:
1. The paper tackles a specific and relevant problem in the field of deep learning, namely, the reduction of computational cost in CNNs.
2. The approach is well-motivated, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of the proposed method, including its relation to existing techniques.
The paper supports its claims through extensive experimental results on various datasets, including Birds-200, Flowers-102, and ImageNet. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in reducing the computational cost of CNNs while maintaining their accuracy. The authors also provide a detailed comparison with existing methods, including OBD, and demonstrate the superiority of their approach.
To further improve the paper, I suggest the following:
* Provide more details on the computational complexity of the proposed method, including the time and memory requirements.
* Consider providing more experimental results on other datasets and architectures to demonstrate the generality of the proposed method.
* Discuss potential applications of the proposed method in real-world scenarios, such as embedded systems or mobile devices.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper are:
* Can the authors provide more insight into the choice of the Taylor expansion-based criterion and its relation to other existing methods?
* How does the proposed method handle the case where the feature maps have different importance across different layers?
* Are there any plans to release the code and datasets used in the experiments to facilitate reproducibility and further research?
