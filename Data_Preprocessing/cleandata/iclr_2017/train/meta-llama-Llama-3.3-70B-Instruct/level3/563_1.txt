Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper presents PixelVAE, a novel latent variable model that combines the strengths of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and PixelCNNs. PixelVAE uses a conditional PixelCNN in the decoder to model the output distribution, allowing it to capture fine details in images while maintaining a latent representation of the data. The authors also extend PixelVAE to a hierarchical model with multiple stochastic layers and autoregressive decoders, enabling it to scale to challenging natural image datasets. The paper demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on binarized MNIST, competitive performance on 64 Ã— 64 ImageNet, and high-quality samples on the LSUN bedrooms dataset.
Decision and Key Reasons
I decide to Reject this paper, with two key reasons:
1. Lack of clarity and motivation: The paper's usefulness and connection to density estimation are unclear, with derived conclusions seeming questionable and lacking concrete evidence. The experiments section is confusing, with uninformative figures and hand-wavy claims.
2. Inconsistent approach: The paper criticizes normal GANs for using heuristic objectives, but then uses multiple heuristic objectives and tricks to make PixelVAE work, which is inconsistent.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's approach to combining VAEs and PixelCNNs is interesting, but the execution is marred by a lack of clarity and rigor. The authors fail to provide a clear motivation for their approach and do not adequately support their claims with concrete evidence. The experiments section is poorly organized, making it difficult to understand the results and their implications. Furthermore, the paper's criticism of GANs is not consistent with its own use of heuristic objectives, which undermines the authors' argument.
Additional Feedback and Questions
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors:
* Provide a clearer motivation for their approach and its connection to density estimation
* Clarify the experiments section and provide more informative figures and results
* Address the inconsistency in their approach and provide a more rigorous justification for their use of heuristic objectives
I would like the authors to answer the following questions to clarify my understanding of the paper:
* Can you provide more details on how PixelVAE's autoregressive decoder is used to model the output distribution, and how it differs from traditional VAE decoders?
* How do you justify the use of multiple heuristic objectives in PixelVAE, given your criticism of GANs for using similar objectives?
* Can you provide more concrete evidence to support your claims about PixelVAE's performance on natural image datasets, such as more detailed results and comparisons to other state-of-the-art models?
