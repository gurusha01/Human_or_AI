Summary
The paper proposes a novel extension of Stochastic Gradient Variational Bayes (SGVB) to perform posterior inference for the weights of Stick-Breaking processes, enabling the definition of a Stick-Breaking Variational Autoencoder (SB-VAE). The SB-VAE is a Bayesian nonparametric version of the variational autoencoder with a latent representation of stochastic dimensionality. The authors experimentally demonstrate that the SB-VAE and its semi-supervised variant learn highly discriminative latent representations that often outperform the Gaussian VAE's.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the paper's contribution, although novel, does not significantly advance the state-of-the-art in the field, as the results are not substantially better than existing methods. Secondly, the paper lacks clarity and concision, making it difficult to follow and understand the authors' arguments and contributions.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's main contribution is the extension of SGVB to Stick-Breaking processes, which enables the definition of the SB-VAE. However, the authors do not provide sufficient evidence to demonstrate the significance of this contribution. The experimental results show that the SB-VAE performs better than the Gaussian VAE in some cases, but the differences are not substantial. Additionally, the paper lacks a clear and concise explanation of the authors' methodology and contributions, making it difficult to understand the novelty and impact of the work.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, the authors should provide more convincing evidence of the significance of their contribution, such as comparing their results to state-of-the-art methods or demonstrating the practical impact of their work. Additionally, the authors should clarify and concisely explain their methodology and contributions, using clear and simple language to make the paper more accessible to a broader audience. The authors should also address the inconsistencies and typos in the paper, such as the discussion of confusions within bilabial stops and alveolar stops not matching the actual confusion data.
Questions
I would like the authors to answer the following questions to clarify my understanding of the paper:
1. Can the authors provide more details on the experimental setup and the datasets used in the experiments?
2. How do the authors plan to address the issue of component collapsing in the SB-VAE, and what are the implications of this issue on the performance of the model?
3. Can the authors provide more insight into the relationship between the Stick-Breaking process and the Gaussian process, and how the SB-VAE differs from existing Gaussian process-based methods?
