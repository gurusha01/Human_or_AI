Summary of the Paper's Claims and Contributions
The paper proposes a neural network-based approach to simulate action-conditional dynamics in various environments, including Atari games, 3D car racing, and mazes. The authors introduce a recurrent neural network architecture that can make temporally and spatially coherent predictions for hundreds of time-steps into the future. They also provide an in-depth analysis of the factors affecting performance, including the impact of different training schemes, action-dependent state transitions, and prediction lengths. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach in improving exploration and adaptability to diverse environments.
Decision and Key Reasons
Based on the provided guidelines, I decide to Reject the paper. The two key reasons for this decision are:
1. Lack of strong baseline comparisons: The paper does not provide sufficient comparisons with existing state-of-the-art methods, particularly on benchmarks like MNIST, CIFAR10, and SVHN. This makes it difficult to assess the superiority of the proposed approach.
2. Data hygiene issues and unclear effectiveness as a regularization technique: The paper reports minimum test loss/maximum test accuracy instead of using an unbiased model selection method, which raises concerns about data hygiene. Additionally, the effectiveness of the proposed method as a regularization technique is unclear, and the paper does not provide sufficient evidence to support its claims.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's approach is an incremental improvement on label softening/smoothing, but its novelty is not high. The experimental results are not competitive with current state-of-the-art methods, and the paper lacks strong baseline comparisons. The data hygiene issues and unclear effectiveness as a regularization technique further weaken the paper's contributions.
Additional Feedback and Questions
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors:
* Provide stronger baseline comparisons with existing state-of-the-art methods
* Address the data hygiene issues and use unbiased model selection methods
* Clarify the effectiveness of the proposed method as a regularization technique
* Consider the regularization potential of early stopping on a validation set
I would like the authors to answer the following questions to clarify my understanding of the paper and provide additional evidence:
* Can you provide more details on the experimental setup and hyperparameter tuning process?
* How do you plan to address the data hygiene issues and improve the paper's methodology?
* Can you provide more insights into the effectiveness of the proposed method as a regularization technique and its potential applications?
