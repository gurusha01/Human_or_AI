Summary
The paper proposes a novel approach to handwriting generation using a physiologically plausible model of handwriting, known as the Sigma Lognormal model. The authors preprocess the input data to extract virtual targets and dynamic parameters, which are then used to train Recurrent Mixture Density Networks (RMDNs) to predict virtual targets and dynamic parameters. The system is able to generate handwriting trajectories that capture the statistical and dynamic qualities of handwriting, and can be used for tasks such as style transfer and one-shot learning.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the paper lacks a clear comparison to state-of-the-art alternatives and established benchmarks in the field of handwriting generation. Secondly, the evaluation of the proposed system is limited to a small dataset, and it is unclear how the system would perform on larger and more diverse datasets.
Supporting Arguments
The paper presents a novel approach to handwriting generation, but it is unclear how this approach compares to existing methods. The authors do not provide a thorough review of the literature, and do not compare their results to those of other researchers in the field. This makes it difficult to evaluate the significance and impact of the proposed system. Additionally, the evaluation of the system is limited to a small dataset, which may not be representative of the diversity of handwriting styles and patterns that exist in the real world.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, I would suggest that the authors provide a more thorough review of the literature, and compare their results to those of other researchers in the field. Additionally, the authors should evaluate their system on a larger and more diverse dataset, to demonstrate its ability to generalize to different handwriting styles and patterns. The authors may also want to consider using more advanced evaluation metrics, such as those that take into account the quality and readability of the generated handwriting.
Questions for the Authors
I would like to ask the authors to clarify the following points:
* How does the proposed system compare to existing methods for handwriting generation, such as those using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) or Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)?
* How does the system perform on larger and more diverse datasets, such as those that include handwriting samples from different languages or cultures?
* What are the potential applications of the proposed system, and how could it be used in real-world scenarios?
