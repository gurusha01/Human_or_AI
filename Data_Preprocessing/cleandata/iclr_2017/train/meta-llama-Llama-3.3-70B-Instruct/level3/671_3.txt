Summary of the Paper
The paper presents a novel framework for natural image modeling, called PixelVAE, which combines the strengths of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and PixelCNNs. The authors propose a VAE model with an autoregressive decoder based on PixelCNN, which allows for efficient modeling of image densities while capturing both global and local structures. The framework is extended to a hierarchical model with multiple stochastic layers, enabling the autoregressive modeling of latent feature maps. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of PixelVAE on several datasets, including MNIST, LSUN bedrooms, and 64x64 ImageNet, achieving state-of-the-art performance in terms of likelihood and sample quality.
Decision
I decide to Accept this paper, with the main reason being that it presents a well-motivated and novel approach to natural image modeling, which is a significant contribution to the field. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide a thorough evaluation of their framework on several datasets.
Supporting Arguments
The approach is well-motivated, as it addresses the limitations of existing VAE and PixelCNN models. The authors provide a clear explanation of the framework and its components, making it easy to follow and understand. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of PixelVAE, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of the results, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of their approach.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the computational complexity of their framework, as well as a more thorough comparison with other state-of-the-art models. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more examples of the samples generated by PixelVAE, to better understand the quality and diversity of the generated images.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like to ask the authors the following questions:
1. Can you provide more details on the training procedure, including the optimization algorithm and hyperparameter settings used?
2. How do you plan to extend the PixelVAE framework to more complex datasets, such as high-resolution images or videos?
3. Can you provide more insights into the hierarchical structure of the latent space, and how it relates to the autoregressive modeling of latent feature maps?
