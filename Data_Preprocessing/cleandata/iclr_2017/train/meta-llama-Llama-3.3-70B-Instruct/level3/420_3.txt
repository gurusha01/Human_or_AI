Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper investigates the loss surface of deep neural networks, focusing on the topological and geometrical aspects that affect the convergence of gradient descent algorithms. The authors propose a novel approach to studying the loss surface by analyzing the connectedness of level sets, which are sets of parameters with a fixed loss value. They provide theoretical results that quantify the amount of "uphill climbing" required to progress to lower energy configurations in single hidden-layer ReLU networks and prove that this amount converges to zero with overparametrization under mild conditions. Additionally, they introduce a dynamic programming algorithm, called Dynamic String Sampling, to efficiently approximate geodesics within each level set, providing a tool to verify the connectedness of level sets and estimate their geometric regularity.
