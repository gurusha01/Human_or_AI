Summary of the Paper
The paper proposes a variational approximation to the information bottleneck (IB) method, called Deep Variational Information Bottleneck (Deep VIB). The IB method is an information-theoretic approach to learning representations that are maximally informative about the target variable while being maximally compressive about the input data. The authors use variational inference to construct a lower bound on the IB objective and propose a stochastic neural network architecture to parameterize the distributions. They demonstrate the effectiveness of Deep VIB in learning robust representations that are resistant to adversarial attacks on MNIST and ImageNet datasets.
Decision
I decide to reject the paper, with the main reason being that the contribution of the paper is not significant enough. The results are direct applications of previous works, and most of the lemmas are restatements of known results.
Supporting Arguments
While the paper is well-written and easy to follow, the presentation of the results is unclear, particularly with regards to when stability-based bounds are tighter than dimension-based bounds. The authors' claim of a bound that does not depend on dimension is misleading, and the paper lacks a clear explanation of the relationship between the IB objective and the variational approximation. Furthermore, the experimental results, although promising, are not sufficient to demonstrate the superiority of Deep VIB over other methods.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, the authors should provide a clearer explanation of the relationship between the IB objective and the variational approximation, as well as a more detailed analysis of the experimental results. They should also consider comparing Deep VIB to other methods, such as variational autoencoders, and provide a more thorough discussion of the limitations and potential applications of their approach.
Questions for the Authors
1. Can you provide a more detailed explanation of how the variational approximation is derived, and how it relates to the IB objective?
2. How do you plan to address the issue of the bound not depending on dimension, and what are the implications of this for the applicability of Deep VIB?
3. Can you provide more experimental results, including comparisons to other methods, to demonstrate the effectiveness of Deep VIB in learning robust representations?
