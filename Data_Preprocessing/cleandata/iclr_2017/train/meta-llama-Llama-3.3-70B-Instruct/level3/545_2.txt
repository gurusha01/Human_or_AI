Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper proposes a novel approach called Compositional Kernel Machines (CKMs), which combines the benefits of instance-based learning and kernel methods to address the limitations of deep architectures. CKMs create an exponential number of virtual instances by composing transformed sub-regions of the original instances, allowing for efficient computation of discriminant functions using sum-product networks. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of CKMs on several image classification tasks, including the NORB dataset, and show promising results compared to deep methods and other kernel-based approaches.
Decision and Key Reasons
Based on the review, I decide to Reject the paper, with two key reasons:
1. Lack of Clarity and Presentation Issues: The paper suffers from a lack of clarity, with critical details often missing or poorly explained. The writing is dense and difficult to follow, making it challenging to understand the methodology and results.
2. Unclear Scalability and Limited Experiments: The paper's claims about scalability are unclear, and the experiments are limited to a few datasets, with no comprehensive comparison to other state-of-the-art methods. The results are preliminary and do not provide a thorough evaluation of the proposed approach.
Supporting Arguments
While the paper proposes an interesting approach, the methodology is not well-motivated, and the connections to existing literature are not clearly established. The authors claim that CKMs can mitigate the curse of dimensionality, but the experiments do not provide sufficient evidence to support this claim. Additionally, the paper lacks a thorough analysis of the computational complexity and scalability of the proposed approach, making it difficult to assess its practicality.
Additional Feedback and Questions
To improve the paper, I suggest the authors:
* Provide a clearer and more concise explanation of the methodology and its connections to existing literature.
* Conduct more comprehensive experiments on a wider range of datasets, including comparisons to state-of-the-art methods.
* Analyze the computational complexity and scalability of the proposed approach and provide a thorough evaluation of its practicality.
* Address the presentation issues and provide a more readable and well-organized paper.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer:
* How do the authors plan to address the scalability issues and make the approach more efficient for larger datasets?
* Can the authors provide more details on the choice of hyperparameters and the optimization procedure used in the experiments?
* How do the authors plan to extend the approach to other domains and applications, such as structured prediction, regression, and reinforcement learning problems?
