This paper proposes a novel approach to improving the efficiency of neural machine translation systems by using vocabulary selection techniques. The authors investigate various selection methods, including word co-occurrences, bilingual embeddings, word alignments, phrase pairs, and Support Vector Machines, and analyze their impact on decoding and training speed. The results show that decoding speed can be reduced by up to 90% without compromising accuracy, and training speed can be improved by up to 25% with a bi-directional LSTM encoder.
The paper's strengths include its comprehensive analysis of vocabulary selection techniques, its thorough experimentation on two language pairs, and its insightful discussion of the trade-off between speed and accuracy. The authors also provide a clear and well-structured presentation of their work, making it easy to follow and understand.
However, the paper could be improved with clearer writing, more informative plots, and additional insights into the results. For example, the authors could provide more detailed analysis of the selection methods, such as the strengths and weaknesses of each approach, and how they compare to each other. Additionally, the authors could provide more context about the related work in the field, and how their approach differs from or builds upon existing research.
To make a decision on accepting or rejecting this paper, I would consider the following key questions:
1. What is the specific question or problem tackled by the paper? The paper addresses the problem of improving the efficiency of neural machine translation systems by using vocabulary selection techniques.
2. Is the approach well-motivated, including being well-placed in the literature? The paper provides a clear motivation for using vocabulary selection techniques, and the approach is well-placed in the literature, building upon existing research in the field.
3. Does the paper support the claims? The paper provides thorough experimentation and analysis to support its claims, and the results are convincing.
Based on these questions, I would decide to accept this paper, as it makes a significant contribution to the field of neural machine translation, and the approach is well-motivated and supported by thorough experimentation and analysis.
Additional feedback to improve the paper includes:
* Providing more detailed analysis of the selection methods, such as the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.
* Including more informative plots, such as plots that compare the performance of different selection methods.
* Providing more context about the related work in the field, and how the approach differs from or builds upon existing research.
* Discussing the potential limitations and future directions of the approach.
Questions to the authors:
* Can you provide more details about the word alignment-based selection method, and how it compares to other selection methods?
* How do you plan to address the potential limitations of the approach, such as the need for large amounts of training data?
* Can you provide more insights into the trade-off between speed and accuracy, and how the approach can be optimized for different use cases?
