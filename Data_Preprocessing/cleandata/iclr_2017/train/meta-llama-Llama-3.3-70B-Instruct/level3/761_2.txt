Summary
The paper presents a systematic investigation of different context types and representations for learning word embeddings, a crucial aspect of natural language processing. The authors conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of various context definitions under four tasks and 21 datasets, aiming to provide insights into context selection and serve as a guideline for the community.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, with the primary reason being that the authors' approach, although well-motivated, lacks ambition in tackling the complexity of static analysis problems. The use of a toy language for static analysis simplifies the problem to the point where it can be solved with simple logic and an LSTM, which may not be representative of real-world static analysis challenges.
Supporting Arguments
The simplicity of the toy language used in the paper raises concerns about the applicability of the results to more realistic static analysis problems. While LSTMs have been successful in solving real-world language problems, the reviewer believes that a more ambitious approach is needed to tackle the complexities of static analysis. The paper's focus on a simplified problem may not demonstrate the full potential of the proposed approach, and the results may not be generalizable to more complex scenarios.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, the authors could consider using more realistic and complex languages for static analysis, which would allow them to demonstrate the robustness and scalability of their approach. Additionally, the authors could provide more detailed analysis and discussion of the results, highlighting the implications of their findings for the broader field of natural language processing.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper and provide additional evidence for my assessment, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
* Can you provide more details on the toy language used in the paper and how it relates to real-world static analysis problems?
* How do you plan to extend your approach to tackle more complex static analysis challenges, and what potential limitations or challenges do you foresee?
* Can you provide more insights into the experimental design and the selection of the 21 datasets used in the evaluation?
