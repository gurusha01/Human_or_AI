Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The authors propose a novel approach to pruning convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using a Taylor expansion-based criterion, which approximates the change in the loss function induced by removing a parameter. This method is shown to be more effective than other pruning criteria, such as weight magnitude and activation-based methods, in reducing the number of parameters while maintaining accuracy. The authors also introduce a FLOPs regularization technique to take into account the computational cost of each parameter, leading to significant reductions in inference time.
Decision and Reasons
I decide to Reject this paper, with two key reasons:
1. Lack of clarity and notation issues: The paper is poorly written, with flawed notation and misunderstandings regarding probability distributions, leading to confusion about the model and its components.
2. Limited empirical results: The empirical results are limited to qualitative samples and reconstructions from a single dataset, CelebA, and are of lower quality compared to state-of-the-art models.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's notation and writing style make it difficult to follow, which is a significant issue for a technical paper. Additionally, the empirical results are not comprehensive, and the comparison to state-of-the-art models is limited. The interpolation results shown in the paper appear to be interpolations in pixel space rather than meaningful latent space interpolations, which raises questions about the effectiveness of the proposed method.
Additional Feedback and Questions
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors:
* Clarify the notation and writing style to make the paper easier to follow.
* Provide more comprehensive empirical results, including comparisons to state-of-the-art models on multiple datasets.
* Address the issue of interpolation results and provide more convincing evidence of the effectiveness of the proposed method.
I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
* Can you provide more details on the Taylor expansion-based criterion and how it is computed?
* How do you plan to address the issue of notation and clarity in the paper?
* Can you provide more comprehensive empirical results, including comparisons to state-of-the-art models on multiple datasets?
