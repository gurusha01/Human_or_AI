This paper explores the concept of neural networks learning to protect their communications through encryption and decryption, without being explicitly taught specific cryptographic algorithms. The authors propose a framework where neural networks, representing Alice, Bob, and Eve, are trained to communicate securely, with Eve attempting to eavesdrop on the conversation. The paper demonstrates that neural networks can learn to perform forms of encryption and decryption, and even apply these operations selectively to meet confidentiality goals.
I decide to reject this paper, primarily due to two key reasons. Firstly, the paper lacks clear explanations of key details, such as the R_l,pi convolutions and SAEN structure, which hinders understanding of the model. Secondly, the description of the SAEN structure is poorly worded, and the 'shift' operation may be more appropriately implemented as an average rather than a summation of object representations.
To support my decision, I argue that the paper's approach, although well-motivated, is not well-placed in the literature. The authors draw inspiration from cryptography and generative adversarial networks (GANs), but the paper's methodology and results are not thoroughly grounded in these fields. Furthermore, the paper's claims are not sufficiently supported by the results, which are often unclear or difficult to interpret.
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more detailed explanations of their model and methodology, particularly with regards to the R_l,pi convolutions and SAEN structure. Additionally, the authors should consider revising the 'shift' operation to use an average rather than a summation of object representations. I would also like the authors to clarify the following points: (1) How do the authors ensure that the neural networks are learning meaningful encryption and decryption operations, rather than simply memorizing the training data? (2) Can the authors provide more insight into the 'ego graph patterns' and 'Ego Graph Neural Network' used in the experiments, and how they relate to the broader context of neural networks and cryptography? (3) How do the authors plan to address the issue of 'security by obscurity' in their approach, and what steps can be taken to ensure that the neural networks are learning robust and generalizable encryption and decryption operations?
