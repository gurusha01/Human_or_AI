Summary of the Paper
The paper explores the loss surface of deep neural networks, focusing on the topological and geometrical aspects of the optimization landscape. The authors provide new theoretical results on the connectedness of level sets in single-hidden-layer ReLU networks and introduce a dynamic programming algorithm to approximate geodesics within each level set. The algorithm is used to study the optimization of various deep learning tasks, including CIFAR-10 and MNIST classification using CNNs, and next word prediction using LSTMs.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, with two key reasons for this choice:
1. Lack of clarity and concision: The paper is overly long and dense, making it difficult to follow and understand. The authors could benefit from condensing their ideas and presenting them in a more concise and clear manner.
2. Limited novelty and impact: While the paper presents some interesting theoretical results and algorithmic contributions, the overall novelty and impact of the work are limited. The authors could strengthen their paper by providing more significant and surprising insights, or by demonstrating the practical relevance and applicability of their methods.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's theoretical results, while technically sound, are not particularly surprising or groundbreaking. The authors' algorithmic contributions, such as the Dynamic String Sampling algorithm, are interesting but not entirely new. The paper's experimental results, while demonstrating the effectiveness of the algorithm, are not particularly comprehensive or convincing.
Furthermore, the paper could benefit from a more thorough discussion of related work and a clearer explanation of the authors' contributions and their significance. The writing style is often dense and technical, making it challenging for non-experts to follow.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, the authors could consider the following suggestions:
* Provide a clearer and more concise introduction to the paper's main contributions and significance.
* Condense the technical sections and focus on the most important and novel results.
* Include more comprehensive and convincing experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm.
* Discuss related work more thoroughly and clearly explain the authors' contributions and their significance.
* Consider adding more visualizations and illustrations to help non-experts understand the paper's technical concepts.
Questions for the Authors
