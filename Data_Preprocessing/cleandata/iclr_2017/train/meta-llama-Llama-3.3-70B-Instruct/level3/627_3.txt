Summary of the Paper
The paper explores the concept of an intelligent agent learning to interact with users by asking questions, with the goal of improving language understanding and question answering ability. The authors design a simulator and a set of synthetic tasks in the movie question answering domain, where a bot can interact with a teacher to address issues such as question clarification, knowledge operation, and knowledge acquisition. The paper investigates how a bot can benefit from interaction by asking questions in both offline supervised settings and online reinforcement learning settings.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the paper's claim that images help in translating better without images at test time is not convincing, and the gains may be due to less overfitting. Secondly, the dataset used is too small for experimenting with Neural Machine Translation (NMT) and the comparison with NMT and VNMT models is unclear.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's presentation is problematic, with unnecessary symbols, inconsistent use of notation, and unclear explanations of equations and variables. Additionally, the paper lacks explanations for certain figures, and contains errors such as missing symbols and inconsistent notation. The reviewer questions the correctness of certain equations, such as the computation of h'_z, and suggests that the notation could be improved for clarity.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, the authors should provide clearer explanations of the equations and variables, and ensure consistent notation throughout the paper. Additionally, the authors should provide more detailed explanations of the figures and tables, and address the errors and inconsistencies in the paper. The authors should also consider using a larger dataset and providing a clearer comparison with NMT and VNMT models.
Questions for the Authors
1. Can you provide more detailed explanations of the equations and variables used in the paper, particularly with regards to the computation of h'_z?
2. How do you plan to address the issues with the presentation of the paper, including the use of unnecessary symbols and inconsistent notation?
3. Can you provide more information on the dataset used, and how you plan to address the limitations of the small dataset size?
4. How do you plan to improve the clarity and consistency of the explanations of the figures and tables in the paper?
5. Can you provide more details on the comparison with NMT and VNMT models, and how you plan to address the limitations of the current comparison?
