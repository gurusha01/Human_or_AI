Summary of the Paper
The authors propose a novel pedestrian detection method based on the Fast R-CNN framework, which utilizes batch normalization to reduce training time and improve generalization performance. They also employ the EdgeBoxes algorithm to generate high-quality region proposals, leading to improved detection speed and accuracy. The method is evaluated on two benchmark datasets, INRIA and ETH, and achieves satisfactory performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods.
Decision
I decide to accept this paper, with the main reason being that the authors propose a well-motivated approach that combines batch normalization with the EdgeBoxes algorithm to improve pedestrian detection performance. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, especially on the INRIA dataset.
Supporting Arguments
The authors provide a clear and concise introduction to the problem of pedestrian detection, highlighting the limitations of traditional methods and the benefits of deep learning approaches. The proposed method is well-motivated, and the use of batch normalization and EdgeBoxes algorithm is justified through experimental results. The evaluation on two benchmark datasets provides a comprehensive assessment of the method's performance.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more detailed analysis of the results, including a comparison with other state-of-the-art methods on the ETH dataset. Additionally, the authors could explore the application of their method to other object detection tasks, such as detecting pedestrians in low-resolution images. It would also be beneficial to include more visualizations of the detection results to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
