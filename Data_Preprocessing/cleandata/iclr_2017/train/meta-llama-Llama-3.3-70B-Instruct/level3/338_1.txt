Summary
This paper presents a new perspective on Highway and Residual networks, arguing that they perform unrolled iterative estimation. The authors propose that successive layers within a stage cooperate to compute a single level of representation, with the first layer providing a rough estimate that is then iteratively refined by subsequent layers. This view is supported by theoretical derivations and preliminary experiments, which demonstrate the effectiveness of both Highway and Residual networks in various tasks.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, primarily due to the lack of sufficient empirical results to support its claims. While the paper provides a compelling theoretical framework, the experimental section is limited to a few case studies, and more comprehensive evaluations are needed to fully validate the proposed perspective.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's theoretical contributions are well-motivated and clearly presented, providing a unified understanding of Highway and Residual networks. The iterative unrolling view is simple, intuitive, and supported by reasonable assumptions. However, the experimental section is limited, and more extensive evaluations are necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Additionally, the paper could benefit from more detailed comparisons with existing architectures and a more thorough analysis of the implications of the iterative estimation view.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, I suggest the following:
1. Conduct more comprehensive experiments to validate the proposed perspective, including comparisons with other architectures and evaluations on a wider range of tasks.
2. Provide more detailed analysis of the implications of the iterative estimation view, including its potential applications and limitations.
3. Consider adding more visualizations, such as combining and enlarging Figures 4 and 5, to better illustrate the effects of batch normalization and the iterative estimation process.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to address the following questions:
1. How do the authors plan to extend the experimental section to provide more comprehensive evaluations of the proposed perspective?
2. Can the authors provide more insight into the implications of the iterative estimation view, including its potential applications and limitations?
3. How do the authors respond to the criticism that the paper's experimental section is limited, and what additional experiments would they propose to fully validate the proposed perspective?
