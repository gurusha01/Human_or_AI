This paper presents a thorough analysis of the nonlinear dynamics of two-layered bias-free ReLU networks. The authors derive a close-form expression for the expected gradient of the loss function and use it to study the convergence of the network parameters to the optimal solution. The paper provides a significant contribution to the understanding of deep learning by analyzing the dynamics of ReLU networks and providing conditions for convergence.
The paper tackles the specific question of how simple approaches like gradient descent can solve a complicated non-convex optimization problem effectively. The approach is well-motivated, and the authors provide a clear and concise formulation of the problem. The paper is well-placed in the literature, and the authors provide a thorough review of previous works on the topic.
The paper supports its claims with rigorous theoretical analysis and simulations. The authors provide a detailed proof of the convergence of the network parameters to the optimal solution and demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through simulations. The results show that the network converges to the optimal solution under certain conditions, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the dynamics of the network.
Based on the analysis, I decide to accept this paper. The two key reasons for this choice are: (1) the paper provides a significant contribution to the understanding of deep learning by analyzing the dynamics of ReLU networks and providing conditions for convergence, and (2) the paper supports its claims with rigorous theoretical analysis and simulations.
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more discussion on the implications of their results for practical deep learning applications. Additionally, the authors could provide more simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on more complex networks and datasets.
I would like to ask the authors to clarify the following points: (1) How do the results of the paper relate to other optimization algorithms, such as stochastic gradient descent and Adam? (2) Can the authors provide more insight into the conditions under which the network converges to the optimal solution, and how these conditions can be satisfied in practice? (3) How do the results of the paper generalize to more complex networks, such as multilayer networks and networks with different activation functions?
