Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper proposes a novel approach to constructing a phylogenetic tree, also known as the Tree of Life, using the deep representation of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) trained for image classification. The authors leverage the hierarchical feature representation learned by deep networks to quantify the visual similarity of species, allowing them to construct a tree of life based on feature similarity. This work provides a potential solution to an important problem in evolutionary biology and sheds light on possible novel applications of deep learning in Bioinformatics.
Decision and Reasons
I decide to Accept this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the paper tackles a specific and interesting question: can deep neural networks be used to construct a phylogenetic tree based on visual similarity? The authors provide a well-motivated approach, effectively exploring the idea of adversarial training in a text context. Secondly, the paper is well-written, easy to follow, and provides empirical evidence to support its claims, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method in constructing a tree of life for various biological species.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's approach is well-placed in the literature, building on existing work in deep learning and evolutionary biology. The authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their method, including the use of probability and inner product methods to evaluate similarity between species. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, with the constructed tree of life showing high similarity to the ground truth tree. The paper also provides insights into the representations produced by deep neural networks, highlighting the potential for novel applications in Bioinformatics.
Additional Feedback and Questions
To further improve the paper, I suggest exploring how the proposed method can be applied to other domains, such as constructing a tree of life for non-biological entities. Additionally, it would be interesting to investigate the use of other deep learning architectures, such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), to construct a tree of life. I would like the authors to answer the following questions: (1) How do the authors plan to extend their method to construct a more delicate tree of life based on gene similarity? (2) Can the authors provide more details on the computational resources required to train and evaluate their method? (3) How do the authors plan to address potential limitations of their method, such as the reliance on visual features and the potential for overfitting?
