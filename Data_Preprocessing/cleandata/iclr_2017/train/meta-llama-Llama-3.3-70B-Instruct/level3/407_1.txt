Summary
The paper proposes a novel approach to few-shot learning called prototypical networks, which learns a metric space where classification can be performed by computing Euclidean distances to prototype representations of each class. The approach is simple, efficient, and achieves state-of-the-art results on the Omniglot dataset and competitive results on the miniImagenet dataset. The paper also demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach in zero-shot learning on the Caltech UCSD birds dataset.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the paper does not fully explore the potential of the approach, with experiments limited to proofs of concept and not fully evaluating the limitations and potential applications of the proposed architecture. Secondly, the paper does not convincingly address how to build libraries of reusable policies, a key challenge in hierarchical RL, and does not tackle negative transfer or compositional reuse in challenging situations.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's experimental setup has similarities to hierarchical RL, but this aspect is not fully explored, which is a notable omission. The paper provides a clear explanation of how the network architecture fits into various reinforcement learning setups, facilitating future work and experimentation. However, the results are primarily empirical, and it would be interesting to see them plotted against wall-clock time to better understand the data efficiency of the approach. The paper's findings are somewhat underwhelming, as it takes a significant amount of data to achieve good performance, and simpler approaches may be able to achieve similar results with less data and computation.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the limitations and potential applications of the proposed architecture. Additionally, the authors should address how to build libraries of reusable policies and tackle negative transfer or compositional reuse in challenging situations. It would also be helpful to see a more detailed analysis of the results, including plots against wall-clock time, to better understand the data efficiency of the approach.
Questions for the Authors
I would like the authors to clarify how they plan to address the challenge of building libraries of reusable policies and tackling negative transfer or compositional reuse in challenging situations. I would also like to see more details on the experimental setup and results, including plots against wall-clock time, to better understand the data efficiency of the approach. Furthermore, I would like the authors to discuss the potential applications of the proposed architecture and how it can be used in real-world scenarios.
