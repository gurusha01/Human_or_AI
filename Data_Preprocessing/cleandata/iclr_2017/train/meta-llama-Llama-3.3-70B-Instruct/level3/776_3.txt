The paper proposes an iterative framework for automated machine translation, mimicking the process of human translators who refine their translations through multiple drafts. This approach is well-motivated and well-placed in the literature, addressing a significant problem in machine translation. The authors provide a clear and well-written explanation of their methodology, which combines a direct model and a noisy channel model to leverage both paired and unpaired training data.
I decide to accept this paper, with the primary reason being the novelty and effectiveness of the proposed approach. The experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over direct models, especially when incorporating unpaired output data. The use of a latent alignment variable to enable tractable decoding is a notable contribution.
To support this decision, I highlight the following strengths: (1) the paper tackles a specific and important problem in machine translation, (2) the approach is well-motivated and grounded in the literature, and (3) the experimental results are convincing and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
To further improve the paper, I suggest the following: (1) provide more architectural drawings to illustrate the relationships between the different components of the model, (2) clarify the connection between error detection and iterative refinement, and (3) consider using post-edited text as ground-truth for more accurate evaluation.
I would like the authors to answer the following questions to clarify my understanding of the paper: (1) How do the authors plan to extend this approach to other machine translation tasks, such as low-resource languages or domain adaptation? (2) Can the authors provide more insights into the trade-offs between the direct model and the noisy channel model, and how to balance their contributions? (3) How do the authors plan to address the potential issue of over-reliance on the language model, which may lead to biased translations?
