Summary
The paper introduces a new dataset called MusicNet, which features dense ground truth labels for over 30 hours of classical music. This dataset has the potential to significantly impact music information retrieval research by enabling the application of modern machine learning techniques. The authors demonstrate the use of MusicNet through example experiments, although these experiments are relatively simple and may not fully showcase the capabilities of the dataset.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, primarily due to the lack of convincing experiments that demonstrate the full potential of the MusicNet dataset. While the dataset itself is a valuable contribution, the example experiments provided are not particularly exciting or challenging, and it is unclear what value the machine learning component adds to the task of identifying pitches in isolated segments of audio.
Supporting Arguments
The experiments conducted in the paper are rigorous, but the simplicity of the task and the lack of comparison to other methods detract from the overall impact of the paper. The observation that a pitch detector learns filters resembling pitches is unsurprising, and it would be more interesting to demonstrate this for higher-level tasks. Furthermore, the paper could benefit from a more convincing setup, such as demonstrating multiple prediction tasks for both low-level and high-level characteristics using simpler models.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more compelling experiments that showcase the capabilities of the MusicNet dataset. This could involve demonstrating the use of MusicNet for more complex tasks, such as music classification or generation, or comparing the performance of different machine learning models on the dataset. Additionally, the authors could provide more detail on the potential applications of MusicNet and how it can be used to advance music information retrieval research.
