Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper proposes a method to analyze bioacoustic signals using a Bayesian non-parametric approach, specifically the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Hidden Markov Model (HDP-HMM). This approach allows for the automatic identification of song units in bioacoustic signals, which is a crucial step in understanding animal communication. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method on two real-world bioacoustic datasets: humpback whale songs and multi-species bird songs.
Decision and Reasons
I decide to accept this paper, with two key reasons: (1) the paper tackles a specific and important problem in bioacoustics, and (2) the authors provide a well-motivated and well-executed approach to solving this problem. The use of HDP-HMM is a novel and suitable choice for this problem, and the authors demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments on real-world data.
Supporting Arguments
The paper is well-structured and easy to follow, with a clear introduction to the problem and the proposed approach. The authors provide a thorough review of related work and motivate the use of HDP-HMM for bioacoustic signal analysis. The experiments are well-designed and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The results are promising, with the HDP-HMM approach showing good performance in identifying song units in both humpback whale and bird songs.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the computational cost of their approach and explore ways to accelerate the MCMC sampling process. Additionally, it would be interesting to see the application of this approach to larger datasets and more complex bioacoustic signals. The authors may also consider providing more visualizations of the results, such as spectrograms of the segmented signals, to help illustrate the effectiveness of their approach.
Questions for the Authors
I would like to ask the authors to clarify the following points: (1) How do they plan to address the issue of computational cost and scalability of their approach? (2) Can they provide more details on the hyperparameter tuning process for the HDP-HMM model? (3) How do they plan to evaluate the performance of their approach on more complex bioacoustic signals, such as those with multiple species singing simultaneously?
