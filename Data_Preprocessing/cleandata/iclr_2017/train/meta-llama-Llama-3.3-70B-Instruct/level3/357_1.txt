This paper introduces a novel approach to instance-level image retrieval by exploring the impact of various factors on the performance of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in this task. The authors conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the effects of feature aggregation, output layer selection, image resizing, multi-scale feature representation, and PCA and whitening on the retrieval performance. Based on their findings, they propose a new multi-scale image representation method that achieves state-of-the-art results on four benchmark datasets.
I decide to accept this paper with minor revisions. The key reasons for this decision are:
1. The paper tackles a specific and well-defined problem in the field of computer vision, namely instance-level image retrieval.
2. The approach is well-motivated, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of the impact of various factors on the performance of CNNs in this task.
The supporting arguments for this decision are:
* The paper provides a comprehensive review of the related work in the field, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of existing methods.
* The authors conduct rigorous experiments to evaluate the effects of different factors on the retrieval performance, providing valuable insights into the behavior of CNNs in this task.
* The proposed multi-scale image representation method is shown to achieve state-of-the-art results on four benchmark datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness and potential for real-world applications.
To further improve the paper, I suggest the following additional feedback:
* The authors could provide more visualizations and examples to illustrate the effectiveness of their proposed method, particularly in comparison to existing methods.
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the computational complexity and efficiency of the proposed method, particularly in comparison to other state-of-the-art methods.
* The authors may want to consider exploring the applicability of their method to other computer vision tasks, such as object detection or image classification, to demonstrate its broader potential.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper are:
* Can the authors provide more details on the network transformations used to adapt the VGG-19 model to process images of varying sizes?
* How do the authors determine the optimal number of scales and regions for the multi-scale feature representation method?
* Can the authors provide more insights into the effects of PCA and whitening on the retrieval performance, particularly in comparison to other dimensionality reduction methods?
