This paper presents a novel approach to learning acoustic word embeddings using a multi-view setting, where both acoustic and orthographic (character) sequences are jointly embedded into a common space. The proposed method addresses the limitations of previous approaches, which either focus on learning acoustic word embeddings in a single-view setting or ignore the similarity between different words. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on several tasks, including acoustic word discrimination, cross-view word discrimination, and word similarity.
I decide to accept this paper with two key reasons: (1) the paper tackles a significant problem in speech processing and natural language processing, and (2) the proposed approach shows promising results on several tasks, outperforming previous methods.
The paper is well-motivated, and the authors provide a clear overview of the limitations of previous approaches. The proposed multi-view approach is well-placed in the literature, and the authors demonstrate its effectiveness on several tasks. The experimental results are thorough, and the authors provide a detailed analysis of the results.
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more insights into the learned embeddings, such as visualizing the embeddings using dimensionality reduction techniques or analyzing the properties of the embeddings. Additionally, the authors could explore the application of their approach to other tasks, such as speech recognition or spoken term detection.
I would like to ask the authors to clarify the following points: (1) How do the learned embeddings capture the phonetic similarity between words? (2) Can the authors provide more details on the cost-sensitive loss function and its effect on the learned embeddings? (3) How do the authors plan to extend their approach to handle out-of-vocabulary words or words with multiple pronunciations? 
Overall, this paper presents a significant contribution to the field of speech processing and natural language processing, and I believe that it deserves to be accepted.
