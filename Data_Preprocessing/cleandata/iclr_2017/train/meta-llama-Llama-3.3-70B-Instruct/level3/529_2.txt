Summary
The paper proposes a novel approach to music synthesis by combining language-model-type approaches with LSTMs and reinforcement learning. The authors aim to address the shortcomings of existing music synthesis methods, such as the lack of long-range structure and repetition of notes. The paper's contribution lies in the application of this methodology to music synthesis, with the authors putting substantial effort into crafting rules and conducting a user study.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, with the main reason being that the approach, while interesting, is not novel and closely resembles previous work in text modeling and dialogue generation. Additionally, the paper's impact is limited by the lack of novelty in the methodology, and the authors may overstate the role of scores in certain types of music, such as jazz.
Supporting Arguments
The reinforcement learning methodology used in the paper is not new and has been applied in various other domains. While the authors have made an effort to apply this methodology to music synthesis, the approach itself is not groundbreaking. Furthermore, the paper's focus on music synthesis, while interesting, may not be the best fit for this conference, which may be looking for more innovative and impactful contributions.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, the authors could consider providing more context on the novelty of their approach and how it differs from existing work in music synthesis. Additionally, they could provide more detailed analysis of the user study and the results of the reinforcement learning methodology. It would also be helpful to see more examples of the generated music and a more in-depth discussion of the limitations and potential applications of the approach.
Questions for the Authors
I would like to ask the authors to clarify the following points:
* How does their approach differ from existing work in music synthesis, and what specific contributions do they claim to make?
* Can they provide more details on the user study and the results of the reinforcement learning methodology?
* How do they plan to address the potential limitations of their approach, such as the lack of long-range structure and repetition of notes?
* Can they provide more examples of the generated music and discuss the potential applications of their approach in more detail?
