Summary
The paper proposes a novel neural network architecture called FractalNet, which is based on a self-similar design principle. The authors claim that FractalNet can match the performance of standard residual networks on image classification tasks, without relying on residual connections. The paper also introduces a regularization technique called drop-path, which prevents co-adaptation of parallel paths in the network.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the paper lacks transparency on how the fractal networks are created and how the drop-path regularization technique is implemented. Secondly, the experiments are not convincing due to the limited scope, running on only a few datasets and tasks.
Supporting Arguments
The paper proposes a new architecture, but it is not clear how the fractal structure is created and how it relates to other architectures. The authors claim that the fractal structure is simple and intuitive, but the implementation details are not provided. Additionally, the drop-path regularization technique is not well-explained, and it is not clear how it prevents co-adaptation of parallel paths. The experiments are limited to a few datasets and tasks, and it is not clear how the results would generalize to other domains.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, the authors should provide more details on the implementation of the fractal networks and the drop-path regularization technique. They should also conduct more experiments on a wider range of datasets and tasks to demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach. Furthermore, the authors should provide more analysis on the internal behavior of the fractal networks and how they relate to other architectures.
Questions for the Authors
I would like to ask the authors to clarify the following points:
* How is the fractal structure created, and what are the key design principles behind it?
* How does the drop-path regularization technique prevent co-adaptation of parallel paths, and what are the key hyperparameters that control its behavior?
* How do the authors plan to extend their approach to other domains and tasks, and what are the potential limitations of their approach?
* Can the authors provide more analysis on the internal behavior of the fractal networks, and how they relate to other architectures such as residual networks and dense networks?
