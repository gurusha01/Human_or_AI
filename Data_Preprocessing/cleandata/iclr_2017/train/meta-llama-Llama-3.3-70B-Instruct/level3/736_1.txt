Summary
The paper proposes a novel method called zoneout for regularizing Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). Zoneout stochastically preserves hidden units' activations, which helps to improve the robustness of RNNs to perturbations in the hidden state. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of zoneout on several tasks, including character-level and word-level language modeling, and classification on permuted sequential MNIST. The results show that zoneout outperforms many alternative regularizers and achieves competitive or state-of-the-art results on several datasets.
Decision
I decide to accept this paper, with the main reason being that the approach is well-motivated and the results are impressive. The authors provide a clear explanation of the zoneout method and its relationship to other regularization techniques, such as dropout and stochastic depth. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of zoneout on several tasks, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of the results.
Supporting Arguments
The paper tackles the specific question of how to regularize RNNs, which is an important problem in the field of deep learning. The approach is well-motivated, as the authors provide a clear explanation of the limitations of existing regularization techniques and how zoneout addresses these limitations. The results are impressive, as zoneout outperforms many alternative regularizers and achieves competitive or state-of-the-art results on several datasets. The authors also provide a thorough analysis of the results, which helps to understand the benefits and limitations of zoneout.
Additional Feedback
One area for improvement is the clarity of some sections, such as 4.3.1 and 3.3, which contain superfluous or unclear analysis. The authors should consider removing or rewriting these sections to improve the overall clarity of the paper. Additionally, the authors may want to consider providing more details on the hyperparameter search process, as the current implementation uses settings from previous state-of-the-art results without searching over zoneout probabilities.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like to ask the authors the following questions:
1. Can you provide more details on the hyperparameter search process, and how the zoneout probabilities were chosen for each task?
2. How do you think zoneout can be extended to other types of neural networks, such as convolutional neural networks or transformers?
3. Can you provide more insights on the relationship between zoneout and other regularization techniques, such as dropout and stochastic depth, and how they can be combined to achieve better results?
