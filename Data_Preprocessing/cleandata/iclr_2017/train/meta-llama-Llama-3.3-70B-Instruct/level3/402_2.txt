This paper presents a novel online dictionary learning approach, Neurogenetic Online Dictionary Learning (NODL), which extends the state-of-art online dictionary learning method to non-stationary environments. The proposed approach incorporates the addition and deletion of dictionary elements, inspired by the adult neurogenesis phenomenon in the hippocampus. The algorithm is well-motivated, and the paper provides a clear and thorough explanation of the method, including its components and parameters.
The paper tackles the specific question of online representation learning in non-stationary environments, which is a well-recognized problem in the field of machine learning. The approach is well-placed in the literature, building upon the online dictionary learning method of Mairal et al. (2009) and incorporating elements of neurogenesis and group sparsity regularization.
The paper supports its claims with extensive empirical evaluations on both real-world and synthetic data, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach in adapting to non-stationary environments. The results show that NODL outperforms the baseline online dictionary learning method, especially in settings with sparse dictionary elements and non-sparse data.
Based on the evaluation, I decide to accept this paper. The two key reasons for this choice are: (1) the paper presents a well-motivated and novel approach to online dictionary learning, and (2) the empirical evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in adapting to non-stationary environments.
To further improve the paper, I suggest the authors provide more insights into the theoretical analysis of the approach, particularly in the scenario of non-sparse data and sparse dictionary elements. Additionally, it would be helpful to explore the effects of varying the order of training datasets and the complexity of the data on the performance of the proposed method.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper are: (1) How does the choice of the Pearson correlation threshold Î³ affect the performance of the algorithm? (2) Can the authors provide more details on the computational advantages of using sparse dictionaries? (3) How does the proposed approach compare to other online learning methods, such as online neural networks or incremental SVMs?
