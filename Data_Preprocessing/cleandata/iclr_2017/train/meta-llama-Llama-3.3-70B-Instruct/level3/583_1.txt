Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper explores the concept of computational creativity from a machine learning perspective, focusing on generative autoencoders. It proposes a new evaluation framework and argues that traditional likelihood training and evaluation methods are ill-suited for out-of-class generation. The authors suggest using held-out classes to measure a model's creativity and present a hypothesis that a model's ability to generate new and interesting known types correlates with its ability to generate new and unknown types.
Decision and Reasons
Based on the provided guidelines, I decide to Accept this paper. The two key reasons for this choice are:
1. The paper tackles a specific and well-defined question: how to evaluate and improve the creativity of generative autoencoders. The authors provide a clear and well-motivated approach to addressing this question.
2. The paper supports its claims with theoretical and empirical results, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed evaluation framework and MCMC sampling process.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a thorough introduction to generative autoencoders and their limitations, motivating the need for a new evaluation framework. The authors propose a well-defined and intuitive framework, which is supported by theoretical results and empirical experiments. The paper also demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed MCMC sampling process in improving the quality of generated samples.
Additional Feedback and Questions
To further improve the paper, I would like to see more discussion on the potential applications and implications of the proposed evaluation framework and MCMC sampling process. Additionally, I would like to ask the authors to clarify the following points:
* How do the authors plan to address the issue of model selection bias, which is mentioned as a caveat in the paper?
* Can the authors provide more insights into the relationship between the proposed evaluation framework and other existing evaluation metrics for generative models?
* How do the authors envision the proposed MCMC sampling process being used in practice, and what are the potential challenges and limitations of this approach?
