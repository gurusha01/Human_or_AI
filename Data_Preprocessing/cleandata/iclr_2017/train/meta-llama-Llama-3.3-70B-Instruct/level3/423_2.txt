Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper proposes a novel extension to the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework, called Generative Multi-Adversarial Network (GMAN), which introduces multiple discriminators to improve the optimization and stability of the generator. The authors argue that having multiple discriminators can overcome the optimization issues with a single harsh critic and provide a more stable learning process. The paper also introduces a new metric, called Generative Multi-Adversarial Metric (GMAM), to evaluate the performance of GMAN.
Decision and Reasons
Based on the review, I would reject the paper with the following reasons:
1. Lack of convincing evidence: The paper's main idea is straightforward to implement, but it requires more analysis and evidence to support its effectiveness. The GMAM metric is not convincing without evidence of convergence, and it does not provide meaningful information about mode coverage or probability mass misallocation.
2. Insufficient evaluation: The paper's evaluation is limited to a few image generation tasks, and the results are not comprehensive enough to demonstrate the superiority of GMAN over standard GANs.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's idea of using multiple discriminators is interesting, but it is not clear how the authors chose the number of discriminators and how they ensured that the discriminators are diverse and do not collapse to a single solution. The paper also lacks a thorough analysis of the optimization process and the stability of the generator. Additionally, the GMAM metric is not well-motivated, and its connection to the generator's performance is not clear.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, the authors should provide more comprehensive evaluations, including comparisons with other GAN variants and more detailed analysis of the optimization process. They should also provide more evidence to support the effectiveness of the GMAM metric and its connection to the generator's performance. Furthermore, the authors should consider using more sophisticated mechanisms for letting the generator control the game and ensuring diversity among the discriminators.
Questions for the Authors
1. How did you choose the number of discriminators, and how did you ensure that they are diverse and do not collapse to a single solution?
2. Can you provide more detailed analysis of the optimization process and the stability of the generator?
3. How did you motivate the GMAM metric, and what is its connection to the generator's performance?
4. Can you provide more comprehensive evaluations, including comparisons with other GAN variants?
