This paper presents a novel approach to learning continuous semantic representations of mathematical and logical expressions, called neural equivalence networks (EQNETs). The authors tackle the fundamental problem of representing and inferring procedural knowledge, which is a crucial aspect of machine learning and artificial intelligence. The proposed EQNET architecture learns to compose representations of equivalence classes into new equivalence classes, allowing it to capture the compositional nature of symbolic expressions.
The paper claims to contribute to the field by introducing a new architecture that outperforms existing methods, such as recursive neural networks (TREENNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), in learning semantic representations of symbolic expressions. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of EQNETs through an exhaustive evaluation on a diverse class of symbolic algebraic and boolean expression types.
I decide to accept this paper due to its correctness, experimental soundness, and significant contribution to the field. The paper provides a clear and well-motivated approach to learning continuous semantic representations of procedural knowledge, which is a challenging problem in machine learning. The experimental evaluation is thorough, and the results demonstrate the superiority of EQNETs over existing methods.
The approach is well-motivated, and the authors provide a clear explanation of the problem and the proposed solution. The paper is well-placed in the literature, and the authors adequately reference prior work in predicting intrinsic motivation, auxiliary variables, and forward modeling. The experimental section is sound, featuring comparisons with other approaches and an ablation study that supports the usefulness of the model's added complexity.
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the implementation of the EQNET architecture, such as the specific hyperparameters used and the optimization algorithm employed. Additionally, it would be helpful to include more visualizations of the learned representations, such as t-SNE plots, to provide a better understanding of the semantic space.
I would like to ask the authors to clarify the following points: (1) How do the authors plan to extend the EQNET architecture to handle more complex symbolic expressions, such as those involving multiple variables and operators? (2) Can the authors provide more insights into the optimization process, such as the convergence rate and the effect of different hyperparameters on the performance of the model? (3) How do the authors envision the application of EQNETs in real-world scenarios, such as automated theorem proving or program synthesis?
