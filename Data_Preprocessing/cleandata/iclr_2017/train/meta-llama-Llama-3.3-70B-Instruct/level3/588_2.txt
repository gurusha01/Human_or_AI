This paper proposes a novel approach to evaluating the performance of decoder-based generative models, such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and Generative Moment Matching Networks (GMMNs). The authors introduce Annealed Importance Sampling (AIS) as a method for estimating the log-likelihood of these models, which is a crucial metric for evaluating their performance. The paper also validates the accuracy of AIS using Bidirectional Monte Carlo (BDMC) and compares it to other estimation methods, such as Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) and the Importance Weighted Autoencoder (IWAE) bound.
I decide to reject this paper, with the main reason being that the experimental results are sparse and inconclusive. The paper only presents a single figure and table of results, which is not sufficient to support the claims made by the authors. Additionally, the paper lacks ablation studies and discussion, which makes it difficult to understand the contribution of each component of the proposed approach.
The approach proposed in the paper is simple and reasonable, but it lacks innovation and is based on similar approaches in computer vision, such as object detection. The authors propose both supervised and semi-supervised approaches, but the terminology is confusing, and the semi-supervised loss is actually stronger than the supervised loss. The paper also has notation issues, with sloppy notation and undefined terms, making it hard to follow in some places.
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more comprehensive experimental results, including ablation studies and discussion. They should also clarify the notation and terminology used in the paper and provide more details about the implementation of the proposed approach. Additionally, the authors should address the issue of reproducibility by providing open-sourced data and code.
I would like to ask the authors to clarify the following points: (1) How did they choose the hyperparameters for the AIS algorithm, and what is the sensitivity of the results to these hyperparameters? (2) Can they provide more details about the implementation of the BDMC algorithm and how it was used to validate the accuracy of AIS? (3) How do the authors plan to address the issue of reproducibility, and will they provide open-sourced data and code to support their claims?
