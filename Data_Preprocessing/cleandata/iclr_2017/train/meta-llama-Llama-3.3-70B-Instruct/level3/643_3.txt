Summary of the Paper's Claims and Contributions
The paper proposes a novel technique called Policy Gradient and Q-Learning (PGQL), which combines the strengths of policy gradient methods and Q-learning to improve the efficiency and stability of reinforcement learning. The authors establish a connection between the fixed points of regularized policy gradient algorithms and the Q-values of the resulting policy, showing that the Bellman residual of the induced Q-values is small for small regularization. This leads to the development of PGQL, which adds an auxiliary update to the policy gradient to reduce the Bellman residual. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of PGQL through numerical experiments on a grid world and the Atari games suite, achieving better data efficiency and stability compared to actor-critic and Q-learning alone.
