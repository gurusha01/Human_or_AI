This paper proposes a novel approach to sequence-to-sequence transduction tasks, such as machine translation and summarization, by formulating them as noisy channel decoding problems. The authors introduce a deep learning framework that uses recurrent neural networks to parameterize the source and channel models, and demonstrate its effectiveness in exploiting unpaired output data to improve performance.
The specific question tackled by the paper is how to effectively utilize unpaired output data in sequence-to-sequence transduction tasks, which is a common challenge in many natural language processing applications. The approach is well-motivated, as it leverages the idea of noisy channel decoding, which has been successfully applied in other areas of artificial intelligence, such as speech recognition.
The paper supports its claims with extensive experimental results on three tasks: abstractive sentence summarization, machine translation, and morphological inflection generation. The results show that the proposed approach outperforms direct models and achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks.
Based on the provided information, I decide to Accept this paper, with the key reason being the novelty and effectiveness of the proposed approach in exploiting unpaired output data. The paper provides a clear and well-motivated formulation of the problem, and the experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach over existing methods.
To further improve the paper, I would suggest providing more analysis on the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed approach, as well as exploring its applications to other sequence-to-sequence transduction tasks. Additionally, it would be helpful to provide more details on the implementation of the proposed framework, such as the specific architectures used for the source and channel models, and the hyperparameter tuning process.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper include:
* How does the proposed approach handle cases where the unpaired output data is noisy or of poor quality?
* Can the proposed approach be extended to other sequence-to-sequence transduction tasks, such as dialogue generation or text generation?
* How does the proposed approach compare to other methods that utilize unpaired output data, such as back-translation or multi-task learning?
