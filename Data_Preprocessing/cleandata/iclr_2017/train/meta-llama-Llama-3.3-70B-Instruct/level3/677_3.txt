Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper proposes a novel method for regularizing Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) called zoneout, which stochastically preserves hidden units' activations. This approach is shown to improve performance across various tasks, including character- and word-level language modeling on the Penn Treebank and Text8 datasets, and classification on the permuted sequential MNIST dataset. The authors demonstrate that zoneout outperforms other regularization methods, such as dropout and recurrent dropout, and achieves state-of-the-art results on some tasks.
Decision and Key Reasons
I decide to accept this paper, with the key reason being that the approach is well-motivated, and the results are significant and scientifically rigorous. The paper provides a clear explanation of the zoneout method, and the experiments are well-designed and thoroughly evaluated.
Supporting Arguments
The paper tackles the specific question of regularization in RNNs, which is a crucial aspect of training these models. The approach is well-placed in the literature, building upon existing work on dropout and recurrent dropout. The results are correct and scientifically rigorous, with the authors providing a detailed analysis of the benefits of zoneout, including its ability to improve gradient flow and introduce stochasticity into the training process.
Additional Feedback and Suggestions
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more baselines for comparison, including other regularization methods and different architectures. Additionally, it would be helpful to see more analysis on the effects of zoneout on different types of RNNs, such as LSTMs and GRUs. The authors may also consider providing more details on the hyperparameter search process and the computational resources used for the experiments.
Questions for the Authors
I would like to ask the authors to clarify the following points:
1. How do the authors plan to extend the zoneout method to other types of neural networks, such as convolutional neural networks?
2. Can the authors provide more insight into the relationship between zoneout and other regularization methods, such as dropout and weight decay?
3. How do the authors think zoneout can be used in combination with other techniques, such as attention mechanisms and residual connections, to further improve the performance of RNNs?
