Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper proposes a framework for predicting learning curves of iterative machine learning methods using Bayesian neural networks. The authors develop a specialized neural network architecture with a learning curve layer that improves learning curve predictions. They also compare different methods for generating Bayesian neural networks, including probabilistic backpropagation, stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics, and stochastic gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. The paper evaluates the predictive performance of these models on several datasets and demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach in predicting asymptotic values of partially observed learning curves and unobserved learning curves.
