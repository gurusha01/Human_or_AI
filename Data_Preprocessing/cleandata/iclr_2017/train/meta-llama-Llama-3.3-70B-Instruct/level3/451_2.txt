Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper explores the energy landscape of neural network loss functions, providing clear insights and intuitive results on the connection of loss function level sets as networks become overparameterized. The study quantifies the degree of disconnectedness in terms of loss increase to find a connected path, which has implications for the likelihood of escaping local minima with stochastic gradient descent. A simple algorithm is presented to find geodesic paths between networks with decreasing loss, showing that loss becomes more nonconvex as it decreases.
Decision and Key Reasons
Based on the evaluation, I decide to Accept this paper. The key reasons for this choice are:
1. The paper tackles a specific and important question in the field of neural networks, namely the characterization of the loss surface and its implications for optimization.
2. The approach is well-motivated, building on existing literature and providing new theoretical results and algorithms to address the problem.
3. The paper supports its claims with a combination of theoretical analysis and empirical results, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and the insights gained from the study.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a thorough analysis of the loss surface, including the topology and geometry of level sets, and presents a novel algorithm for finding geodesic paths between networks. The empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm and provide insights into the behavior of the loss surface as the network becomes overparameterized. The paper also acknowledges the limitations of the study, including the lack of analysis on deep networks and empirical loss.
Additional Feedback and Questions
To further improve the paper, I would like to see more discussion on the practical implications of the results, including the potential impact on the design of neural network architectures and optimization algorithms. Additionally, I would like to see more analysis on the relationship between the loss surface and the generalization error of the network.
Some questions I would like the authors to address in their response include:
* How do the results of the paper relate to existing work on the optimization of neural networks, such as the use of batch normalization and residual connections?
* Can the authors provide more insight into the behavior of the loss surface as the network becomes deeper, and how this affects the optimization process?
* How do the results of the paper inform the design of neural network architectures, and are there any potential applications of the proposed algorithm in practice?
