This paper proposes a modification to ConvNet training using privileged information to assign features to groups, which is applied to image classification with some beneficial results. The paper is clear and easy to follow, with experimental results showing some benefits from the proposed approach, but lacks focus and clean experiments.
The introduction focuses on replacing ensembles with a single model having diverse features, but the rest of the paper does not follow up on this point with experimental results. The paper introduces background feature suppression without much motivation and without careful experimentation, which seems ad hoc and is not decoupled from the main technical contribution of group orthogonality.
The paper lacks comparison with an ensemble and full experiments on ImageNet under the "partial privileged information" setting would be more impactful. There are minor errors in the paper, including an incorrect normalizing factor in Definition 2 and incorrect mask placements in Figure 1.
Based on the conference guidelines, I will answer the three key questions:
1. The specific question/problem tackled by the paper is how to modify ConvNet training using privileged information to assign features to groups for image classification.
2. The approach is not well-motivated, as the introduction does not clearly explain why this approach is necessary or how it relates to existing work.
3. The paper does not fully support its claims, as the experimental results are not comprehensive and lack comparison to relevant baselines.
My decision is to reject the paper, with the main reason being the lack of clear motivation and comprehensive experimental results. The paper has some interesting ideas, but they are not well-developed or supported by the experiments.
To improve the paper, I would suggest the following:
- Provide a clear motivation for the proposed approach and explain how it relates to existing work.
- Conduct more comprehensive experiments, including comparison to relevant baselines and evaluation on larger datasets such as ImageNet.
- Carefully evaluate the impact of background feature suppression and group orthogonality on the performance of the model.
- Address the minor errors in the paper, such as the incorrect normalizing factor in Definition 2 and incorrect mask placements in Figure 1.
I would like the authors to answer the following questions to clarify my understanding of the paper and provide additional evidence to support their claims:
- Can you provide more details on how the proposed approach relates to existing work on ConvNet training and feature learning?
- How do you plan to address the lack of comprehensive experimental results and comparison to relevant baselines?
- Can you provide more insight into the impact of background feature suppression and group orthogonality on the performance of the model?
