Summary
The paper proposes a novel learning framework, Recurrent Inference Machines (RIMs), which abandons the traditional separation between model and inference in inverse problems. Instead, RIMs learn both components jointly using recurrent neural networks, allowing for a direct mapping from observations to estimated signals. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of RIMs in various image reconstruction tasks, including denoising and super-resolution, and show that they can outperform state-of-the-art methods.
Decision
I decide to accept this paper, with two key reasons for this choice: (1) the paper tackles a specific and important problem in inverse problems, and (2) the approach is well-motivated and supported by empirical results.
Supporting Arguments
The paper clearly defines the problem of inverse problems and the limitations of traditional approaches. The authors provide a thorough review of related work and motivate their approach by highlighting the need for a joint learning framework. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of RIMs in various tasks, including denoising and super-resolution, and show that they can outperform state-of-the-art methods.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors discuss what the network learns about natural images, such as filter characteristics and sensitivity to image structures. Additionally, exploring the role of the state in the recurrent unit, including gate functionality and usage, could provide valuable insights into the workings of RIMs. I would also like to see more analysis on the convergence behavior of RIMs and how they compare to traditional optimization methods.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like to ask the authors: (1) How do RIMs handle non-linear inverse problems, and are there any plans to extend the framework to such cases? (2) Can the authors provide more details on the training procedure, including the choice of hyperparameters and the optimization algorithm used? (3) How do RIMs compare to other deep learning-based approaches for inverse problems, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs)?
