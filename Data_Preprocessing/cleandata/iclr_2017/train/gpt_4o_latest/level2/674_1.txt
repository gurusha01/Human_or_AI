The paper presents a theoretical framework to explain the approximate invertibility of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and connects this phenomenon to model-based compressive sensing. The authors propose that CNNs with random weights exhibit a model-Restricted Isometry Property (model-RIP), enabling sparse signal recovery. They empirically validate their theoretical claims using synthetic data and real-world datasets, demonstrating that CNNs trained for classification can reconstruct input images with reasonable accuracy. The paper also highlights the role of pooling switches and filter coherence in reconstruction quality and discusses gaps between theoretical assumptions and practical CNN architectures.
Decision: Accept (with minor revisions)  
The paper addresses an important gap in the theoretical understanding of CNNs, particularly their invertibility, which has significant implications for applications like image reconstruction and interpretability. The theoretical contributions are novel, and the empirical results support the claims. However, some aspects of the paper require clarification and refinement.
Supporting Arguments:  
1. Novelty and Contribution: The paper introduces a unique connection between CNNs and compressive sensing, leveraging model-RIP to explain invertibility. This is a valuable theoretical advancement in the field.  
2. Empirical Validation: The experiments on synthetic data and real-world datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10, ImageNet) are well-designed and demonstrate the practical relevance of the proposed framework. The empirical model-RIP evaluations and reconstruction results align with the theoretical predictions.  
3. Practical Implications: The findings have potential applications in image reconstruction, unsupervised learning, and understanding the internal representations of CNNs.
Additional Feedback for Improvement:  
1. Clarity of Assumptions: The paper assumes Gaussian random filters for theoretical analysis but acknowledges that real CNN filters deviate from this assumption. While the empirical results suggest robustness to this mismatch, a more detailed discussion of the implications and limitations of this assumption would strengthen the paper.  
2. Reproducibility: While the theoretical framework is well-detailed, the experimental setup for real-world datasets (e.g., VGGNet and AlexNet) could benefit from more explicit descriptions. Providing code or pseudocode for key experiments would enhance reproducibility.  
3. Comparison with Related Work: The paper references prior work on CNN invertibility (e.g., Dosovitskiy and Brox, 2016; Zhang et al., 2016) but does not provide a detailed comparison of the proposed method's advantages over these approaches. Including such a comparison would contextualize the contributions more effectively.  
4. Visualization: The reconstructed images from real datasets are discussed but not sufficiently analyzed. A qualitative comparison of reconstruction quality across different layers and filter types (random vs. learned) would provide deeper insights.  
5. Discussion of Pooling Switches: The role of pooling switches in reconstruction is highlighted but not explored in depth. A more detailed analysis of their contribution to the model's success would be valuable.
Questions for the Authors:  
1. How sensitive is the proposed framework to deviations from the Gaussian random filter assumption? Could the model-RIP property hold for other types of filters?  
2. Have you considered extending the analysis to modern architectures like ResNets, which include skip connections? If not, what challenges do you foresee in doing so?  
3. Can the framework be adapted to explain the invertibility of CNNs trained for tasks other than classification, such as segmentation or generative modeling?  
4. How does the reconstruction quality degrade as the coherence of learned filters increases? Could this be mitigated by explicitly enforcing model-RIP during training?
In conclusion, this paper makes a strong theoretical and empirical contribution to understanding CNN invertibility. Addressing the above points would further enhance its impact and clarity.
