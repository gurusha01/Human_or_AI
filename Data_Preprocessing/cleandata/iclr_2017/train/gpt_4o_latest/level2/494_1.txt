Review
This paper introduces a novel dataset for applying machine learning to Higher-Order Logic (HOL) theorem proving, aiming to address the challenge of automating proof step selection and generation. The authors make several contributions, including the creation of a publicly available dataset derived from HOL Light proofs, the proposal of machine learning tasks relevant to theorem proving, and the benchmarking of baseline models for proof step classification. The dataset, consisting of over 2 million training examples and nearly 200,000 testing examples, is designed to facilitate research in areas such as premise selection, intermediate step generation, and proof guidance. The authors also evaluate simple machine learning models, such as logistic regression, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), achieving promising results while identifying limitations in current approaches.
Decision: Accept (with minor revisions)
The paper makes a strong case for its acceptance due to its novel contribution of a specialized dataset and its relevance to the growing intersection of machine learning and formal theorem proving. The dataset fills a critical gap in the field, providing a benchmark for future research. The baseline results demonstrate the feasibility of applying machine learning to HOL theorem proving, while the discussion highlights areas for improvement and future exploration. However, some aspects of the paper could benefit from additional clarity and detail.
Supporting Arguments:
1. Novelty and Contribution: The dataset is a significant addition to the field, enabling machine learning research in a domain where data availability has been a bottleneck. The focus on HOL proofs, which are foundational to many formal verification tasks, ensures the dataset's relevance and utility.
2. Experimental Rigor: The authors provide a thorough evaluation of baseline models, demonstrating that even simple architectures achieve reasonable accuracy in proof step classification. This establishes a solid foundation for future work.
3. Relevance to the Field: The paper effectively situates its contributions within the context of prior work, highlighting the potential impact of machine learning on theorem proving. The discussion of tasks such as premise selection and intermediate step generation aligns well with current challenges in the field.
Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Dataset Generalization: While the dataset focuses on HOL Light, the authors should provide more discussion on its applicability to other theorem provers or foundational logics. This would strengthen the claim that the dataset has broad utility.
2. Model Limitations: The paper acknowledges that the baseline models rely on pattern matching rather than logical reasoning. The authors could expand on how future models might incorporate reasoning, such as through graph-based architectures or hybrid approaches.
3. Evaluation Metrics: The paper primarily reports accuracy for classification tasks. Including additional metrics, such as precision, recall, or F1-score, would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of model performance.
4. Task Prioritization: While the paper outlines several machine learning tasks, it would be helpful to clarify which tasks are most critical for advancing automated theorem proving and why.
Questions for the Authors:
1. How well do the proposed models generalize across different theorem provers or datasets? Have you considered testing the baseline models on other proof libraries?
2. Could the dataset be extended to include proofs from automated theorem provers (ATPs) to evaluate cross-system applicability?
3. What specific challenges do you foresee in integrating reasoning-based approaches with the current dataset and tasks?
In summary, this paper provides a valuable dataset and a strong foundation for future research in applying machine learning to theorem proving. While the baseline models are limited, the paper's contributions are significant, and its insights will likely inspire further advancements in the field. Minor revisions addressing the suggestions above would enhance the paper's impact and clarity.
