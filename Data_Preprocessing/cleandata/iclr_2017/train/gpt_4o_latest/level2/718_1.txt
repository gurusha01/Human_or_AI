Review of the Paper
Summary of Contributions
This paper proposes a novel multiagent-based neural network framework that eliminates the traditional layer structure and matrix-vector computation scheme, aiming to create a more biologically plausible model while maintaining compatibility with standard deep networks. The authors reimplement the Stacked Denoising Autoencoder (SDAE) within this framework and theoretically and empirically demonstrate its equivalence to the standard SDAE. Additionally, they introduce a variant called Sparse Connect SDAE (SCSDAE), which reduces computational complexity by randomly truncating edges. The paper evaluates the performance of the proposed models on the MNIST dataset and demonstrates the computational advantages of the multiagent approach, particularly in sparse settings.
Decision: Reject
While the paper presents an interesting idea with potential for innovation, it falls short in several key areas, including clarity, novelty, and experimental rigor. The theoretical contributions are underdeveloped, and the empirical results, while promising, lack sufficient depth and comparison to existing methods.
Supporting Arguments for Decision
1. Clarity and Presentation: The paper is difficult to follow due to its overly technical and verbose explanations. The theoretical proof of equivalence between the multiagent and standard SDAE is convoluted, making it hard to verify. Additionally, the description of the Sparse Connect SDAE lacks sufficient detail about its practical implications and potential use cases.
2. Novelty: While the idea of using a multiagent system for neural networks is intriguing, the paper does not sufficiently differentiate its approach from existing biologically plausible models or multiagent learning frameworks. The cited works (e.g., Sussillo & Abbott, Risi & Stanley) already explore biologically inspired architectures, and the paper does not clearly articulate how its approach significantly advances the state of the art.
3. Experimental Rigor: The empirical evaluation is limited to the MNIST dataset and a toy XOR dataset, which are insufficient for demonstrating the generalizability of the proposed framework. The MNIST results are not compared to other sparse or biologically plausible models, leaving the reader uncertain about the practical advantages of the proposed approach. Furthermore, the claim that Sparse Connect SDAE reduces computational time is intuitive but not thoroughly analyzed in terms of trade-offs with accuracy.
4. Reproducibility: The paper lacks sufficient implementation details for reproducibility. For example, the random edge truncation process in Sparse Connect SDAE is not described in enough detail, and the experiments do not explore the impact of hyperparameters like connection probability or learning rate on performance.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Clarify Theoretical Contributions: Simplify the proof of equivalence between the multiagent and standard SDAE, and provide a more intuitive explanation of the benefits of the multiagent framework.
2. Expand Experimental Scope: Evaluate the proposed models on more diverse datasets and tasks to demonstrate generalizability. Include comparisons to other biologically plausible and sparse neural network models.
3. Highlight Practical Applications: Discuss potential use cases for the multiagent framework, such as its applicability to hardware-constrained environments or real-time systems.
4. Acknowledge Limitations: The paper should explicitly discuss the limitations of the proposed approach, such as potential scalability issues or challenges in training multiagent systems.
5. Improve Reproducibility: Provide more detailed descriptions of the algorithms and experimental setups, including hyperparameter settings and implementation details.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the proposed multiagent framework compare to other biologically plausible models in terms of computational efficiency and accuracy?
2. Have you considered the scalability of the multiagent approach for larger datasets or deeper networks?
3. Can you provide more details on the edge truncation process in Sparse Connect SDAE and its impact on model performance?
In summary, while the paper introduces an interesting concept, it requires significant refinement in terms of clarity, experimental rigor, and positioning within the existing literature to justify acceptance.
