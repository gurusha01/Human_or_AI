Review of the Paper: "Gaussian Error Linear Unit (GELU): A High-Performing Neural Network Activation Function"
The paper introduces the Gaussian Error Linear Unit (GELU), a novel neural network activation function that bridges the gap between stochastic regularizers and traditional nonlinearities. The authors propose that GELU, derived as the expected transformation of a stochastic regularizer (the SOI map), offers a probabilistic interpretation of nonlinearities. Through extensive empirical evaluations across tasks in computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition, the authors demonstrate that GELU consistently outperforms established activation functions like ReLU and ELU. The paper also explores the SOI map's ability to replace traditional nonlinearities, challenging the necessity of deterministic activation functions in neural network architectures.
Decision: Accept
The key reasons for this decision are:  
1. Novelty and Significance: The GELU activation function presents a significant conceptual and practical advancement over existing nonlinearities. Its probabilistic foundation and demonstrated performance improvements make it a valuable contribution to the field.  
2. Empirical Rigor: The paper supports its claims with a comprehensive set of experiments across diverse datasets and tasks, showcasing the robustness and generalizability of GELU.  
Supporting Arguments for the Decision:  
1. Well-Motivated Approach: The authors provide a clear motivation for their work, addressing the limitations of existing nonlinearities and stochastic regularizers. The probabilistic interpretation of GELU is a compelling innovation that connects dropout-like regularization with activation functions.  
2. Experimental Validation: The experiments are thorough, covering multiple domains (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR-10/100, TIMIT, and Twitter POS tagging). The consistent performance improvements of GELU over ReLU and ELU across these tasks substantiate its effectiveness.  
3. Relevance to Literature: The paper situates GELU within the broader context of activation functions and stochastic regularizers, referencing key prior works (e.g., ReLU, ELU, dropout). The connections drawn between GELU, SOI maps, and adaptive dropout are insightful and well-articulated.  
Suggestions for Improvement:  
1. Theoretical Analysis: While the empirical results are strong, the paper could benefit from a deeper theoretical exploration of why GELU performs better than ReLU and ELU. For instance, how does the increased curvature and non-monotonicity of GELU contribute to its ability to approximate complex functions?  
2. Ablation Studies: Additional experiments isolating the impact of GELU's probabilistic nature (e.g., comparing GELU to simpler approximations like SiLU) would strengthen the argument for its design choices.  
3. Practical Considerations: The paper briefly mentions the computational cost of approximating the Gaussian CDF. A more detailed discussion of the trade-offs between GELU's performance gains and computational overhead would be valuable for practitioners.  
Questions for the Authors:  
1. How does GELU perform in scenarios with limited computational resources, where the cost of approximating the Gaussian CDF might be prohibitive?  
2. Can the probabilistic framework of GELU be extended to other activation functions or architectures (e.g., transformers)?  
3. Did the authors explore the impact of GELU on adversarial robustness or explainability in neural networks?  
Overall, this paper presents a well-motivated, novel, and empirically validated contribution to the field of neural network activation functions. With minor refinements, it has the potential to significantly influence both research and practice.
