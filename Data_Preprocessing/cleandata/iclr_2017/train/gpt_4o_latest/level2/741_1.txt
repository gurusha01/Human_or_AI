Review of the Paper
This paper investigates the ability of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn chess game concepts under weak supervision, using tic-tac-toe as a case study. The authors explore three key questions: whether CNNs can understand game concepts, whether cross-modal supervision is applicable to game rules, and whether class activation mapping (CAM) can activate in non-salient regions. The paper claims that CNNs can learn complex game rule concepts, that cross-modal supervision can be extended to higher-level semantics, and that CAM can activate in texture-free regions. The authors support these claims with experiments on rendered tic-tac-toe boards, demonstrating that the network can identify the correct move and visualize its attention on the board. The work also evaluates the robustness of the approach by varying board and piece appearances and provides quantitative metrics for representation accuracy and consistency.
Decision: Reject
While the paper addresses an interesting and underexplored problem, it falls short in several critical areas. The primary reasons for rejection are (1) insufficient novelty and (2) limited practical significance of the contributions.
Supporting Arguments
1. Novelty: While the paper extends CAM to non-salient regions and applies cross-modal supervision to game rules, these contributions are incremental rather than groundbreaking. The use of tic-tac-toe as a case study is overly simplistic, limiting the generalizability of the findings to more complex games or real-world applications. The paper does not provide a significant advancement over existing works in representation learning or visualization techniques.
2. Practical Significance: The problem of learning game concepts under weak supervision is intriguing, but the choice of tic-tac-toe as the testbed undermines the practical relevance of the results. Tic-tac-toe is a trivial game with a small state space, and the findings may not scale to more complex games or tasks. Additionally, the paper does not discuss potential applications of the proposed approach beyond this toy example.
Additional Feedback
1. Experimental Design: The experiments are well-structured, but they lack diversity in tasks. Exploring more complex games or real-world scenarios would strengthen the claims. The use of a pre-trained AlexNet model is also somewhat outdated, and comparisons with more modern architectures would be beneficial.
2. Clarity and Focus: The paper is dense and occasionally difficult to follow, particularly in the methodology and results sections. Simplifying the presentation and focusing on the most impactful findings would improve readability.
3. Limitations: While the paper acknowledges some limitations, such as the simplicity of the game, it does not sufficiently address the scalability of the approach or its applicability to other domains. A discussion of these aspects would enhance the paper's impact.
Questions for the Authors
1. How do you anticipate the proposed approach scaling to more complex games or tasks with larger state spaces?
2. Why was tic-tac-toe chosen as the testbed, and how do you justify its relevance to broader applications?
3. Have you considered using more modern CNN architectures or reinforcement learning frameworks to strengthen your results?
In summary, while the paper explores an interesting problem and demonstrates some promising results, its contributions are incremental, and its practical significance is limited. A stronger focus on scalability, complexity, and real-world applications would be necessary for acceptance.
