Review of the Paper
Summary of Contributions
The paper introduces the UNREAL (UNsupervised REinforcement and Auxiliary Learning) agent, a novel reinforcement learning (RL) architecture that integrates auxiliary tasks to improve data efficiency, robustness, and performance. The key contributions include learning separate policies for pseudo-reward functions, a mechanism to focus representation learning on extrinsic rewards, and the use of auxiliary tasks such as pixel control and reward prediction. The UNREAL agent significantly outperforms the baseline A3C algorithm on both 3D Labyrinth tasks and Atari games, achieving state-of-the-art results. Notably, the agent demonstrates a 10Ã— speedup in learning on Labyrinth and achieves 880% mean human-normalized performance on Atari games. The paper also provides extensive experimental results and ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

2. Experimental Rigor: The paper provides extensive experiments on two challenging domains (Labyrinth and Atari), demonstrating the generalizability of the approach. The ablation studies further validate the contributions of individual components.
3. Practical Usefulness: The proposed architecture is highly practical, achieving faster learning and better performance, which are critical for real-world applications of RL.
4. Robustness and Reproducibility: The authors provide detailed implementation details, including hyperparameter tuning and architectural choices, ensuring reproducibility. The robustness of the agent to hyperparameters is also thoroughly analyzed.
Additional Feedback and Suggestions
1. Clarity of Presentation: While the paper is generally well-written, certain sections, such as the mathematical formulations and auxiliary task descriptions, could benefit from additional clarity and simplification for a broader audience.
2. Comparison with Related Work: The paper briefly mentions related architectures like Horde and UVFA but could provide a more detailed comparison to highlight the unique advantages of UNREAL.
3. Limitations: The paper does not explicitly discuss the limitations of the approach, such as computational overhead introduced by auxiliary tasks or potential challenges in scaling to more complex environments.
4. Future Work: The authors could explore combining pixel control with feature control, as suggested in the experiments, and investigate the applicability of UNREAL to continuous action spaces or real-world robotic tasks.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the computational cost of training the UNREAL agent compare to the baseline A3C agent, particularly in terms of wall-clock time and resource usage?
2. Can the auxiliary tasks (e.g., pixel control) be dynamically adapted or prioritized based on the agent's learning progress or task requirements?
3. Have the authors considered applying the UNREAL framework to environments with continuous action spaces or multi-agent settings?
In conclusion, the paper makes a significant contribution to reinforcement learning by introducing a novel architecture that improves efficiency and performance through auxiliary tasks. The results are compelling, and the methodology is well-grounded and reproducible. Addressing the above feedback could further strengthen the paper.
