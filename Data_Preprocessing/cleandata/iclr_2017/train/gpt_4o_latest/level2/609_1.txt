Review
The paper proposes a novel generalization of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to graph-structured data, addressing the challenge of applying CNNs to non-grid data structures. The authors introduce a convolution framework that utilizes random walks to select relevant nodes, enabling weight sharing across features and parameter efficiency. The method is validated through experiments on the MNIST dataset and the Merck molecular activity dataset, demonstrating competitive or state-of-the-art performance.
Decision: Accept
The paper presents a well-motivated and innovative approach to generalizing CNNs for graph-structured data, which is a significant and timely contribution to the field. The proposed method is supported by theoretical foundations and empirical results, making it a strong candidate for acceptance.
Supporting Arguments
1. Novelty and Contribution: The paper introduces a new convolution operator for graphs based on random walks and the expected number of visits. This approach is unique compared to prior methods, such as spectral convolutions, as it preserves locality, enables weight sharing, and handles varying graph structures. The authors also demonstrate how their method can be applied to standard regression and classification problems, broadening its applicability.
2. Experimental Validation: The empirical results on the Merck molecular activity and MNIST datasets are compelling. The method outperforms state-of-the-art models on the Merck dataset and achieves competitive results on MNIST. The experiments are well-designed, with comparisons to fully connected networks, linear regression, and prior graph-based CNNs.
3. Practical Usefulness: The proposed method has clear practical implications, particularly in domains where data is inherently graph-structured, such as molecular biology, social networks, and recommendation systems. Its parameter efficiency and ability to handle varying graph structures make it a promising tool for real-world applications.
Additional Feedback
1. Clarity and Accessibility: While the paper is technically sound, certain sections, such as the mathematical formulation of the convolution operator, could benefit from additional explanations or visual aids to improve accessibility for a broader audience.
2. Graph Pooling: The authors acknowledge the lack of a pooling mechanism for graphs as a limitation. Addressing this in future work could further enhance the method's scalability and performance.
3. Hyperparameter Selection: The choice of hyperparameters, such as the power of \( Q(k) \), is described as data-dependent but not systematically explored. A more detailed discussion or sensitivity analysis would strengthen the paper.
4. Reproducibility: While the authors mention that the source code will be made available, providing a link to the code repository in the paper would ensure transparency and reproducibility.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the proposed method perform on larger, more complex graph datasets, such as social networks or citation graphs? Have scalability issues been observed?
2. Could the random walk-based convolution operator be extended to incorporate edge weights or directed edges explicitly?
3. How sensitive is the method to the choice of the similarity matrix? Would alternative graph construction methods, such as k-nearest neighbors, significantly impact performance?
4. Have the authors considered integrating their method with graph pooling techniques, such as hierarchical clustering or graph coarsening, to improve scalability?
Conclusion
This paper makes a significant contribution to the field by extending CNNs to graph-structured data, addressing a critical gap in the literature. The proposed method is innovative, well-supported by experiments, and practically useful. While there are areas for improvement, the work is of high quality and should be accepted for presentation at the conference.
