Review of the Paper: "Annealed Importance Sampling for Evaluating Log-Likelihoods of Decoder-Based Generative Models"
This paper introduces a novel approach to evaluating the log-likelihoods of decoder-based generative models, such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and Generative Moment Matching Networks (GMMNs), using Annealed Importance Sampling (AIS). The authors validate their method with Bidirectional Monte Carlo (BDMC) and demonstrate its superiority over existing methods like Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) and the Importance Weighted Autoencoder (IWAE) bound. The paper provides insights into model performance, overfitting, and mode coverage, offering a robust framework for understanding generative models.
Decision: Accept
The paper makes a significant contribution to the field of generative modeling by addressing a critical challenge: the accurate evaluation of log-likelihoods for decoder-based models. The key reasons for acceptance are:
1. Novelty and Impact: The use of AIS for log-likelihood estimation, validated with BDMC, represents a substantial improvement over existing methods. The paper not only highlights the limitations of KDE and IWAE but also demonstrates AIS's ability to provide fine-grained comparisons between models, which is crucial for advancing the field.
   
2. Scientific Rigor: The authors provide thorough experimental validation on MNIST, demonstrating the accuracy of AIS and its ability to uncover phenomena like mode dropping and overfitting that are not observable with other methods. The use of BDMC to bound estimation errors further strengthens the reliability of the results.
3. Practical Contribution: The evaluation code is made publicly available, ensuring reproducibility and encouraging adoption by the community.
Supporting Arguments
The authors convincingly show that AIS outperforms KDE and IWAE in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency. For example, AIS achieves accurate log-likelihood estimates with smaller gaps compared to BDMC, while KDE fails in high-dimensional settings. The paper also provides valuable insights into the behavior of generative models, such as the observation that GANs and GMMNs fail to capture certain modes of the data distribution, which is validated through posterior visualizations. Additionally, the analysis of overfitting reveals that VAEs tend to overfit more than GANs and GMMNs, a finding that could inform future model design.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Clarity of Presentation: While the methodology is rigorous, the paper could benefit from a more concise explanation of AIS and BDMC for readers unfamiliar with these techniques. A flowchart or diagram summarizing the AIS process would be helpful.
2. Broader Dataset Evaluation: The experiments are limited to MNIST. Extending the evaluation to more complex datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10 or CelebA) would strengthen the generalizability of the findings.
3. Discussion of Limitations: Although the authors briefly mention the Gaussian observation model's limitations, a more detailed discussion of how this assumption impacts the results across different models would be valuable.
4. Comparison with Other Metrics: While the paper critiques visual inspection and inception scores, it would be useful to include a direct comparison with these metrics to highlight AIS's advantages more explicitly.
Questions for the Authors
1. How sensitive is the AIS performance to the choice of intermediate distributions and the number of chains? Could this impact its applicability to more complex datasets?
2. The paper focuses on decoder-based models. Could the AIS framework be extended to other types of generative models, such as autoregressive models or diffusion models?
3. How does the computational cost of AIS scale with model complexity and dataset size compared to KDE and IWAE?
Conclusion
This paper addresses a critical gap in the evaluation of generative models and provides a robust, validated method for log-likelihood estimation. Its contributions are both theoretical and practical, with the potential to significantly impact the field. While there are areas for improvement, the strengths of the paper far outweigh its limitations, warranting acceptance.
