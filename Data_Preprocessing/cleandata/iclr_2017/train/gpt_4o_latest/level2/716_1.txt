The paper presents ENet, a novel deep neural network architecture designed for real-time semantic segmentation on resource-constrained devices. The authors claim that ENet achieves up to 18× faster inference, requires 75× fewer floating-point operations, and has 79× fewer parameters compared to existing state-of-the-art models, while maintaining comparable or better accuracy. The architecture is benchmarked on datasets such as Cityscapes, CamVid, and SUN RGB-D, and its performance on embedded systems like the NVIDIA Jetson TX1 is highlighted. The paper also discusses design choices, such as early downsampling, asymmetric convolutions, and dilated convolutions, which contribute to ENet's efficiency.
Decision: Accept
Key reasons for acceptance:
1. Significant Practical Contribution: The paper addresses a critical problem in mobile and embedded applications—real-time semantic segmentation with limited computational resources. The proposed ENet demonstrates substantial improvements in speed and efficiency while maintaining competitive accuracy, making it highly relevant for practical use.
2. Thorough Evaluation: The authors provide extensive experimental results, comparing ENet with state-of-the-art methods across multiple datasets and hardware platforms. The results are convincing and demonstrate the claimed advantages.
Supporting Arguments:
- Motivation and Novelty: The paper is well-motivated, focusing on a gap in the field where existing models are too resource-intensive for real-time applications. The design choices, such as the asymmetric encoder-decoder structure and factorized convolutions, are innovative and well-justified.
- Experimental Rigor: The authors evaluate ENet on three diverse datasets and provide detailed benchmarks on both high-end GPUs and embedded systems. The results consistently support the claims of efficiency and accuracy.
- Relevance and Usefulness: The proposed architecture is highly relevant for applications like autonomous driving and augmented reality, where real-time performance on low-power devices is essential.
Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Limitations and Trade-offs: While the paper acknowledges some limitations, such as the software inefficiencies caused by kernel calls, a more detailed discussion of accuracy trade-offs (e.g., performance on smaller object classes) would strengthen the work.
2. Reproducibility: Although the paper provides sufficient architectural details, releasing the code and pretrained models would enhance reproducibility and encourage adoption.
3. Comparison with Lightweight Models: The paper could benefit from a comparison with other lightweight segmentation models designed for real-time applications, if available.
Questions for Authors:
1. How does ENet perform on datasets with more diverse or complex scenes beyond the three tested datasets? Would the architecture generalize well to such scenarios?
2. Could you elaborate on the specific challenges faced during training, particularly with smaller datasets, and how these were mitigated?
3. Are there plans to address the software inefficiencies mentioned (e.g., kernel fusion) in future work?
Overall, ENet is a well-executed contribution to the field of efficient semantic segmentation, with strong potential for real-world applications. Addressing the suggestions above would further enhance its impact.
