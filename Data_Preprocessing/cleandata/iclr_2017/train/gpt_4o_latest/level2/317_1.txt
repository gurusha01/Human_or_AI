The paper introduces novel methods for image super-resolution (SR) using amortized Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) inference, addressing the limitations of traditional pixel-wise mean squared error (MSE) loss functions that often produce blurry and implausible outputs. The authors propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that ensures consistency between high-resolution (HR) outputs and low-resolution (LR) inputs by projecting outputs onto the affine subspace of valid SR solutions. They present three approaches for optimizing the MAP objective: (1) Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), (2) denoiser-guided SR, and (3) density-guided SR using maximum likelihood-trained image priors. Experimental results demonstrate that the GAN-based approach (AffGAN) achieves the best perceptual quality, and the paper establishes a theoretical connection between GANs and variational inference.
Decision: Accept
Key Reasons for Decision:
1. Novelty and Contribution: The paper makes a significant contribution by introducing an affine projection layer that ensures consistency between HR and LR images, a feature absent in prior SR methods. The theoretical grounding for using GANs in SR and the connection to variational inference further enhance the paper's novelty.
2. Experimental Validation: The experiments are comprehensive, covering synthetic data (Swiss-roll), textures, faces (CelebA), and natural images (ImageNet). The results convincingly show that AffGAN produces sharper and more plausible images compared to baseline methods.
Supporting Arguments:
- The paper is well-motivated, addressing the critical issue of perceptual quality in SR. It highlights the limitations of MSE-based methods and proposes a theoretically sound alternative.
- The affine projection layer is a notable innovation, ensuring that SR outputs are consistent with LR inputs. This architectural constraint is validated through experiments showing faster convergence and better performance.
- The GAN-based approach (AffGAN) is shown to outperform other methods in terms of perceptual quality, and the use of instance noise to stabilize GAN training is a practical and effective addition.
- The connection between GANs and variational inference is a valuable theoretical insight that could inspire future research.
Additional Feedback:
1. Limitations and Future Work: While the authors acknowledge potential issues with MAP inference, such as dependence on representation and atypicality of the mode, these points could be explored further. For instance, how does the method perform under alternative representations or color spaces?
2. Denoiser and Density-Guided Methods: The paper briefly mentions that these approaches produce blurry results and were not pursued further. A more detailed analysis of why these methods underperform would strengthen the discussion.
3. Visual Artifacts in GAN Outputs: The high-frequency noise observed in AffGAN outputs could be addressed in future work. Exploring alternative regularization techniques or post-processing methods might mitigate these artifacts.
4. Reproducibility: While the experimental details are thorough, providing open-source code or pre-trained models would enhance reproducibility and encourage adoption by the community.
Questions for Authors:
1. How sensitive is the performance of AffGAN to the choice of the noise distribution and its annealing schedule during training?
2. Could the proposed affine projection layer be applied to other inverse problems beyond SR? If so, what modifications would be required?
3. Have you considered evaluating the perceptual quality of SR outputs using user studies or more advanced metrics like LPIPS (Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity)?
Overall, the paper presents a well-motivated, theoretically grounded, and experimentally validated approach to improving SR. The contributions are significant, and the work is likely to have a meaningful impact on the field.
