The paper proposes a novel framework for reference-aware language models that explicitly treat reference decisions as stochastic latent variables. This approach enables the generation of referring expressions (REs) by accessing external databases or internal discourse contexts, addressing tasks like task-oriented dialogue, recipe generation, and coreference-aware language modeling. The authors demonstrate the efficacy of their models through experiments on three datasets, outperforming baseline models that rely on deterministic attention mechanisms.
Decision: Accept
The paper makes a significant contribution to the field of natural language processing by introducing a generalizable framework for reference-aware language models. The novelty of explicitly modeling reference decisions and the strong empirical results on diverse tasks justify its acceptance.
Supporting Arguments:
1. Novelty and Contribution: The paper introduces a new paradigm for handling references in language models, which is a clear improvement over existing deterministic attention-based methods. The explicit modeling of reference decisions as latent variables is innovative and applicable to multiple domains.
2. Empirical Validation: The experiments on three distinct tasks—dialogue modeling, recipe generation, and coreference-aware language modeling—demonstrate the robustness and generalizability of the proposed approach. The models consistently outperform strong baselines, particularly in handling rare or unseen tokens.
3. Practical Utility: The proposed framework has practical implications for real-world applications like task-oriented dialogue systems and content generation tasks, making it highly relevant to the NLP community.
Additional Feedback:
1. Clarity and Accessibility: While the paper is comprehensive, the technical details, particularly in the model descriptions, can be overwhelming. Simplifying the presentation or including more intuitive diagrams may help readers better understand the methodology.
2. Evaluation Metrics: The paper primarily uses perplexity and BLEU scores for evaluation. While these are standard metrics, incorporating human evaluations for dialogue tasks would strengthen the results and provide a more holistic assessment of the model's performance.
3. Ablation Studies: Although the paper compares different model variants, more detailed ablation studies could help isolate the impact of specific components, such as the table pointer mechanism or the latent variable formulation.
4. Limitations: The paper does not explicitly discuss the limitations of the proposed approach. For example, the reliance on annotated datasets for coreference or database construction may limit scalability. Acknowledging these challenges would provide a more balanced perspective.
Questions for the Authors:
1. How does the model handle cases where the database or discourse context is incomplete or noisy? Are there mechanisms to mitigate errors in such scenarios?
2. Could the proposed framework be extended to handle multimodal data, such as images or videos, in addition to text?
3. Have you considered using reinforcement learning to optimize the reference decisions, as suggested in the conclusion? If so, what challenges do you anticipate?
In conclusion, the paper presents a novel and impactful approach to reference-aware language modeling, supported by strong empirical results. While there is room for improvement in presentation and evaluation, the work is a valuable contribution to the field and merits acceptance.
