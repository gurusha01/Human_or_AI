The paper proposes a novel Context-aware Attention Network (CAN) for Interactive Question Answering (IQA), which leverages a two-level attention mechanism (word-level and sentence-level) and an interactive mechanism to address limitations in traditional QA models. The key contributions include: (i) a self-adaptive encoder-decoder model with context-dependent attention, (ii) an interactive mechanism for generating supplementary questions and incorporating user feedback without additional training, and (iii) the introduction of a new dataset (ibAbI) for evaluating IQA tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate CAN's superiority over state-of-the-art QA models, achieving significant improvements in both traditional QA and IQA tasks.
Decision: Accept
Key Reasons for Acceptance:
1. Novelty and Innovation: The paper introduces a unique approach to IQA by combining context-aware attention mechanisms with an interactive component, addressing a critical gap in existing QA models. This is a significant step toward building more adaptive and intelligent conversational systems.
2. Empirical Rigor: The experimental results are robust, showing substantial improvements over baseline models (e.g., DMN+, MemN2N) on both traditional QA (bAbI) and IQA (ibAbI) datasets. The interactive mechanism is particularly effective in handling ambiguous or incomplete queries.
Supporting Arguments:
- The proposed two-level attention mechanism is well-motivated and effectively models the semantic logic of input sentences, as evidenced by the quantitative and qualitative results.
- The interactive mechanism is a novel addition, enabling the model to handle incomplete information by generating supplementary questions and refining attention weights using user feedback. This feature is critical for real-world applications.
- The introduction of the ibAbI dataset fills a gap in the evaluation of IQA models, providing a benchmark for future research.
- The paper demonstrates a strong understanding of the field, with comprehensive references to prior work and clear positioning of the proposed approach within the literature.
Additional Feedback for Improvement:
1. Clarity of Presentation: While the technical details are thorough, the paper could benefit from a clearer explanation of the training procedure and the role of hyperparameters. Simplifying some equations and providing more intuitive descriptions would improve accessibility.
2. Evaluation Metrics: The paper uses error rates and BLEU/METEOR scores but could include additional metrics (e.g., user satisfaction or response latency) to better evaluate the practical utility of the interactive mechanism.
3. Limitations and Future Work: The paper briefly mentions limitations (e.g., poor performance on simple tasks like bAbI task 16) but does not explore them in depth. A more detailed discussion of failure cases and potential solutions would strengthen the paper.
4. Scalability: While the model performs well on small datasets like bAbI and ibAbI, its scalability to larger, real-world datasets remains unclear. Future work should explore this aspect.
Questions for Authors:
1. How does the model handle noisy or contradictory user feedback during the interactive process? Have you tested robustness in such scenarios?
2. Can the proposed approach generalize to multi-turn conversations or more complex dialog systems? If so, what modifications would be required?
3. How does the computational cost of CAN compare to baseline models, particularly for large-scale datasets?
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of IQA and is well-suited for acceptance at the conference. With minor improvements in presentation and additional evaluations, this work has the potential to inspire further advancements in interactive and adaptive QA systems.
