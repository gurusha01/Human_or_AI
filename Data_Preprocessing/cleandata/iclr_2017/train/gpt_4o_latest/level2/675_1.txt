Review of "Incremental Sequence Learning for Sequence Prediction and Classification"
Summary of Contributions
This paper introduces Incremental Sequence Learning (ISL), a novel approach to sequence learning that incrementally increases the length of training sequences as the model achieves predefined performance thresholds. The authors evaluate ISL using a new dataset derived from MNIST, where handwritten digits are represented as sequences of pen strokes. The key findings demonstrate that ISL achieves significant improvements in training efficiency, generalization, and robustness compared to regular sequence learning and two other curriculum learning methods. Specifically, ISL reduces test error by 74%, achieves the best test performance 20 times faster, and continues improving after other methods plateau. The paper also explores transfer learning, showing that models trained with ISL for sequence prediction can effectively transfer to sequence classification tasks, outperforming models trained from scratch.
Decision: Accept
The paper makes a clear and significant contribution to sequence learning by proposing a simple yet effective method that demonstrates substantial improvements in performance and efficiency. The empirical results are robust and well-supported by experiments, and the method is likely to be of practical use in a wide range of sequence learning applications.
Supporting Arguments
1. Novelty and Significance: The proposed ISL method is a straightforward yet innovative application of curriculum learning tailored to sequence learning. The idea of gradually increasing sequence length leverages the inherent structure of sequence data and addresses the challenge of learning long-term dependencies effectively. This approach is novel and has not been sufficiently explored in prior work.
   
2. Experimental Rigor: The experiments are comprehensive and well-designed. The authors compare ISL against three baselines, including regular sequence learning and two curriculum learning variants, and provide detailed analyses of the results. The use of both RNNs and FFNNs to test hypotheses about the observed improvements adds scientific rigor.
3. Practical Utility: ISL is computationally efficient, easy to implement, and applicable to a wide range of sequence learning tasks. The availability of the code and dataset further enhances the paper's reproducibility and practical value.
4. Transfer Learning: The demonstration of transfer learning from sequence prediction to sequence classification highlights the versatility of the learned representations and adds further value to the proposed approach.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Theoretical Insights: While the empirical results are strong, the paper could benefit from a deeper theoretical analysis of why ISL works so well. For example, formalizing how ISL aids in building internal representations in RNNs could strengthen the paper's contributions.
2. Comparison with Other Sequence Learning Techniques: The paper could include comparisons with other state-of-the-art sequence learning methods, such as Transformer-based models, to provide a broader context for the significance of ISL.
3. Dataset Limitations: The authors acknowledge that the transformation of MNIST into pen stroke sequences discards some information. It would be helpful to discuss how this limitation might affect the generalizability of the results to other sequence learning tasks.
4. Ablation Studies: While the paper explores the role of batch size and internal representations, additional ablation studies (e.g., varying the threshold for increasing sequence length) could provide more insights into the sensitivity of ISL to its hyperparameters.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does ISL perform on more complex sequence learning tasks, such as natural language processing or time-series forecasting? Have you considered testing ISL on datasets beyond MNIST pen stroke sequences?
2. Could ISL be combined with other curriculum learning strategies (e.g., increasing dataset size or class complexity) to achieve even better results?
3. How does ISL compare to modern sequence learning architectures like Transformers, which are known for their ability to handle long-range dependencies?
Conclusion
The paper presents a well-motivated, novel, and empirically validated approach to sequence learning that achieves significant improvements in efficiency and generalization. The results are compelling, and the method is likely to have a broad impact on the field. With minor improvements in theoretical analysis and broader comparisons, this work could become a foundational contribution to curriculum learning in sequence modeling.
