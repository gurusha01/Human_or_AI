Review of "A2T: Attend, Adapt, and Transfer - An Attentive Deep Architecture for Adaptive Transfer Learning"
This paper introduces A2T (Attend, Adapt, and Transfer), a novel deep learning framework for transfer learning in reinforcement learning (RL). The key contributions of the paper are the ability to avoid negative transfer (when knowledge transfer worsens performance) and to perform selective transfer (choosing relevant knowledge from multiple source tasks for specific parts of the target task's state space). The proposed architecture uses an attention mechanism to dynamically weigh the contributions of source task solutions and a base network that learns from scratch. The framework is demonstrated to work for both policy transfer and value transfer, and its generality is highlighted through experiments on synthetic environments (e.g., chain world, puddle world) and real-world benchmarks (e.g., Atari 2600 games).
Decision: Accept
The paper makes a strong case for acceptance due to its novel contributions, thorough empirical evaluation, and practical relevance. The key reasons for this decision are:
1. Novelty and Significance: The A2T framework addresses two critical challenges in transfer learning—negative transfer and selective transfer—using a unified attention-based approach. This is a significant improvement over prior approaches, which either fail to avoid negative transfer or lack the granularity to perform selective transfer at the state level.
2. Empirical Validation: The experiments convincingly demonstrate the effectiveness of A2T in avoiding negative transfer and leveraging favorable source tasks. The results are consistent across diverse settings, including synthetic environments and complex RL tasks like Atari games.
3. Practical Utility: The framework is general and can be applied to various RL settings, including policy transfer, value transfer, and hierarchical RL. Its potential applications, such as household robotics and meta-learning, make it highly relevant to the field.
Supporting Arguments
- Claims and Support: The paper's claims are well-supported by experiments. For instance, the ability to avoid negative transfer is demonstrated using unfavorable source tasks (e.g., Inverse-Pong), while selective transfer is validated through tasks like chain world and Pong with blurred regions. The attention mechanism's effectiveness is further visualized, showing its ability to adapt dynamically to different state-space regions.
- Positioning in Literature: The paper provides a comprehensive review of related work and clearly positions A2T as an improvement over existing methods like policy reuse, multi-task networks, and progressive neural networks. The comparisons with these baselines are fair and highlight A2T's advantages.
- Clarity and Completeness: The architecture is described in detail, including equations, training algorithms, and implementation specifics. This ensures reproducibility and demonstrates the paper's rigor.
Suggestions for Improvement
While the paper is strong overall, a few areas could be improved:
1. Scalability to Different Domains: The paper focuses on tasks with shared state and action spaces. Future work could explore how A2T can handle tasks with different state-action spaces or domains, as briefly mentioned in the conclusion.
2. Ablation Studies: While the experiments are thorough, additional ablation studies isolating the contributions of the attention mechanism and the base network would provide deeper insights into the architecture's components.
3. Comparison with More Baselines: The paper could include comparisons with recent meta-learning or hierarchical RL approaches to further strengthen its empirical claims.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does A2T scale to tasks with significantly larger state-action spaces or continuous control tasks? Are there any computational bottlenecks in training the attention network?
2. The experiments focus on tasks with shared state and action spaces. Can A2T be extended to handle tasks with different state-action spaces (e.g., transferring between different games)?
3. How sensitive is the performance of A2T to the choice of hyperparameters, such as learning rates or the architecture of the attention network?
Conclusion
The A2T framework is a significant contribution to transfer learning in RL, addressing critical challenges with a novel and generalizable approach. The paper is well-written, with strong theoretical grounding and comprehensive experimental validation. While there are opportunities for further exploration, the current work is impactful and deserving of acceptance.
