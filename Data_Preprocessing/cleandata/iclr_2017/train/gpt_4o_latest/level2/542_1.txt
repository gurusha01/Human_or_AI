The paper presents a novel framework for multitask deep reinforcement learning (RL) guided by policy sketches, which annotate tasks with sequences of named subtasks. The authors propose a modular approach where each subtask is associated with a reusable subpolicy, enabling parameter sharing across tasks. The framework employs a decoupled actor-critic training objective to optimize task-specific policies while learning shared behaviors. The approach is evaluated on two environments: a maze navigation game and a 2D crafting game, both featuring sparse rewards and hierarchical task structures. The results demonstrate superior performance compared to standard baselines, faster convergence, and the ability to generalize to unseen tasks through zero-shot and adaptation learning.
Decision: Accept
Key Reasons for Decision:
1. Novelty and Contribution: The paper introduces a modular RL framework that leverages symbolic policy sketches to induce reusable subpolicies. This approach is a significant improvement over existing methods, as it requires minimal supervision and avoids strong assumptions about reward functions or state representations.
2. Empirical Validation: The experiments are comprehensive, demonstrating the framework's effectiveness in multitask learning, generalization to unseen tasks, and adaptation without sketches. The results convincingly outperform baselines in terms of reward and convergence speed.
Supporting Arguments:
1. Claims and Support: The paper claims that policy sketches enable efficient multitask learning and induce reusable subpolicies. These claims are well-supported by experiments showing higher rewards and faster convergence compared to independent and joint policy baselines. The ablation studies further validate the importance of the decoupled critic and curriculum learning components.
2. Usefulness: The proposed framework is practically useful for RL tasks with sparse rewards and hierarchical structures. The ability to generalize to new tasks and adapt without sketches makes it appealing for real-world applications.
3. Field Knowledge and Related Work: The paper demonstrates a solid understanding of the field, situating its contributions within the broader literature on hierarchical RL, policy abstraction, and multitask learning. The references are relevant and comprehensive, and the distinctions from related work are clearly articulated.
4. Completeness: The methodology is described in sufficient detail, including the modular policy structure, training algorithm, and curriculum learning scheme. The experiments are thorough, covering multiple evaluation scenarios and ablations.
Additional Feedback:
1. Clarity: While the paper is generally well-written, some sections, such as the policy optimization and curriculum learning algorithms, could benefit from additional clarification or visual aids to improve accessibility for readers unfamiliar with the technical details.
2. Limitations: The paper could explicitly discuss potential limitations, such as scalability to more complex environments or the reliance on predefined sketches. Addressing these would strengthen the work.
3. Future Work: The authors mention coupling the framework with generic option learners as future work. Expanding on this idea and discussing other potential extensions, such as applying the framework to continuous action spaces, would be valuable.
Questions for Authors:
1. How does the framework scale to environments with significantly larger state and action spaces? Are there any computational bottlenecks in the current implementation?
2. Could the framework handle tasks where the sketches are noisy or partially incorrect? If so, how robust is it to such imperfections?
3. Have you considered applying this approach to real-world domains, such as robotics or autonomous navigation? If so, what challenges do you anticipate?
In summary, the paper makes a strong contribution to multitask RL by introducing a modular framework guided by policy sketches. The proposed approach is well-motivated, rigorously evaluated, and demonstrates significant potential for advancing the field. With minor improvements in clarity and discussion of limitations, this work is a valuable addition to the conference.
