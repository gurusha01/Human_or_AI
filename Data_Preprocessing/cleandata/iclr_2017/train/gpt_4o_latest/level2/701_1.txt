The paper presents a novel neuro-modular approach to transfer learning, aimed at improving neural network performance on small datasets. The authors propose combining pre-trained modules with untrained modules to retain the representational power of the original network while learning new task-specific features. This modular architecture is shown to outperform traditional fine-tuning methods, particularly in low-data regimes, across a variety of tasks, including image classification (CIFAR-100, Stanford Cars), text classification (IMDB sentiment), and MNIST experiments. The approach is well-motivated, leveraging the strengths of pre-trained networks while addressing their limitations, such as catastrophic forgetting.
Decision: Accept
The key reasons for this decision are:  
1. Novelty and Contribution: The modular approach introduces a significant innovation over traditional fine-tuning by preserving the pre-trained network's features while learning complementary task-specific representations. This is a meaningful contribution to the field of transfer learning, particularly for small data scenarios.  
2. Empirical Support: The claims are well-supported by experiments on diverse datasets, demonstrating consistent improvements over baseline methods. The results are statistically significant and scientifically rigorous.
Supporting Arguments:  
The paper is well-placed in the literature, building on foundational work in transfer learning and modular architectures. The authors provide a thorough comparison with existing methods, including fine-tuning and progressive networks, and demonstrate clear advantages in terms of accuracy and adaptability. The experiments are comprehensive, covering both vision and text domains, and the modular approach is shown to generalize well across tasks. Additionally, the visualization of learned filters and the detailed analysis of modular contributions provide valuable insights into the method's effectiveness.  
Additional Feedback:  
1. Clarity: While the paper is generally well-written, some sections, such as the mathematical formulation of the modular approach, could benefit from more detailed explanations for accessibility to a broader audience.  
2. Efficiency: The modular approach increases the number of parameters, as noted in the Stanford Cars experiment. Future work could explore more compact module designs to reduce computational overhead.  
3. Hyperparameter Optimization: The authors acknowledge the lack of hyperparameter tuning in some experiments. Including this could further strengthen the results.  
4. Limitations: While the paper demonstrates strong performance on small datasets, it would be helpful to discuss potential limitations, such as scalability to extremely large datasets or domains with highly dissimilar distributions.
Questions for the Authors:  
1. How does the modular approach perform when the pre-trained network and the target domain are highly dissimilar?  
2. Could the proposed architecture be extended to unsupervised or semi-supervised learning tasks?  
3. Have you explored the impact of different module sizes or architectures on performance?  
Overall, the paper makes a strong contribution to the field of transfer learning and provides a promising direction for future research. With minor improvements in clarity and efficiency, it has the potential to make a significant impact.
