The paper presents a novel neural network-based approach to argumentation mining, specifically focusing on extracting links between argument components (ACs) and classifying their types. The authors propose a modified Pointer Network (PN) architecture, which enforces tree-structured relationships between ACs and jointly optimizes for both link prediction and AC classification. The model achieves state-of-the-art results on two datasets: a persuasive essay corpus and a microtext corpus. The authors also demonstrate the importance of joint modeling and the inclusion of a fully connected layer before the LSTM input for high performance.
Decision: Accept
Key reasons for acceptance include the novelty of the approach, the strong empirical results, and the clear motivation for using Pointer Networks in this domain. The paper addresses a well-defined problem and provides rigorous experimental validation, demonstrating significant improvements over prior methods.
Supporting Arguments:
1. Novelty and Motivation: The use of a Pointer Network for argumentation mining is innovative and well-motivated. The authors convincingly argue that the sequential nature of ACs and the tree structure of argumentation make PNs a natural fit for this task. The joint modeling of link prediction and AC classification is another novel contribution that enhances performance.
   
2. Empirical Results: The model achieves state-of-the-art results on 10 out of 13 metrics across two datasets, including the challenging microtext corpus with limited training data. The ablation study further highlights the importance of specific design choices, such as the fully connected layer and joint optimization.
3. Scientific Rigor: The paper provides a thorough comparison with baseline models, including feature-rich classifiers and structured optimization methods. The experimental setup is robust, with appropriate hyperparameter tuning, dropout regularization, and cross-validation.
Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Reproducibility: While the paper provides many implementation details, it would benefit from a more explicit description of the hyperparameter search process and the specific training/validation split for the microtext corpus. Sharing code and pretrained models would further enhance reproducibility.
   
2. Limitations: The paper does not explicitly discuss the limitations of the proposed approach. For example, the reliance on pre-identified ACs (subtask 1) and the assumption of tree-structured argumentation may restrict the model's applicability to other datasets or domains with more complex structures.
3. Future Work: The authors mention integrating subtasks 1 and 4 into the model but do not elaborate on how this could be achieved. A more detailed roadmap for extending the work would be valuable.
Questions for the Authors:
1. How does the model handle cases where the argument structure deviates from a strict tree structure, such as graphs with cycles or disconnected components?
2. Could the proposed approach be adapted to handle multilingual datasets or argumentation in less structured text, such as social media posts?
3. How sensitive is the model to the quality of AC segmentation (subtask 1)? Would errors in this preprocessing step significantly degrade performance?
In conclusion, the paper makes a strong contribution to the field of argumentation mining, and its innovative use of Pointer Networks is both well-justified and empirically validated. With minor clarifications and extensions, this work has the potential to inspire further research in this area.
