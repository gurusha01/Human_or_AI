The paper introduces a novel framework for semi-supervised learning in Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) that incorporates domain knowledge through structured probabilistic encoders. The authors propose a stochastic computation graph approach, allowing flexible specification of dependency structures with both continuous and discrete latent variables. The framework enables disentangled representation learning by leveraging minimal supervision and structural constraints, which is demonstrated across various datasets, including MNIST, SVHN, Yale B faces, and a custom Multi-MNIST dataset. The paper claims to improve interpretability and disentanglement of learned representations while maintaining competitive performance in classification and regression tasks.
Decision: Accept
The primary reasons for this decision are the novelty of the proposed framework and its demonstrated effectiveness in disentangling latent representations with minimal supervision. The paper addresses a significant gap in semi-supervised learning by enabling the incorporation of domain-specific knowledge into VAEs, which is a meaningful contribution to the field. The experimental results are compelling, showing both qualitative and quantitative improvements in disentanglement and classification accuracy. Furthermore, the framework's flexibility and generality make it a valuable tool for a wide range of applications.
Supporting Arguments:
1. Novelty and Motivation: The paper presents a unique approach by embedding structured graphical models into the encoder of VAEs, which contrasts with prior work that focuses on the generative model. This innovation allows for more interpretable and disentangled representations, addressing a key challenge in unsupervised and semi-supervised learning.
2. Experimental Validation: The experiments are well-designed and demonstrate the framework's ability to disentangle latent variables effectively. For example, the MNIST and SVHN results highlight the model's capacity to separate style and class with minimal supervision, while the Yale B dataset showcases its ability to handle complex dependencies.
3. Practical Usefulness: The framework is implemented as a Torch library, making it accessible for researchers and practitioners. Its ability to handle both discrete and continuous latent variables expands its applicability to diverse domains.
Additional Feedback:
1. Clarity and Accessibility: While the paper is technically sound, some sections, particularly the mathematical formulations, could benefit from clearer explanations and more intuitive examples. For instance, the discussion on supervision rate (r) and its impact on learning could be expanded with visual aids or diagrams.
2. Comparison with Baselines: Although the paper compares its results with prior work, a more extensive analysis of the trade-offs between interpretability and performance would strengthen the evaluation. For example, how does the framework perform when the supervision rate is extremely low or high?
3. Limitations and Future Work: The authors briefly mention limitations, such as the potential for overfitting with high supervision rates. A more detailed discussion of the framework's scalability and computational overhead would be valuable. Additionally, exploring the integration of graphical models in both the encoder and generative model, as suggested, is a promising direction for future work.
Questions for the Authors:
1. How does the framework handle cases where the domain knowledge or structural constraints are incorrect or incomplete? Does this negatively impact disentanglement or reconstruction quality?
2. Can the proposed approach be extended to other generative models beyond VAEs, such as GANs or normalizing flows? If so, what challenges might arise?
3. How sensitive is the framework to the choice of supervision rate (r) across different datasets? Are there guidelines for selecting an optimal rate?
Overall, the paper makes a strong contribution to semi-supervised learning and disentangled representation learning, and I recommend its acceptance with minor revisions to improve clarity and address the above questions.
