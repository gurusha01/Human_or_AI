Review
Summary of the Paper
The paper proposes a novel implementation of a differentiable 3D rigid body physics engine that allows for gradient-based optimization of robotic controllers. Unlike traditional derivative-free methods such as evolutionary algorithms or reinforcement learning, this approach leverages analytical gradients computed via automatic differentiation libraries like Theano. The engine is implemented for both CPU and GPU, enabling efficient optimization of control parameters even for complex systems with millions of parameters. The authors demonstrate the utility of their approach through several experiments, including optimizing a robotic arm, a quadrupedal robot, and a pendulum-cart system with vision-based control. The results show significant improvements in optimization speed and scalability compared to state-of-the-art derivative-free methods. The paper also discusses potential applications, such as hardware optimization, adversarial robotics training, and transferring knowledge between models and neural networks.
Decision: Accept
The paper should be accepted because it presents a novel and practically useful contribution to robotics and machine learning.

Supporting Arguments
1. Novelty and Contribution: The implementation of a differentiable physics engine for 3D rigid body models is a significant innovation. While similar approaches have been explored for simpler systems, this paper extends the concept to modern robotics simulation tools, which is a meaningful advancement for the field.
2. Experimental Validation: The experiments are thorough and demonstrate the practical utility of the proposed method. For example, the optimization of a robotic arm and a quadrupedal robot shows clear advantages in terms of speed and scalability compared to derivative-free methods like CMA-ES.
3. Practical Usefulness: The approach is directly applicable to real-world robotics problems, such as optimizing controllers and hardware parameters. The ability to differentiate through complex sensors like cameras further enhances its applicability.
4. Clarity and Rigor: The paper is well-written, with detailed explanations of the methodology, experiments, and results. The use of automatic differentiation libraries ensures scientific rigor in the computation of gradients.
Additional Feedback
1. Limitations: While the paper acknowledges some limitations, such as the restricted set of operations in Theano and the simplified collision detection model, these could be discussed in more depth. For example, how might these limitations affect the transferability of the approach to more complex real-world systems?
2. Comparison with Deep Q-Learning: The paper positions the proposed method as an alternative to deep Q-learning but does not provide direct experimental comparisons. Including such a comparison would strengthen the argument.
3. Reproducibility: The paper provides sufficient detail for reproducing the results, but sharing the code and models would further enhance reproducibility and encourage adoption by the community.
4. Energy Efficiency: The experiments focus primarily on optimization speed and accuracy. Including metrics like energy efficiency, especially for robotic applications, would provide a more holistic evaluation.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the performance of the proposed engine compare to state-of-the-art reinforcement learning methods like PPO or SAC in terms of both speed and quality of the learned policies?
2. Can the approach handle more complex collision geometries and constraints, or are there fundamental limitations due to the reliance on Theano?
3. How transferable are the optimized controllers to real-world robots, given the potential discrepancies between simulated and physical systems?
