Review of the Paper
Summary of Contributions
This paper addresses the problem of feature representation learning for graph-structured data using an unsupervised approach. The authors propose a novel method, termed "Skip-Graph," which adapts the skip-thought encoder-decoder model from natural language processing to graph data. By training the model on random walk sequences from graphs, the method generates feature representations that group structurally and functionally similar subgraphs together in feature space. The learned graph embeddings are evaluated on binary classification tasks using real-world chemical compound datasets, where the proposed method achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques. The paper highlights the general-purpose nature of the approach, its task-agnostic applicability, and its ability to outperform supervised methods in certain scenarios.
Decision: Accept
The decision to accept this paper is based on two key reasons: (1) the novelty of the proposed unsupervised graph representation learning method, which extends the encoder-decoder framework to graph-structured data, and (2) the strong empirical results that demonstrate the method's effectiveness on real-world datasets. The paper provides a well-motivated and scientifically rigorous approach, with sufficient experimental validation and comparisons to relevant baselines.
Supporting Arguments
1. Novelty and Motivation: The paper presents a novel adaptation of the skip-thought model to graph data, which is a significant contribution to the field of graph representation learning. The authors convincingly argue for the need for unsupervised, task-agnostic methods, addressing a gap in the literature dominated by supervised and task-specific approaches.
2. Experimental Validation: The method is evaluated on multiple datasets, and the results show that Skip-Graph achieves state-of-the-art performance on three out of four datasets. The authors also conduct a thorough parameter study and visualization of the learned embeddings, providing insights into the model's behavior and robustness.
3. Relevance and Practicality: The proposed method is general-purpose and can be applied to a variety of graph-based tasks, making it a valuable contribution to the community. The use of random walks and aggregation strategies ensures scalability and flexibility.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Clarity of Presentation: While the technical details are thorough, some sections (e.g., the mathematical formulation of the encoder-decoder model) are dense and could benefit from additional explanations or visual aids to improve accessibility for a broader audience.
2. Comparison to More Methods: Although the paper compares Skip-Graph to several baselines, it would be beneficial to include comparisons with more recent graph neural network (GNN) architectures, such as GraphSAGE or GIN, to contextualize the performance further.
3. Limitations and Future Work: The paper briefly mentions future directions but does not fully explore the limitations of the current approach. For example, the reliance on random walks may introduce biases depending on graph structure, which could be explicitly discussed.
Questions for the Authors
1. How sensitive is the proposed method to the choice of random walk parameters (e.g., walk length, number of walks)? Could this impact generalizability across datasets with different graph structures?
2. Have you considered testing the method on larger, more complex graph datasets (e.g., social networks or citation graphs)? If not, what are the computational limitations?
3. How does the method handle graphs with highly imbalanced class distributions, as seen in the original datasets before balancing?
Conclusion
This paper presents a novel and well-motivated approach to unsupervised graph representation learning, with strong empirical results and potential for broad applicability. While there are areas for improvement, the contributions are significant, and the work is likely to inspire further research in this domain. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the suggestions above.
