The paper introduces the Shift Aggregate Extract Network (SAEN), a novel neural network architecture designed for learning representations on social network graphs. The key contributions include the development of SAEN, which uses H-hierarchical decompositions to address challenges in graph classification, and a domain compression algorithm that exploits symmetries in hierarchical decompositions to reduce memory usage and computational time. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through experiments on six real-world social network datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results on four datasets and competitive performance on the others. Additionally, the domain compression algorithm significantly improves runtime efficiency, enabling the processing of large datasets that would otherwise be infeasible.

- The hierarchical decomposition approach is well-motivated and grounded in the literature, addressing challenges specific to social network graphs, such as irregular structures and varying node degrees.
- The domain compression algorithm is a valuable contribution, as it enables the method to scale to large datasets while maintaining accuracy. The reported speedups and memory savings are substantial.
- The experiments are comprehensive, covering multiple datasets and comparing against established baselines. The use of 10-times 10-fold cross-validation ensures robustness in the reported results.
Additional Feedback:
1. Clarity and Accessibility: While the technical depth of the paper is commendable, certain sections, such as the mathematical formulation of the domain compression algorithm, could benefit from more intuitive explanations or visual aids to improve accessibility for a broader audience.
2. Limitations and Future Work: The paper could explicitly discuss potential limitations, such as the scalability of SAEN to extremely large graphs or its applicability to non-social network domains. Additionally, exploring the impact of different hierarchical decompositions on performance could be an interesting avenue for future work.
3. Reproducibility: While the paper provides details on the experimental setup, including parameters and datasets, releasing the code and preprocessed datasets would further enhance reproducibility.
Questions for Authors:
1. How sensitive is the performance of SAEN to the choice of hierarchical decomposition? Would alternative decompositions significantly impact the results?
2. The domain compression algorithm relies on symmetries in the data. How does its effectiveness vary across datasets with differing levels of symmetry?
3. Could the proposed approach be extended to dynamic or temporal graphs, where the structure evolves over time?
Overall, the paper presents a strong contribution to the field of graph representation learning, with both theoretical and practical advancements. Addressing the feedback and questions above could further strengthen the work.
