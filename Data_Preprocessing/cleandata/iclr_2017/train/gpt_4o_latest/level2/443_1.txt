Review of the Paper
Summary of Contributions
This paper proposes a novel approach to sequence-to-sequence transduction by framing it as a noisy channel decoding problem. The authors leverage recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to parameterize both the source model and the channel model, enabling the use of unpaired output data in addition to paired input-output data. A key innovation is the introduction of a latent alignment variable that facilitates tractable decoding through beam search. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach on three tasks: abstractive sentence summarization, machine translation, and morphological inflection generation. Experimental results show that the noisy channel model outperforms direct models and benefits significantly from unpaired data, with further improvements achieved by combining the two models.
Decision: Accept
The paper presents a well-motivated and novel contribution to sequence-to-sequence modeling, offering a significant improvement over existing direct models. The experimental results are robust, and the proposed method demonstrates practical utility across multiple tasks. However, there are areas where the paper could be improved in terms of clarity and additional analysis.
Supporting Arguments
1. Novelty and Motivation: The paper introduces a fresh perspective on sequence-to-sequence tasks by revisiting the noisy channel framework and adapting it to modern neural architectures. This is a meaningful contribution, as it addresses the limitations of direct models, such as explaining-away effects and the inability to leverage unpaired data effectively.
   
2. Experimental Validation: The authors provide extensive empirical evidence across three diverse tasks. The noisy channel model consistently outperforms direct models, particularly when unpaired data is available. The human evaluation for summarization further strengthens the claim of improved output quality.
3. Scientific Rigor: The paper employs statistically significant experiments and compares its results against strong baselines and state-of-the-art methods. The use of multiple metrics (e.g., ROUGE, BLEU, accuracy) ensures a comprehensive evaluation.
4. Practical Usefulness: The ability to incorporate unpaired data is highly relevant for real-world applications where labeled data is scarce. The proposed method is also computationally feasible, as evidenced by the tractable decoding algorithm.
Additional Feedback
1. Clarity of Presentation: While the technical details are thorough, the paper is dense and could benefit from clearer explanations, particularly in the model description and decoding sections. A simplified diagram illustrating the noisy channel framework and the role of the latent variable would help readers unfamiliar with the concept.
2. Ablation Studies: The paper could include more detailed ablation studies to isolate the contributions of individual components, such as the latent alignment variable and the interpolation of direct and noisy channel models.
3. Analysis of Limitations: While the paper acknowledges computational challenges, it does not provide a detailed discussion of the limitations of the approach, such as scalability to larger datasets or tasks with highly non-monotonic alignments.
4. Broader Impact: The paper could explore broader implications of the proposed method, such as its potential for low-resource languages or other domains like speech recognition.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the performance of the noisy channel model scale with increasing amounts of unpaired data? Are there diminishing returns beyond a certain threshold?
2. Could the proposed method be extended to tasks with highly non-monotonic alignments, such as dialogue generation or code translation? If so, what modifications would be required?
3. How sensitive is the model to the choice of hyperparameters, particularly the weights in the decoding objective (λ1, λ2, etc.)?
Conclusion
This paper makes a strong contribution to the field of sequence-to-sequence modeling by revisiting the noisy channel framework and adapting it to modern neural architectures. The proposed method is both novel and practically useful, with robust experimental validation across multiple tasks. While there are areas for improvement in presentation and analysis, the paper's contributions merit acceptance.
