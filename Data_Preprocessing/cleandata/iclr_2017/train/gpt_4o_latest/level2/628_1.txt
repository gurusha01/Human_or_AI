The paper introduces Submodular Sum-Product Networks (SSPNs), a novel extension of Sum-Product Networks (SPNs) designed to address the intractability of certain SPN models for complex tasks like scene understanding. The main contribution is the integration of submodular energy functions into SPNs, enabling efficient computation of the MAP state for a combinatorial number of labelings. The authors also propose INFERSSPN, an efficient, convergent algorithm based on graph cuts for approximate inference in SSPNs. Empirical results demonstrate that INFERSSPN achieves comparable accuracy to α-expansion while reducing parsing time exponentially, making SSPNs a promising tool for tasks requiring expressive and hierarchical probabilistic models.
Decision: Accept
The primary reasons for this decision are the novelty of the SSPN model and the practical efficiency of the proposed inference algorithm. The paper addresses a significant limitation of SPNs in handling complex tasks like scene understanding, providing a theoretically sound and empirically validated solution. The combination of submodular energy functions with SPNs is innovative, and the results show clear advantages over existing methods like α-expansion and belief propagation.
Supporting Arguments
1. Novelty and Contribution: The introduction of SSPNs represents a meaningful advancement in probabilistic modeling, combining the expressivity of SPNs with the tractable inference properties of submodular functions. This is a significant improvement over existing grammar-based and neural parsing methods, which often restrict region shapes or rely on heuristic inference.
   
2. Empirical Validation: The experiments convincingly demonstrate the efficiency of INFERSSPN, particularly in scenarios with increasing grammar height, boundary strength, or productions per nonterminal. The results highlight exponential improvements in inference time compared to α-expansion and belief propagation, while maintaining comparable accuracy.
3. Theoretical Rigor: The paper provides a thorough theoretical foundation for SSPNs, including proofs of submodularity, convergence guarantees for INFERSSPN, and complexity analysis. This rigor enhances confidence in the proposed approach.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Clarity of Exposition: Some sections, particularly those describing the grammar and parse tree construction, are dense and difficult to follow. For example, the explanation of how SSPNs handle arbitrary region shapes could be simplified or supported with more intuitive illustrations.
   
2. Comparison to Neural Methods: While the paper briefly mentions neural parsing methods, it would benefit from a more detailed comparison, especially given the popularity of deep learning in scene understanding. Including results from state-of-the-art neural models would strengthen the empirical evaluation.
3. Reproducibility: While the algorithm is well-described, the paper could provide more details about the experimental setup, such as hyperparameters and dataset splits, to facilitate reproducibility.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the performance of SSPNs compare to state-of-the-art deep learning models for scene understanding, such as modern semantic segmentation architectures?
2. Could the authors clarify how SSPNs handle overlapping regions during inference? This aspect was not entirely clear from the description of the algorithm.
3. Are there any limitations in extending SSPNs to domains beyond image parsing, such as activity recognition or social network modeling, as suggested in the conclusion?
Overall, the paper makes a strong case for the adoption of SSPNs in tasks requiring expressive probabilistic models with efficient inference. Addressing the clarity and comparison points would further enhance its impact.
