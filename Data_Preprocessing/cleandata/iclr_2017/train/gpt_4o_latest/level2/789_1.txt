Review of the Paper
Summary of Contributions
This paper introduces a novel Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling process for generative autoencoders, which allows sampling from the learned latent distribution \( P̂(Z) \) rather than the prior \( P(Z) \). The authors argue that this approach improves the quality of generated samples by iteratively decoding and encoding latent representations, thereby converging to \( P̂(Z) \). The paper also extends the MCMC process to denoising generative autoencoders, revealing the benefits of the denoising criterion in improving sample quality. Experimental results on CelebA and SVHN datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in generating more realistic samples and reducing artifacts in interpolations. The work is positioned as an orthogonal improvement that can be easily integrated into existing generative autoencoder architectures.
Decision: Accept
The paper presents a well-motivated and novel contribution to the field of generative modeling. The introduction of MCMC sampling for generative autoencoders addresses a critical gap in existing methods by focusing on the learned latent distribution rather than the prior. The experimental results are compelling, and the proposed method is straightforward to implement, making it practically useful for the community. However, some areas require clarification and additional discussion, as detailed below.
Supporting Arguments
1. Novelty and Contribution: The use of MCMC to sample from \( P̂(Z) \) is a novel and significant contribution. The paper convincingly demonstrates that this approach leads to improved sample quality, particularly in high-dimensional latent spaces. The extension to denoising generative autoencoders further strengthens the contribution.
   
2. Experimental Validation: The experiments are well-designed and provide strong evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed method. The comparison of samples before and after MCMC iterations is clear and supports the claims. The use of CelebA and SVHN datasets ensures relevance to real-world applications.
3. Practical Usefulness: The proposed method is simple to implement and can be applied to existing generative autoencoders without significant modifications. This makes it highly accessible to practitioners.
4. Positioning in Literature: The paper demonstrates a solid understanding of related work and positions its contributions well against existing methods like VAEs, AAEs, and denoising autoencoders. The discussion of limitations in prior approaches, such as the mismatch between \( P(Z) \) and \( P̂(Z) \), is insightful.
Areas for Improvement
1. Theoretical Justification: While the paper provides a proof of convergence for the MCMC process, the practical implications of the number of iterations required for convergence are not discussed. It would be helpful to include guidelines or heuristics for selecting the number of MCMC steps in practice.
2. Computational Overhead: The paper does not discuss the computational cost of the iterative MCMC process. A comparison of runtime and resource requirements with baseline methods would provide a more complete evaluation.
3. Broader Applicability: While the experiments focus on image datasets, it would be valuable to discuss the applicability of the method to other types of data, such as text or audio, to broaden its impact.
4. Clarity of Presentation: Some sections, particularly the mathematical formulations, could benefit from clearer explanations and more intuitive descriptions. For example, the transition operator \( T(Z{t+1}|Zt) \) could be explained in simpler terms for readers less familiar with MCMC.
Questions for the Authors
1. How sensitive is the proposed method to the choice of the prior \( P(Z) \)? Would alternative priors (e.g., non-Gaussian) affect the performance of MCMC sampling?
2. What is the impact of the dimensionality of the latent space on the convergence rate of the MCMC process?
3. Could the proposed method be extended to other generative models, such as GANs, that do not explicitly define an encoder-decoder structure?
Additional Feedback
- The inclusion of supplementary material with more detailed experimental results is appreciated, but it would be helpful to integrate key findings into the main text for better accessibility.
- The authors should consider discussing potential limitations of the method, such as cases where \( P̂(Z) \) is poorly learned or highly multimodal, which could affect MCMC convergence.
In conclusion, this paper makes a meaningful contribution to the field of generative modeling by addressing a key limitation in generative autoencoders. With minor clarifications and additional discussion, it has the potential to significantly impact both research and practical applications.
