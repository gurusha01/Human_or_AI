The paper presents a novel application of Bayesian non-parametric (BNP) models, specifically the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Hidden Markov Model (HDP-HMM), for the unsupervised segmentation of bioacoustic signals. It addresses the challenge of automatically inferring the number of hidden states (song units) in non-human animal vocalizations, a critical problem in bioacoustics. The authors evaluate their approach on two real-world datasets: humpback whale songs and multi-species bird vocalizations. The results demonstrate the model's ability to segment bioacoustic signals into meaningful units, providing insights into species-specific vocal patterns and laying the groundwork for ecological and behavioral studies.
Decision: Accept with Minor Revisions
Key Reasons for Decision:
1. Novelty and Relevance: The use of HDP-HMM for bioacoustic signal segmentation is innovative and addresses a significant gap in the field. The paper demonstrates how BNP models can overcome the limitations of traditional HMMs, such as the need to predefine the number of states.
2. Experimental Validation: The approach is validated on two challenging datasets, with results showing promise for both single-species (whale) and multi-species (bird) scenarios. The segmentation aligns well with expert annotations in many cases, highlighting the model's practical utility.
Supporting Arguments:
- Claims and Support: The paper claims that HDP-HMM can infer the number of song units and segment bioacoustic signals in an unsupervised manner. These claims are supported by detailed experiments, including qualitative visualizations (spectrograms) and quantitative evaluations (e.g., NMI scores for bird data).
- Field Knowledge: The authors demonstrate a strong understanding of bioacoustics and statistical modeling, referencing relevant literature (e.g., Kershenbaum et al., 2014; Fox et al., 2008) and situating their work within the broader context of ecological monitoring.
- Practical Utility: The method has clear applications in biodiversity conservation and ecological studies, as it enables large-scale analysis of bioacoustic data without requiring extensive manual annotation.
Additional Feedback:
1. Computational Efficiency: While the paper acknowledges the computational expense of MCMC sampling, it would benefit from a more detailed discussion of potential solutions, such as variational inference or parallelization strategies.
2. Evaluation Metrics: The NMI score for bird segmentation is relatively low (mean: 0.367). The authors should clarify whether this is due to model limitations, feature representation (MFCC), or noise in the data. Exploring alternative features or pre-processing techniques could improve performance.
3. Limitations and Future Work: The paper could better articulate its limitations, such as the difficulty in handling overlapping species or highly variable vocalizations. Additionally, the proposed future work on classification tasks and faster inference methods is promising but could be expanded upon.
4. Accessibility: The technical details of HDP-HMM and its inference process are well-explained but may be dense for readers unfamiliar with Bayesian non-parametrics. A simplified overview or diagram could enhance accessibility.
Questions for the Authors:
1. How does the model handle overlapping vocalizations from multiple species in the bird dataset? Are there specific cases where it fails, and why?
2. Have you considered alternative feature representations beyond MFCC, such as wavelet transforms or deep learning-based embeddings, to improve segmentation accuracy?
3. Can you provide more details on the computational resources required for training the HDP-HMM on these datasets? How scalable is the approach to larger datasets?
In conclusion, this paper makes a valuable contribution to bioacoustics by introducing a robust, unsupervised method for signal segmentation. With minor revisions to address computational and evaluation concerns, it has the potential to significantly impact ecological monitoring and biodiversity conservation.
