The paper introduces NewsQA, a large-scale machine comprehension dataset comprising over 100,000 question-answer pairs derived from 12,744 CNN news articles. The authors claim that NewsQA is more challenging than existing datasets due to its emphasis on reasoning, synthesis, and inference, rather than simple word matching. They highlight a novel four-stage crowdsourcing methodology that encourages exploratory and curiosity-driven questions, resulting in diverse answer types and reasoning requirements. The dataset is benchmarked against human performance and two neural models, revealing a significant performance gap (0.198 in F1), which underscores its potential to drive advancements in machine comprehension.
Decision: Accept
Key Reasons:
1. Novelty and Contribution: NewsQA addresses a critical gap in machine comprehension datasets by emphasizing reasoning and synthesis, which are underrepresented in existing datasets like SQuAD. Its design and collection methodology are innovative, and the dataset's scale and complexity make it a valuable resource for the research community.
2. Scientific Rigor: The claims are well-supported through thorough analysis, including reasoning type stratification, human performance benchmarking, and baseline model evaluations. The significant performance gap between humans and machines demonstrates the dataset's challenge and utility.
Supporting Arguments:
- Motivation and Placement in Literature: The paper is well-situated within the field, providing a comprehensive comparison with related datasets (e.g., SQuAD, CNN/Daily Mail). The authors convincingly argue for the need for a dataset like NewsQA, which bridges the gap between small-scale reasoning-focused datasets and large-scale synthetically generated ones.
- Experimental Validation: The evaluation of human and model performance is robust, with clear metrics (F1 and exact match) and stratified analysis by answer and reasoning types. The authors also propose a sentence-level subtask to further demonstrate the dataset's difficulty.
- Practical Usefulness: NewsQA is freely available and designed to spur future research in machine comprehension. Its emphasis on reasoning aligns with real-world applications where simple word matching is insufficient.
Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Reproducibility: While the paper provides substantial details on the dataset and baseline models, additional clarity on hyperparameter settings and training configurations for the models would enhance reproducibility.
2. Error Analysis: A deeper analysis of model errors, particularly on synthesis and inference questions, could provide insights into specific challenges and guide future model development.
3. Broader Evaluation: Testing additional state-of-the-art models beyond mLSTM and BARB would strengthen the paper's claims about the dataset's difficulty.
Questions for Authors:
1. Can you provide more details on how the validation stage impacts the quality of the dataset? For instance, how do the validation metrics compare to the initial crowdsourced answers?
2. How does the dataset handle ambiguity in questions with multiple plausible answers? Are such cases explicitly flagged for researchers?
3. Have you considered extending the dataset to include multilingual articles or questions to evaluate cross-lingual comprehension?
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of machine comprehension, and its acceptance would benefit the research community. The dataset is likely to become a benchmark for evaluating reasoning capabilities in AI systems.
