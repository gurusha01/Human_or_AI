The paper introduces Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNNs), a novel architecture for sequence modeling that combines the parallelism of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with the sequential modeling capabilities of recurrent neural networks (RNNs). The authors claim that QRNNs achieve better predictive accuracy than LSTMs of equivalent hidden size while being significantly faster (up to 16x in some cases). The paper supports these claims with experiments on three tasks: sentiment classification, language modeling, and character-level neural machine translation, demonstrating both accuracy improvements and computational efficiency.
Decision: Accept
The paper is well-motivated, presenting QRNNs as a solution to the limitations of RNNs in handling long sequences and the inefficiency of CNNs in capturing sequence order. The key reasons for acceptance are (1) the strong empirical results showing QRNNs outperforming LSTMs on multiple benchmarks, and (2) the significant computational speedup, which is a critical contribution for scaling sequence models to real-world applications.
Supporting Arguments:
1. Novelty and Contribution: The QRNN architecture is a meaningful innovation that combines the strengths of CNNs and RNNs. The use of convolutional layers for parallelism and a minimalist recurrent pooling function for sequence modeling is a compelling design. The paper also extends QRNNs with techniques like dense connections and attention mechanisms, showcasing its versatility.
   
2. Empirical Validation: The experiments are thorough, covering diverse tasks (classification, language modeling, and translation) and demonstrating consistent improvements over LSTMs in both accuracy and speed. The results are benchmarked against strong baselines, including optimized cuDNN LSTMs, adding credibility to the claims.
3. Practical Usefulness: The significant speedup in training and inference makes QRNNs highly practical, especially for tasks involving long sequences. The architecture's compatibility with existing extensions for RNNs and CNNs further enhances its applicability.
Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Analysis of Limitations: While the paper mentions that QRNNs require larger models for certain tasks (e.g., addition and copy tasks), a more detailed discussion of these limitations would improve transparency. For example, why QRNNs underperform on certain arithmetic tasks compared to LSTMs should be explored.
2. Ablation Studies: While the paper introduces several architectural extensions (e.g., dense connections, zoneout), it would be helpful to include ablation studies to quantify the individual contributions of these components.
3. Clarity in Presentation: Some sections, particularly the mathematical descriptions of the pooling functions, could benefit from clearer explanations or visual aids to improve accessibility for readers less familiar with the technical details.
Questions for Authors:
1. How does the QRNN perform on tasks requiring very fine-grained temporal dependencies, such as speech recognition or time-series forecasting? Are there specific scenarios where QRNNs might struggle compared to LSTMs or GRUs?
2. Could you elaborate on the trade-offs between model size and performance for QRNNs, particularly in tasks like the addition task? Are there strategies to mitigate the need for larger models?
3. How does the QRNN compare to more recent architectures like Transformers, particularly in terms of scalability and performance on long sequences?
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to sequence modeling, and its strong empirical results and practical implications justify acceptance. With minor improvements in clarity and additional analysis, the work could be even more impactful.
