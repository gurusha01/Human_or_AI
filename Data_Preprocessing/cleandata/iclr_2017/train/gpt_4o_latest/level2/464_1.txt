Review
The paper presents a novel approach to learning tree-structured neural networks for sentence representation using reinforcement learning. Unlike prior work that relies on predefined syntactic trees or explicit supervision from treebank annotations, this method optimizes tree structures to improve performance on downstream tasks. The authors demonstrate that task-specific composition orders learned through reinforcement learning outperform both sequential encoders and supervised tree-structured models. Additionally, the induced trees exhibit some linguistically intuitive structures while differing from conventional syntactic analyses.
Decision: Accept
Key reasons for this decision include: (1) the paper introduces a novel and well-motivated approach to learning hierarchical sentence structures, which bridges the gap between sequential and syntactic models; and (2) the experimental results convincingly demonstrate the utility of the proposed method across multiple tasks, including sentiment analysis, semantic relatedness, natural language inference, and sentence generation.
Supporting Arguments:
1. Novelty and Contribution: The paper makes a significant contribution by proposing a reinforcement learning framework to discover task-specific tree structures. This approach is innovative and addresses limitations of prior methods that either assume fixed syntactic trees or rely on explicit supervision. The use of policy gradient methods to optimize tree structures for downstream tasks is a compelling idea that advances the field.
2. Experimental Rigor: The authors evaluate their method on four diverse tasks and compare it against strong baselines, including sequential models, supervised syntactic models, and balanced binary trees. The results consistently show that the proposed latent syntax and semi-supervised syntax models outperform baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of task-specific tree structures.
3. Analysis and Insights: The paper provides a thorough analysis of the learned tree structures, showing that they capture linguistically meaningful patterns (e.g., noun phrases, verb phrases) while diverging from traditional syntactic trees. This analysis adds depth to the work and demonstrates the interpretability of the learned structures.
Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Training Efficiency: A major limitation of the proposed method is its high computational cost, with training times significantly longer than models with predefined structures. The authors should explore strategies to improve efficiency, such as batch processing or approximations to reduce the overhead of reconstructing computation graphs.
2. Broader Comparisons: While the paper compares its method to several baselines, it would benefit from additional comparisons to state-of-the-art models with larger parameter sizes, especially for tasks like natural language inference where the proposed method underperforms.
3. Clarity in Presentation: The paper could improve clarity by providing more intuitive explanations of the reinforcement learning framework, particularly for readers unfamiliar with policy gradient methods. Simplified diagrams illustrating the tree construction process would also enhance accessibility.
Questions for the Authors:
1. How sensitive is the performance of the proposed method to the choice of reward function? Have alternative reward formulations been explored?
2. Could the learned tree structures be leveraged for tasks beyond sentence representation, such as grammar induction or syntactic parsing?
3. Given the computational cost, how does the method scale to larger datasets or higher-dimensional embeddings?
Overall, the paper presents a promising direction for learning task-specific hierarchical structures and offers valuable insights into the interplay between syntax and semantics in neural models. While computational efficiency remains a concern, the contributions and experimental results justify acceptance.
