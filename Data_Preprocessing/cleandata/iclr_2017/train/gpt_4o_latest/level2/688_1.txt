Review of the Paper
The paper addresses the challenge of learning effective policies in reinforcement learning (RL) when the number of policy updates is constrained, a scenario relevant in real-world applications such as online advertising and robotics. The authors propose Iterative PoWER, a novel extension of the PoWER algorithm, which uses concave lower bounds to approximate the expected policy reward. This approach reduces the number of policy updates required while maintaining high performance. Additionally, the paper extends existing methods to handle negative rewards, enabling the use of control variates to reduce variance. The proposed method is validated on both the Cartpole benchmark and a large-scale real-world dataset in online advertising.
Decision: Accept
The paper makes a significant contribution to reinforcement learning by addressing a practical and underexplored problem: optimizing policies with limited updates. The proposed Iterative PoWER algorithm is well-motivated, theoretically grounded, and demonstrates strong empirical performance. The extension to handle negative rewards further enhances the method's applicability. The combination of theoretical rigor and practical relevance makes this paper a valuable addition to the conference.
Supporting Arguments
1. Novelty and Contribution: The paper introduces a meaningful extension to the PoWER algorithm, iteratively refining the policy using concave lower bounds. This approach is novel and addresses a critical gap in RL literature, where most methods assume frequent policy updates. The ability to handle negative rewards and incorporate control variates is another noteworthy contribution.
2. Theoretical and Empirical Support: The theoretical derivation of the concave lower bounds and their properties is rigorous and well-presented. The experiments on the Cartpole benchmark and real-world online advertising data convincingly demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness, with significant improvements over the baseline PoWER method.
3. Practical Relevance: The focus on reducing policy updates is highly relevant for production environments, such as online advertising, where frequent updates are infeasible. The real-world dataset experiments highlight the method's scalability and practical utility.
Additional Feedback
1. Clarity and Accessibility: While the theoretical sections are thorough, they may be challenging for readers unfamiliar with the mathematical intricacies of RL. Including a more intuitive explanation of the concave lower bounds and their practical implications would improve accessibility.
2. Limitations and Future Work: The paper acknowledges the potential issue of high variance in regions of the parameter space after multiple iterations. While this is a valid concern, the proposed solutions (e.g., regularizers) are not fully explored. Providing preliminary results or insights into the effectiveness of these regularizers would strengthen the paper.
3. Broader Applicability: The paper focuses on specific applications (e.g., online advertising and Cartpole). It would be beneficial to discuss the potential applicability of Iterative PoWER to other domains, such as robotics or healthcare, where policy updates are costly.
Questions for the Authors
1. How sensitive is the performance of Iterative PoWER to the choice of the initial policy parameters (θ₀)? Would poor initialization significantly impact convergence or performance?
2. In the real-world advertising experiments, how does the method handle the potential non-stationarity of user behavior over time? Could this affect the robustness of the learned policy?
3. The paper mentions the need for additional regularizers to address high variance in later iterations. Have you explored specific regularization techniques, and if so, what were the preliminary findings?
4. Could the proposed method be extended to multi-agent RL settings, where multiple policies interact and influence each other? If so, what challenges might arise?
Overall, this paper makes a strong theoretical and practical contribution to reinforcement learning and is well-suited for acceptance at the conference. With minor improvements in clarity and further exploration of limitations, it could have an even greater impact.
