Review of the Paper
Summary of Contributions
This paper addresses the problem of answering cloze-style questions over documents by introducing the Gated-Attention (GA) Reader, a novel multi-hop architecture with a fine-grained attention mechanism. The GA Reader employs multiplicative interactions between query embeddings and intermediate states of a recurrent neural network to create query-specific token representations, enabling accurate answer selection. The model achieves state-of-the-art results on three benchmark datasets: CNN & Daily Mail, and Who Did What (WDW). The authors provide an ablation study to demonstrate the effectiveness of the gated-attention mechanism, as well as comparisons with alternative compositional operators. The paper also includes visualizations of intermediate attention layers, offering insights into the model's reasoning process.
Decision: Accept
The paper is well-motivated, presents a novel and effective approach, and demonstrates significant improvements over existing baselines. The results are robust, and the ablation studies provide strong evidence for the contributions of the proposed architecture. However, there are areas where the paper could be improved, particularly in terms of theoretical justification and clarity in certain sections.
Supporting Arguments
1. Novelty and Contribution: The proposed gated-attention mechanism is a significant innovation, combining multi-hop reasoning with fine-grained attention. The empirical results demonstrate that this approach outperforms existing models, including strong baselines like the AS Reader and NSE, by a substantial margin.
2. Experimental Rigor: The paper evaluates the GA Reader on multiple datasets, including CNN, Daily Mail, CBT, and WDW, showcasing its generalizability. The ablation study convincingly demonstrates the importance of gated attention, multi-hop reasoning, and pre-trained embeddings.
3. Practical Usefulness: The GA Reader's ability to achieve state-of-the-art performance on large-scale datasets makes it a valuable contribution to the field of machine reading comprehension.
4. Clarity and Reproducibility: The authors provide sufficient implementation details, including hyperparameters and training procedures, and release their code on GitHub, ensuring reproducibility.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Theoretical Justification: While the empirical results strongly support the use of multiplicative gating, the paper lacks a theoretical explanation for why this mechanism is superior to alternatives like addition or concatenation. Including such an analysis would strengthen the contribution.
2. Dataset Limitations: The paper focuses on datasets with specific characteristics (e.g., anonymized entities in CNN/Daily Mail). It would be helpful to discuss how the GA Reader might perform on datasets with different properties, such as non-anonymized corpora or multilingual datasets.
3. Visualization and Interpretability: The attention visualizations are insightful, but the paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of how these insights might generalize to other tasks or datasets.
4. Scalability: The paper does not discuss the computational efficiency of the GA Reader compared to simpler models. Including a runtime analysis would provide a more complete picture of its practicality.
Questions for the Authors
1. Can you provide a theoretical explanation for why multiplicative gating outperforms addition or concatenation in your experiments?
2. How does the GA Reader perform on datasets with non-anonymized entities or in multilingual settings? Have you considered testing it on such datasets?
3. Could the gated-attention mechanism be extended to other tasks, such as machine translation or summarization? If so, what modifications would be required?
Conclusion
The Gated-Attention Reader is a novel and impactful contribution to the field of machine reading comprehension. Its strong empirical performance, combined with the authors' thorough evaluation and analysis, makes it a valuable addition to the literature. While there are areas for improvement, particularly in terms of theoretical justification and scalability, the paper meets the standards for acceptance at this conference.
