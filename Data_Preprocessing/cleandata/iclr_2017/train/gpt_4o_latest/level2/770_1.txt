The paper proposes a Neural Knowledge Language Model (NKLM) that integrates symbolic knowledge from knowledge graphs with RNN-based language models to address the limitations of traditional models in encoding and decoding factual knowledge, particularly for rare or unknown words. The authors introduce a novel mechanism to predict whether a word is fact-based and either generate it from a vocabulary or copy it from a fact description. They also present a new dataset, WikiFacts, and a metric, Unknown-Penalized Perplexity (UPP), to evaluate the model's performance. Experiments demonstrate that NKLM significantly reduces perplexity, generates fewer unknown words, and adapts to new knowledge without retraining.
Decision: Accept
The paper makes a strong case for acceptance due to its innovative approach to integrating symbolic knowledge into language modeling, its introduction of a new dataset and evaluation metric, and its demonstrated empirical improvements over traditional RNN language models. The work is well-motivated, novel, and addresses a critical limitation in language modeling.
Supporting Arguments
1. Novelty and Contribution: The NKLM introduces a knowledge-copy mechanism that effectively addresses the rare/unknown word problem, a significant limitation in traditional RNNLMs. The integration of knowledge graphs into language modeling is a meaningful advancement, and the ability to adapt to knowledge changes without retraining is particularly noteworthy.
2. Empirical Validation: The experiments are thorough and demonstrate clear improvements in perplexity and the reduction of unknown words. The introduction of UPP as a metric is a valuable contribution, addressing the limitations of standard perplexity in evaluating knowledge-related language models.
3. Dataset Contribution: The WikiFacts dataset is a significant addition to the field, providing a resource for future research in knowledge-based language modeling.
4. Clarity and Rigor: The paper is well-written, with clear explanations of the model architecture, training process, and evaluation metrics. The experimental setup is robust, and the results are well-analyzed.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Reasoning Capabilities: While the paper highlights the importance of reasoning in language models, it does not explore this aspect in-depth. Future work could investigate how the NKLM can handle reasoning tasks, such as inferring implicit knowledge from facts.
2. Generalizability: The experiments are limited to the WikiFacts-FilmActor domain. It would be helpful to evaluate the model on other domains to demonstrate its generalizability.
3. Ablation Studies: While the paper shows the importance of the copy mechanism, more detailed ablation studies could provide insights into the contributions of other components, such as the topic context embedding.
4. Scalability: The paper does not discuss the computational overhead of integrating knowledge graphs into language models. A discussion on scalability and potential optimizations would strengthen the paper.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the NKLM handle ambiguous or conflicting facts in the knowledge graph? Does it rely solely on the provided topic context to resolve such issues?
2. Could the model be extended to handle multi-topic descriptions where the topic is not explicitly provided?
3. How does the NKLM perform on tasks requiring reasoning, such as question answering or dialogue generation? Could the explicit representation of facts be leveraged for these tasks?
In conclusion, the paper presents a well-motivated and innovative approach to addressing a critical limitation in language modeling. While there are areas for further exploration, the contributions are significant, and the paper is a strong candidate for acceptance.
