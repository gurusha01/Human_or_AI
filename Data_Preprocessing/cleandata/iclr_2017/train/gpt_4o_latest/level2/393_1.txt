Review of the Paper: "Structured Attention Networks"
This paper introduces Structured Attention Networks, a novel extension of standard attention mechanisms in deep learning. The authors propose incorporating graphical models, such as linear-chain CRFs and graph-based dependency parsers, into attention layers to model richer structural dependencies. This approach generalizes the standard soft-selection attention mechanism, enabling tasks such as attending to subsequences or latent syntactic structures like parse trees. The paper demonstrates the efficacy of structured attention across multiple tasks, including tree transduction, neural machine translation, question answering, and natural language inference, showing improvements over baseline attention models. The authors also highlight the ability of these models to learn interpretable latent structures in an unsupervised manner.
Decision: Accept
The paper is well-motivated, presents a significant novel contribution, and demonstrates strong empirical results. The integration of structured graphical models into attention mechanisms is a meaningful advancement, and the experiments convincingly show the utility of the proposed method across diverse tasks.
Supporting Arguments:
1. Novelty and Contribution: The paper makes a compelling case for structured attention as a generalization of standard attention mechanisms. By embedding graphical models within attention layers, the authors enable the modeling of structural dependencies that are otherwise challenging to capture. This is a significant innovation, particularly for tasks requiring structural biases, such as parsing or segmentation.
   
2. Empirical Validation: The experiments span a range of tasks, from synthetic tree transduction to real-world applications like machine translation and question answering. In each case, structured attention outperforms standard attention mechanisms, demonstrating both the robustness and versatility of the approach. The visualization of learned latent structures further underscores the interpretability of the model.
3. Technical Rigor: The paper provides detailed descriptions of the structured attention mechanism, including the differentiable inference algorithms (e.g., forward-backward and inside-outside algorithms). The authors also address practical challenges, such as numerical stability and computational efficiency, which adds to the technical depth of the work.
Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Runtime Analysis: While the authors acknowledge that structured attention is approximately 5× slower than simple attention, a more detailed analysis of the computational trade-offs (e.g., memory usage, scalability to longer sequences) would be helpful for practitioners considering this method.
   
2. Ablation Studies: The paper could benefit from additional ablation studies to isolate the impact of different components of the structured attention mechanism (e.g., the effect of pairwise potentials in CRFs or the choice of graphical model structure).
3. Broader Applicability: While the experiments are diverse, it would be interesting to explore the applicability of structured attention in other domains, such as computer vision or reinforcement learning, to further demonstrate its generality.
Questions for the Authors:
1. How does the performance of structured attention scale with increasing sequence lengths or larger datasets? Are there any practical limitations in terms of computational resources?
2. Could the structured attention mechanism be extended to approximate inference methods for more complex graphical models (e.g., loopy CRFs)?
3. How sensitive are the results to hyperparameters, such as the regularization penalty on pairwise potentials or the choice of λ in normalization?
Conclusion:
This paper presents a significant advancement in attention mechanisms by integrating structured graphical models, enabling the modeling of richer dependencies. The empirical results are compelling, and the technical contributions are well-executed. While there are areas for further exploration, the paper's contributions merit acceptance and are likely to inspire future research in structured deep learning.
