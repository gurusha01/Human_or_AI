The paper introduces a novel method to stabilize Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) training by unrolling the optimization of the discriminator during generator updates. This approach interpolates between using the optimal discriminator (ideal but computationally infeasible) and the current discriminator (prone to instability). The authors claim that this method mitigates mode collapse, stabilizes training for complex architectures like recurrent generators, and improves diversity and coverage of the generated data distribution. The paper is supported by experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating improved stability and diversity in GAN training.
Decision: Accept
The paper presents a significant and well-motivated contribution to GAN training by addressing a critical challenge: instability and mode collapse. The proposed unrolling method is novel and demonstrates clear improvements over standard GAN training across diverse datasets. The experimental results are compelling and align with the claims made by the authors.
Supporting Arguments:
1. Novelty and Contribution: The idea of unrolling the discriminator optimization to improve GAN training is innovative and bridges the gap between theoretical and practical GAN training. The method provides a principled way to approximate the true generator loss, which is often intractable.
2. Experimental Validation: The paper provides extensive experimental evidence across synthetic (e.g., Gaussian mixtures) and real-world datasets (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR-10). The results consistently show improved stability, reduced mode collapse, and better data distribution coverage.
3. Relevance and Practicality: GANs are widely used in generative modeling, and the proposed method addresses a fundamental limitation in their training. The method is practical, with the trade-off between computational cost and performance being clearly articulated.
Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Computational Cost: While the authors acknowledge the increased computational cost of unrolling, further discussion on optimizing this trade-off (e.g., adaptive unrolling steps) would strengthen the paper. Additionally, comparisons with other stabilization techniques, such as Wasserstein GANs or spectral normalization, would provide more context.
2. Evaluation Metrics: The paper primarily uses qualitative metrics (e.g., visual inspection, Inception score) and some quantitative metrics (e.g., KL divergence, JS divergence). Including more robust and standardized metrics, such as Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID), would enhance the evaluation.
3. Ablation Studies: While the paper explores the effect of unrolling steps, additional ablation studies on hyperparameters (e.g., learning rates, batch sizes) and their interaction with unrolling would provide deeper insights into the method's robustness.
4. Broader Applicability: The method is demonstrated on image datasets. Exploring its applicability to other domains (e.g., text, audio) would highlight its generalizability.
Questions for the Authors:
1. How does the proposed method compare with other GAN stabilization techniques, such as Wasserstein GANs or gradient penalty methods, in terms of performance and computational cost?
2. Can the unrolling steps be dynamically adjusted during training to balance computational cost and stability?
3. Have you explored the impact of unrolling on other GAN variants (e.g., conditional GANs, StyleGAN)?
In conclusion, the paper presents a meaningful contribution to GAN research, with strong theoretical motivation and experimental validation. Addressing the suggestions above would further enhance its impact and applicability.
