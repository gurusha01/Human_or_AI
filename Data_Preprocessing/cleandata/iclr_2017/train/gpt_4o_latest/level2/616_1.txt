The paper presents a novel weakly supervised framework for solving inverse problems in Computer Vision by generating "imaginations" of hidden representations (e.g., albedo, shading, in-painted images) that reconstruct the original image when rendered. The key contribution lies in the use of data-driven adversarial priors to regularize the imagination spaces, leveraging unpaired data and memory retrieval mechanisms to guide the learning process. The proposed method is validated on three tasks: image in-painting, intrinsic image decomposition, and figure-ground layer extraction, demonstrating competitive results without requiring paired supervision. The paper also introduces fully-convolutional discriminators for matching local image statistics, which improve training stability and convergence.
Decision: Accept
Key Reasons for Decision:
1. Novelty and Contribution: The paper proposes a unique approach to inverse problems by combining adversarial priors, memory retrieval, and weak supervision. This is a significant departure from traditional methods that rely on paired data or hand-designed priors.
2. Empirical Validation: The method is rigorously evaluated on diverse tasks, showing promising results comparable to fully supervised baselines. The ablation studies and design choices (e.g., fully-convolutional discriminators) are well-justified and empirically validated.
Supporting Arguments:
1. Motivation and Placement in Literature: The paper is well-situated in the context of prior work on inverse problems, adversarial learning, and memory-based retrieval. It addresses key limitations of existing methods, such as reliance on paired data and hand-crafted priors, and builds on recent advances in generative adversarial networks.
2. Scientific Rigor: The claims are supported by clear experiments, including comparisons with baselines and ablations that isolate the contributions of individual components (e.g., memory retrieval, adversarial priors). The results are convincing, particularly in tasks like image in-painting and intrinsic decomposition.
3. Practical Usefulness: The framework has broad applicability across multiple vision tasks and demonstrates the ability to generalize to unseen data, which is critical for real-world deployment.
Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Clarity in Presentation: While the technical details are comprehensive, the paper could benefit from a more structured and concise exposition, particularly in the experimental section. For instance, summarizing key quantitative results in a table would improve readability.
2. Limitations and Future Work: The paper briefly mentions limitations (e.g., reliance on memory databases) but could provide a more detailed discussion. For example, how does the method scale with larger or more diverse datasets? Additionally, the proposed extension to video-based tasks is intriguing but remains speculative; preliminary results or a clearer roadmap would strengthen the paper.
3. Memory Retrieval Mechanism: The retrieval process is described but lacks a detailed analysis of its impact on performance. How sensitive is the model to the quality and diversity of the memory database? Including such an analysis would provide deeper insights.
Questions for Authors:
1. How does the model handle cases where the memory database lacks relevant examples for a given input? Does this lead to degraded performance, and if so, how can it be mitigated?
2. Can the proposed framework be extended to handle tasks beyond the three demonstrated, such as depth estimation or optical flow? If so, what modifications would be required?
3. How does the method compare quantitatively with state-of-the-art supervised methods on standard benchmarks for intrinsic decomposition and in-painting?
In conclusion, the paper makes a strong contribution to the field of weakly supervised learning for inverse problems in Computer Vision. While there are areas for improvement, the novelty, rigor, and potential impact of the proposed approach warrant acceptance.
