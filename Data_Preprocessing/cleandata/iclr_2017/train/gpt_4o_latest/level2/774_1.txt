The paper introduces several novel techniques for sampling and visualizing the latent spaces of generative models, with a focus on improving the visual quality and interpretability of these spaces. Key contributions include the use of spherical linear interpolation (slerp) to address issues with linear interpolation, the introduction of J-Diagrams and MINE grids for visualizing analogies and manifolds, and two methods for deriving attribute vectors: bias-corrected vectors using data replication and synthetic vectors via data augmentation. The authors also propose a quantitative evaluation method for attribute vectors using binary classification. The techniques are demonstrated on both Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), showcasing their general applicability across model types.
Decision: Accept
The primary reasons for this decision are the paper's strong contributions to the field and its clear, well-supported claims. The proposed techniques address practical challenges in working with latent spaces, such as sampling outside the manifold and correlated attribute labels, and offer innovative solutions that are both theoretically sound and empirically validated. The inclusion of visualizations and quantitative evaluations enhances the paper's clarity and rigor. Furthermore, the work is well-placed in the literature, building on established methods while offering meaningful advancements.
Supporting Arguments:
1. Novelty and Practicality: The introduction of slerp for interpolation and J-Diagrams for analogy visualization are significant contributions that improve latent space operations. These techniques are broadly applicable and address common issues in generative modeling, such as sampling artifacts and interpretability.
2. Empirical Validation: The paper provides compelling experimental results, including visual comparisons and quantitative evaluations, to support its claims. The use of both VAEs and GANs demonstrates the generalizability of the proposed methods.
3. Field Knowledge and Relevance: The paper reflects a strong understanding of the field, referencing key works and addressing known challenges, such as the "tent-pole" effect in linear interpolation and label correlation biases in attribute vectors.
Additional Feedback:
1. Reproducibility: While the authors mention a Python library supporting their techniques, it would be helpful to provide more details about its availability and documentation to ensure reproducibility.
2. Limitations: The paper could benefit from a more explicit discussion of its limitations. For instance, the potential computational overhead of MINE grids or the reliance on labeled datasets for attribute vector construction could be acknowledged.
3. Future Work: The proposed future directions, such as constructing a prior for linear interpolation and developing metrics for latent space structure, are promising. However, more concrete details on how these might be implemented would strengthen the paper.
Questions for the Authors:
1. How does the computational cost of slerp compare to linear interpolation in high-dimensional latent spaces, and is this overhead significant in practice?
2. Can the proposed techniques, particularly J-Diagrams and MINE grids, be extended to domains beyond images, such as text or molecular data? If so, what challenges might arise?
3. Have you considered the impact of different training datasets or architectures on the efficacy of the proposed methods, particularly for attribute vector construction?
Overall, this paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of generative modeling and latent space analysis. The techniques are innovative, well-supported, and likely to be of interest to both researchers and practitioners.
