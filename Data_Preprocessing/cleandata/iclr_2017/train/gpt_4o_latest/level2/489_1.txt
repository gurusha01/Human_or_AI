The paper investigates the properties encoded in sentence embeddings and proposes a novel framework to analyze them through auxiliary prediction tasks. The authors focus on three fundamental aspects of sentence structure—length, word content, and word order—and evaluate the ability of different sentence representation methods, including CBOW, LSTM auto-encoders, and skip-thought vectors, to encode these properties. The work provides actionable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of these methods, such as the surprising effectiveness of CBOW in encoding length and word order and the dimensionality-dependent performance of LSTM auto-encoders. The study also highlights the limitations of BLEU scores in evaluating encoder quality and suggests that the proposed methodology can complement existing evaluation approaches.
Decision: Accept
Key reasons for acceptance:
1. Novelty and Contribution: The paper introduces a fine-grained methodology for analyzing sentence embeddings, which addresses a critical gap in understanding the information captured by these representations. This is a significant improvement over coarse-grained evaluations on downstream tasks.
2. Scientific Rigor: The claims are well-supported by extensive experiments on a large dataset, with clear and statistically significant results. The analysis is thorough, and the findings are insightful for both researchers and practitioners.
Supporting Arguments:
- The proposed methodology is generalizable and can be applied to any sentence representation model, making it a valuable tool for the NLP community.
- The experiments are well-designed, isolating specific properties of sentence embeddings and controlling for confounding factors like natural language word order.
- The paper provides actionable insights, such as the unexpected effectiveness of CBOW for certain tasks and the limitations of using BLEU scores for encoder evaluation.
- The authors acknowledge the limitations of their work, such as the focus on low-level properties and the reliance on empirical observations, and suggest directions for future research.
Additional Feedback:
1. While the paper is strong overall, it would benefit from a more detailed discussion of how the proposed methodology could be extended to higher-level semantic and syntactic properties, as mentioned in the conclusion.
2. The analysis of skip-thought vectors is insightful but limited by the lack of direct comparability due to differences in training corpus and embedding size. Future work could include retraining skip-thought models under the same conditions as other methods.
3. The paper could explore the practical implications of its findings more explicitly. For instance, how can practitioners leverage the insights about dimensionality and model selection in real-world applications?
Questions for the Authors:
1. Have you considered testing your methodology on other sentence embedding models, such as transformer-based encoders (e.g., BERT or Sentence-BERT)? How do you anticipate these models would perform on the proposed tasks?
2. Can the proposed framework be extended to evaluate embeddings in multilingual or cross-lingual settings? If so, what challenges do you foresee?
3. Did you explore the impact of different training datasets on the performance of the sentence representations? Would the findings generalize to embeddings trained on non-Wikipedia corpora?
Overall, the paper makes a meaningful contribution to the field and provides a solid foundation for future research on understanding and evaluating sentence embeddings.
